I gradual- ly discovered other FDFA priorities but also realised that although there were sectoral strategies cover- ing various areas, there was no overall vision. What are our actual foreign policy objectives? What glob- al trends and developments do we face and what are the opportunities and challenges for Switzer- land? The Federal Constitution provides us with our fundamental mandate and represents our raison d’être. The Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy is designed to interpret this fundamental mandate. But it is not well known, it is presented in broad strokes, and initially I did not know to what extent it was being put into practice. Various analysts I asked about this told me that Switzerland’s foreign policy was generally oppor- tunity-driven. To some extent that is inevitable. Switzerland is not a major power holding the reins of world politics. And its pragmatic approach has so far proven its worth. Our country is doing very well. It enjoys a high international reputation. Swiss values such as our readiness for dialogue, reliability and honesty, and our power-sharing tra- dition and respect for the rule of law have long been acknowledged and appreciated. But is this enough for the future? In an increas- ingly multipolar world, Switzerland needs to have a clear idea of what it wants. “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there” – said the cat to Alice in Wonderland. As a highly networked country and host state of numerous international organisations, it is very much in our interest to look to the future and to know what path we want to take. Switzerland’s foreign policy has essentially remained unchanged since the end of the Cold War. The geopolitical watershed the end of the Cold War represented was reflected in the Feder- al Council’s Foreign Policy Report of 1993, which placed Swiss foreign policy on a new conceptual footing. Since then, we have tightened a few bolts here and there, but by and large our foreign poli- cy has been marked by continuity. Continuity is a Swiss trademark and remains important. But the world is not what it was. Switzerland needs the foresight to set new foreign policy paths. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But we should gear our foreign policy to the challenges and opportu- nities of tomorrow and future-proof Switzerland’s strengths. Hence the idea of a vision. I decided to set up a working group to develop such a vision. It was to be composed of experts with a variety of backgrounds and have strong federal government and cantonal representation. In addition to senior FDFA officials and the pres- ident of the Conference of the Cantonal Govern- ments of Switzerland, it was also to include rep- resentatives of the scientific community, business and civil society. This breadth of expertise ensured that the positions taken by the working group would be well balanced. At the same time, it was also important to keep the number of participants small enough to enable genuine discussion. A 10-year time frame (2019–28) was chosen, hence AVIS28: Aussenpolitische Vision Schweiz 2028, i.e., Switzerland’s 2028 Foreign Policy Vision. The vision is where we want to be by 2028. The idea was to aim for a horizon neither too near nor too distant, but sufficiently within reach to allow us to derive concrete goals from it. © KEYSTONE / Walter Bieri ii The working group’s task was to draw up a report that would serve as a source of inspiration to help shape Swiss foreign policy in the years ahead. It was important to me that all FDFA employees be able to participate in the AVIS process and con- tribute their ideas. The working group organised numerous AVIS events and created a blog that gave the AVIS process a momentum that exceed- ed my expectations. With this report, the working group has completed its task. The report helps us to better understand the drivers of change. It puts forward a vision of a networked foreign policy that is capable of further development and can take proactive action and respond to events as they arise. It presents sound ideas and recommendations that provide me with a useful basis for the FDFA’s work going forward. The Federal Council has already set out its Euro- pean policy vision: Switzerland needs the best possible access to the EU’s single market while retaining as much independence as possible. The consolidated bilateral approach remains the best way of achieving this. In addition to our essential relationship with the EU, the report also addresses our relations with international organisations in a multipolar world. The report persuasively sets out our interests and makes it clear that a foreign poli- cy more geared towards change does not call into question our tried and tested Swiss values. I also found the proposition that in shaping its foreign policy Switzerland needs to adopt a whole-of-Switzerland approach persuasive. New technologies, including digitalisation, will change the world: as a neutral country, Switzerland is well placed to position itself as a centre of digital gov- ernance. Close cooperation with all stakeholders – science, business, multilateral organisations and NGOs – is essential in this area. Bridge builders are more in demand than ever, not least at the UN Security Council. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the working group for its informative and thought-provoking report. Special thanks are also due to everyone who contributed to the AVIS pro- cess. At the FDFA we will continue to work on and further develop this process, not least in order to generate new impetus for the Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy 2020–23. The report provides a sound basis for a construc- tive discussion on Switzerland’s future place in the world. I therefore hope that it will be read by a wide audience. “If life has no vision, with no ultimate goal towards which we strive, no single objective to fulfil, there is no point in making an effort.” Erich Fromm iii Cl ea rly de fin ed in te re st s an d p rio rit ie s Fo re ig n a nd do m es tic po lic y ar e c lo se ly in te rt wi ne d Gr ea te r f oc us on cit ize ns an d t he ec on om y Sw itz er la nd ac ts se lf- co nf id en tly w ith an d v is- à- vis th e E U Te ch no log y i s a n es ta bl ish ed pi lla r o f Sw iss fo re ig n p oli cy Sw iss so ft po we r f or a m or e p ea ce fu l a nd st ab le wo rld Today’s foreign policy 2028 Foreign Policy Vision for Switzerland iv The 2028 vision in brief: A more focused, networked, agile Swiss foreign policy Foreign policy is becoming increasingly important to Switzerland’s prosperity and security. Switzerland is a success story, but if its success is to continue until 2028 and beyond it will need to adapt to the changing international environment. Switzerland must have the courage to change. Switzerland needs to adopt a more focused, networked and agile foreign policy: • Switzerland’s foreign policy must emerge from a defined position more than has hitherto been the case. • As an independent country, Switzerland needs to build upon relationships, both domestical- ly and internationally, to enable it to promote its values and defend its interests. In shaping its foreign policy, Switzerland needs to adopt a ‘whole of Switzerland’ approach and step up cooperation with like-minded countries to achieve its stated objectives. • Finally, Switzerland’s foreign policy instruments must be geared to anticipating challenges and opportunities, enabling it to respond rapidly and with flexibility. Switzerland needs skills and resources in order to be heard in the volatile world of tomorrow and have a stake in shaping global events. AVIS28 sets out Switzerland’s vision in six key areas with a view to defining future foreign policy: 1. By 2028, Switzerland‘s foreign policy will deliver on strategic priorities based on cle- arly defined interests and its values. Foreign policy will articulate thematic and regional prio- rities. Switzerland will be consistent in its dea- lings with the outside world, including major powers. 2. Foreign policy will be closely linked with domestic policy. Swiss foreign policy will be firmly anchored within domestic policy, thereby ensuring it meets the expectations of the gene- ral public. The Federal Council will determine the direction of foreign policy in close consulta- tion with Parliament and the cantons, based on a shared understanding of the responsibilities involved. 3. Greater focus on services for citizens and cooperating with Swiss businesses are recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy. Foreign policy and trade policy will operate as a homogeneous whole. Market access for Swiss companies is a key priority. The private sector is an effective partner in addressing the sustaina- ble development goals. 4. Switzerland will leverage its core strengths to build a more peaceful and stable world. Swiss development cooperation will focus on creating jobs locally, finding innovative solu- tions to reduce poverty and addressing migra- tion challenges strategically. Harnessing new technology will ensure highly effective delive- ry of humanitarian aid. Peacebuilding will be backed by a clear strategy, broad-based poli- tical support, and attractive packages of good offices. Switzerland will be able to respond rapidly to requests for its good offices. It will adopt effective initiatives to bolster the rules- based international order and work, both off- line and online, to foster respect for internatio- nal law and human rights. 5. By 2028, new technologies will be an esta- blished topic of Swiss foreign policy. Inter- national Geneva will be a leading location for global governance in relation to digital trans- formation. Switzerland will present a clear, con- textual profile and contribute to international policy debates with its expertise in tech diplom- acy. Stakeholders from industry and the scienti- fic community will become established partners in this process. 6. Having consolidated its bilateral approach, Switzerland will work with the EU, as a non-member state, in shaping Europe. The various institutional issues will have been sett- led and a self-aware and strategic approach will guide the internal debate on Europe. Switzer- land is a European country both in cultural and geographical terms and defending its global interests must start with Europe. Switzerland will strive to put in place jointly agreed arran- gements for regional cooperation. It will take an active role in shaping decisions, providing effective input into policy areas coordinated by the EU at European level. v Introduction – why a 2028 Foreign Policy Vision? Switzerland is one of the safest and most prosper- ous countries in the world. It is politically stable and Swiss citizens have confidence in their insti- tutions. The prospects for the next generation are good. Its prosperity, openness, competitiveness and innovative strength make Switzerland a politi- cal and economic middle power with major global interests. Switzerland is a success story. But it has no guarantee of future success. Switzerland’s pragmatic approach of focusing on solving specific issues and proceeding step by step has served it well in the past. But the world is becoming harsher, more fragmented, more com- plex – and more unpredictable. For Switzerland, this means that it cannot simply take its success for granted. More than ever, it must act based on a clearly defined position, especially in foreign policy. One of the main tasks every state has to fulfil is to regularly assess the global political environment, analyse changes and their causes, identify chal- lenges and opportunities and, where necessary, adjust its foreign policy accordingly. Today this task is more important than ever. We live in an era where change and movement are the norm and Switzerland is impacted on multiple fronts. Digitalisation is transforming the economy and societies worldwide. The growth model pursued by industrialised countries to date is running up against limits imposed by climate change. Power shifts are changing the dynamics underpinning global politics. Geopolitical tensions are growing and trade conflicts are escalating. The cornerstones of international order, especially international law and multilateralism, are increasingly being called into question. Large-scale migration is sowing uncertainty among large segments of the popu- lation. In many countries, protest movements are on the rise because of a widespread loss of trust in established political parties and institutions. The European Union is faced with diverging conceptions of its own identity. And Switzerland is also feeling the consequences. Switzerland wants to shape its future place in Europe and in the world in a self-determined and independent way. It must therefore respond to global changes and find solutions to emerging problems. It needs a vision to protect its interests and promote its values in a volatile environment. Foreign policy is becoming increasingly important for Switzerland‘s prosperity and security. The Federal Constitution provides a solid founda- tion to further develop Swiss foreign policy. Our starting position is good: Switzerland has consider- able credibility as an honest broker and as a country that fulfils its obligations. Its good offices and com- mitment to the rule of law are greatly valued, as are its development cooperation and humanitarian aid work. International Geneva is a major asset for Switzerland’s foreign policy. The FDFA also boasts a strong external network, highly experienced staff, and a broad range of high-quality services for Swiss citizens abroad. There is nonetheless need for action. In a world that is again increasingly marked by power poli- tics, Switzerland must speak with one voice inter- nationally, understand its own interests and know how it intends to achieve its goals. It must equip itself to withstand pressure and demands from all quarters. It can do this most effectively if it already has proposed solutions at its disposal before pres- sure begins to be felt. In the past we often did the opposite: Switzerland would first ignore attempts to apply pressure to it, then it would raise objec- tions, and in the end it would give in. Changing how we deal with international pressure requires a forward-looking analytical capability. Switzerland must also exert influence wherever important decisions are made. It must have the right instruments, partnerships and networks in order to help shape its environment to its advan- tage and seize opportunities worldwide. So there is a great deal Switzerland must accom- plish, and this in a domestic context where unease about external influences is growing. This unease is less pronounced in Switzerland than in other European countries. But it would be wrong to under estimate the trend. It is worth recalling how 1 1 Introduction – why a 2028 Foreign Policy Vision? important a stable set of international rules was and will remain for the Swiss success story. AVIS28 highlights the strengths our foreign policy can bring to bear to contribute to Switzerland‘s future prosperity and security. The report provides an interpretative overview enabling us to draw the right conclusions about the changes that are currently underway. It translates them into a framework that takes due account of domestic politics: Switzerland’s success will depend more than was the case in the past on whether its citizens can understand and recognise the advantages of its foreign policy. AVIS28 is a vision, not a strategy. The report is a source of inspiration to reflect on and set the course for Switzerland’s future foreign policy. It aims to contribute to the dialogue on the Switzer- land of tomorrow. Its ten-year perspective allows a careful examination of the horizon ahead. This time frame also makes it possible to make plau- sible projections about how Switzerland and the world will develop. AVIS28 spans two legislative periods to allow for gradual adjustments and innovations. Based on the premise that our environment will continue to change, AVIS28 lays building blocks for the further development of Swiss foreign poli- cy. These are presented in the form of a six-point vision for Switzerland’s foreign policy until 2028: 1. By 2028, Switzerland‘s foreign policy will deliver on strategic priorities based on clearly defined interests and its values. 2. Foreign policy will be closely linked with domestic policy. 3. Greater focus on services for citizens and cooperating with Swiss businesses are recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy. 4. Switzerland will leverage its core strengths to build a more peaceful and stable world. 5. By 2028, new technologies will be an established topic of Swiss foreign policy. 6. Having consolidated its bilateral approach, Switzerland will work with the EU, as a non-member state, in shaping Europe. The report concludes with a set of considerations on the foundations of Switzerland’s future foreign policy. Policy deliberations must take account of the fact that Switzerland’s political culture and unique characteristics impose certain limits on its strate- gic capacities. Yet these same characteristics are also an opportunity for Switzerland and its glob- al engagement. Political inclusion (the consocia- tional model of democracy), peaceful coexistence against a backdrop of linguistic, cultural and reli- gious diversity, a state structure based on pow- er-sharing, and government policies focused on the welfare of citizens: these historic achievements are not only quintessentially Swiss strengths but also highly relevant for Switzerland’s future for- eign policy. Introduction – why a 2028 Foreign Policy Vision? 2 The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? Nothing is more constant than change. Predicting the world of 2028 is difficult. Neverthe- less, various drivers of change point to a number of trends that provide a strategic framework to discuss Switzerland’s future foreign policy. 2.1. Political drivers: Switzerland in a fragmented world shaped by power politics Globalisation remains a megatrend. The world will continue to be interconnected across a broad range of domains. But the pace of integration will not be as rapid as it was before the 2008 financial crisis. Something of a counter-trend is also evident: a return to national and local concerns. The international realignment of economic power is coupled with the fragmentation of global politics. Outside the Western world, liberal values are not as a matter of course associated with prosperity. A counter-narrative is gaining traction: capitalism without political pluralism. Competition between different systems of government and development models is challenging a global order that has his- torically been shaped by Western values. 2.1.1. Geopolitics and nationalism Competition between the major powers will increasingly shape international relations – in strategic, economic and technological terms. Geopolitical tensions are growing. Interests are increasingly being asserted through the exertion of power. Nationalism and protectionism are resurgent. The United States will remain the leading global power for the time being. While the United States makes up just 4% of the world’s population, it accounts for a quarter of global value added, 35% of global innovation and 40% of global arms expenditures. Yet the United States’ self-percep- tion of being the keeper of the global order is beginning to ebb. National interests are defined more narrowly than in the past. The United States’ transition from ‘leader of the free world’ to ‘Amer- ica first’ began before the Trump administration and is likely to continue after his presidency. China has regained the status of a world power. China’s one-party state has set the pace for for- midable economic growth and is systematically transforming China into a technological and scien- tific superpower. State capitalism combines with nationalist rhetoric that is once again increasing- ly based on Marxist-Leninist principles. China’s long-expected gradual adoption of the western developmental model has not taken place. Domestically, China faces major challenges. Inter- nationally, China is the only major power with a clearly discernible foreign policy vision for the future. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a long- term global infrastructure and investment project. It aims to supply China with resources and energy. It also allows China to export its industrial overca- pacities. The BRI aims to stimulate the development of China’s poorer western provinces and expand Beijing’s influence across Central Asia. It also seeks to open up transport routes to Europe, bypassing the maritime routes controlled by the United States. Many observers believe that Beijing also aims to use the BRI to realign world trade and policymaking, with China at the centre. The future will tell how successful China will be in implementing this cen- tennial project – and with what consequences for the countries involved. The project’s vast scope is itself indicative of China’s new ambitions. 2 0 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 19 96 19 97 19 98 19 99 20 00 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 20 05 20 06 20 07 20 08 20 09 20 10 20 11 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 China is catching up – also in science Percentage of articles cited in western scientific journals USA China UK Germany Switzerland Source: SCImago; China is catching up – also in science 3 The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? Russia, too, will continue to claim major power status. Moscow’s foreign policy is founded on a nationalist narrative that is critical of the West and challenges the liberal order. Moscow’s power is primarily based on Russian mili- tary strength. Russia is no longer among the world’s ten largest economies. Its current GDP is compara- ble to South Korea’s, Spain’s or Australia’s. Reforms and a rapprochement with the West could poten- tially stem Russia’s relative loss of economic pow- er, but no such domestic and foreign policy adjust- ments appear to be on the horizon. Given the strained global political climate, there are expectations that Europe should move closer together. A united Europe could become a world power. This is in fact one the European Union’s stated objectives. But centrifugal forces are also at work in Europe. The EU is an economic power and European coun- tries remain global leaders when it comes to quality of life. But internal fault lines will continue to be a major concern for the EU in the foreseeable future. The EU’s biggest players are facing major domestic political problems. Protest movements are challeng- ing the European integration process as it is present- ly constituted. The EU is rarely able to live up to its potential as a foreign policy actor. Its member states disagree on too many key issues. Calls for ‘strategic autonomy’ and ‘European sovereignty’ remain rath- er theoretical for the time being. Whether the trend is towards ‘more Europe’ or ‘less Europe’ is as yet unclear. Despite this uncertainty, or rather because of it, the single market with its four freedoms at the heart of the European integration process is likely to endure. EU member states will in all likelihood also continue to coordinate within the framework of the EU their efforts to ensure Europe’s internal security and global competitiveness. It also remains to be seen whether the West, as a transatlantic community of values, will be able to retain its power to shape policymaking. The lan- guage coming from Washington gives little room for optimism in the short term. It is clear, however, that Europe and the United States will continue to need each other in the global political landscape of the future. We should therefore not be too hasty in writing off the West just yet. 2.1.2. The international order under pressure The growing prominence of non-Western values has led to an erosion of the liberal international order. The rule of law, democracy and human rights are on the defensive. International law is under pressure. Freedom of expression is being curtailed in many countries. Facts are countered with pseudo-facts with alarming frequency – not only in autocratic countries. It is too early to tell whether this trend is a temporary setback or whether decades of progress have been irretriev- ably lost. The weakening of the international order is also evidenced by the fact that arms control trea- ties are being flouted: we are witnessing a trend towards rearmament. A future arms race between China, the United States and Russia with regional spillover effects cannot be ruled out. Strategic sta- bility is difficult to achieve in a multipolar world. We are already facing the ever-present risk of the misuse of cyberspace for geopolitical, intelligence and military purposes. Numerous multilateral organisations are strug- gling to maintain their capacity to act because of growing divergences between their member states. The law of the strongest is gaining ground, especially in security and trade relations. The US historian and foreign-policy commentator Robert Kagan encapsulated this trend in the title of his 2018 book The Jungle Grows Back. Kagan’s argument overreaches, however: multi- lateralism is not finished, but it is changing and increasingly fragmented. Governance structures are becoming more diverse, with sometimes competing and overlapping interests. New cooperation networks are also emerging, for example between cities. Rapid worldwide urban- isation is turning cities into key players in efforts to address climate, energy and migration issues. Digitalisation is enhancing non-governmental actors’ ability to shape developments. This trend also places limits on nation states’ ability to reas- sert their sway. A stable new global order is unlikely to emerge any time soon from this tangled web. For small and medium-sized countries like Switzerland, whose prosperity and security depend on a rules- based system, these trends pose a real challenge. Protecting its interests will become much more challenging for Switzerland in the years ahead. The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? 4 Experts are saying that a new bipolar world order – divided this time into US and Chinese spheres of influence – is a real possibility. But it is no more likely than other scenarios. Although confronta- tions over regional conflicts are more frequent and often more intense in multilateral forums like the UN, positive results are still being achieved on many issues. With the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the global compact for migration, the UN has been able to develop solutions to glob- al challenges. A reformed multilateralism certainly has a future and Switzerland can help to shape it. 2.1.3. 2030 Agenda: progress towards development and global challenges The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop- ment provides a global framework for economical- ly, socially and environmentally sustainable develop- ment. Adopted in 2015, the Agenda sets common goals for all states and marks a break with the old north-south paradigm. It also constitutes a basis for forward-looking development cooperation. The agenda is also a benchmark for International Gene- va, as many of the organisations based there are contributing to its implementation. The world has made significant development progress. The proportion of children dying before reaching their fifth birthday fell from 36% at the turn of the 20th century to 4% in 2015. The pro- portion of adults with basic literacy skills rose from 21% to 85% over the same period. Over 2.5 bil- lion people gained better access to clean drinking water between 1990 and 2015. Per capita income is a particularly telling indicator of progress: the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from 41% in 1981 to 10% in 2015. Despite this progress, enormous global challeng- es remain. Among these are numerous crises and conflicts, often escalating to extreme lev- els of violence. Today’s conflicts also last longer than they did some 20 years ago. A multiplicity of causes and actors make it more difficult to find lasting solutions. Most conflicts are still intra-state conflicts but they are increasingly becoming proxy wars orchestrated by regional and major powers. Although wars between the world’s major powers are unlikely, there is a growing risk of unintention- al escalation triggered by military provocations. Fragile states are still a major challenge. Accord- ing to the OECD, 24% of the world’s population now lives in a fragile state, and by 2030 this figure could rise to 28%, to 2.3 billion people. The fight against poverty has been comparatively unsuc- cessful in fragile states: by 2030, over 80% of people living in extreme poverty are likely to be in such countries. Demographic trends are important indicators of future development. Many fragile states are experiencing high population growth. According to UN forecasts, the world’s population is expect- ed to increase by 2.2 billion between 2017 and 2050. Over half of this increase will take place in Africa, whose share of the world population is expected to rise from 17% to 26%. Europe is the only continent where the population will decline in absolute terms. Europe’s share of the world’s pop- ulation will fall from 10% to under 8% by 2050. Asia already accounts for over 60% of the world’s population, and its share will continue to increase. Fragile contexts Extremely fragile contexts Source: OECD, States of Fragility Report 2018 Fragile states – focus on Africa 5 The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? Africa and Europe face diametrically opposed demographic challenges: Africa has a very young population (40% of Africans are under the age of 15) for whom jobs will have to be created. It is estimated that 800 million people will enter the labour market by 2050. Dynamic entrepreneurship is fast becoming the key to Africa’s future. Europe, in contrast, will have to deal with the problems of an ageing population. The rising costs of the wel- fare state, coupled with stalled reforms in many countries, are compounding the challenges. Migration will remain a crucial political issue. An increase in rural-urban migration and in migra- tory pressure from the South to the North are to be expected. While the rate of migration is rising only moderately in relation to the world’s popu- lation, the relative share of migration towards Europe, the United States and the Gulf States has increased: In 2017, 30% of the world’s 258 million migrants lived in Europe. Half of them migrated within Europe. Migration policy will likely contin- ue to focus on preventing irregular migration from Africa. Europe will continue to face migratory pressure. Instability in Europe’s southern neighbourhood not only drives migration to Europe but also pos- es a persistent threat of jihadist terrorism. It is conceivable that technological developments will allow terrorism to become smarter and more dan- gerous in the future. Depending on the political and economic situation, there is also a risk of an increase in left-wing or right-wing extremist violence.

Ecological drivers: sustainability as the basis for prosperity and security Together with climate change, environmental de gradation is a critical global challenge. Both will be at the centre of social and political attention in the years ahead. The enormous economic and social growth the world has experienced since the middle of the 20th century has come at an increas- ingly high environmental cost. Natural resources are being overexploited and the consumption of fossil fuels is unsustainable. Environmental impacts threaten to undermine development progress. For several years now, the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report has been placing environmen- tal risks at the top of global challenges. Policy- makers have in fact taken measures to reduce the environmental footprint. In certain areas, there is some evidence of a trend reversal: the ozone layer has begun to show signs of recovery since ozone- depleting chemicals were banned. The ozone layer is healing itself. Overall, however, the environmen- tal trend is negative. Achieving the economic and social goals of the 2030 Agenda will require greater progress in the Agenda’s environmental dimension. 2.2.1. Critical thresholds of planetary boundaries have been reached Scientific research on the various planetary boundaries to absorb waste and pollution has not advanced equally far for all these boundaries. But there is little disagreement among experts that critical thresholds have been reached or will soon be reached in many environmental areas: according to UN environmental reports, global air pollution is worsening despite progress in the industrialised countries. Polluted air kills up to 7 million people each year. Soil quality is also deteriorating. Almost one third of the world’s land mass is affected by soil degradation. Biodiversity is declining dramatically. Biodiver- sity loss reduces the ability of ecosystems to per- form vital functions. Western and central Europe have witnessed a 60% decline in species diversi- ty in recent decades. Global populations of ver- tebrates have declined by 60% on average since 1970. Depending on the habitat, between 25% and 42% of invertebrate species are now threat- ened with extinction. The acidification of the world’s oceans and marine plastic waste are another environmental disaster. Freshwater quality is also deteriorating. In addition to contamination by bacteria, chem- icals, pesticides and heavy metals, the dissemi- nation of antibiotic resistance via waterways is a major concern. Antibiotic resistance is becoming a global threat to health and food security. Fur- thermore, rising water consumption causes water shortages: According to the UN, by 2040 over 30 countries – almost half of them in the Middle East – will face “extreme water stress”. This occurs when over 80% of available water resources are used up. low ( 80%) Source: World Resources Institute Water stress: forecast for 2040 7 The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? 2.2.2. Climate change as a megatrend Climate change is the primary ecological driver. Annual carbon dioxide emissions have quadrupled since 1960. As a consequence, sea levels are ris- ing and weather patterns are changing. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, more severe and more widespread. Climate change is a megatrend that affects all countries. It exacerbates adverse environmental impacts and affects all societies and economies. Developing countries lacking sufficient resources to adapt to climate change are particularly affect- ed. In large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa, climate change is threatening crop yields, food security and incomes. Climate change could push 100 mil- lion people back into extreme poverty by 2030. The World Bank estimates that climate change could displace over 140 million people by 2050. Densely populated coastal regions such as the Nile Delta and Bangladesh, as well as various Pacif- ic island states, are particularly threatened. Heat stress could make many sub-Saharan regions unin- habitable. Switzerland is also feeling the effects of cli- mate change. As a landlocked country, it does not benefit from ocean-driven temperature reg- ulation. Average temperatures in Switzerland are already 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This means that in Switzerland, climate warming is twice the global average. Switzerland is affect- ed directly both by more heatwaves with nega- tive consequences for people’s health and by the progressive melting of its glaciers. It is also bears an indirect brunt of climate change, for example through migration and bottlenecks in the supply of important goods. The scale of future risks largely depends on our ability to limit global warming. Climate mitiga- tion is now becoming a vital global task. The Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in glob- al average temperature to well below 2°C by the end of this century. According to the UN, climate mitigation efforts need to be tripled to achieve this goal. In essence, the aim is to ensure economic growth while reducing carbon emissions. Sustainability will become a cornerstone of prosperity and secu- rity. Systematic incentives for sustainable and scal- able innovations could be an important means to achieve this. New technologies will play a pivotal role, alongside political initiatives, to significantly reduce the environmental impacts of consumption and production. They are all the more important given that the environmental policy measures tried so far have been largely ineffective in addressing the challenge of climate change. The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? 8 2.3. Technological drivers: the digital transformation is picking up steam In the years ahead, new technologies are set to become the principal drivers of change – with consequences for global politics, the environment, the global economy and society. We are on the cusp of a quantum leap in information and com- munication technologies. Today, around 11 billion devices, sensors and people are connected to each other. By 2030, that number is projected to jump to 200 billion devices. 2.3.1. A new phase in digitalisation Building on the Internet of Things, big data and cloud technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is ush- ering in a new phase of digital transformation. AI enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to new information inputs and perform tasks that require human-like intelligence. AI systems already outperform humans in some cognitive tasks. AI is also beginning to catch up with humans in terms of sensorimotor skills and is also making progress in social intelligence. That said, people are unlikely to be ever overtaken by AI systems in social intel- ligence skills. Digitalisation 2.0 will become a key driver of inno- vation, value creation and growth. It will transform the way we live, work and grow old. But it also carries enormous risks, for example in the military sector and in the field of surveillance. AI also rais- es a number of sensitive foreign policy issues for Switzerland. As the raw material of the 21st century, data is changing the very foundations of power. Whoever possesses big data and AI technology has a strate- gic power advantage. There are signs that a tech- nology race for supremacy in AI is already under- way, particularly between the United States and China. Beijing is investing enormous sums in new technologies. The government wants to use AI to catapult China’s economy into the future but also to ensure public security and monitor and con- trol Chinese citizens ‘intelligently’. Technological nationalism could become a defining trend, to the detriment of the free and fair use of technological innovations. Internet freedom is an achievement that is increasingly under threat. 2.3.2. The fourth industrial revolution Like communication technologies, biotechnolo- gy and gene technology are also on the verge of major innovations. In the health sector, new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures bring enor- mous opportunities, but also raise ethical questions. Genetically modified or gene-edited crops promise to do the same for agriculture. Nanotechnologies and bionics will also change industrial production. We are witnessing the beginning of a Fourth Indus- trial Revolution. It will be driven by the convergence of digital, biological, and physical technolo- gies. This convergence will multiply the potential for change inherent in each of these technology sec- tors. Compared to this networked digital world, the physical world will become less important econom- ically. Some experts are predicting that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will significantly exceed earlier revolutions in terms of speed, scale and impact on economic, social and political systems. The Fourth Industrial Revolution also holds great potential for addressing environmental challenges. New technologies will help to reduce humanity’s ecological footprint and shape interactions between people, businesses and the environment in a sustain- able way. Rapid developments in robotics, machine learning and automation will also impact labour markets worldwide. Manufacturing will be fully computer- ised and new production techniques and processes promise significant productivity gains. Many jobs, including high-skilled ones, are likely to be replaced, which could result in greater social inequality. At the same time, however, new technologies always usher in innovations and new tasks to manage the interaction between people and machines. Countries like South Korea and Japan, for example, have remarkably low unemployment rates despite the fact that robotics are highly integrated in their value-added chains. The disruptive impact of the Fourth Industrial Revo- lution on labour markets and society will depend on the extent of the gap between automation and the emergence of new types of occupations. The tran- sition requires appropriate framework conditions, for example at the level of education and training. Technological advances should benefit the greatest possible number of people. 9 The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? 2.4. Economic drivers: trade and production changes Technological change is also driving global eco- nomic developments: the Fourth Industrial Revo- lution alters trade flows. The reason for this is a transformation of the global industrial sector: companies with large manufacturing plants scat- tered across different countries are not likely to be the model of the future. AI and lower production costs are driving a trend away from mass manufac- turing towards local, small-scale production: this allows companies to relocate production plants closer to their customers and their sales markets. This will on the one hand give international com- panies a greater incentive to embed themselves more firmly in the local economy, potentially con- tributing to more inclusive growth in peripheral regions. But on the other hand, some production lines that were offshored to low-wage countries will move back to OECD countries. 2.4.1. Glocalisation Companies from countries with small domestic markets – such as Switzerland – face particu- lar challenges, but are also presented with new opportunities. The global textile industry, which will undergo a major transformation with the advent of smart fabrics and e-textiles, is a case in point. A combination of lower production costs, Swiss expertise in textile manufacturing and in the electronics sector could give new impetus to the Swiss textile industry. In the industrial sector almost 60% of all exported goods are unfinished products that pass through global value chains. This figure will decline in the future. Production processes will increasingly be glocalised. Technological advances will place particular demands on developing countries. Industri- alisation may in future not be the key driver of development it has been until now. Low-skilled industrial jobs will probably reduce in numbers. The leitmotiv of the 2030 Agenda – not to leave anyone behind – takes on a new meaning in light of technological transformation. Developing countries are, at the same time, under ever greater pressure to improve their econom- ic framework conditions in order to continue to attract investment. Some developing countries have a greater capacity for adaptation than indus- trialised countries, as they are less encumbered with long-established structures standing in the way of change. Moreover, technological advances – the smartphone is just one example – are now available almost everywhere at the same time. If developing countries set the right course, they can create new prospects for growth. On balance, high-wage industrialised coun- tries are likely to be in a better position than emerging countries to rise to the challenge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This could slow down the structural shift of power from the West to other parts of the world. Nevertheless, how individual countries will ultimately develop in the future remains an open question. 2.4.2. Fragmented global trade order The polarisation of global politics is now also mirrored in the fragmentation of the internation- al trade order: The World Trade Organization is struggling to maintain its relevance. It will have to be reformed if it is to regain acceptance. In the field of regulation, the trend is away from multilat- eral towards plurilateral agreements. Tariff reduc- tion and free trade agreements are now largely regional and bilateral. We are currently witnessing an escalation of pro- tectionist measures and countermeasures between the trading powers which is weakening the global trading order. As long as the global political arena continues to be dominated by tensions between the major powers, political goals and ambitions will play a significant role in world trade. Further geo-economic tensions are likely.

Social drivers: identity politics, inward turn and demands for greater say in decision-making Fragmentation also has an impact on society. The fundamental principles of the democratic model are increasingly contested in Western societies. Public discourse is suffused with unease towards political institutions and decision-makers. Protest movements are altering the party-political land- scape. Domestic polarisation hampers effective governance. 2.5.1. Defensive reflex against globalisation The defensive reflex against globalisation has mul- tiple causes, ranging from the failure to address the negative consequences of the financial and debt crisis of 2008 to the refugee crisis of 2015. The redefinition of values is also a defensive reflex against globalisation. While globalisation has nar- rowed the economic gap between developed and developing countries and opened up new oppor- tunities for millions of people, it has also produced greater income inequality within many countries around the world. The job losses caused by the Fourth Industrial Revolution will potentially lead to more social protests. Moreover, as people become more affluent, many also fear that they will be deprived of their new prosperity. That is why scep- ticism of globalisation is increasingly widespread in countries that have largely benefited from it in recent decades. Identity politics and an inward turn are becoming increasingly important factors in polit- ical life. Many people around the world feel a loss of democratic control. Wherever internation- al rules and standards are laid down in response to globalisation, we also see calls to recover lost sovereignty. What is more, traditional political parties, particularly in Europe, are coming under growing pressure as a result of this dynamic. They are losing support just as political movements are attracting it. This political malaise is fanned both by state and non-state actors that are spreading disinforma- tion. Open societies have become more vulnerable in the age of digitalisation. Strengthening socie- ties’ resilience to fake news campaigns will be a major task. Schools will have to play a key role in teaching students how to judge news and infor- mation. The challenge is all the greater as AI-generat- ed deepfake technology that allows the digital manipulation of videos and images will make it increasingly difficult to distinguish genuine from false information. Social media encourage the fragmentation of values and political views. While social media allows people in an individualistic world to read news from sources they would not otherwise have access to and to exchange information with a wid- er range of people, it also creates echo chambers and filter bubbles that increasingly induce them to consume personalised information and filter out other opinions. This phenomenon can under- mine social cohesion. 2.5.2. Transnational movements Digitalisation fosters the emergence of new trans- national identities and movements. In virtual com- munities, people organise themselves across geo- graphical and political boundaries. Young people’s current efforts to mitigate climate change are a prime example of this transnational dynamic. They are demanding a greater say in decision-making but are not sceptical of globalisation per se. The Me-Too movement is another example, but so are jihadist terrorism (Al-Qaeda and the ‘Islamic State’ group) and organised crime. Switzerland still enjoys a high level of social cohe- sion. But there is also growing unease in Switzer- land about international regulatory processes, a fact that Swiss foreign policy should not ignore. The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for? 12 2028 Foreign Policy Vision The second chapter outlined the changes hap- pening in the world and showed what they mean for Switzerland, while highlighting the drivers of development. The Foreign Policy Vision translates these changes – at both the global and national level – into options for action. AVIS28 identifies six foreign policy areas for inno- vation. The vision begins by describing an opti- mum condition in 2028, before setting out pro- posals – in the form of building blocks that can be combined to gear foreign policy to achieving this optimum scenario. 3.1. Foreign policy based on clearly defined interests and Switzerland’s value compass In order to continue its success story, Switzerland should define its interests more clearly and pursue them more prominently in future. In Switzerland’s case, interest-driven politics does not mean pow- er politics or unilateralism. And Switzerland must not lose sight of its core values. On the contrary: in Switzerland, interests and values coincide. They are two sides of the same coin. Switzerland’s inner strengths should continue to guide its foreign policy. Switzerland’s commitment to democracy and the rule of law, to dialogue and a culture of compromise, to human rights and gender equity, and to humanitarian principles is a core element of its foreign policy. A Swiss foreign policy devoid of values would lack strength and credibility. Switzerland is known throughout the world for its humanitarian tradition, and solidarity forms part of its understanding of what a state should be and do. However, safeguarding national interests has tra- ditionally been the primary focus of foreign policy. The geopolitical and trade policy developments dis- cussed here will make this task much more demand- ing for Switzerland in future. Others are envious of the country’s prosperity and, as an independent actor, Switzerland will become the target of more frequent international pressure. What is more, in a multipolar world, the country will be forced to take a position on controversial issues more often than has hitherto been the case. For that reason, Switzerland should take a much closer look at its interests. Only by knowing its interests can it effectively defend them. With that in mind, Switzerland will be able to have a say in the international arena: pursuing a policy based on interests means exercising influence and shap- ing decisions. The vision is based on four main components or building blocks: 3.1.1. A shared understanding of interests The article in the Federal Constitution that sets out the aims of the Swiss Confederation provides the starting point for defining these interests. From a foreign policy viewpoint, Switzerland’s security, welfare and independence are its core interests. Added to these are the long-term preservation of natural resources and the promo- tion of a just and peaceful international order as the basis for security, welfare and independence. Art. 54 of the Federal Constitution names impor- tant sub-areas of foreign policy. It states that “the Confederation shall ensure that the independence of Switzerland and its welfare is safeguarded; it shall in particular assist in the alleviation of need and poverty in the world and promote respect for human rights and democracy, the peaceful co- existence of peoples as well as the conservation of natural resources.” In its dispatch on the Federal Constitution, the Federal Council notes that this list is not exhaustive. It also states that Article 101 of the Federal Constitution, according to which the Confederation “shall safeguard the interests of the Swiss economy abroad”, crystallises the The vision By 2028, Switzerland’s foreign policy will deliver on strategic priorities based on clearly defined interests and its values. Foreign policy will articulate thematic and regional priorities. Switzerland will be consistent in its dealings, including those with the major powers. It will leverage the potential afforded by its independence while pursuing its interests in cooperation with like-minded countries. 3 13 2028 Foreign Policy Vision powers conferred on foreign policy by law. In other words, foreign policy is also foreign eco- nomic policy. The Federal Constitution thus specifies the key values of foreign policy while leaving considera- ble scope as to how that policy is defined. Foreign policy may be developed further in line with inter- national requirements and domestic preferences. A broad discussion could reveal how Switzerland’s interests manifest themselves in this context: the aim is to give specific form to security, prosperity and independence as the country’s core interests – while including the cross-cutting areas of inter- national order and sustainability. Security becoming more important Security is becoming increasingly important in the context of foreign policy. It is in Switzerland’s interest that states – and particularly the major powers – resolve conflicts peacefully. Peace means more security and prosperity. An international order that puts law before power is just as important. It is in Switzerland’s interest to defend and further develop the achieve- ments of this order, which include strong secu- rity organisations such as the UN and the OSCE, respect for the rule of law and international law, promoting democracy, and a functioning arms control system. All states should have access to the new technol- ogies as a tool for peace on the basis of common standards. An open, free and stable cyberspace is equally in Switzerland’s interest. Democracy and the rule of law must be protected against espio- nage and be able to withstand influence and dis- information. Lastly, Switzerland helps safeguard the security of its citizens by means of consular protection. Geographically, the stability of Europe around it is key to Switzerland’s security. In recent decades, Switzerland has benefited from the stabilising effect of NATO and European unity. However, social and political changes in many states indicate that this stability can no longer be taken for granted. Europe’s neighbours to the south and east take high priority too: Africa, the Middle East, the Western Balkans and the Eastern European countries between Russia and the EU are priority regions for Switzerland’s contributions to stabilisa- tion. The aim is to create development prospects locally, reduce the pressure of migration to Europe and avoid the threat of terrorism and organised crime. In addition, the inclusive pan-European security order should be strengthened. Switzer- land can help achieve this by building confidence and trust in relations between Russia and the West, and defending the OSCE principles: it can also work to bolster prospects and stability in the countries situated between the EU and Russia.

In this way, foreign policy contributes to the coun- try’s internal cohesion and helps safeguard its system of social welfare. Supporting Swiss busi- ness abroad thus takes on even more importance. Securing market access for Swiss companies and maintaining fair competition rules will become more difficult: companies should be able to trade and invest without discrimination. Alongside mar- ket access, this also requires legal certainty when making long-term investments and the protection of intellectual property. A rules-based international order is essential for Switzerland to prosper. Priority must go to a World Trade Organization with the capacity for effective action, and further rounds of multilateral trade lib- eralisation. However, while progress here remains blocked, the focus will be placed on plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements. Free trade policy is crucial to Switzerland as an exporter. Market access boosts the country’s competitiveness and the attainment of full employment. Its key markets are: the EU, the United States, Chi- na and – if Brexit happens – the United Kingdom. However, for Switzerland and its prosperity, main- taining and expanding the global scale of its foreign trade policy is key. The most common- ly named growth markets for Switzerland today include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will require busi- nesses, the state and its citizens to adapt to large- scale change with wide-ranging consequences. Foreign policy will have to respond via new forms of governance that enable this change to be accompanied by suitable regulation. The prosperity of other countries contributes sig- nificantly to Switzerland’s prosperity – yet another reason why it is in Switzerland’s interest to pro- mote development in other countries. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pro- vides a meaningful framework for its efforts in this area. Enabling global economic growth that pro- duces fewer emissions is another important task facing Swiss foreign policy. Independence: freedom of action and new opportunities of neutrality Independence means freedom of action. The primary consideration here is to protect people against the arbitrary use of power. International agreements are a suitable instrument for achieving this. Rather than weakening Switzerland’s sover- eignty, rules-based treaties actually prevent deci- sions being made solely according to ‘might makes right’. But this does not mean that Switzerland should enter into as many of these agreements as possible. The important point is that the agree- ments it does conclude should be in the national interest and enjoy domestic support. Pursuing its own foreign policy remains Swit- zerland’s best guarantee of independence.

The pros of an independent free trade policy can turn into cons if actors such as the EU follow suit and use their greater market power to enter into agree- ments that are potentially more favourable. It also remains to be seen how Switzerland can defend its independence and capacity to act in the digital sphere. Nevertheless, the advantages of pursuing an independent foreign policy outweigh the dis- advantages at present. Going forward, an intelligent combination of independence and openness will be decisive. It is in Switzerland’s interest to maintain political relations with all other states and to adhere to its policy of dialogue. Independence calls for an agile foreign policy, an extensive global presence and sound knowledge of other cultures. Swiss neutrality is a trump card in the country’s independent foreign policy. It was being called into question in the 1990s, when not actually being declared obsolete. Now it is once more opening up opportunities for Switzerland. The protective function of neutrality will play a less prominent role as long as Switzerland is surrounded by the EU and NATO. Instead, neutrality gives Switzerland much greater room for manoeuvre in foreign pol- icy terms. Thanks to its neutrality, it can propose solutions as a credible actor, with the other actors knowing that it has no hidden power-politics agenda in doing so. Neutrality is also important to the country’s host state policy and good offices. It creates fresh pros- pects for Switzerland in relation to digital transfor- mation, for example: Switzerland is an ideal venue for discussing and regulating certain aspects of tomorrow’s world that are already highly politi- cised, such as artificial intelligence. 3.1.2. Setting regional priorities As an independent state situated between centres of power, Switzerland has an interest in maintain- ing an extensive geographical presence. However, it cannot be omnipresent and it cannot do everything. It will have to set priorities: Europe remains the key region for Switzerland’s prosperity and security. The EU-28’s share of global GDP (PPP) may have fallen from 21% to 16% over the last decade and now looks likely to decline fur- ther in the next 10 years. However, this trend does nothing to diminish the paramount importance of the EU single market to the Swiss economy. In 2018, 52% of all Swiss exports went to the EU and 70% of all imports came from EU countries. Even without the United Kingdom, the EU-27 will remain Switzerland’s main market, accounting for 48% of its exports and 66% of its imports (as at 2018). Defending Switzerland’s interests with regard to the EU is of strategic importance, as is working together with the EU – and not just when it comes to market access. Numerous matters that were previously considered to fall under domestic policy have taken on a European dimension in recent dec- ades. The ability to participate in European research programmes is essential if Switzerland is to remain a hub of innovation. Issues relating to national security are also increasingly being dealt with at the European level. Switzerland needs relations with its neighbours to be stable and built on trust. Germany, France, Italy and Austria alone account for two thirds of bilat- eral trade with Switzerland. The volume of trade between Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg is equal to that between Switzerland and China. If and when Brexit comes to pass, full market access and a close partnership with the United Kingdom will become paramount. The transformation of Eastern Europe and Central Asia has been uneven. The dismantling of democ- racy and deepening of geopolitical divides is not in Switzerland’s interest. Continuing its dialogue with Russia and Turkey based on constructive criticism, stabilising the Western Balkans and resolving the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus remain important fields of action. Africa’s stability is also of strategic interest to Swit- zerland. As far as North Africa is concerned, the focus is on economic development and migration cooperation. Progress in stabilising the crisis regions south of the Sahara – stretching from Mali to Lake Chad to Somalia – is another matter of importance to Switzerland’s security. This area is marked by high fragility, conflict, terrorism, high rates of poverty and population growth. However, the problems associated with migration should not be the sole focus of attention. Non- European states have recognised the continent’s tre- mendous economic potential and are making huge investments in Africa. Even though the region cur- rently accounts for only 1.5% of total Swiss trade, promoting the African market and encouraging the business world to make more use of the opportu- nities it affords is in our national interest as Africa’s economic development benefits Switzerland’s own 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 16 prosperity and security. As well as promoting this development by helping Swiss companies to seize opportunities, Switzerland should also expand its political presence in the region. The Middle East is one of the most important regions for Switzerland’s security. Unlike Africa, the Middle East’s overall economic importance is likely to stagnate or even decline. The region is witnessing momentous upheavals, with numerous geopolitical, ethnic and religious lines of conflict reducing the prospects for stabilisation. Violent conflict, poor governance, increasing water scar- city, population growth and youth unemployment rates as high as 30%: these are the realities. Grow- ing numbers of migrants attempting to reach Europe via the Mediterranean are to be expected. It is in Switzerland’s interest to prevent the region from destabilising further and to assist it in achiev- ing progress. Preventing and defusing conflicts, exercising protecting power mandates, water diplomacy, respect for international humanitar- ian law and promoting regional cooperation are potential elements of a firm engagement for peace. Switzerland has an interest in improving econom- ic prospects in this region too. Efforts to encour- age start-ups and young entrepreneurs could be stepped up, in the occupied Palestinian territory for instance. The rights of individuals as entre- preneurs and employees could be strengthened by giving them access to formal markets. There is the potential for greater cooperation with certain countries in the areas of business, science and aca- demia, and finance. As in Africa, refugees in the Middle East should receive support locally. Asia presents a major opportunity for Switzerland in business terms. According to the OECD, by 2028 four of the five largest national economies in this region – China, Japan, Indonesia and India – will generate half of global GDP. By 2030, two thirds of the world’s middle class will live in Asia. Asia’s share in Swiss foreign trade rose from just under 12% to over 23% in the last decade. Asia is also becoming a centre of world politics, making Switzerland’s presence in the region all the more important. As far as security policy is con- cerned, Asia is less directly relevant than Africa or the Middle East. Nevertheless, Switzerland has an interest in resolving conflicts peacefully and pro- moting cooperative security structures. Bilateral relations with China already cover a wide range of areas. There is potential to build on relations with other countries, including India, which will become more important to the Swiss economy while also playing an anchor role for democracy in the region. The focus in the Americas is on relations with the United States. Switzerland’s interests elsewhere in this region are less prominent. It has econom- ic interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. Bilateral economic relations with these countries could be expanded. One important topic is coop- eration in combating corruption. Switzerland also works closely with a large number of these states in a multilateral setting, especially when it comes 50 40 30 20 10 0 Source: International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database.

An eye on the major powers When it comes to safeguarding Switzerland’s inter- ests, the country’s relations with the major powers are growing in importance. Improvements are nec- essary here. In a world dominated by great-power diplomacy, power politics and unilateralism, an independent Switzerland needs to have clear strate- gies for dealing with the most influential actors and viable political relations with them. Although the Federal Council recognised the importance of priority countries outside Europe as early as 2005, the approach it adopted of enter- ing into ‘strategic partnerships’ with the BRICS countries, the United States, Japan and Turkey nevertheless failed to produce the desired effect in some cases. Relationships are too asymmetrical and were defined too strongly in terms of cooper- ation rather than actual content. As a result, these bilateral relations are at times administered rather than actively defined at the policy level. In future, relations with priority countries should be defined on the basis of strategies that combine political, security, economic, tech- nological, scientific and sustainable develop- ment matters, with Switzerland’s interests and high- potential areas serving as a starting point. High-potential areas include Switzerland’s good offices, which continually open doors that would otherwise remain closed. Coherence between the departments in their han- dling of such priority countries is paramount. Swit- zerland’s consociational democracy presents it with particular challenges in this respect. Country strategies that define clear goals and for which the Federal Council is responsible have the potential to serve as an instrument here. While they may not represent a ’one size fits all solution’ for the wide range of voices and agendas in Switzerland, they nevertheless facilitate a ‘big picture’ view that reduces the segmentation of foreign policy. Coherent strategies are called for in relation to the United States, China and Russia in particular – the foremost powers at present. The USA remains very important to Switzer- land’s prosperity and security. Switzerland must take due account of the continuing US dom- inance of the international order. Bilateral relations are based on a solid historical foundation, largely shared values and close cultural and human ties. An estimated 1 million people with Swiss roots live in the United States. It is by far the most impor- tant destination for direct investments by Swiss companies. The United States is Switzerland’s second largest trading partner, and Switzerland is the seventh largest investor in the US and one of its top twenty trading partners. Conditions in the US market for non-US companies are becom- ing tougher. Switzerland has an interest in deep- ening its relationship with the United States and strengthening the framework conditions for doing business with it. A free trade agreement and closer cooperation in the field of international financial market regulation would help achieve this. Measured by the number of diplomatic visits, rela- tions with Washington have been less intense in the last few years than those with Beijing.

Closely linking foreign and domestic policy to prevent a loss of trust A culture that views foreign policy as part of domestic policy and domestic policy as part of for- eign policy must be actively promoted and gain broad support. More weight should be given to this aspect of foreign policy in future. As a semi- direct democracy, scepticism towards politics and globalisation is less evident in Swiss society than in other Western countries. But a sense of unease can be felt in our country too. People’s trust in foreign policy must be strengthened by linking for- eign and domestic policy more closely. AVIS28 describes four building blocks for linking foreign and domestic policy more closely: 3.2.1. Closer cooperation with Parliament and the cantons National legislation is increasingly being supple- mented by European and international forms of regulation. Foreign policy has a greater impact on legislation and domestic policy processes than was previously the case. Many norms negotiated at the global level can no longer be fundamentally altered at the national level. More soft law instruments are emerging in place of agreements under international law. These qua- si-legal instruments are referred to as ‘soft’ as they have no binding force under international law. They are easier to negotiate and can help maintain an international framework of rules and norms in the face of political stalemates. However, they are not generally put before national parliaments for The vision By 2028, foreign and domestic policy will be closely linked. Swiss foreign policy will have a broad domestic support base as it meets the expectations of the general public. It will be based on continuous dialogue and a whole-of- Switzerland approach. Foreign policy will have a fixed place on the Federal Council’s agenda. The latter will determine the direction of foreign policy, in close consultation with Parliament and the cantons, and with clearly defined responsibilities. a strategic partnership. Looking beyond the pro- tecting power mandate in Iran and Venezuela and cooperation on vocational education and training, new areas of cooperation should be considered. These include new technologies and new issues of international law. Switzerland has a wealth of expertise to offer in repatriating illicitly acquired assets of politically exposed persons. Stepping up cooperation with influential US think tanks may also serve to safeguard Switzerland’s interests in the long term. If Switzerland wants to assert its multilateral interests on the global stage, it must also articulate them vis-à-vis Washington and seek to cooperate with the United States in areas in which it makes sense to do so. Switzerland has succeeded in establishing very close relations with China. Switzerland became the first country in mainland Europe to conclude a free trade agreement with China, which is now its third most important trading part- ner. Around 30 sectoral dialogues are being held on a variety of topics, illustrating the fact that Bei- jing has responded more positively to the idea of a strategic partnership than other priority countries. In addition, around 20 cantons and cities have now established economic and cultural partner- ships with Chinese provinces and municipalities. The Federal Council should draw up a clear strate- gy for its policy on China over the coming years in a way that intelligently combines the opportunities and challenges associated with cooperation. As well as developments within China itself, the wid- er international frame of reference must be tak- en into consideration. Should the world become more politically polarised, Switzerland’s relation- ship with China could become more complicated. Although close economic relations and strategic dialogue remain important, they should form part of an effective overall strategy. Russia is not one of Switzerland’s top trading partners. However, the country’s weight in global affairs makes Moscow an important player with regard to Swiss foreign policy. Relations between the two countries have become more fraught since the annexation of Crimea and various espi- onage and cyber incidents. However, more than other European countries, Switzerland remains committed to dialogue rather than isolation, as evidenced by its good offices – specifically the protecting power mandates in Georgia and Rus- sia – and the firm belief that security can only be achieved in Europe by working with Russia rather than against it. 3.1.4. Structured cooperation with like-minded states Switzerland can defend its interests on the global stage by stepping up its cooperation with certain partner countries. It already works together with a group of like-minded states, above all on specific topics and at the technical level. A more tightly structured form of cooperation with some of these like-minded countries (LMCs) on policy and transversal issues would lend itself to this purpose. Although these countries are not among the most dominant actors on the world stage, they are nevertheless relevant. They pursue similar interests to Switzerland, and previous expe- rience has shown them to be reliable. They advo- cate for a peaceful world order, are committed to results-based multilateralism and work together as equals. Their positions often converge, for exam- ple in areas such as peace, human rights, the envi- ronment, energy and science. LMCs are most likely to be found in Europe. But not only there. With tomorrow’s world in mind, Switzerland should also integrate non-Europe- an countries into an LMC strategy. Moves in this direction have already been made below the polit- ical level: for instance, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland all collaborate as part of the Small Advanced Economies Initiative. These industrialised coun- tries with around 5 to 10 million inhabitants each work together on issues related to economics and innovation. Other formats should be looked into, such as setting up a K7 group of smaller states as a counterpart to the G7. An LMC strategy would allow promising partnerships for the future to be built: Switzerland can promote its interests more effectively by joining forces with others. 19 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 3.2. Closely linking foreign and domestic policy to prevent a loss of trust A culture that views foreign policy as part of domestic policy and domestic policy as part of for- eign policy must be actively promoted and gain broad support. More weight should be given to this aspect of foreign policy in future. As a semi- direct democracy, scepticism towards politics and globalisation is less evident in Swiss society than in other Western countries. But a sense of unease can be felt in our country too. People’s trust in foreign policy must be strengthened by linking for- eign and domestic policy more closely. AVIS28 describes four building blocks for linking foreign and domestic policy more closely: 3.2.1. Closer cooperation with Parliament and the cantons National legislation is increasingly being supple- mented by European and international forms of regulation. Foreign policy has a greater impact on legislation and domestic policy processes than was previously the case. Many norms negotiated at the global level can no longer be fundamentally altered at the national level. More soft law instruments are emerging in place of agreements under international law. These qua- si-legal instruments are referred to as ‘soft’ as they have no binding force under international law. They are easier to negotiate and can help maintain an international framework of rules and norms in the face of political stalemates. However, they are not generally put before national parliaments for approval. This development has sparked debate in a domestic policy context about roles and respon- sibilities. If Switzerland is to represent its interests effectively, it must present a united front. To achieve this, the Confederation must collaborate with Parliament and the cantons on foreign policy matters on the basis of trust. The foundations for such a relation- ship appear to be intact: the rights of Parliament and the cantons to participate in foreign policy decisions have been expanded since the 1990s. The Federal Council is thus obliged to consult the foreign affairs committees on important plans. The cantons can ask to be consulted on the preparation of foreign policy decisions, and the federal govern- ment can choose to consult them of its own accord. Furthermore, the cantons often form part of the Confederation’s negotiation delegations, especially with respect to matters of European policy. Nevertheless, action is required, even though the basic situations differ. On the one hand, there is no longer a sense of clearly defined cooperation between the Federal Council and Parliament on foreign policy. The latter bemoans its loss of con- trol and lack of involvement, while the former feels its powers in foreign policy matters are increas- ingly being called into question. In the Federal Council’s view, the growing number of parliamen- tary interventions constitute undue interference in its foreign policy. On the other hand, relations between the Confederation and the cantons are comparatively more stable. The question to be discussed here is whether participatory federalism should be extended, given the increasing influence of EU law on national legislation. If Parliament and the cantons are to cooperate more closely with the Federal Council, this must happen without restricting the latter’s capacity to act. In 2028, the power to make foreign policy must continue to lie, first and foremost, with the government. The formal definition of responsibil- ities for foreign policy should remain unchanged and serve as the basis for cooperation. What measures are needed to consolidate a shared understanding of the foreign policy roles of the Federal Council and Parliament? An important first step would be to improve the way in which the existing rules are implemented. In other words, the government must be made more aware of Parliament’s rights to participate in shaping foreign policy. At the same time, Par- liament’s involvement should concentrate on stra- tegic aspects. The government must enjoy more freedom again when it comes to the operations management side of foreign policy. The vision By 2028, foreign and domestic policy will be closely linked. Swiss foreign policy will have a broad domestic support base as it meets the expectations of the general public. It will be based on continuous dialogue and a whole-of- Switzerland approach. Foreign policy will have a fixed place on the Federal Council’s agenda. The latter will determine the direction of foreign policy, in close consultation with Parliament and the cantons, and with clearly defined responsibilities. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 20 However, there is also a need to define Parliament’s participation rights more precisely. This applies especially to soft law. The first point that should be clarified is the content of this policy instrument and how it is delineated from other instruments. Second, it must be decided which soft law agree- ments the committees are to be consulted on and in which form. Given the number of agreements of this kind, Parliament will have to restrict itself to the most significant cases. The challenge will lie in assessing what qualifies as ‘significant’. In addition to defining participation rights more precisely, the Federal Council should advocate in the international arena for parliamentarians to be given a greater role in shaping soft law within international organisations. The OECD consulta- tion mechanisms and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the OSCE can serve as models here. In the case of the cantons, there is a need to clarify the extent of their rights to participate in shaping foreign policy. The division of roles is undisputed and the participation processes are well established. The cantons are demanding to be consulted more frequently on European policy matters, and at an earlier stage: receiving compre- hensive information would enable them to play a greater role in shaping the Swiss agenda on Euro- pean policy. The cantons would like to see their concerns taken into account more systematically in the preparations for treaty negotiations. The cantons are proposing that any loss of auton- omy occasioned by the agreements with the EU be compensated by according greater weight to their own positions. This would allow the federalist state structure to be preserved. In the case of European policy plans that touch on their powers, the cantons believe their consolidated opinions should now be con- sidered ‘legally binding inter pares’ (in German: ‘relative Bildungswirkung’). This means that the Federal Council would only be able to deviate from the agreed position if there were overriding foreign policy interests for doing so. It would also have to set down its reasons in writing. Lastly, cantonal representatives are calling for the exist- ing mechanism through which the cantons discuss European policy with the federal government to be developed into a more formalised joint coordi- nation body. The Confederation and the cantons aim to main- tain their well-functioning partnership on foreign policy. A joint analysis should determine whether the opportunities for the cantons to have a say need to be adapted. It should be added that there is no adequate legal basis for foreign policy at present. There is no framework act for foreign policy, and the Federal Act on Development Cooperation is outdated.

Now is the time to review whether new legal bases that reflect the growing importance of foreign policy will be required for the future. 3.2.2. Expanding the dialogue on foreign policy Looking beyond Parliament and the cantons, for- eign policy must gain broader support among the general public. A national dialogue on foreign pol- icy and Switzerland’s interests is desirable. A cit- izen-centred foreign policy that enables ordinary people to seize the opportunities presented by rapid change is a fundamental cornerstone of the Switzerland of tomorrow. Greater use should be made of relevant com- petencies and networks outside of the Federal Administration in achieving foreign policy goals. The FDFA should pursue a whole-of-Switzer- land approach. Cooperation with Swiss NGOs is already well established and important. These organisations play a major role in realising inter- national cooperation goals. However, the partner- ships could benefit from an even clearer strategic direction inspired by the 2030 Agenda. The new SDC strategy for cooperation with Swiss NGOs provides a good basis from which to start. The FDFA also maintains regular contact with sci- entific institutions and think tanks. This could be stepped up: shared expertise strengthens Switzer- land’s capacity to act in a foreign policy context. The Swiss Institute of International Studies (SIAF) was set up back in 1943, with the aim of providing “qualified guidance in difficult times”. The Federal Council was one of the driving forces behind this decision. With the three Geneva Centres and sev- eral other centres of excellence in peace, security, European and economic policy issues, Switzerland now has a wealth of expertise in global matters at its disposal. Much could be done to build on cooperation with the Swiss business world too, whose competencies, contact networks and local knowledge could be of great benefit in shaping and implementing foreign policy (chapter 3.3). Citizens’ forums attended by diplomats could make a significant contribution to bring- ing foreign and domestic policy closer together. Switzerland’s representatives around the world work in an environment which is sometimes far removed from ‘everyday life at home’. It is important for them to remain in touch with the debates and finer feelings regarding domestic policy. At the same time, the general public is not necessarily all that familiar with foreign poli- cy. People in Switzerland should get to know the Federal Council’s foreign policy priorities better. The opportunity to exchange views directly with Swiss diplomats stationed around the globe will boost interest in foreign policy and encourage greater awareness on both sides. Organising a ‘Tour de Suisse’ of community halls could spark genuine debate on current foreign policy issues from Geneva to Appenzell. Another option would be to put more foreign policy matters out to consultation. Consulta- tion procedures offer all stakeholders the opportu- nity to state their position and viewpoints early in the decision-making process. This instrument has seldom been used in relation to foreign policy thus far. Doing so in future would allow the Federal Council to generate broader domestic support for its foreign policy at an earlier stage. Conducting periodic surveys on foreign policy – using social media, among other things – could also help take the pulse of the people. 3.2.3. The Federal Council preserving the lead in foreign policy Today, federal councillors have little time to spend on foreign policy and visits abroad, even though international regulation is becoming increasing- ly important in every department. Switzerland’s political system is geared towards domestic policy. Improvements are possible without having to fun- damentally reform the system. However, paying more attention to public opinion at home must not cause the Federal Council to relinquish its lead role in foreign policy. It should attach greater weight to foreign policy issues at its meetings, and ensuring that suffi- cient time is set aside to deal with these issues will become even more important in future. The Fed- eral Council could increase its strategic scope for decision-making by holding more special closed sessions on foreign policy topics while at the same time reaffirming its claim to leadership. The Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy for the legislative periods should set a clear direc- tion and be implemented consistently. To date, these strategies have not had sufficient impact on the practical work of the Federal Administra- tion. In addition, the wider public has barely been aware of them. The strategic bases of the Federal Council’s for- eign policy should serve as actual mandates that 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 22 improve the convergence between Swiss foreign and domestic policy. Clear goals and measures are required. 3.2.4. Communication is integral to foreign policy Communication is essential in linking foreign and domestic policy more closely. It not only consti- tutes a form of management support, but can also serve as a strategic foreign policy instrument. On the one hand, the task is to create a broader domestic support base for foreign policy by com- municating and explaining it in an easy-to-under- stand manner. On the other, communication is growing in impor- tance as a means of safeguarding foreign policy interests. How Switzerland is seen by the rest of the world has an impact on its opportunities for action and its attractiveness as a place to live and do business. Given the global competition between states, Switzerland must actively shape the way in which it is perceived abroad. It must not allow its image to be determined by actors seek- ing to create advantages for themselves according to their own interests and agenda. Consequently, communication must be more closely linked to content. Switzerland must develop key messages and strategic narratives for the relevant dossiers and communicate them whenever it has the opportunity. Targeted mar- keting is one way of supporting foreign policy by influencing how Switzerland is seen abroad. The majority of new communication instruments and arenas are digital. They should be used sys- tematically as an effective means of conveying the key messages of foreign and domestic policy to the relevant target groups. This is an area in which government politics lags behind. Non-state actors use digital communication to increase their power to define topics and thus boost their political influ- ence. Completely new political marketing instru- ments have emerged in the digital sphere, such as collecting signatures over the internet or crowd- sourced lobbying. This refers to the sending of a vast number of emails from members of the public to members of Parliament, for instance, and marks the beginning of a new political trend. Social media open up opportunities for foreign policy. But they also decentralise communication, which can be challenging for an organisation like the FDFA. A clear definition of responsibilities and powers is required, and employees must be given more training. Lastly, communication plays a key role in protect- ing against disinformation. Although Switzer- land clearly does not require a Ministry of Truth, it should nevertheless counter fake news with effec- tive, fact-based information. At the same time, the education of tomorrow will also mean helping citizens to exercise and preserve their digital sov- ereignty. 3.3. A greater focus on the needs of citizens and businesses Foreign policy should put citizens first and pro- mote economic interests to a greater extent than before. The support of citizens and the Swiss busi- ness community must become a core element of foreign policy. Services for citizens are an established area of foreign policy, and one that is appreciated by the public. The challenge here is to adapt the services on offer to changing needs and to keep up with rising expectations. Switzerland’s foreign policy has room for improve- ment when it comes to supporting foreign trade interests. Considerable opportunities for entering into win-win cooperation agreements will open up in this area. However, placing greater emphasis on economic issues should not detract from other FDFA priorities such a peace, security and develop- ment. On the contrary – it could lend them new dynamism. The vision Services for Swiss citizens and close cooperation with Swiss businesses are recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy in 2028. Both target groups will receive unbureaucratic help, more and more delivered through digital channels. Foreign policy and trade policy will operate as a homogeneous whole. Market access, legal certainty and protecting the investments of Swiss companies are priority foreign policy commitments. At the same time, the private sector is an active partner in addressing sustainable development and climate change mitigation. 23 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 3.3. A greater focus on the needs of citizens and businesses Foreign policy should put citizens first and pro- mote economic interests to a greater extent than before. The support of citizens and the Swiss busi- ness community must become a core element of foreign policy. Services for citizens are an established area of foreign policy, and one that is appreciated by the public. The challenge here is to adapt the services on offer to changing needs and to keep up with rising expectations. Switzerland’s foreign policy has room for improve- ment when it comes to supporting foreign trade interests. Considerable opportunities for entering into win-win cooperation agreements will open up in this area. However, placing greater emphasis on economic issues should not detract from other FDFA priorities such a peace, security and develop- ment. On the contrary – it could lend them new dynamism. Looking forward to 2028, the following three building blocks create a suitable foundation: 3.3.1. Tailored services abroad There are over 760,000 Swiss nationals living abroad, and the trend is rising. Foreign travel is also increasing. Whereas the Swiss made 11.5 mil- lion trips abroad in 2012, that number had risen to more than 15.5 million in 2017. Providing support to Swiss nationals residing abroad and travellers in need is one of the basic tasks of foreign policy. Any Swiss citizen requir- ing help in an emergency situation will receive consular protection. Thus, for example, Swiss representations will advise the relatives of people who have gone missing or been kidnapped. This area of foreign policy will see many changes in the coming years. New technologies will open the way to greater efficiency and better services that are more in touch with citizens’ needs. The result: a more personal form of support, and bundled consular services. A considerable number of consular functions involve standardised work processes. Intelligent machines can reduce the workload of employees and boost service effi- ciency. Providing a range of digital consular ser- vices will create a one-stop shop where customer needs can be addressed quickly and straightfor- wardly. Using AI-supported solutions would allow Switzerland to deliver a tailored service to its citi- zens abroad in future – both remotely and locally. Consular activities could be linked more closely with other areas of foreign policy. Digital transformation creates new potential for Switzerland to market its consular activities. Regional communities of Swiss abroad can be addressed more specifically through digital chan- nels. They can be made more aware of Switzer- land’s position on European policy issues or other international topics. The vision Services for Swiss citizens and close cooperation with Swiss businesses are recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy in 2028. Both target groups will receive unbureaucratic help, more and more delivered through digital channels. Foreign policy and trade policy will operate as a homogeneous whole. Market access, legal certainty and protecting the investments of Swiss companies are priority foreign policy commitments. At the same time, the private sector is an active partner in addressing sustainable development and climate change mitigation. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 24 3.3.2. Foreign policy is also foreign economic policy Switzerland generates more than of half of its GDP abroad. Since 1995, its trade-to-GDP ratio – i.e. the sum of exports and imports measured as a share of gross domestic product – has risen from 69% to over 90%. In addition to multinationals, two-thirds of Swiss SMEs also operate internationally. Of the 5,000 Swiss companies with fixed places of business abroad, 4,000 are SMEs. Swiss compa- nies have created two million jobs abroad through direct investment. Three quarters of all Swiss employees work for companies involved in inter- national trade. The Swiss export industry contributes significantly to Switzerland’s prosperity. In some cases, techno- logical upheaval and growing geopolitical tension present it with major challenges: competition is fiercer than ever and market access more difficult. In future, the Swiss economy will no longer have the same exclusive access to the innovations and technology developments on which its success is based. Currency risks must be added to this scenario. The euro has fallen by more than 30% in value against the Swiss franc since it was first introduced. A scenario in which the two currencies reach pari- ty cannot be ruled out. The extent to which cen- tral banks will still be able to intervene in future remains uncertain. Great-power rivalries are also having an effect on currency movements. Russia and China are calling the US dollar into question as a reserve currency and have reduced their purchas- es of US Treasuries. Experts doubt that Switzerland would be able to handle a further exchange rate shock as well as it did in 2015. Commitment to a successful Swiss export industry should be put back at the heart of Swiss foreign policy. It is true that this topic has always been part of foreign policy and that the external network plays an important role in this respect. Nevertheless, the FDFA should attach greater importance to promoting foreign trade interests and should coordinate closely with the other competent agencies in doing so. Despite the administrative lines that separate them, foreign and trade policy should be thought of as one. The whole-of-government approach that has proven its worth in migration and health policy points the way forward. More market access, more legal certainty and proper protection for innovations are topics that should be placed high up on the bilateral and mul- tilateral foreign policy agenda. Air transport con- nections are another factor of importance to the Swiss economy. The agendas being set by international organ- isations are becoming more important. This is especially true in relation to issues such as cli- mate change that cut across countries and remits. Although these topics are not being addressed by trade organisations, they are relevant to global trade and have the ability to distort it. Stepping up foreign policy engagement in this area will only be successful, however, if Switzerland develops a common agenda for its export and domestic econ- omies. That way, trade-offs between further free 3 .19 2 .8 7 2. 77 1 .5 2 1. 06 0. 57 0. 42 0. 40 0 .3 3 0. 29 200,000 150, 000 100,000 50,000 0 Fr an ce Ge rm an y US A Ita ly Ca na da UK Au st ra lia Sp ai n Is ra el Au st ria Top ten: Swiss abroad 2017 Swiss nationals living abroad Number of persons 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 Fr an ce Ita ly Ge rm an y Sp ai n Au st ria UK Po rt ug al Ne th er la nd s US A Gr ee ce Travel destinations Number of overnight stays in million 19 6, 30 0 | 2 6. 1% 8 8, 60 0 | 1 1.8 % 7 9, 90 0 | 1 0. 6% 49 ,6 00 | 6. 6% 3 9, 70 0 | 5 .3 % 35 ,0 00 |  4. 7% 24 ,9 00 |  3. 3% 2 3, 50 0 | 3 .1% 19 ,9 00 |  2. 6% 16 ,2 00 |  2. 2% Source: Swiss Federal Statistical Office Top ten: Swiss abroad 2017 25 2028 Foreign Policy Vision trade agreements and agricultural policy could be reduced. As well as becoming more important, Swiss export promotion still has improvement poten- tial. A large number of actors are currently involved in delivering support to Swiss businesses abroad: Switzerland Global Enterprise with its Swiss Busi- ness Hubs in over 20 target markets, bilateral chambers of commerce, cantonal economic pro- motion bodies, Swissnex, Switzerland Tourism and Switzerland’s diplomats. However, there is neither a global strategy nor any form of global branding in place. Creating a syner- getic platform would allow the business commu- nity to satisfy all its needs for information, advi- sory and support services in foreign markets via one central point of contact. The Swedish model is a source of inspiration: Business Sweden runs 50 offices in 4 priority regions and offers a wide range of services in 7 priority export areas. 3.3.3. Swiss business as a partner for the 2030 Agenda and climate change mitigation Any form of foreign policy partnership with the business community cannot be a one-way street. Increasing the promotion of foreign trade interests cannot be the sole objective. It would also be in the economy’s interest for Swiss companies to make a greater contribution to implementing the Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy. Business representatives should be more involved in foreign policy discussions, as they were in the past. The divide between business and politics that opened up in the wake of the financial crisis must be closed again. Swiss businesses could play a greater role in the country’s international cooperation activities. Thus far, the focus has been on financing solutions for public-private partnerships and guidelines for doing business in a way that respects human rights. The goal should now be to create a gen- uine partnership drawing on private-sector expertise through which joint projects are realised. This also forms part of the 2030 Agen- da. The ability of the private sector to create new markets and scalable innovations will help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (chapter 3.4). Partnership between the state and the business community is especially important in relation to climate and environmental issues. There is a grow- ing need for action on both sides that calls for joint solutions: foreign policy should help establish a global framework of action which permits inter- nationally agreed rules and implementation mech- anisms to be adopted and creates general condi- tions conducive to innovation, thus leaving room for entrepreneurial solutions. The international environmental regime must become more coher- ent, effective and efficient. When implementing the Paris Agreement, it is essential that we comply with the transparency rules and promote a green economy. The marketplace for emissions trading should be internationalised and include countries outside Europe. Switzerland can do more to help developing countries carry out climate and envi- ronmental measures. As for the business community, it has a duty to make better use of resources and generate few- er emissions, and to push ahead in finding entre- preneurial solutions to environmental and cli- mate problems. In addition to the real economy, the financial sector should also make more of a contribution to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development. Sustainable finance, which integrates environmental, social and governance criteria into financing and invest- ment decisions, improves the chances of achieving the 2030 Agenda. As a financial hub, Switzerland could play a leading role here. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 26 3.4. Leveraging Swiss soft power for a more peaceful and stable world The commitment to sustainable development, peace and security and a rules-based international order will remain a priority for Swiss foreign poli- cy. The need for international action is great, and Switzerland has much to offer. Guided by its com- prehensive understanding of security, it makes high-quality contributions geared towards the long term and pursues a complementary foreign and security policy. By working towards a more peaceful and stable world, Switzerland is investing in its own prosper- ity, security and independence. This commitment gives its foreign policy greater impact and reso- nance. Switzerland’s engagement builds networks and goodwill for Swiss interests in other areas. Switzerland can create and shape more here than in other foreign policy fields, and is seen as a cred- ible and reliable partner in international cooper- ation. However, domestic political expectations mean that Switzerland needs to act in a more focused and efficient way in the future. For this reason, its efforts to promote a more peaceful and stable world must have stronger backing within society and dovetail more with its domestic policy con- cerns. In addition, individual instruments must be adapted in accordance with the global changes underway. The following building blocks will help to create a sustainable policy combining development cooper- ation, peacebuilding and security, as well as com- mitment to a rules-based international order: 3.4.1. The profile of development cooperation sharpened and anchored domestically In many ways, development cooperation is a major component of Swiss foreign policy, accounting for over half of the FDFA’s budget. Thanks to a strong international presence, it is an important element in Switzerland’s external relations, and projects the country’s values and image around the world. Properly deployed, it can achieve greater strategic impact than many other instruments. For a globalised economy such as Switzerland’s, sustainable development is a necessity. Precise- ly because of its relative weight, development cooperation, more than other instruments, needs political backing within Switzerland. Measures will take time to implement, but they will make Swiss development cooperation more agile in its imple- mentation of the 2030 Agenda. The vision Swiss foreign policy in 2028 will leverage its core strengths to build a more peaceful and stable world. Development cooperation will be focused, with a broad domestic support base, and will attach strategic importance to reducing migratory pressure. Switzerland will help to foster economic development in close cooperation with the private sector and other partners. It will create jobs and improve prospects in target countries, relay Swiss know-how on governance, education and environmental issues, and find innovative solutions to reduce poverty. Swiss expertise in peacebuilding will be much sought after in 2028. Peacebuilding will be backed by a clear strategy, broad-based political support and attractive packages of good offices. Switzerland will be able to respond quickly and flexibly to requests for its good offices. Important peace negotiations will take place in Switzerland or with Switzerland as an intermediary. Peacebuilding efforts and development cooperation will be closely coordinated. In 2028, Switzerland will adopt effective initiatives promoting results-oriented multilateralism in order to bolster the rules-based international order. It will work, both offline and online, to foster respect for international law and human rights. Switzerland will set international benchmarks by involving companies in the promotion of human rights and the development of global standards. International Geneva will be a leading and innovative centre of governance, a place that shapes the digital transformation. 27 2028 Foreign Policy Vision Development cooperation – high-profile, interest-led and focused Development cooperation is both an expression of Switzerland’s solidarity and part of its interest-driv- en policy approach. Establishing clear links between development cooperation and Switzerland’s own interests will help to boost domestic political accept- ance of the former. The principle that development cooperation is a foreign policy instrument should be given greater emphasis. This will require action at the FDFA head office, in terms of communication and on the actual form of development coopera- tion. The stronger focus on geographical and themat- ic priorities is an important step towards making development cooperation even more effective and giving it greater political support within Switzer- land. In 2016/17, the 20 countries that benefited most from Swiss bilateral development assistance accounted for 24% of total development assistance expenditure. This percentage should be significantly higher in 2028. Bilateral development cooperation should focus on regions whose political and eco- nomic stabilisation creates maximum leverage for the countries concerned, as well as for Switzerland. Priority consideration should be given to Europe’s southern and eastern neighbourhoods, namely Afri- ca, the Middle East, the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe. In these focus regions, Switzerland’s securi- ty, economic and migration interests converge. The prosperity gap between Africa and Western Europe must be reduced in a sustainable way. Finally, the prospects for people in crisis-hit regions of the Mid- dle East should be improved. Greater weight on economic development The private sector creates 90% of all jobs world- wide and plays a crucial role in tackling poverty. Sustainable economic growth is the best way to reduce poverty. There is no magic formula for achieving this, but a key ingredient is promoting local entrepreneurship and innovation. Switzerland should focus more on sustainable local economic ecosystems by working with international companies and NGOs and engaging closely with the state-owned Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM), which aims to give local SMEs access to capital and exper- tise. As an umbrella fund, SIFEM invests primarily in other funds. Another model worth exploring for Switzerland is that of the Dutch development bank FMO, which invests directly in the private sector in 85 developing countries and emerging markets, mainly in infrastructure, microfinance and sustainability. The aim of such public invest- ment is to enable, rather than to replace, private investment. SIFEM’s capital base is small by inter- national standards. It would need to be increased as the fund develops. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1950 1965 1980 1995 2010 2025 2040 2055 2070 2085 2100 Africa Asia Europe Latin America and the Caribbean Forecast share of world total of working age population (15–64) by region (percentage) Africa needs jobs Source: UNCTAD Economic Development in Africa Report 2018 Africa needs jobs 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 28 As well as agile entrepreneurship, sustainable growth also requires the right framework condi- tions. There is need in many cases to modernise governance structures and promote good gov- ernance, as functioning state institutions and the rule of law are prerequisites for economic devel- opment. To achieve this goal, it will sometimes be necessary to work with corrupt regimes and state administrations, unsatisfactory though this is. In the choice of priority areas, greater emphasis should be placed on countries where growth and its effects can spill over into neighbouring coun- tries. Swiss business interests will act as a leading indicator in this regard. In Africa, for example, Angola, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa are con- sidered potential drivers of economic growth. Rather than comprehensive development cooper- ation programmes, these countries tend to need ad hoc assistance with combating corruption and money laundering as well as with better legisla- tion, investment protection, justice and tax policy. Step up cooperation with Swiss companies It is not only large corporations that should be looking to the African continent. Swiss SMEs can play a key role in promoting local entrepreneurship as a driver of development. Private investment in Africa is key. The federal government should do more to foster and safeguard this investment by further developing tools and instruments such as start-up support and high-quality advisory ser- vices, provided for example by Swiss representa- tions in the countries concerned. New forms of cooperation and interaction between governmental and non-governmental actors are needed, going beyond private sector funding of development cooperation activities. An indicator of this is the transfer of expertise by the private sector, for economic development requires input from professionals with the rele- vant practical experience. One approach would be to create a pool of experts from the private sector, the federal government and cantons, deployed on missions lasting several months, along the lines of the peacebuilding and Swiss Humanitarian Aid corps. Build on Swiss strengths: governance, education, environment, innovation International development cooperation is chang- ing. Some donor countries, such as China and the Gulf States, have a different development philos- ophy from Switzerland. A clear profile is therefore all the more important: Switzerland needs to focus on strengths that are embedded in its own political system but which also confer added value globally. In other words, it has to harness its soft power. Switzerland’s core strengths will be increasingly in demand internationally. Switzerland has strengths in the following areas: • Governance: this is often where the greatest barriers to development lie. Switzerland has experience and credibility when it comes to the rule of law, good governance, human rights, proximity to citizens and subsidiarity. • Education: Switzerland’s experience with educa- tion at all levels, and especially with vocational skills development, can improve the prospects of young people in developing countries and emerging economies. Education is becoming more important than ever for economic devel- opment. • Environment and climate change: the need for expertise to reduce emissions and pollution and use natural resources more efficiently will increase. For example, technical assistance and investment will be needed to enable develop- ing countries to generate energy for electricity, heating and cooling in a cleaner, more efficient and sustainable way. The Swiss cleantech indus- try can help to deliver solutions here. Expertise in coping with more frequent and intense natu- ral disasters and dealing with major challenges in water supply will be increasingly sought after. However, the way in which Switzerland does development cooperation is also a key aspect of its profile. Its capacity for innovation is an asset that deserves to be made more of: • Firstly, the international programmes through which Switzerland helps to address global chal- lenges are pioneering, as in areas such as food security and health. Swiss know-how and resourc- es may be instrumental in the development of innovative global solutions. • Secondly, according to the OECD, Switzerland is characterised by innovative partnerships and financing models, as well as the flexibility to adapt programmes as needed. 29 2028 Foreign Policy Vision • Thirdly, Switzerland could help to boost the effec- tiveness of development cooperation by means of new technologies. For example, artificial intel- ligence (AI) could improve the early detection of negative trends and thus strengthen prevention. Switzerland could help developing countries to harness the opportunities offered by the digital transformation while reducing the associated risks (see section 3.5). Focus on tackling causes in Swiss foreign policy on migration Switzerland needs safe and regular labour migra- tion to maintain its prosperity. However, it also has every interest in preventing irregular migration. This can only be achieved through multilateral efforts and bilateral engagement. The strategic linking of development cooperation and migration policy should be put into practice systematically. Switzerland will remain true to its development approach. While many countries, under heavy political pressure, are opting to channel their development funds into short-term security solu- tions designed to tackle unwanted immigration, Switzerland should continue to pursue a foreign policy on migration that is both holistic in its impact and geared towards the long term. Within this context, Switzerland should invest even more heavily in addressing the causes of migration as a means of preventing it. First and foremost, this means working in regions of origin to improve the economic, social and political prospects of people there. Protecting and looking after refu- gees and migrants in the places where they are should be a priority. Where there is no foreseeable prospect of return, Switzerland should promote the economic self-reliance of people in countries of first refuge. It can assist displaced persons with repatriation and help them to rebuild their lives after returning to their countries of origin, as well as helping countries of origin and transit to put in place migration policies. Bilateral migration part- nerships should be expanded. A key factor in foreign policy on migration is demographics. In Africa, lowering the birth rate is vital to secure significantly greater prosperity for the population. Among other things, this requires specific preventive education to improve family planning and an overall rise in education levels for the entire population. The current literacy rate is stagnating at just over 60%. Forge close links between development cooperation and humanitarian aid Humanitarian aid plays a key role in ensuring the stability needed to create prospects for displaced persons in the places where they find themselves, usually regions of countries of first refuge which adjoin the crisis-hit areas. Development coopera- tion and humanitarian aid must engage with each other more closely and on a continuous basis. In protracted crises, it becomes impossible to divide up the needs of the population according to dif- ferent international cooperation instruments. An integrated approach is needed, aimed at free- ing people from their dependence on emergency relief. Humanitarian aid can help to create better long-term prospects for the population so that they no longer have to rely on emergency relief. Conversely, development cooperation, which Less than 0 0 to less than 50 50 to less than 100 100 to less than 150 150 and over Source: Berlin Institute for Population and Development Based on data from: UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population development 2015–60 Percentage 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 30 is geared towards long-term impact, needs to become more operationally flexible so that it can respond appropriately to rapidly changing con- texts. Switzerland’s humanitarian tradition is integral to its good reputation, and a distinct profile and uni- versal approach will help to ensure that it remains a credible humanitarian actor in the future. The country has soft power and internationally recog- nised expertise in the form of the Swiss Humani- tarian Aid Unit. Regarding the future direction of Swiss Humani- tarian Aid, it should be borne in mind that coun- tries affected by natural disasters are making few- er appeals for international assistance. Thanks in part to Swiss support, many countries now have their own structures to deal with such crises inde- pendently. Indeed, the last time that Swiss Res- cue responded to an earthquake was in 2009. The question of whether Swiss Humanitarian Aid should undertake more direct action needs to be examined. Such action is exemplified by the aid convoys that it has been organising successfully in Ukraine for some years. The need is there – not least in Africa. At the same time, Switzerland is well placed to make humanitarian aid more effi- cient by harnessing the potential of digitalisation. The ICRC, its most important humanitarian part- ner, is a pioneer and a source of inspiration in this area. Maintain flexibility and a willingness to take risks Partly because of its financial weight, develop- ment cooperation has been in the political spot- light of late. Striking a balance between accounta- bility and operational freedom is vital. Too tight a bureaucratic straitjacket would make development cooperation actors unwilling to take risks in dif- ficult and fragile contexts, yet the ability to take such risks is essential. It should be possible to try out new approaches, for example on strengthen- ing ownership by the local population or promot- ing the rights of entrepreneurs. 3.4.2. Switzerland’s good offices modernised and optimally positioned Civilian peacebuilding enjoys widespread support in Switzerland, and is part of the country’s foreign policy DNA. By contributing to conflict prevention and management, Switzerland enhances its own security. Through its good offices, Switzerland also strengthens its political contacts with senior officials in the countries concerned. While demand for mediation by independent third parties is likely to increase by 2028, there are two reasons why Switzerland, despite its excellent rep- utation as a promoter of peace, cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Firstly, peacebuilding has become more challeng- ing. Many conflicts are extremely complex, with some involving ten or more parties, each with widely differing interests, diffuse structures and opaque chains of responsibility. The causes of con- flict have also become more complicated and the forms of conflict more varied. Furthermore, the global political environment is making conflicts harder to resolve. Secondly, peacebuilding is becoming increasingly fragmented and the number of potential media- tors is growing. More and more European coun- tries are positioning themselves as mediators, with more non-Western players also vying for conten- tion. In a competitive market for good offices, Switzerland has to affirm its credentials and adapt its offer accordingly. Guiding principle: build peace from the bottom up, leveraging Swiss strengths As a result of political stalemates, the number of major peace processes involving comprehensive peace agreements is likely to decline. In many cas- es, peacebuilding activities will shift to the local level and focus on certain aspects of a conflict, with peace being built on more of a step-by-step basis. This kind of bottom-up principle is ideal- ly suited to Switzerland, the holistic, long-term approach to promoting peace reflecting its own functioning as a state and as a society. The promotion of dialogue, power sharing and the involvement of all interests are increasingly important factors in peacebuilding. Facilitating local dialogue processes involving different social groups should remain part of Switzerland’s peace policy. Supporting women and young people in conflicts and involving them in prevention and 31 2028 Foreign Policy Vision peace processes can help to unleash new social dynamics. Swiss expertise will remain in demand, for example on constitutional issues, dealing with the past and fighting impunity for war crimes. Give peacebuilding a stronger political profile In the future, simply offering standard mediation services will no longer be sufficient. Such mandates require political investment. While preserving the discretion that is highly prized internationally, Swit- zerland should also try to be more politically active in obtaining mandates. This is the only way that it will hold on to its reputation as a leading play- er in mediation processes, alongside its bottom-up peacebuilding work. Achieving this will require political commitment, a willingness to take risks and a clear strategy. An attractive package of services and an involvement on substantive issues are also important. In addition to International Geneva, other locations could offer the privacy and seclusion that parties in mediation processes often say they need. Swiss peace specialists promote peace policy efforts and build up relationships of trust with conflict par- ties. Where required, it should be possible to deploy teams with the necessary expertise at short notice, headed up by experienced diplomats and/or medi- ators. More special envoys, for specific conflicts or issues such as water diplomacy, would give greater political clout to efforts in this area. If its application is successful, Switzerland’s mem- bership of the UN Security Council will raise its pro- file in the domain of peace policy by emphasising Swiss soft power both internationally and domes- tically. It will give Switzerland, as a credible and pragmatic player, the opportunity to build bridges and will also have a positive impact on Geneva in particular. Intensive discussions with member states – including those with veto powers – will provide Switzerland with an important additional platform for safeguarding its interests bilaterally. Good offices: look to the future while holding on to tradition The increase in tensions between states is leading to a revival of interest in traditional forms of good offices. These include protecting power mandates as well as trust-building measures such as those developed during the Cold War with substantial Swiss input.

For example, the basic concept of good offices should become an integral part of a new foreign policy on technology (see section 3.5). It could also be applied to the business arena. Dispute settlement mechanisms in the commercial sector are becom- ing increasingly ineffective due to the fragment- ed nature of legal systems. Swiss mediation in economic and trade disputes would represent a sensible addition to the good offices provided by Switzerland. Indeed, there are already examples of this in practice, as in the context of the Georgia crisis, where Switzerland brokered an agreement between Russia and Georgia governing customs administration and the monitoring of trade in goods. Harness expertise and practical knowledge for peacebuilding Conflict resolution à la suisse should become a brand that can be deployed even without direct Swiss involvement. The courses launched by ETH Zurich and the FDFA to train international and Swiss mediators are one part of this approach. Another idea would be a Swiss ‘manual’ setting out practical peacebuilding measures. Bilateral mediation dialogues, including with non-Western countries, should be expanded. Switzerland at the interface between peace and development The 2030 Agenda recognises that peace and sus- tainable development are mutually dependent. In Switzerland, peacebuilding and development cooperation are already closely linked in the con- text of international cooperation, thanks to com- mon reference documents and regional strategies. However, the potential of international coopera- tion could be further maximised at an operational level. Switzerland’s water diplomacy activities illustrate what it can achieve at the interface between peace and development. Now a global brand, Blue Peace sees Switzerland working in the Middle East and Central Asia to transform water from a possible cause of conflict into a driving force for cooperation and peace. Such approaches to con- flict prevention have great potential . 3.4.3. Building bridges to consolidate a rules-based international order Binding rules applying to large and small countries alike are the prerequisite for peaceful coexistence within the international community. Switzerland is dependent on a rules-based order for its pros- perity, security and independence. Effective mul- tilateralism is an integral part of this. Today, it is easy to forget the huge benefits that Switzerland derived from the international order established after 1945. These benefits should be the subject of renewed focus and communicated accordingly. In our politically fragmented world, multilateral action is becoming more challenging but also more important. With power distributed more widely between countries in all parts of the world, there are growing divergences in interests and values. The current changes in multilateralism are ultimately the expression of a crisis of con- fidence in globalisation. These changes have affected all international organisations, albeit in different ways. Heavily value-based organisations such as the Council of Europe are increasingly sub- ject to centrifugal interests, whereas organisations like the UN, which act more as platforms for bal- ancing interests, are proving to be more stable. Switzerland should continue to advocate tireless- ly for multilateral solutions and an international order based on the rule of law. There is a growing need for mediators that can conciliate between competing interests. With its stable set of values and its focus on practical compromise solutions, Switzerland is well placed to build bridges. Promote multilateral organisations‘ ability to act Multilateralism is in need of reform to reduce bureaucracy, boost efficiency and improve out- comes. One area for improvement is the way that organisations reach joint decisions between their member states. The operational performance of some organisations also needs to be enhanced. Switzerland, together with partners, should sub- mit reform proposals in both these areas. Its strong multilateral engagement means that it can contribute credibly to these discussions. The UN, with its universal membership and legiti- macy, is an important instrument for safeguarding Swiss interests. At the economic level, Switzerland should seek to be included in the G20 as a per- manent invitee, like Spain and Singapore. Discus- sions at this forum encompass a range of Swiss interests, not only financial ones. In Europe, the 33 2028 Foreign Policy Vision OSCE and the Council of Europe remain particular- ly important. At the same time, Switzerland should continue its successful strategy of establishing for- mal relations with non-European regional organi- sations such as the African Union and ASEAN in order to ensure more broad-based support for its independent foreign policy. In the multilateral context as elsewhere, Swit- zerland must pay particular attention to security policy issues. The erosion of international arms control is making Europe less safe. In cyberspace and in the field of artificial intelligence, rules are needed to prevent an arms race. Similarly, conflict prevention can only succeed if it is underpinned by multilateral agreements. Last but not least, Swit- zerland’s multilateral engagement should be more firmly rooted in domestic policy. Geneva as a laboratory for reformed multilateralism Over the past 100 years, Switzerland has succeed- ed in making Geneva one of the world’s leading centres of international governance, where count- less decisions are taken that improve the lives of millions of people. This focus on operational action is one of Geneva’s strengths. For Swiss foreign pol- icy, Geneva offers a unique network of contacts that could be even more systematically utilised. In addition, International Geneva is a source of prosperity, accounting for more than 10% of can- tonal GDP. The benefits for the country as a whole far outweigh the costs. The International Geneva brand, and indeed multilateralism itself, should feature more prominently in domestic politics. To help it achieve critical mass, International Gene- va should also become more broadly based within the surrounding area, with the Lake Geneva and French border regions more closely integrated. This will require political commitment by Swiss pol- iticians and the development of a forward-looking host state strategy. Geneva’s unique assets, including its diversity of actors, together with the neutrality and credibility of Switzerland as a whole provide ideal conditions for positioning Geneva favourably for the future. This is all the more important given the mounting global competition for dialogue and regulation ‘hubs’. Geneva will be able to stand out from this com- petition by establishing itself as a leading centre for innovative forms of governance. These have qualities that go beyond intergovernmental coop- eration as it currently exists, promoting the emer- gence of dynamic ecosystems involving a wide range of actors and helping to develop solutions on important future issues such as digitalisation. Defend international law and apply it in new areas International law is a life insurance policy for Swit- zerland. The country should therefore prioritise better compliance with existing obligations, espe- cially in the area of international humanitarian law, which is coming under increasing pressure. In new fields such as digital transformation, legal instruments must be clarified and adapted to the new realities (see section 3.5). Switzerland should be at the forefront of these efforts. The same goes GDP 11.3% GDP 1% =14% of jobs in the canton of Geneva 30,000 indirect and induced jobs = 4,000 employees = 177 states represented by a permanent mission 37 international organisations 20,000 employees = 2,700 employees = 400 NGOs = = > 3,300 meetings per year > 2,200 delegates 4,400 visits by heads of state, ministers and other senior officials International Geneva facts and figures (2018) Source: FDFA International Geneva facts and figures (2018) 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 34 for the application of international law in cyber- space. The final item on this to-do list is working out how to better involve non-state actors in inter- national agreements. In the area of soft law, Switzerland must ensure that it has the necessary expertise. Know-how in international dispute resolution should be expand- ed. Given the fragmented nature of the interna- tional trade system, Switzerland will become a party in disputes more frequently, with a grow- ing risk that countervailing measures will be taken against it or that it will be taken to court. Swit- zerland will thus need to assert its interests with equivalent means. Protect the rule of law, human rights and democracy The rule of law, human rights and democracy are three cornerstones of the current international order, enabling individual freedom and allow- ing people to live their lives in the way that they choose. But there is no guarantee that they will remain in place by 2028 given the number of countries now leaning towards the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Swiss efforts in this area will remain important, but will become more challenging owing to the increase in conflict- ing objectives. Swiss efforts must not have the effect of pitting human rights against economic interests. Swit- zerland has developed a number of promising approaches aimed at working with the private sector to develop standards on corporate respect for and promotion of human rights, based on the principle of self-responsibility. This partnership approach to human rights policy has great poten- tial. Companies have a fundamental interest in respecting human rights. At the same time, they can help to improve the human rights situation through their local engagement. With the international understanding of human rights also showing signs of fragmentation, Swit- zerland should work to promote human rights dialogue between countries. Finally, the same observation applies to human rights as to other areas: new fields of activity throw up new chal- lenges, such as protection against identity theft or cyberbullying, but they also bring opportunities. It is therefore time to think seriously about the issue of digital human rights. 35 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 3.5. Technology as a new topic of Swiss foreign policy Technology will drive not just far-reaching global changes, it will also impact foreign policy. It would be reductive to regard new technologies merely as a tool. Rather, Switzerland should conceptualise technology as a new foreign policy topic. A tech foreign policy can help optimise the opportunities afforded by new technologies while minimising their risks for Switzerland and the world. The Federal Institutes of Technology and other research centres position Switzerland at the cut- ting edge of research in new technologies. This is underscored by the country’s Impact per Paper ranking in research on artificial intelligence (AI). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the deep learn- ing process that is integral to all smartphones today, was developed in Switzerland. The coun- try is, after all, a world leader in engineering and robotics. The relevant tech companies are located in Swit- zerland, and there is a high density of AI start-ups per capita. In biotechnology, successful global Swiss companies in the pharmaceutical, chemi- cal and agricultural sectors and the food industry are playing a significant role. All of these compa- nies are shoring up Switzerland’s reputation as a hub for innovation. Numerous other international organisations and key players such as the WEF and the ICRC are headquartered in Switzerland. They are also key influencers in the debate on digital transformation. Other multilateral organisations, such as the UN, can benefit by networking locally with these knowledge centres. Switzerland’s foreign policy profile also predis- poses it to be a hub for technology themes. Swiss neutrality is the basis for a credible tech foreign policy. Its independence and reputation for medi- ation and building bridges serve as enablers for new opportunities. Consequently, the prerequisites for engaging with technology themes through a distinct foreign pol- icy are there. At present, they are not being opti- mally combined. Switzerland has so far not been well represented in the debates on new technolo- gies: the United States and China have been set- ting the benchmarks for AI, and Europe’s position is being shaped by countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Finland, the Nether- lands and Denmark. In the time frame until 2028, three building blocks will lay the foundation for Switzerland to consoli- date its position in new technologies: 3.5.1. Switzerland as a hub for governance and innovation in new technologies To project itself as a location for new technol- ogies, Switzerland will need to adopt measures that go beyond foreign policy. They must include developing a national strategy on AI, a favoura- ble regulatory environment for start-ups as well as internationally competitive government incen- tives to halt the brain drain that has already beset the Swiss AI development sector and other sec- tors such as biotechnology. Foreign policy can play an important role here. Switzerland should project International Gene- va as the leading destination for the global debates on digitalisation and technology. Geneva is already known for its dynamic ecosys- tem embracing diverse stakeholder groups. This ecosystem must be nurtured and encouraged to develop innovative governance models for new technologies. Governmental and government-re- lated institutions across the world are currently finding it difficult to keep pace with the speed of technological development. The future will be shaped in creative interactions between various stakeholders on suitable platforms. Expanding these capacities and networks could be one element of a host country policy. A step in that direction was the decision of the Federal Council along with the Canton and City of Gene- va in spring 2019 to establish the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator foundation. There is The vision By 2028, new technologies are an established topic of Swiss foreign policy. Switzerland is a leading global hub for governance and research in artificial intelligence and other new technologies. It has a clearly defined profile and is a leading contributor to international policy debates. Switzerland utilises new technologies to enhance the impact of its foreign policy actions and commitments. Stakeholders from industry and the scientific community will become established partners in this process. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 36 tremendous scope in combining science policy and Swiss diplomacy. Switzerland should also strengthen federal government, research and industry net- works in the area of new technologies. Com- petence clusters create the critical mass in the competition between geographical locations. An AI cluster involving partners can help to establish the right priorities for a tech foreign policy and to develop the required know-how. The scientific community has proposed the idea of a foreign policy initiative to support basic research in artificial intelligence. The objec- tive is to achieve transparent, fair and peaceful use of AI as a counterpoint to a technological arms race. There is a proposal to set up an AI organisation in Switzerland along the lines of CERN. Such an ambitious plan would need to be supported by a supraregional group of like-mind- ed countries. Another promising approach is positioning Swit- zerland as a safe harbour for data. Data pro- tection as well as secure information systems and data infrastructure are increasingly critical issues – for international organisations too. A digital safe deposit box could emerge as a new form of good offices and simultaneously strength- en Switzerland’s position as an IT and business location. Swiss neutrality, political stability, data protection regulations and acknowledged tech- nological know-how provide an excellent foun- dation. 3.5.2. Tech diplomacy In the last 30 years, Switzerland has been glob- ally acknowledged for its peace-building efforts. The geopolitically motivated technology race could present an opportunity for similar ambition in establishing a high-profile Swiss tech foreign policy. It can serve as an important link between peace policy, development cooperation, environ- mental and foreign policy, thereby strengthening the rules-based international order. New standards and regulatory models are a long- term goal. In the short and medium-term, asking the right questions and finding solutions that enjoy broad societal support are key. Existing interna- tional law should be applied as widely as possible. Until such time as there is agreement on generally applicable standards, self regulation through vol- untary commitments on the use of AI algorithms appears to be a promising approach. The interna- tional organisations based in Geneva would be particularly interested in such benchmarks. Switzerland should focus on building a tech foreign policy profile in three policy and governance areas, and on contributing to the respective international debates: The first area pertains to security issues. Auton- omous weapons and the militarisation of space using high-tech weapons call for a rethink of arms control and international humanitarian law in this new scenario. A further topic to be addressed is influence operations and the corresponding defence capabilities. Switzerland’s cyber foreign policy could be developed within the framework of its tech foreign policy. 1500 1200 900 600 300 0 Source: Roland Berger and ASGARD, Artificial Intelligence – A strategy for European startups Un ite d St at es Ch in a Is ra el UK Ca na da Ja pa n Fr an ce Ge rm an y In di a Sw ed en Fi nl an d So ut h Ko re a Sp ai n Si ng ap or e Sw itz er la nd Au st ra lia Br az il Ne th er la nd s Ita ly Ru ss ia Top 20 countries for AI start-ups 13 93 3 83 3 62 2 45 13 1 1 13 10 9 10 6 82 5 5 4 5 4 2 3 9 3 5 2 8 27 26 26 22 19 Top 20 countries for AI start-ups 37 2028 Foreign Policy Vision The second area pertains to democracy and eth- ical issues. Citizens must be put at the heart of technological change. The key parameters for this objective are digital privacy protection and social norms for digital platforms. Human rights must be defended equally – online or offline. In this con- text, Switzerland can raise its profile by pioneering the development and application of responsible and human-oriented AI and other new technol- ogies. The third area pertains to social and economic transformation. Switzerland can provide inputs for formulating an international response to the challenges posed by the Fourth Industrial Revolu- tion and thereby maximise the opportunities for OECD and developing countries. One focus area could be strategies for technological innovations to become growth drivers in developing countries. 3.5.3. Making foreign policy more effective Digital transformation offers tremendous oppor- tunities for shaping and implementing foreign pol- icy. Its impact can be enhanced through the use of AI as an instrument for analysing and sup- porting decision-making. For instance, social media analytics can provide multifaceted insights into international perceptions of Switzerland (Chapter 3.2.4 and 3.3.1). Peacebuilding can be supported with big data analytics providing early recognition of poten- tial conflicts. Humanitarian crises can be better responded to by pinpointing needs more quickly and precisely (Chapter 3.4.1). In this way, digital transformation facilitates achieving the 2030 Agenda’s sustainable development goals. Swiss foreign policy should accord high priority to this core idea. In concrete terms, it should expand both digital services and digital service delivery. Digitalisation in a cross-cutting issue: in order to leverage the potential of new technologies for for- eign policy and to carve out a distinct profile, the FDFA needs to develop specific competencies by working together with industry and the scien- tific community. An organisational unit for tech foreign policy could bring together data specialists and tech diplomats. Such a unit could become a nodal point of contact for all stakeholders. A tech ambassador and relevant know-how in its over- seas missions, such as San Francisco, could extend the reach of Swiss tech foreign policy. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 38 3.6. Self-confident with and vis-à-vis the EU Switzerland’s relations with Europe are the core issue of its foreign policy. Global and trade-related trends indicate that this will not change (Chapter 2). Access to the EU single market remains central to Swiss prosperity: trade with the EU comprises over half of Switzerland’s foreign trade. The single market is expected to grow again in significance – also as a labour mar- ket. The same holds for the role of the EU as a partner in the fields of science, education and innovation. The ongoing fragmentation of the world trade order further increases the relevance of the homogenous and rules-based EU market, as does the technology-driven reshoring of pro- duction plants. Developments in mainland European also have implications for Swiss security. The future course will be determined by how Europe is able to assert its position among the global powers. Should the European countries prove unable to safeguard their interests and values externally, this critical development would also impact Switzer- land. Within Europe, cooperation between police and judicial authorities will gain greater impor- tance. Joint solutions will be sought for an asylum policy. Had Switzerland not been associated with the Schengen and Dublin Agreements, it would, from a technical perspective, already be worse off today. What is the role that Switzerland needs to play in the present European context? Greater prosperity and security through Europe can reinforce Swiss independence. At the same time, Switzerland’s political identity is being put to the test by Europe- an unification, as reflected in the anxieties voiced during the current debate on Switzerland’s Euro- pean policy. In sum, the implications are that Switzerland needs a close partnership with the EU and its member states, a partnership that is capable of evolv- ing. The question of acceding to the EU will not arise, even in 2028. Switzerland will continue to pursue a bilateral path that strikes an optimum balance between extensive market access and maintaining the greatest possible political inde- pendence. The three building blocks below set out the con- tours of a sound and stable relationship between Switzerland and the EU in 2028: 3.6.1. Regulated participation in the single market is the key Non-discriminatory access to the EU market has been a core concern of Swiss foreign policy since the 1950s, and will remain so until 2028. Three developments have a crucial bearing on formulat- ing the requirements for a future model of coop- eration: 1. A strong EU single market will persist (Chap- ter 2.1). Switzerland therefore requires a viable model for preserving and structuring its access to the market in the long term. 2. Both in economic and social terms, Switzerland is more strongly connected with the EU than many member states. The volume of trade with the EU amounts to CHF 1 billion per workday. Every day, some 1.5 million persons and 1 mil- lion vehicles cross Swiss borders. The model must take into account these very close links, while still remaining flexible. 3. Switzerland desires to retain its independent policy vis-à-vis Europe. The model must preser- ve the achievements of the bilateral approach and make it viable for the future. The vision Having consolidated its bilateral approach, Switzerland will work with the EU, as a non- member state, in shaping Europe. The various institutional issues will have been settled and a self-aware and strategic approach will guide the internal debate on Europe. Switzerland is a European country both in cultural and geographical terms and defending its global interests must start with Europe. Switzerland will strive to put in place jointly agreed arrangements for regional cooperation. It will take an active role in shaping decisions, providing effective input into policy areas coordinated by the EU at European level. Switzerland thereby contributes to preserving Europe’s attractiveness as a location for global business and innovation. In return, as a partner it benefits from the political clout of like-minded neighbouring EU countries. 39 2028 Foreign Policy Vision An institutional agreement is best suited to meet these three requirements from among all the Euro- pean policy options available. It would institution- ally cement bilateral relations, continue to guar- antee sectoral participation in the single market and consequently enhance legal certainty. Finally, such an agreement would allow for the further development of Switzerland’s independent path. The dynamic incorporation of new EU leg- islation within the scope of market access agree- ments guarantees that the existing agreements will remain applicable, and that they may be fur- ther developed based on situational requirements, while also providing for new participatory rights to Switzerland. Active participation in the framing of EU legisla- tion strengthens Swiss sovereignty. Participation in preparing norms should therefore be given preference over autonomous adoption. The close involvement of Parliament and the cantons will reflect the convergence of foreign and domestic policy. Both will have a growing role in shaping Switzerland’s European policy. A mixed parliamen- tary committee of representatives from the Feder- al Assembly and the European Parliament would create new opportunities for influence. An insti- tutional agreement will underscore Switzerland’s importance as a sectoral partner in the single mar- ket. It is in Switzerland’s interest to have defined pro- cedures for accepting or rejecting new EU legis- lation and for arbitration. Such arrangements can prevent arbitrary political influence. While relations with the EU will not be entirely free of conflict – relations between sovereign partners by definition never are – there would nevertheless be capacity for constructive conflict. Differences in opinion would be resolved in an orderly way, with law prevailing over power. The principle of proportionality applicable to any compensato- ry measures would also relativise the guillotine clause. In sum, relations between Switzerland and the EU would become more symmetrical, stable and consequently more predictable. Overall, this would have a positive impact on Swiss foreign and European policy, and also widen the scope of their application. 3.6.2. Preserving sectoral interests at all levels Switzerland has much to offer Europe: from cut- ting edge research to contributing towards reduc- ing economic and social disparities in an enlarged EU. Switzerland is respected and welcome as a partner in those areas where it wishes to pursue its interests jointly with Europe. For regional cooperation within Europe, Switzer- land has a selection of policy instruments that are flexible and related to specific thematic areas at various levels: national/independent, cross-border with neighbouring countries, bilateral or plurilater- al ventures with like-minded countries or regional organisations, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. In all such forums it meets member states of the EU. EU-driven approaches will become increasing- ly important if there is Swiss interest in pursuing cooperation at the European level in any policy area. There are several such areas ranging from digitalisation, energy transition, promotion of culture and armaments cooperation. Har- monious relations with the EU are consequent- ly crucial. Opportunities to cooperate are the basis for contributing Swiss concerns, ideas and strengths. It will bolster the Swiss negotiating position if the EU perceives it as constructive and solution-oriented. Long-term support for research cooperation must be ensured. The networking of cross- border research capabilities will strengthen innovation on both sides. 45% of research staff at Swiss research institutes are from the EU zone. Over half of the professors at the Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH) are from Europe. From a scientific, techno- logical and economic perspective, Switzerland’s full participation in the EU’s framework pro- grammes for research is in the interests of the EU and Switzerland. 2028 Foreign Policy Vision 40 3.6.3. Striking a balance between independence and partnering with Europe Switzerland cannot influence Europe’s leverage as a global force. It is therefore all the more important that it appraises how closely it wishes to cooperate with the EU in those foreign policy areas where the EU can and does act effectively. On numerous fronts, Swiss values and interests coincide with those of its neighbours, including with regard to shared risk analyses. Switzerland has supported various EU sanctions that go beyond existing UN resolutions. For many years it has participated in civilian and military EU peacekeeping operations – in the Ukraine, the Western Balkans and the Sahel. It is one of the few third countries to have a cooperation agree- ment with the European Defence Agency (EDA), giving it access to the EDA’s forums and projects. Switzerland also maintains active contact with the European Union’s External Action Service on specific issues: coordination in multilateral forums, regional strategies as well as development assis- tance and humanitarian commitments. On the other hand, Switzerland has no structured political dialogue with the EU. Cooperation is also limited in other areas in comparison with other non-EU countries in Europe. Switzerland is the only country in the Euro-Atlantic region, for instance, that does not formally endorse positions and declarations emerging from the EU’s common foreign and security policy. It also does not join EU sanctions if this would jeopardise a possible role for Switzerland as a mediator. A Swiss foreign policy that is guided by self-in- terest consequently requires space – also and especially as far as the EU is concerned. The Swiss policy of dialogue demonstrates the opportunities that emerge from an independent position – often for all actors. The goal is to objectively analyse by what means Swiss interests can best be served. In some cases, more can be achieved by acting in concert with the EU and thereby leveraging its critical mass in negotiations. At the same time, Switzerland must ensure that it does not become a victim of this mass. Were the EU to conclude better free trade agreements with third countries than Switzer- land is able to, for example, this could negatively impact Swiss competitiveness. The discussions on the future development of cooperation with Europe are worth following closely. It does not serve Swiss interests to have the EU moving towards becoming a European superstate, nor to have Europe disintegrate. An EU that is a union of European nations helping them to achieve greater prosperity and security while respecting their uniqueness also benefits Switzer- land. In light of this, the proposal to establish a European Security Council with the participation of the United Kingdom will be of interest for Swiss foreign policy. What is certain is that neither Switzerland nor other European states can individually defend the liberal international order. In the future, Switzerland will demonstrate the same commitment and confidence vis-à-vis the EU as it has within the UN, the OSCE and other organisa- tions. 41 2028 Foreign Policy Vision Foundations of an agile foreign policy A vision is not a utopia. All the developments set out in AVIS28 can be implemented. Switzerland can develop its foreign policy in a way that reflects its own interests and has a broader domestic sup- port base. Focusing on the needs of its citizens and the economy makes sense. With political will, the proposed innovations in Switzerland’s engage- ment for development, peace and a rules-based international order can be achieved. The same applies to establishing a Swiss foreign policy on technology and to the relationship with Europe. A Switzerland that plays its part self-assuredly and does not confine its policy on the EU to damage limitation will forge its own identity with foresight. Realising the 2028 Vision will require adjustments to the foundations of Swiss foreign policy, which will need to be more agile to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s world. AVIS28 therefore concludes with some reflections on four factors underpin- ning Swiss foreign policy: personnel, the external network, anticipation, and the need for coherence and efficiency. These reflections may stimulate further in-depth discussion in the wake of AVIS28. Foreign policy needs generalists, but also more specialists The foreign policy outlined in AVIS28 will require a broader range of skills within the FDFA. This means more economic expertise, both in the work of Swiss diplomacy and in international cooperation activities, as well as specialist knowledge of new technologies. More staff in responsible positions at head office and in the representations will have to communicate differently and more intensively. These skills will need to be developed. In addition, foreign policy should be developed in closer coor- dination with the domestic policy agenda. This will be a challenge facing all levels of management. In-depth knowledge of non-European countries and cultures will also become more important. All these elements are in addition to an already very demanding competency profile. Job profiles will need to be adapted. On the one hand, there will still be a need for proven all-rounders who are will- ing to bring their expertise to maturity in a range of disciplines by dint of many years of training. Generalists with broad skill sets will be particularly in demand in the external network. On the other hand, more specialists will also be required, includ- ing for the diplomatic corps, in areas such as medi- ation, economic diplomacy, international law and multilateral engagement. In general, both the diplomatic corps and interna- tional cooperation bodies should be aiming for a greater variety of expertise, whether through recruitment or increased use of secondments. Pri- vate sector experience will be more important for diplomatic careers than it is today. At the same time, the secondment of FDFA personnel to spe- cialist departments and international organisations could be expanded. Conversely, foreign policy could make greater use of external expertise, for example in the form of a pool of experts for development cooperation (see section 3.4). The FDFA needs to become more permeable, in both directions. Ensuring that FDFA personnel are representative of the wider population strengthens the legitima- cy and domestic credibility of Swiss foreign policy. Accordingly, the country’s different language com- munities should be appropriately reflected in the staff composition. Employees are the most important asset of Swiss foreign policy. Switzerland is politically and eco- nomically a middle-ranking power with global interests. Ensuring that these interests are intelli- gently, sensitively and realistically represented is vital to the country’s success. This applies to all job profiles. To attract the most talented young people into these demanding roles, flexible working mod- els are essential. Balancing work, family and free time is also key in terms of equal opportunities. Gender equity boosts productivity and will underpin the success of a future foreign policy. With women making up 50% of its staff, the FDFA is well positioned in this respect. At senior management level, the propor- tion has risen to 25% in recent years. Neverthe- less, it is important that further efforts are made to achieve gender parity at all managerial levels, and that gender equality and women’s rights are given a high profile in foreign policy activities. 4 Foundations of an agile foreign policy 42 Successful foreign policy relies on a flexible and innovative external network Switzerland currently has an official presence in over 120 countries. It has 102 embassies, 12 per- manent missions to international organisations, 29 consulates general and 19 cooperation offices. According to an international study, Switzerland is ranked number 16 in the world for the size of its external network. This network represents Switzerland’s strength. It is an expression of the country’s independent foreign policy and an important instrument for protecting Switzerland’s global interests. It per- forms a range of tasks, from fostering relation- ships and promoting business interests to looking after Swiss nationals abroad. Relationships of trust forged in these countries can also lead to requests for good offices. However, there is a risk that the external network could become overstretched. For example, there are currently around 20 micro-representations consisting of only one transferable staff mem- ber plus local employees. The usefulness of such representations is debatable. Generally speaking, Switzerland is now present in too many locations with too few resources. Possible solutions would be either to increase the transferable human resources or to concentrate funding and rely on more cross accreditations for countries in which Switzerland is not physically present. The principle of universality, whereby Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with all countries, has been a cornerstone of Swiss foreign policy since 1945. New states, regardless of their political orientation, should be recognised once they meet the relevant criteria under international law. It is only in recent years that the principle of universal- ity has also been applied to the external network. A dogmatic interpretation is not expedient: the network should reflect political priorities rather than the other way around. Apart from universality, the current strategy for the external network also specifies the principles of flexibility and efficiency. Since 1990, 38 representations have closed and 39 have opened. Switzerland has expanded its presence to a further 20 countries, primarily those classed as emerging economies. By having a range of Swiss actors together in one place and by strengthening coop- eration with partner countries, it is able to exploit synergies within its external network. Flexibility must also mean being able to transfer resources from lower priority areas within head office or the external network to strategically important loca- tions, or to undertake closures. As the world and societies change, it is impor- tant to think about the form and function of rep- resentations abroad. It is also worth exploring a network- based approach that would see the representations cooperate more with each other on substantive issues and become less reliant on head office alone. This would enable representations Switzerland’s external network Source: FDFA Embassies (102) Permanent UN/OI missions (12) General Consulates (29) Swiss Cooperation Offices (19) Other representations (4) 43 Foundations of an agile foreign policy within a region to specialise in particular areas and enhance their expertise through exchange, with- out the need for additional resources. In the future, representations should be designed more as innovative platforms for Switzerland, and should be open to a wide range of actors from politics, business, science/academ- ia, innovation, culture and the media. The main aim of these platforms would be to promote inter- action between people from Switzerland and the host country. Modern representations are already seeing a demand for this kind of service, especially in big cities, which are increasingly important driv- ing forces on foreign policy and economic issues. Providing resources for a strategic framework will strengthen the ability to anticipate The representations act as Switzerland’s external antennas. Their reports help build up a picture of what is going on, the quality of which is essen- tial to Switzerland’s independence. They give early warning signals and suggest new foreign policy options. Head office needs to be able to draw the right con- clusions from this information and to act quickly. Compared to many other foreign ministries, the FDFA’s capacity for anticipation and analysis is very modest. Models such as an internal think tank or a planning unit would enhance its ability to process information from the external network. Such a unit could help to ensure a high-quality overall view of foreign policy. As specialisation increases, classifications within a strategic frame- work will be required. It is equally important that this unit can provide ‘rolling’ risk analysis. Global political and economic volatility means that deci- sion-makers need regular, comprehensive and accurate information about how situations are developing. Coherence and efficiency will be central to future foreign policy The world is changing and Swiss foreign policy is changing with it. More and more units within the administration work in, or in connection with, international contexts. In their respective thematic sectors, the offices in effect operate their own for- eign policy and maintain their own international networks. This departmentalisation of foreign pol- icy began three decades ago and now extends far beyond European issues. AVIS28 has deliberately made only marginal ref- erence to sectoral foreign policies. Some con- cluding remarks on the vital role of coherence are therefore all the more important. Coordinating the departments’ foreign policy activities with Swiss interests in mind will become a core task for the FDFA. The aim must be to combine specialist sectoral expertise and diplomatic knowledge in order to create administratively lean coordination models that enable the units to interact and work together in an overall political context. This would be a milestone for Switzerland on the path to a coherent safeguarding of its foreign policy inter- ests. Conflicting objectives are the expression of a plu- ralist society. The aim is not to overcome such conflicts but rather to ensure transparency: the conflicts should be clearly stated and carefully weighed up, and decisions taken in a transparent way. The need for efficiency is equally important. AVIS28 identifies a number of innovations that could make Swiss foreign policy fit for the future. They range from new economic development instruments to the creation of a tech ambassador profile and a planning unit in the FDFA. Rather than simply supplementing existing foreign policy, these innovations should be linked to clear prior- itisation and retrenchment planning. Swit- zerland cannot do everything. But it does have to know how it intends to position itself in order to work efficiently towards meeting the goals it sets. If it achieves this, Switzerland’s 2028 Foreign Poli- cy Vision will become a reality, enjoying domestic political support and generating great benefits. Switzerland’s success is not guaranteed, but it is the author of its own success story. By having the courage to embrace change, it can add a new chapter to that story.

Mr Cassis and the FDFA would then draw on the working group’s report as a source of inspiration in further developing Swiss foreign policy and aligning its instruments with the chal- lenges and opportunities ahead. The report is also intended to encourage a broad debate on the future of Swiss foreign policy. The working group met for six workshops between October 2018 and May 2019, and developed the 2028 Vision on the basis of intensive dialogue and discussions. In line with Mr Cassis’s instruc- tions, FDFA staff were also able to contribute their analyses, plans and ideas. To this end, the FDFA General Secretariat set up a number of sound- ing boards.Round-table discussions on numerous foreign policy topics as well as events with exter- nal experts were held. There was also an AVIS28 blog. The results of these discussions and inputs were made available to the working group. The working group comprised senior FDFA staff, the president of the Conference of the Canton- al Governments of Switzerland and experts from academia, business and civil society. The experts were appointed personally by Mr Cassis to provide an outside perspective on global affairs and Swiss foreign policy and augment the internal views put forward within the FDFA. Members of the AVIS28 Working Group: • Dr Philipp Aerni, Director of the Center for Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability at the University of Zurich • Pascale Baeriswyl, State Secretary, Head of the Directorate of Political Affairs, FDFA • Dr Roberto Balzaretti, State Secretary, Head of the Directorate for European Affairs, FDFA • Alenka Bonnard, Director and co-founder of staatslabor • Dr Manuel Sager, Ambassador, SDC Director- General, FDFA • Dr Markus Seiler, FDFA General Secretary (head of the working group) • Peter R.

The above titles refer to the positions held at the time of appointment to the working group. The working group analysed the factors driving changes in Switzerland’s global and regional con- text and drew conclusions for Swiss foreign policy in the medium term. It examined Swiss interests, identified regional and thematic priorities and set out proposals concerning the future capacities and expertise of the FDFA. The working group’s report outlines a target vision for foreign policy in 2028 and identifies ways how the vision can be realised. It is available to down- load from the FDFA website in German, French, Italian, and English: The report reflects the opinions of the working group: it is not a report by the FDFA or the Federal Council. 46 Publication details Switzerland in the World 2028.

I gradual- ly discovered other FDFA priorities but also realised  that although there were sectoral strategies cover- ing various areas, there was no overall vision. What  are our actual foreign policy objectives? What glob- al trends and developments do we face and what  are the opportunities and challenges for Switzer- land? The Federal Constitution provides us with our  fundamental mandate and represents our raison  d’être. The Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy  is designed to interpret this fundamental mandate.  But it is not well known, it is presented in broad  strokes, and initially I did not know to what extent  it was being put into practice.  Various analysts I asked about this told me that  Switzerland’s foreign policy was generally oppor- tunity-driven. To some extent that is inevitable.  Switzerland is not a major power holding the reins  of world politics. And its pragmatic approach has  so far proven its worth. Our country is doing very  well. It enjoys a high international reputation.  Swiss values such as our readiness for dialogue,  reliability and honesty, and our power-sharing tra- dition and respect for the rule of law have long  been acknowledged and appreciated.  But is this enough for the future? In an increas- ingly multipolar world, Switzerland needs to have  a clear idea of what it wants. “If you don’t know  where you’re going, any road will get you there”  – said the cat to Alice in Wonderland. As a highly  networked country and host state of numerous  international organisations, it is very much in our  interest to look to the future and to know what  path we want to take.  Switzerland’s foreign policy has essentially  remained unchanged since the end of the Cold  War. The geopolitical watershed the end of the  Cold War represented was reflected in the Feder- al Council’s Foreign Policy Report of 1993, which  placed Swiss foreign policy on a new conceptual  footing. Since then, we have tightened a few bolts  here and there, but by and large our foreign poli- cy has been marked by continuity. Continuity is a  Swiss trademark and remains important. But the  world is not what it was. Switzerland needs the  foresight to set new foreign policy paths. We don’t  have to reinvent the wheel. But we should gear  our foreign policy to the challenges and opportu- nities of tomorrow and future-proof Switzerland’s  strengths. Hence the idea of a vision.  I decided to set up a working group to develop  such a vision. It was to be composed of experts  with a variety of backgrounds and have strong  federal government and cantonal representation.  In addition to senior FDFA officials and the pres- ident of the Conference of the Cantonal Govern- ments of Switzerland, it was also to include rep- resentatives of the scientific community, business  and civil society. This breadth of expertise ensured  that the positions taken by the working group  would be well balanced. At the same time, it was  also important to keep the number of participants  small enough to enable genuine discussion.  A 10-year time frame (2019–28) was chosen,  hence AVIS28: Aussenpolitische Vision Schweiz  2028, i.e., Switzerland’s 2028 Foreign Policy  Vision. The vision is where we want to be by 2028.  The idea was to aim for a horizon neither too near  nor too distant, but sufficiently within reach to  allow us to derive concrete goals from it.  © KEYSTONE / Walter Bieri  ii          The working group’s task was to draw up a report  that would serve as a source of inspiration to help  shape Swiss foreign policy in the years ahead. It  was important to me that all FDFA employees be  able to participate in the AVIS process and con- tribute their ideas. The working group organised  numerous AVIS events and created a blog that  gave the AVIS process a momentum that exceed- ed my expectations.  With this report, the working group has completed  its task. The report helps us to better understand  the drivers of change. It puts forward a vision of a  networked foreign policy that is capable of further  development and can take proactive action and  respond to events as they arise. It presents sound  ideas and recommendations that provide me with  a useful basis for the FDFA’s work going forward.  The Federal Council has already set out its Euro- pean policy vision: Switzerland needs the best  possible access to the EU’s single market while  retaining as much independence as possible. The  consolidated bilateral approach remains the best  way of achieving this. In addition to our essential  relationship with the EU, the report also addresses  our relations with international organisations in a  multipolar world. The report persuasively sets out  our interests and makes it clear that a foreign poli- cy more geared towards change does not call into  question our tried and tested Swiss values.  I also found the proposition that in shaping its  foreign policy Switzerland needs to adopt a  whole-of-Switzerland approach persuasive. New  technologies, including digitalisation, will change  the world: as a neutral country, Switzerland is well  placed to position itself as a centre of digital gov- ernance. Close cooperation with all stakeholders  – science, business, multilateral organisations and  NGOs – is essential in this area. Bridge builders are  more in demand than ever, not least at the UN  Security Council.  I would like to express my heartfelt thanks  to the working group for its informative and  thought-provoking report. Special thanks are also  due to everyone who contributed to the AVIS pro- cess. At the FDFA we will continue to work on and  further develop this process, not least in order to  generate new impetus for the Federal Council’s  foreign policy strategy 2020–23.  The report provides a sound basis for a construc- tive discussion on Switzerland’s future place in the  world. I therefore hope that it will be read by a  wide audience.  “If life has no vision, with no ultimate  goal towards which we strive,    no single objective to fulfil, there is  no point in making an effort.”   Erich Fromm        iii    Cl ea  rly  de  fin ed   in te  re st  s  an  d p rio  rit ie  s  Fo re  ig n a  nd  do  m es  tic  po  lic y   ar e c  lo se  ly  in  te rt  wi ne  d  Gr ea  te r f  oc us   on    cit ize  ns  an  d t he    ec  on om  y  Sw itz  er la  nd  ac  ts    se lf-  co nf  id en  tly  w  ith    an d v  is- à-  vis  th  e E U  Te ch  no log  y i s a  n  es  ta bl  ish ed   pi lla  r o f   Sw iss   fo re  ig n p  oli cy  Sw iss   so ft   po we  r f or    a m  or e p  ea ce  fu l a  nd    st ab  le  wo  rld  Today’s foreign policy  2028 Foreign Policy Vision for Switzerland  iv          The 2028 vision in brief: A more focused,  networked, agile Swiss foreign policy  Foreign policy is becoming increasingly important  to Switzerland’s prosperity and security. Switzerland  is a success story, but if its success is to continue  until 2028 and beyond it will need to adapt to the  changing international environment. Switzerland  must have the courage to change. Switzerland  needs to adopt a more focused, networked  and agile foreign policy:  • Switzerland’s foreign policy must emerge from  a defined position more than has hitherto been  the case.  • As an independent country, Switzerland needs  to build upon relationships, both domestical- ly and internationally, to enable it to promote  its values and defend its interests. In shaping  its foreign policy, Switzerland needs to adopt  a ‘whole of Switzerland’ approach and step  up cooperation with like-minded countries to  achieve its stated objectives.  • Finally, Switzerland’s foreign policy instruments  must be geared to anticipating challenges and  opportunities, enabling it to respond rapidly  and with flexibility. Switzerland needs skills and  resources in order to be heard in the volatile  world of tomorrow and have a stake in shaping  global events.   AVIS28 sets out Switzerland’s vision in six key  areas with a view to defining future foreign policy:  1. By 2028, Switzerland‘s foreign policy will  deliver on strategic priorities based on cle- arly defined interests and its values. Foreign  policy will articulate thematic and regional prio- rities. Switzerland will be consistent in its dea- lings with the outside world, including major  powers.   2. Foreign policy will be closely linked with  domestic policy. Swiss foreign policy will be  firmly anchored within domestic policy, thereby  ensuring it meets the expectations of the gene- ral public. The Federal Council will determine  the direction of foreign policy in close consulta- tion with Parliament and the cantons, based on  a shared understanding of the responsibilities  involved.   3. Greater focus on services for citizens and  cooperating with Swiss businesses are  recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy.  Foreign policy and trade policy will operate as a  homogeneous whole. Market access for Swiss  companies is a key priority. The private sector is  an effective partner in addressing the sustaina- ble development goals.  4. Switzerland will leverage its core strengths  to build a more peaceful and stable world.  Swiss development cooperation will focus on  creating jobs locally, finding innovative solu- tions to reduce poverty and addressing migra- tion challenges strategically. Harnessing new  technology will ensure highly effective delive- ry of humanitarian aid. Peacebuilding will be  backed by a clear strategy, broad-based poli- tical support, and attractive packages of good  offices. Switzerland will be able to respond  rapidly to requests for its good offices. It will  adopt effective initiatives to bolster the rules- based international order and work, both off- line and online, to foster respect for internatio- nal law and human rights.  5. By 2028, new technologies will be an esta- blished topic of Swiss foreign policy. Inter- national Geneva will be a leading location for  global governance in relation to digital trans- formation. Switzerland will present a clear, con- textual profile and contribute to international  policy debates with its expertise in tech diplom- acy. Stakeholders from industry and the scienti- fic community will become established partners  in this process.  6. Having consolidated its bilateral approach,  Switzerland will work with the EU, as a  non-member state, in shaping Europe. The  various institutional issues will have been sett- led and a self-aware and strategic approach will  guide the internal debate on Europe. Switzer- land is a European country both in cultural and  geographical terms and defending its global  interests must start with Europe. Switzerland  will strive to put in place jointly agreed arran- gements for regional cooperation. It will take  an active role in shaping decisions, providing  effective input into policy areas coordinated by  the EU at European level.         v    Introduction – why a 2028  Foreign Policy Vision?  Switzerland is one of the safest and most prosper- ous countries in the world. It is politically stable  and Swiss citizens have confidence in their insti- tutions. The prospects for the next generation are  good. Its prosperity, openness, competitiveness  and innovative strength make Switzerland a politi- cal and economic middle power with major global  interests.  Switzerland is a success story. But it  has no guarantee of future success.  Switzerland’s pragmatic approach of focusing  on solving specific issues and proceeding step by  step has served it well in the past. But the world  is becoming harsher, more fragmented, more com- plex – and more unpredictable. For Switzerland,  this means that it cannot simply take its success for  granted. More than ever, it must act based on a  clearly defined position, especially in foreign policy.  One of the main tasks every state has to fulfil is to  regularly assess the global political environment,  analyse changes and their causes, identify chal- lenges and opportunities and, where necessary,  adjust its foreign policy accordingly. Today this  task is more important than ever.  We live in an era where change and  movement are the norm and Switzerland  is impacted on multiple fronts.  Digitalisation is transforming the economy and  societies worldwide. The growth model pursued  by industrialised countries to date is running up  against limits imposed by climate change. Power  shifts are changing the dynamics underpinning  global politics. Geopolitical tensions are growing  and trade conflicts are escalating. The cornerstones  of international order, especially international law  and multilateralism, are increasingly being called  into question. Large-scale migration is sowing  uncertainty among large segments of the popu- lation. In many countries, protest movements are  on the rise because of a widespread loss of trust  in established political parties and institutions. The  European Union is faced with diverging conceptions  of its own identity. And Switzerland is also feeling  the consequences.  Switzerland wants to shape its future place in  Europe and in the world in a self-determined and  independent way. It must therefore respond to  global changes and find solutions to emerging  problems. It needs a vision to protect its interests  and promote its values in a volatile environment.   Foreign policy is becoming increasingly  important for Switzerland‘s  prosperity and security.   The Federal Constitution provides a solid founda- tion to further develop Swiss foreign policy. Our  starting position is good: Switzerland has consider- able credibility as an honest broker and as a country  that fulfils its obligations. Its good offices and com- mitment to the rule of law are greatly valued, as  are its development cooperation and humanitarian  aid work. International Geneva is a major asset for  Switzerland’s foreign policy. The FDFA also boasts a  strong external network, highly experienced staff,  and a broad range of high-quality services for Swiss  citizens abroad.  There is nonetheless need for action. In a world  that is again increasingly marked by power poli- tics, Switzerland must speak with one voice inter- nationally, understand its own interests and know  how it intends to achieve its goals. It must equip  itself to withstand pressure and demands from all  quarters. It can do this most effectively if it already  has proposed solutions at its disposal before pres- sure begins to be felt. In the past we often did the  opposite: Switzerland would first ignore attempts  to apply pressure to it, then it would raise objec- tions, and in the end it would give in. Changing  how we deal with international pressure requires a  forward-looking analytical capability.  Switzerland must also exert influence wherever  important decisions are made. It must have the  right instruments, partnerships and networks in  order to help shape its environment to its advan- tage and seize opportunities worldwide.  So there is a great deal Switzerland must accom- plish, and this in a domestic context where unease  about external influences is growing. This unease  is less pronounced in Switzerland than in other  European countries. But it would be wrong to  under estimate the trend. It is worth recalling how   1  1      Introduction – why a 2028 Foreign Policy Vision?    important a stable set of international rules was  and will remain for the Swiss success story.   AVIS28 highlights the strengths our foreign  policy can bring to bear to contribute to  Switzerland‘s future prosperity and security.  The report provides an interpretative overview  enabling us to draw the right conclusions about  the changes that are currently underway. It  translates them into a framework that takes due  account of domestic politics: Switzerland’s success  will depend more than was the case in the past on  whether its citizens can understand and recognise  the advantages of its foreign policy.  AVIS28 is a vision, not a strategy. The report  is a source of inspiration to reflect on and set the  course for Switzerland’s future foreign policy. It  aims to contribute to the dialogue on the Switzer- land of tomorrow. Its ten-year perspective allows  a careful examination of the horizon ahead. This  time frame also makes it possible to make plau- sible projections about how Switzerland and the  world will develop. AVIS28 spans two legislative  periods to allow for gradual adjustments and  innovations.  Based on the premise that our environment will  continue to change, AVIS28 lays building blocks  for the further development of Swiss foreign poli- cy. These are presented in the form of a six-point  vision for Switzerland’s foreign policy until 2028:  1.  By 2028, Switzerland‘s foreign policy will deliver on strategic  priorities based on clearly defined interests and its values.  2. Foreign policy will be closely linked with domestic policy.  3. Greater focus on services for citizens and cooperating with  Swiss businesses are recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy.  4. Switzerland will leverage its core strengths to build a more  peaceful and stable world.  5. By 2028, new technologies will be an established topic of Swiss  foreign policy.  6. Having consolidated its bilateral approach, Switzerland will work  with the EU, as a non-member state, in shaping Europe.   The report concludes with a set of considerations  on the foundations of Switzerland’s future foreign  policy.  Policy deliberations must take account of the fact  that Switzerland’s political culture and unique  characteristics impose certain limits on its strate- gic capacities. Yet these same characteristics are  also an opportunity for Switzerland and its glob- al engagement. Political inclusion (the consocia- tional model of democracy), peaceful coexistence  against a backdrop of linguistic, cultural and reli- gious diversity, a state structure based on pow- er-sharing, and government policies focused on  the welfare of citizens: these historic achievements  are not only quintessentially Swiss strengths but  also highly relevant for Switzerland’s future for- eign policy.   Introduction – why a 2028 Foreign Policy Vision?      2    The world in 2028 – what do  we have to prepare for?  Nothing is more constant than change.  Predicting the world of 2028 is difficult. Neverthe- less, various drivers of change point to a number  of trends that provide a strategic framework to  discuss Switzerland’s future foreign policy.   2.1. Political drivers:   Switzerland in a fragmented  world shaped by power politics  Globalisation remains a megatrend. The world  will continue to be interconnected across a broad  range of domains. But the pace of integration will  not be as rapid as it was before the 2008 financial  crisis. Something of a counter-trend is also evident:  a return to national and local concerns.  The international realignment of economic power  is coupled with the fragmentation of global politics.  Outside the Western world, liberal values are not  as a matter of course associated with prosperity.  A counter-narrative is gaining traction: capitalism  without political pluralism. Competition between  different systems of government and development  models is challenging a global order that has his- torically been shaped by Western values.  2.1.1. Geopolitics and nationalism  Competition between the major powers  will increasingly shape international relations –  in strategic, economic and technological terms.  Geopolitical tensions are growing. Interests are  increasingly being asserted through the exertion  of power. Nationalism and protectionism are  resurgent.  The United States will remain the leading global  power for the time being. While the United States  makes up just 4% of the world’s population,  it accounts for a quarter of global value added,  35% of global innovation and 40% of global arms  expenditures. Yet the United States’ self-percep- tion of being the keeper of the global order is  beginning to ebb. National interests are defined  more narrowly than in the past. The United States’  transition from ‘leader of the free world’ to ‘Amer- ica first’ began before the Trump administration  and is likely to continue after his presidency.  China has regained the status of a world power.  China’s one-party state has set the pace for for- midable economic growth and is systematically  transforming China into a technological and scien- tific superpower. State capitalism combines with  nationalist rhetoric that is once again increasing- ly based on Marxist-Leninist principles. China’s  long-expected gradual adoption of the western  developmental model has not taken place.  Domestically, China faces major challenges. Inter- nationally, China is the only major power with  a clearly discernible foreign policy vision for the  future. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a long- term global infrastructure and investment project.  It aims to supply China with resources and energy.  It also allows China to export its industrial overca- pacities. The BRI aims to stimulate the development  of China’s poorer western provinces and expand  Beijing’s influence across Central Asia. It also seeks  to open up transport routes to Europe, bypassing  the maritime routes controlled by the United States.  Many observers believe that Beijing also aims to use  the BRI to realign world trade and policymaking,  with China at the centre. The future will tell how  successful China will be in implementing this cen- tennial project – and with what consequences for  the countries involved. The project’s vast scope is  itself indicative of China’s new ambitions.  2  0  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  19 96  19 97  19 98  19 99  20 00  20 01  20 02  20 03  20 04  20 05  20 06  20 07  20 08  20 09  20 10  20 11  20 12  20 13  20 14  20 15  20 16  20 17  China is catching up – also in science  Percentage of articles cited in western scientific journals  USA  China  UK Germany Switzerland  Source: SCImago; https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php  China is catching up – also in science  3      The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?    Russia, too, will continue to claim major power  status. Moscow’s foreign policy is founded on a  nationalist narrative that is critical of the West and  challenges the liberal order.  Moscow’s power is primarily based on Russian mili- tary strength. Russia is no longer among the world’s  ten largest economies. Its current GDP is compara- ble to South Korea’s, Spain’s or Australia’s. Reforms  and a rapprochement with the West could poten- tially stem Russia’s relative loss of economic pow- er, but no such domestic and foreign policy adjust- ments appear to be on the horizon.  Given the strained global political climate, there  are expectations that Europe should move closer  together. A united Europe could become a world  power. This is in fact one the European Union’s  stated objectives. But centrifugal forces are also at  work in Europe.  The EU is an economic power and European coun- tries remain global leaders when it comes to quality  of life. But internal fault lines will continue to be a  major concern for the EU in the foreseeable future.  The EU’s biggest players are facing major domestic  political problems. Protest movements are challeng- ing the European integration process as it is present- ly constituted. The EU is rarely able to live up to its  potential as a foreign policy actor. Its member states  disagree on too many key issues. Calls for ‘strategic  autonomy’ and ‘European sovereignty’ remain rath- er theoretical for the time being.  Whether the trend is towards ‘more Europe’ or ‘less  Europe’ is as yet unclear. Despite this uncertainty, or  rather because of it, the single market with its four  freedoms at the heart of the European integration  process is likely to endure. EU member states will in  all likelihood also continue to coordinate within the  framework of the EU their efforts to ensure Europe’s  internal security and global competitiveness.  It also remains to be seen whether the West, as a  transatlantic community of values, will be able to  retain its power to shape policymaking. The lan- guage coming from Washington gives little room  for optimism in the short term. It is clear, however,  that Europe and the United States will continue to  need each other in the global political landscape of  the future. We should therefore not be too hasty in  writing off the West just yet.   2.1.2. The international order  under pressure  The growing prominence of non-Western values  has led to an erosion of the liberal international  order. The rule of law, democracy and human  rights are on the defensive. International law is  under pressure. Freedom of expression is being  curtailed in many countries. Facts are countered  with pseudo-facts with alarming frequency –  not only in autocratic countries. It is too early to  tell whether this trend is a temporary setback or  whether decades of progress have been irretriev- ably lost.  The weakening of the international order is also  evidenced by the fact that arms control trea- ties are being flouted: we are witnessing a trend  towards rearmament. A future arms race between  China, the United States and Russia with regional  spillover effects cannot be ruled out. Strategic sta- bility is difficult to achieve in a multipolar world.  We are already facing the ever-present risk of the  misuse of cyberspace for geopolitical, intelligence  and military purposes.  Numerous multilateral organisations are strug- gling to maintain their capacity to act because  of growing divergences between their member  states. The law of the strongest is gaining ground,  especially in security and trade relations. The US  historian and foreign-policy commentator Robert  Kagan encapsulated this trend in the title of his  2018 book The Jungle Grows Back.  Kagan’s argument overreaches, however: multi- lateralism is not finished, but it is changing and  increasingly fragmented. Governance structures  are becoming more diverse, with sometimes  competing and overlapping interests.  New cooperation networks are also emerging, for  example between cities. Rapid worldwide urban- isation is turning cities into key players in efforts  to address climate, energy and migration issues.  Digitalisation is enhancing non-governmental  actors’ ability to shape developments. This trend  also places limits on nation states’ ability to reas- sert their sway.  A stable new global order is unlikely to emerge  any time soon from this tangled web. For small  and medium-sized countries like Switzerland,  whose prosperity and security depend on a rules- based system, these trends pose a real challenge.  Protecting its interests will become much  more challenging for Switzerland in the  years ahead.  The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?      4    Experts are saying that a new bipolar world order  – divided this time into US and Chinese spheres of  influence – is a real possibility. But it is no more  likely than other scenarios. Although confronta- tions over regional conflicts are more frequent  and often more intense in multilateral forums like  the UN, positive results are still being achieved  on many issues. With the 2030 Agenda, the Paris  Agreement and the global compact for migration,  the UN has been able to develop solutions to glob- al challenges. A reformed multilateralism certainly  has a future and Switzerland can help to shape it.  2.1.3. 2030 Agenda: progress towards  development and global challenges  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop- ment provides a global framework for economical- ly, socially and environmentally sustainable develop- ment. Adopted in 2015, the Agenda sets common  goals for all states and marks a break with the old  north-south paradigm. It also constitutes a basis  for forward-looking development cooperation. The  agenda is also a benchmark for International Gene- va, as many of the organisations based there are  contributing to its implementation.   The world has made significant development  progress. The proportion of children dying before  reaching their fifth birthday fell from 36% at the  turn of the 20th century to 4% in 2015. The pro- portion of adults with basic literacy skills rose from  21% to 85% over the same period. Over 2.5 bil- lion people gained better access to clean drinking  water between 1990 and 2015. Per capita income  is a particularly telling indicator of progress: the  proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell  from 41% in 1981 to 10% in 2015.   Despite this progress, enormous global challeng- es remain. Among these are numerous crises  and conflicts, often escalating to extreme lev- els of violence. Today’s conflicts also last longer  than they did some 20 years ago. A multiplicity  of causes and actors make it more difficult to find  lasting solutions. Most conflicts are still intra-state  conflicts but they are increasingly becoming proxy  wars orchestrated by regional and major powers.  Although wars between the world’s major powers  are unlikely, there is a growing risk of unintention- al escalation triggered by military provocations.  Fragile states are still a major challenge. Accord- ing to the OECD, 24% of the world’s population  now lives in a fragile state, and by 2030 this figure  could rise to 28%, to 2.3 billion people. The fight  against poverty has been comparatively unsuc- cessful in fragile states: by 2030, over 80% of  people living in extreme poverty are likely to be in  such countries.  Demographic trends are important indicators  of future development. Many fragile states are  experiencing high population growth. According  to UN forecasts, the world’s population is expect- ed to increase by 2.2 billion between 2017 and  2050. Over half of this increase will take place in  Africa, whose share of the world population is  expected to rise from 17% to 26%. Europe is the  only continent where the population will decline in  absolute terms. Europe’s share of the world’s pop- ulation will fall from 10% to under 8% by 2050.  Asia already accounts for over 60% of the world’s  population, and its share will continue to increase.  Fragile contexts  Extremely fragile contexts  Source: OECD, States of Fragility Report 2018  Fragile states – focus on Africa  5      The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?    Africa and Europe face diametrically opposed  demographic challenges: Africa has a very young  population (40% of Africans are under the age of  15) for whom jobs will have to be created. It is  estimated that 800 million people will enter the  labour market by 2050. Dynamic entrepreneurship  is fast becoming the key to Africa’s future. Europe,  in contrast, will have to deal with the problems of  an ageing population. The rising costs of the wel- fare state, coupled with stalled reforms in many  countries, are compounding the challenges.  Migration will remain a crucial political issue. An  increase in rural-urban migration and in migra- tory pressure from the South to the North are to  be expected. While the rate of migration is rising  only moderately in relation to the world’s popu- lation, the relative share of migration towards  Europe, the United States and the Gulf States has  increased: In 2017, 30% of the world’s 258 million  migrants lived in Europe. Half of them migrated  within Europe. Migration policy will likely contin- ue to focus on preventing irregular migration  from Africa. Europe will continue to face migratory  pressure.  Instability in Europe’s southern neighbourhood  not only drives migration to Europe but also pos- es a persistent threat of jihadist terrorism. It is  conceivable that technological developments will  allow terrorism to become smarter and more dan- gerous in the future. Depending on the political  and economic situation, there is also a risk of an  increase in left-wing or right-wing extremist  violence.

Ecological drivers:  sustainability as the basis  for prosperity and security  Together with climate change, environmental  de gradation is a critical global challenge. Both will  be at the centre of social and political attention  in the years ahead. The enormous economic and  social growth the world has experienced since the  middle of the 20th century has come at an increas- ingly high environmental cost. Natural resources  are being overexploited and the consumption of  fossil fuels is unsustainable. Environmental impacts  threaten to undermine development progress.  For several years now, the World Economic Forum  Global Risks Report has been placing environmen- tal risks at the top of global challenges. Policy- makers have in fact taken measures to reduce the  environmental footprint. In certain areas, there is  some evidence of a trend reversal: the ozone layer  has begun to show signs of recovery since ozone-  depleting chemicals were banned. The ozone layer  is healing itself. Overall, however, the environmen- tal trend is negative. Achieving the economic and  social goals of the 2030 Agenda will require greater  progress in the Agenda’s environmental dimension.  2.2.1. Critical thresholds of planetary  boundaries have been reached   Scientific research on the various planetary  boundaries to absorb waste and pollution has not  advanced equally far for all these boundaries. But  there is little disagreement among experts that  critical thresholds have been reached or will soon  be reached in many environmental areas:   according to UN environmental reports, global  air pollution is worsening despite progress in  the industrialised countries. Polluted air kills up to  7 million people each year. Soil quality is also  deteriorating. Almost one third of the world’s  land mass is affected by soil degradation.  Biodiversity is declining dramatically. Biodiver- sity loss reduces the ability of ecosystems to per- form vital functions. Western and central Europe  have witnessed a 60% decline in species diversi- ty in recent decades. Global populations of ver- tebrates have declined by 60% on average since  1970. Depending on the habitat, between 25%  and 42% of invertebrate species are now threat- ened with extinction.  The acidification of the world’s oceans and  marine plastic waste are another environmental  disaster. Freshwater quality is also deteriorating.  In addition to contamination by bacteria, chem- icals, pesticides and heavy metals, the dissemi- nation of antibiotic resistance via waterways is a  major concern. Antibiotic resistance is becoming  a global threat to health and food security. Fur- thermore, rising water consumption causes water  shortages: According to the UN, by 2040 over  30 countries – almost half of them in the Middle  East – will face “extreme water stress”. This occurs  when over 80% of available water resources are  used up.  low (<10%) low to medium (10–20%) medium to high (20–40%) high (40–80%) extremely high  (>80%)  Source: World Resources Institute  Water stress: forecast for 2040  7      The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?    2.2.2. Climate change as a megatrend  Climate change is the primary ecological driver.  Annual carbon dioxide emissions have quadrupled  since 1960. As a consequence, sea levels are ris- ing and weather patterns are changing. Extreme  weather events are becoming more frequent,  more severe and more widespread.  Climate change is a megatrend that affects all  countries. It exacerbates adverse environmental  impacts and affects all societies and economies.  Developing countries lacking sufficient resources  to adapt to climate change are particularly affect- ed. In large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa, climate  change is threatening crop yields, food security  and incomes. Climate change could push 100 mil- lion people back into extreme poverty by 2030.  The World Bank estimates that climate change  could displace over 140 million people by 2050.  Densely populated coastal regions such as the Nile  Delta and Bangladesh, as well as various Pacif- ic island states, are particularly threatened. Heat  stress could make many sub-Saharan regions unin- habitable.  Switzerland is also feeling the effects of cli- mate change. As a landlocked country, it does  not benefit from ocean-driven temperature reg- ulation. Average temperatures in Switzerland  are already 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This  means that in Switzerland, climate warming is  twice the global average. Switzerland is affect- ed directly both by more heatwaves with nega- tive consequences for people’s health and by the  progressive melting of its glaciers. It is also bears  an indirect brunt of climate change, for example  through migration and bottlenecks in the supply  of important goods.  The scale of future risks largely depends on our  ability to limit global warming. Climate mitiga- tion is now becoming a vital global task. The  Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in glob- al average temperature to well below 2°C by the  end of this century. According to the UN, climate  mitigation efforts need to be tripled to achieve this  goal.  In essence, the aim is to ensure economic growth  while reducing carbon emissions. Sustainability  will become a cornerstone of prosperity and secu- rity. Systematic incentives for sustainable and scal- able innovations could be an important means to  achieve this. New technologies will play a pivotal  role, alongside political initiatives, to significantly  reduce the environmental impacts of consumption  and production. They are all the more important  given that the environmental policy measures tried  so far have been largely ineffective in addressing  the challenge of climate change.   The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?      8    2.3. Technological drivers:   the digital transformation  is picking up steam  In the years ahead, new technologies are set to  become the principal drivers of change – with  consequences for global politics, the environment,  the global economy and society. We are on the  cusp of a quantum leap in information and com- munication technologies. Today, around 11 billion  devices, sensors and people are connected to each  other. By 2030, that number is projected to jump  to 200 billion devices.   2.3.1. A new phase in digitalisation   Building on the Internet of Things, big data and  cloud technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is ush- ering in a new phase of digital transformation. AI  enables machines to learn from experience, adapt  to new information inputs and perform tasks that  require human-like intelligence. AI systems already  outperform humans in some cognitive tasks. AI is  also beginning to catch up with humans in terms  of sensorimotor skills and is also making progress  in social intelligence. That said, people are unlikely  to be ever overtaken by AI systems in social intel- ligence skills.  Digitalisation 2.0 will become a key driver of inno- vation, value creation and growth. It will transform  the way we live, work and grow old. But it also  carries enormous risks, for example in the military  sector and in the field of surveillance. AI also rais- es a number of sensitive foreign policy issues for  Switzerland.  As the raw material of the 21st century, data is  changing the very foundations of power. Whoever  possesses big data and AI technology has a strate- gic power advantage. There are signs that a tech- nology race for supremacy in AI is already under- way, particularly between the United States and  China. Beijing is investing enormous sums in new  technologies. The government wants to use AI to  catapult China’s economy into the future but also  to ensure public security and monitor and con- trol Chinese citizens ‘intelligently’. Technological  nationalism could become a defining trend, to the  detriment of the free and fair use of technological  innovations. Internet freedom is an achievement  that is increasingly under threat.  2.3.2. The fourth industrial revolution  Like communication technologies, biotechnolo- gy and gene technology are also on the verge  of major innovations. In the health sector, new  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures bring enor- mous opportunities, but also raise ethical questions.  Genetically modified or gene-edited crops promise  to do the same for agriculture. Nanotechnologies  and bionics will also change industrial production.  We are witnessing the beginning of a Fourth Indus- trial Revolution. It will be driven by the convergence  of digital, biological, and physical technolo- gies. This convergence will multiply the potential for  change inherent in each of these technology sec- tors. Compared to this networked digital world, the  physical world will become less important econom- ically. Some experts are predicting that the Fourth  Industrial Revolution will significantly exceed earlier  revolutions in terms of speed, scale and impact on  economic, social and political systems.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution also holds great  potential for addressing environmental challenges.  New technologies will help to reduce humanity’s  ecological footprint and shape interactions between  people, businesses and the environment in a sustain- able way.  Rapid developments in robotics, machine learning  and automation will also impact labour markets  worldwide. Manufacturing will be fully computer- ised and new production techniques and processes  promise significant productivity gains. Many jobs,  including high-skilled ones, are likely to be replaced,  which could result in greater social inequality.  At the same time, however, new technologies always  usher in innovations and new tasks to manage  the interaction between people and machines.  Countries like South Korea and Japan, for example,  have remarkably low unemployment rates despite  the fact that robotics are highly integrated in their  value-added chains.  The disruptive impact of the Fourth Industrial Revo- lution on labour markets and society will depend on  the extent of the gap between automation and the  emergence of new types of occupations. The tran- sition requires appropriate framework conditions,  for example at the level of education and training.  Technological advances should benefit the greatest  possible number of people.   9      The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?    2.4. Economic drivers:  trade and production changes   Technological change is also driving global eco- nomic developments: the Fourth Industrial Revo- lution alters trade flows. The reason for this is  a transformation of the global industrial sector:  companies with large manufacturing plants scat- tered across different countries are not likely to be  the model of the future. AI and lower production  costs are driving a trend away from mass manufac- turing towards local, small-scale production: this  allows companies to relocate production plants  closer to their customers and their sales markets.  This will on the one hand give international com- panies a greater incentive to embed themselves  more firmly in the local economy, potentially con- tributing to more inclusive growth in peripheral  regions. But on the other hand, some production  lines that were offshored to low-wage countries  will move back to OECD countries.   2.4.1. Glocalisation  Companies from countries with small domestic  markets – such as Switzerland – face particu- lar challenges, but are also presented with new  opportunities. The global textile industry, which  will undergo a major transformation with the  advent of smart fabrics and e-textiles, is a case in  point. A combination of lower production costs,  Swiss expertise in textile manufacturing and in  the electronics sector could give new impetus to  the Swiss textile industry. In the industrial sector  almost 60% of all exported goods are unfinished  products that pass through global value chains.  This figure will decline in the future. Production  processes will increasingly be glocalised.  Technological advances will place particular  demands on developing countries. Industri- alisation may in future not be the key driver of  development it has been until now. Low-skilled  industrial jobs will probably reduce in numbers.  The leitmotiv of the 2030 Agenda – not to leave  anyone behind – takes on a new meaning in light  of technological transformation.  Developing countries are, at the same time, under  ever greater pressure to improve their econom- ic framework conditions in order to continue to  attract investment. Some developing countries  have a greater capacity for adaptation than indus- trialised countries, as they are less encumbered  with long-established structures standing in the  way of change. Moreover, technological advances  – the smartphone is just one example – are now  available almost everywhere at the same time. If   developing countries set the right course, they can  create new prospects for growth.  On balance, high-wage industrialised coun- tries are likely to be in a better position than  emerging countries to rise to the challenge  of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This could  slow down the structural shift of power from the  West to other parts of the world. Nevertheless,  how individual countries will ultimately develop in  the future remains an open question.   2.4.2. Fragmented global trade order   The polarisation of global politics is now also  mirrored in the fragmentation of the internation- al trade order: The World Trade Organization is  struggling to maintain its relevance. It will have to  be reformed if it is to regain acceptance. In the  field of regulation, the trend is away from multilat- eral towards plurilateral agreements. Tariff reduc- tion and free trade agreements are now largely  regional and bilateral.  We are currently witnessing an escalation of pro- tectionist measures and countermeasures between  the trading powers which is weakening the global  trading order. As long as the global political arena  continues to be dominated by tensions between  the major powers, political goals and ambitions  will play a significant role in world trade. Further  geo-economic tensions are likely.

Social drivers:   identity politics, inward turn  and demands for greater  say in decision-making  Fragmentation also has an impact on society. The  fundamental principles of the democratic model  are increasingly contested in Western societies.  Public discourse is suffused with unease towards  political institutions and decision-makers. Protest  movements are altering the party-political land- scape. Domestic polarisation hampers effective  governance.  2.5.1. Defensive reflex against  globalisation  The defensive reflex against globalisation has mul- tiple causes, ranging from the failure to address  the negative consequences of the financial and  debt crisis of 2008 to the refugee crisis of 2015.  The redefinition of values is also a defensive reflex  against globalisation. While globalisation has nar- rowed the economic gap between developed and  developing countries and opened up new oppor- tunities for millions of people, it has also produced  greater income inequality within many countries  around the world. The job losses caused by the  Fourth Industrial Revolution will potentially lead to  more social protests. Moreover, as people become  more affluent, many also fear that they will be  deprived of their new prosperity. That is why scep- ticism of globalisation is increasingly widespread  in countries that have largely benefited from it in  recent decades.  Identity politics and an inward turn are  becoming increasingly important factors in polit- ical life. Many people around the world feel a  loss of democratic control. Wherever internation- al rules and standards are laid down in response  to globalisation, we also see calls to recover lost  sovereignty. What is more, traditional political  parties, particularly in Europe, are coming under  growing pressure as a result of this dynamic. They  are losing support just as political movements are  attracting it.  This political malaise is fanned both by state and  non-state actors that are spreading disinforma- tion. Open societies have become more vulnerable  in the age of digitalisation. Strengthening socie- ties’ resilience to fake news campaigns will be a  major task. Schools will have to play a key role in  teaching students how to judge news and infor- mation.  The challenge is all the greater as AI-generat- ed deepfake technology that allows the digital  manipulation of videos and images will make it  increasingly difficult to distinguish genuine from  false information.  Social media encourage the fragmentation of  values and political views. While social media  allows people in an individualistic world to read  news from sources they would not otherwise have  access to and to exchange information with a wid- er range of people, it also creates echo chambers  and filter bubbles that increasingly induce them  to consume personalised information and filter  out other opinions. This phenomenon can under- mine social cohesion.  2.5.2. Transnational movements  Digitalisation fosters the emergence of new trans- national identities and movements. In virtual com- munities, people organise themselves across geo- graphical and political boundaries. Young people’s  current efforts to mitigate climate change are a  prime example of this transnational dynamic. They  are demanding a greater say in decision-making  but are not sceptical of globalisation per se. The  Me-Too movement is another example, but so are  jihadist terrorism (Al-Qaeda and the ‘Islamic State’  group) and organised crime.  Switzerland still enjoys a high level of social cohe- sion. But there is also growing unease in Switzer- land about international regulatory processes, a  fact that Swiss foreign policy should not ignore.  The world in 2028 – what do we have to prepare for?      12    2028 Foreign Policy Vision  The second chapter outlined the changes hap- pening in the world and showed what they mean  for Switzerland, while highlighting the drivers of  development. The Foreign Policy Vision translates  these changes – at both the global and national  level – into options for action.  AVIS28 identifies six foreign policy areas for inno- vation. The vision begins by describing an opti- mum condition in 2028, before setting out pro- posals – in the form of building blocks that can be  combined to gear foreign policy to achieving this  optimum scenario.  3.1. Foreign policy based on  clearly defined interests and  Switzerland’s value compass  In order to continue its success story, Switzerland  should define its interests more clearly and pursue  them more prominently in future. In Switzerland’s  case, interest-driven politics does not mean pow- er politics or unilateralism. And Switzerland must  not lose sight of its core values. On the contrary: in  Switzerland, interests and values coincide. They are  two sides of the same coin.  Switzerland’s inner strengths should continue to  guide its foreign policy. Switzerland’s commitment  to democracy and the rule of law, to dialogue and  a culture of compromise, to human rights and  gender equity, and to humanitarian principles is a  core element of its foreign policy. A Swiss foreign  policy devoid of values would lack strength and  credibility. Switzerland is known throughout the  world for its humanitarian tradition, and solidarity  forms part of its understanding of what a state  should be and do.  However, safeguarding national interests has tra- ditionally been the primary focus of foreign policy.  The geopolitical and trade policy developments dis- cussed here will make this task much more demand- ing for Switzerland in future. Others are envious of  the country’s prosperity and, as an independent  actor, Switzerland will become the target of more  frequent international pressure. What is more, in a  multipolar world, the country will be forced to take  a position on controversial issues more often than  has hitherto been the case.  For that reason, Switzerland should take a much  closer look at its interests. Only by knowing its   interests can it effectively defend them. With that  in mind, Switzerland will be able to have a say in  the international arena: pursuing a policy based on  interests means exercising influence and shap- ing decisions.  The vision is based on four main components or  building blocks:  3.1.1. A shared understanding  of interests  The article in the Federal Constitution that sets  out the aims of the Swiss Confederation provides  the starting point for defining these interests.  From a foreign policy viewpoint, Switzerland’s  security, welfare and independence are its  core interests. Added to these are the long-term  preservation of natural resources and the promo- tion of a just and peaceful international order as  the basis for security, welfare and independence.  Art. 54 of the Federal Constitution names impor- tant sub-areas of foreign policy. It states that “the  Confederation shall ensure that the independence  of Switzerland and its welfare is safeguarded; it  shall in particular assist in the alleviation of need  and poverty in the world and promote respect for  human rights and democracy, the peaceful co-  existence of peoples as well as the conservation of  natural resources.” In its dispatch on the Federal  Constitution, the Federal Council notes that this  list is not exhaustive. It also states that Article 101  of the Federal Constitution, according to which  the Confederation “shall safeguard the interests  of the Swiss economy abroad”, crystallises the   The vision   By 2028, Switzerland’s foreign policy will  deliver on strategic priorities based on clearly  defined interests and its values.    Foreign policy will articulate thematic  and regional priorities. Switzerland will be  consistent in its dealings, including those with  the major powers.    It will leverage the potential afforded by its  independence while pursuing its interests  in cooperation with like-minded countries.  3  13      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    powers conferred on foreign policy by law. In  other words, foreign policy is also foreign eco- nomic policy.  The Federal Constitution thus specifies the key  values of foreign policy while leaving considera- ble scope as to how that policy is defined. Foreign  policy may be developed further in line with inter- national requirements and domestic preferences.  A broad discussion could reveal how Switzerland’s  interests manifest themselves in this context: the  aim is to give specific form to security, prosperity  and independence as the country’s core interests  – while including the cross-cutting areas of inter- national order and sustainability.  Security becoming more important   Security is becoming increasingly important in  the context of foreign policy. It is in Switzerland’s  interest that states – and particularly the major  powers – resolve conflicts peacefully. Peace  means more security and prosperity.  An international order that puts law before power  is just as important. It is in Switzerland’s interest  to defend and further develop the achieve- ments of this order, which include strong secu- rity organisations such as the UN and the OSCE,  respect for the rule of law and international law,  promoting democracy, and a functioning arms  control system.   All states should have access to the new technol- ogies as a tool for peace on the basis of common  standards. An open, free and stable cyberspace  is equally in Switzerland’s interest. Democracy and  the rule of law must be protected against espio- nage and be able to withstand influence and dis- information. Lastly, Switzerland helps safeguard  the security of its citizens by means of consular  protection.  Geographically, the stability of Europe around it  is key to Switzerland’s security. In recent decades,  Switzerland has benefited from the stabilising effect  of NATO and European unity. However, social and  political changes in many states indicate that this  stability can no longer be taken for granted.  Europe’s neighbours to the south and east take  high priority too: Africa, the Middle East, the  Western Balkans and the Eastern European  countries between Russia and the EU are priority  regions for Switzerland’s contributions to stabilisa- tion. The aim is to create development prospects  locally, reduce the pressure of migration to Europe  and avoid the threat of terrorism and organised  crime. In addition, the inclusive pan-European  security order should be strengthened. Switzer- land can help achieve this by building confidence  and trust in relations between Russia and the  West, and defending the OSCE principles: it can  also work to bolster prospects and stability in the  countries situated between the EU and Russia.

In  this way, foreign policy contributes to the coun- try’s internal cohesion and helps safeguard its  system of social welfare. Supporting Swiss busi- ness abroad thus takes on even more importance.  Securing market access for Swiss companies  and maintaining fair competition rules will become  more difficult: companies should be able to trade  and invest without discrimination. Alongside mar- ket access, this also requires legal certainty when  making long-term investments and the protection  of intellectual property.  A rules-based international order is essential for  Switzerland to prosper. Priority must go to a World  Trade Organization with the capacity for effective  action, and further rounds of multilateral trade lib- eralisation. However, while progress here remains  blocked, the focus will be placed on plurilateral  and bilateral trade agreements. Free trade policy  is crucial to Switzerland as an exporter. Market  access boosts the country’s competitiveness and  the attainment of full employment.  Its key markets are: the EU, the United States, Chi- na and – if Brexit happens – the United Kingdom.  However, for Switzerland and its prosperity, main- taining and expanding the global scale of its  foreign trade policy is key. The most common- ly named growth markets for Switzerland today  include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan,  Mexico, South Korea and Turkey.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution will require busi- nesses, the state and its citizens to adapt to large- scale change with wide-ranging consequences.  Foreign policy will have to respond via new forms  of governance that enable this change to be  accompanied by suitable regulation.  The prosperity of other countries contributes sig- nificantly to Switzerland’s prosperity – yet another  reason why it is in Switzerland’s interest to pro- mote development in other countries. The  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pro- vides a meaningful framework for its efforts in this  area. Enabling global economic growth that pro- duces fewer emissions is another important task  facing Swiss foreign policy.  Independence: freedom of action and  new opportunities of neutrality   Independence means freedom of action. The  primary consideration here is to protect people  against the arbitrary use of power. International  agreements are a suitable instrument for achieving  this. Rather than weakening Switzerland’s sover- eignty, rules-based treaties actually prevent deci- sions being made solely according to ‘might makes  right’. But this does not mean that Switzerland  should enter into as many of these agreements  as possible. The important point is that the agree- ments it does conclude should be in the national  interest and enjoy domestic support.   Pursuing its own foreign policy remains Swit- zerland’s best guarantee of independence.

The pros  of an independent free trade policy can turn into  cons if actors such as the EU follow suit and use  their greater market power to enter into agree- ments that are potentially more favourable. It also  remains to be seen how Switzerland can defend  its independence and capacity to act in the digital  sphere. Nevertheless, the advantages of pursuing  an independent foreign policy outweigh the dis- advantages at present.  Going forward, an intelligent combination of  independence and openness will be decisive. It  is in Switzerland’s interest to maintain political  relations with all other states and to adhere to its  policy of dialogue. Independence calls for an agile  foreign policy, an extensive global presence and  sound knowledge of other cultures.  Swiss neutrality is a trump card in the country’s  independent foreign policy. It was being called into  question in the 1990s, when not actually being  declared obsolete. Now it is once more opening  up opportunities for Switzerland. The protective  function of neutrality will play a less prominent  role as long as Switzerland is surrounded by the  EU and NATO. Instead, neutrality gives Switzerland  much greater room for manoeuvre in foreign pol- icy terms. Thanks to its neutrality, it can propose  solutions as a credible actor, with the other actors  knowing that it has no hidden power-politics  agenda in doing so.  Neutrality is also important to the country’s host  state policy and good offices. It creates fresh pros- pects for Switzerland in relation to digital transfor- mation, for example: Switzerland is an ideal venue  for discussing and regulating certain aspects of  tomorrow’s world that are already highly politi- cised, such as artificial intelligence.   3.1.2. Setting regional   priorities  As an independent state situated between centres  of power, Switzerland has an interest in maintain- ing an extensive geographical presence. However, it  cannot be omnipresent and it cannot do everything.  It will have to set priorities:  Europe remains the key region for Switzerland’s  prosperity and security. The EU-28’s share of global  GDP (PPP) may have fallen from 21% to 16% over  the last decade and now looks likely to decline fur- ther in the next 10 years. However, this trend does   nothing to diminish the paramount importance  of the EU single market to the Swiss economy. In  2018, 52% of all Swiss exports went to the EU and  70% of all imports came from EU countries. Even  without the United Kingdom, the EU-27 will remain  Switzerland’s main market, accounting for 48% of  its exports and 66% of its imports (as at 2018).  Defending Switzerland’s interests with regard to  the EU is of strategic importance, as is working  together with the EU – and not just when it comes  to market access. Numerous matters that were  previously considered to fall under domestic policy  have taken on a European dimension in recent dec- ades. The ability to participate in European research  programmes is essential if Switzerland is to remain  a hub of innovation. Issues relating to national  security are also increasingly being dealt with at the  European level.  Switzerland needs relations with its neighbours to  be stable and built on trust. Germany, France, Italy  and Austria alone account for two thirds of bilat- eral trade with Switzerland. The volume of trade  between Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg is  equal to that between Switzerland and China. If  and when Brexit comes to pass, full market access  and a close partnership with the United Kingdom  will become paramount.  The transformation of Eastern Europe and Central  Asia has been uneven. The dismantling of democ- racy and deepening of geopolitical divides is not in  Switzerland’s interest. Continuing its dialogue with  Russia and Turkey based on constructive criticism,  stabilising the Western Balkans and resolving the  conflicts in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus  remain important fields of action.   Africa’s stability is also of strategic interest to Swit- zerland. As far as North Africa is concerned, the  focus is on economic development and migration  cooperation. Progress in stabilising the crisis regions  south of the Sahara – stretching from Mali to Lake  Chad to Somalia – is another matter of importance  to Switzerland’s security. This area is marked by high  fragility, conflict, terrorism, high rates of poverty and  population growth.  However, the problems associated with migration  should not be the sole focus of attention. Non-  European states have recognised the continent’s tre- mendous economic potential and are making huge  investments in Africa. Even though the region cur- rently accounts for only 1.5% of total Swiss trade,  promoting the African market and encouraging the  business world to make more use of the opportu- nities it affords is in our national interest as Africa’s  economic development benefits Switzerland’s own   2028 Foreign Policy Vision      16    prosperity and security. As well as promoting this  development by helping Swiss companies to seize  opportunities, Switzerland should also expand its  political presence in the region.  The Middle East is one of the most important  regions for Switzerland’s security. Unlike Africa,  the Middle East’s overall economic importance  is likely to stagnate or even decline. The region is  witnessing momentous upheavals, with numerous  geopolitical, ethnic and religious lines of conflict  reducing the prospects for stabilisation. Violent  conflict, poor governance, increasing water scar- city, population growth and youth unemployment  rates as high as 30%: these are the realities. Grow- ing numbers of migrants attempting to reach  Europe via the Mediterranean are to be expected.  It is in Switzerland’s interest to prevent the region  from destabilising further and to assist it in achiev- ing progress. Preventing and defusing conflicts,  exercising protecting power mandates, water  diplomacy, respect for international humanitar- ian law and promoting regional cooperation are  potential elements of a firm engagement for  peace.  Switzerland has an interest in improving econom- ic prospects in this region too. Efforts to encour- age start-ups and young entrepreneurs could be  stepped up, in the occupied Palestinian territory  for instance. The rights of individuals as entre- preneurs and employees could be strengthened  by giving them access to formal markets. There is  the potential for greater cooperation with certain   countries in the areas of business, science and aca- demia, and finance. As in Africa, refugees in the  Middle East should receive support locally.   Asia presents a major opportunity for Switzerland  in business terms. According to the OECD, by 2028  four of the five largest national economies in this  region – China, Japan, Indonesia and India – will  generate half of global GDP. By 2030, two thirds of  the world’s middle class will live in Asia. Asia’s share  in Swiss foreign trade rose from just under 12% to  over 23% in the last decade.  Asia is also becoming a centre of world politics,  making Switzerland’s presence in the region all the  more important. As far as security policy is con- cerned, Asia is less directly relevant than Africa or  the Middle East. Nevertheless, Switzerland has an  interest in resolving conflicts peacefully and pro- moting cooperative security structures. Bilateral  relations with China already cover a wide range of  areas. There is potential to build on relations with  other countries, including India, which will become  more important to the Swiss economy while also  playing an anchor role for democracy in the region.   The focus in the Americas is on relations with the  United States. Switzerland’s interests elsewhere  in this region are less prominent. It has econom- ic interests in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Bilateral economic relations with these countries  could be expanded. One important topic is coop- eration in combating corruption. Switzerland also  works closely with a large number of these states  in a multilateral setting, especially when it comes   50  40  30  20  10  0  Source: International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database.

The same is true of Canada, Switzer- land’s second largest trading partner in the region.   3.1.3. An eye on the   major powers  When it comes to safeguarding Switzerland’s inter- ests, the country’s relations with the major powers  are growing in importance. Improvements are nec- essary here. In a world dominated by great-power  diplomacy, power politics and unilateralism, an  independent Switzerland needs to have clear strate- gies for dealing with the most influential actors and  viable political relations with them.  Although the Federal Council recognised the  importance of priority countries outside Europe as  early as 2005, the approach it adopted of enter- ing into ‘strategic partnerships’ with the BRICS  countries, the United States, Japan and Turkey  nevertheless failed to produce the desired effect  in some cases. Relationships are too asymmetrical  and were defined too strongly in terms of cooper- ation rather than actual content. As a result, these  bilateral relations are at times administered rather  than actively defined at the policy level.  In future, relations with priority countries  should be defined on the basis of strategies  that combine political, security, economic, tech- nological, scientific and sustainable develop- ment matters, with Switzerland’s interests and  high- potential areas serving as a starting point.  High-potential areas include Switzerland’s good  offices, which continually open doors that would  otherwise remain closed.  Coherence between the departments in their han- dling of such priority countries is paramount. Swit- zerland’s consociational democracy presents it  with particular challenges in this respect. Country  strategies that define clear goals and for which the  Federal Council is responsible have the potential  to serve as an instrument here. While they may  not represent a ’one size fits all solution’ for the  wide range of voices and agendas in Switzerland,  they nevertheless facilitate a ‘big picture’ view that  reduces the segmentation of foreign policy.  Coherent strategies are called for in relation to the  United States, China and Russia in particular – the  foremost powers at present.  The USA remains very important to Switzer- land’s prosperity and security. Switzerland  must take due account of the continuing US dom- inance of the international order. Bilateral relations  are based on a solid historical foundation, largely  shared values and close cultural and human ties.  An estimated 1 million people with Swiss roots live  in the United States. It is by far the most impor- tant destination for direct investments by Swiss  companies. The United States is Switzerland’s  second largest trading partner, and Switzerland  is the seventh largest investor in the US and one  of its top twenty trading partners. Conditions in  the US market for non-US companies are becom- ing tougher. Switzerland has an interest in deep- ening its relationship with the United States and  strengthening the framework conditions for doing  business with it. A free trade agreement and closer  cooperation in the field of international financial  market regulation would help achieve this.  Measured by the number of diplomatic visits, rela- tions with Washington have been less intense in  the last few years than those with Beijing.

Closely linking foreign  and domestic policy to  prevent a loss of trust  A culture that views foreign policy as part of  domestic policy and domestic policy as part of for- eign policy must be actively promoted and gain  broad support. More weight should be given to  this aspect of foreign policy in future. As a semi-  direct democracy, scepticism towards politics and  globalisation is less evident in Swiss society than  in other Western countries. But a sense of unease  can be felt in our country too. People’s trust in  foreign policy must be strengthened by linking for- eign and domestic policy more closely.  AVIS28 describes four building blocks for linking  foreign and domestic policy more closely:  3.2.1. Closer cooperation with  Parliament and the cantons   National legislation is increasingly being supple- mented by European and international forms of  regulation. Foreign policy has a greater impact  on legislation and domestic policy processes than  was previously the case. Many norms negotiated  at the global level can no longer be fundamentally  altered at the national level.  More soft law instruments are emerging in place  of agreements under international law. These qua- si-legal instruments are referred to as ‘soft’ as they  have no binding force under international law.  They are easier to negotiate and can help maintain  an international framework of rules and norms in  the face of political stalemates. However, they are  not generally put before national parliaments for   The vision   By 2028, foreign and domestic policy will be  closely linked.    Swiss foreign policy will have a broad  domestic support base as it meets the  expectations of the general public. It will be  based on continuous dialogue and a whole-of- Switzerland approach.    Foreign policy will have a fixed place  on the Federal Council’s agenda. The  latter will determine the direction of  foreign policy, in close consultation  with Parliament and the cantons, and  with clearly defined responsibilities.  a strategic partnership. Looking beyond the pro- tecting power mandate in Iran and Venezuela and  cooperation on vocational education and training,  new areas of cooperation should be considered.  These include new technologies and new issues  of international law. Switzerland has a wealth of  expertise to offer in repatriating illicitly acquired  assets of politically exposed persons. Stepping up  cooperation with influential US think tanks may  also serve to safeguard Switzerland’s interests in  the long term. If Switzerland wants to assert its  multilateral interests on the global stage, it must  also articulate them vis-à-vis Washington and seek  to cooperate with the United States in areas in  which it makes sense to do so.  Switzerland has succeeded in establishing  very close relations with China. Switzerland  became the first country in mainland Europe  to conclude a free trade agreement with China,  which is now its third most important trading part- ner. Around 30 sectoral dialogues are being held  on a variety of topics, illustrating the fact that Bei- jing has responded more positively to the idea of a  strategic partnership than other priority countries.  In addition, around 20 cantons and cities have  now established economic and cultural partner- ships with Chinese provinces and municipalities.  The Federal Council should draw up a clear strate- gy for its policy on China over the coming years in  a way that intelligently combines the opportunities  and challenges associated with cooperation. As  well as developments within China itself, the wid- er international frame of reference must be tak- en into consideration. Should the world become  more politically polarised, Switzerland’s relation- ship with China could become more complicated.  Although close economic relations and strategic  dialogue remain important, they should form part  of an effective overall strategy.  Russia is not one of Switzerland’s top trading  partners. However, the country’s weight in global  affairs makes Moscow an important player with  regard to Swiss foreign policy. Relations between  the two countries have become more fraught  since the annexation of Crimea and various espi- onage and cyber incidents. However, more than  other European countries, Switzerland remains  committed to dialogue rather than isolation, as  evidenced by its good offices – specifically the  protecting power mandates in Georgia and Rus- sia – and the firm belief that security can only be  achieved in Europe by working with Russia rather  than against it.   3.1.4. Structured cooperation  with like-minded states  Switzerland can defend its interests on the global  stage by stepping up its cooperation with certain  partner countries. It already works together with a  group of like-minded states, above all on specific  topics and at the technical level.  A more tightly structured form of cooperation  with some of these like-minded countries (LMCs)  on policy and transversal issues would lend itself  to this purpose. Although these countries are not  among the most dominant actors on the world  stage, they are nevertheless relevant. They pursue  similar interests to Switzerland, and previous expe- rience has shown them to be reliable. They advo- cate for a peaceful world order, are committed to  results-based multilateralism and work together as  equals. Their positions often converge, for exam- ple in areas such as peace, human rights, the envi- ronment, energy and science.  LMCs are most likely to be found in Europe. But  not only there. With tomorrow’s world in mind,  Switzerland should also integrate non-Europe- an countries into an LMC strategy. Moves in this  direction have already been made below the polit- ical level: for instance, Denmark, Finland, Ireland,  Israel, New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland  all collaborate as part of the Small Advanced  Economies Initiative. These industrialised coun- tries with around 5 to 10 million inhabitants each  work together on issues related to economics and  innovation. Other formats should be looked into,  such as setting up a K7 group of smaller states as  a counterpart to the G7. An LMC strategy would  allow promising partnerships for the future to be  built: Switzerland can promote its interests more  effectively by joining forces with others.   19      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    3.2. Closely linking foreign  and domestic policy to  prevent a loss of trust  A culture that views foreign policy as part of  domestic policy and domestic policy as part of for- eign policy must be actively promoted and gain  broad support. More weight should be given to  this aspect of foreign policy in future. As a semi-  direct democracy, scepticism towards politics and  globalisation is less evident in Swiss society than  in other Western countries. But a sense of unease  can be felt in our country too. People’s trust in  foreign policy must be strengthened by linking for- eign and domestic policy more closely.  AVIS28 describes four building blocks for linking  foreign and domestic policy more closely:  3.2.1. Closer cooperation with  Parliament and the cantons   National legislation is increasingly being supple- mented by European and international forms of  regulation. Foreign policy has a greater impact  on legislation and domestic policy processes than  was previously the case. Many norms negotiated  at the global level can no longer be fundamentally  altered at the national level.  More soft law instruments are emerging in place  of agreements under international law. These qua- si-legal instruments are referred to as ‘soft’ as they  have no binding force under international law.  They are easier to negotiate and can help maintain  an international framework of rules and norms in  the face of political stalemates. However, they are  not generally put before national parliaments for   approval. This development has sparked debate in  a domestic policy context about roles and respon- sibilities.  If Switzerland is to represent its interests effectively,  it must present a united front. To achieve this, the  Confederation must collaborate with Parliament  and the cantons on foreign policy matters on the  basis of trust. The foundations for such a relation- ship appear to be intact: the rights of Parliament  and the cantons to participate in foreign policy  decisions have been expanded since the 1990s.  The Federal Council is thus obliged to consult the  foreign affairs committees on important plans. The  cantons can ask to be consulted on the preparation  of foreign policy decisions, and the federal govern- ment can choose to consult them of its own accord.  Furthermore, the cantons often form part of the  Confederation’s negotiation delegations, especially  with respect to matters of European policy.  Nevertheless, action is required, even though the  basic situations differ. On the one hand, there is  no longer a sense of clearly defined cooperation  between the Federal Council and Parliament on  foreign policy. The latter bemoans its loss of con- trol and lack of involvement, while the former feels  its powers in foreign policy matters are increas- ingly being called into question. In the Federal  Council’s view, the growing number of parliamen- tary interventions constitute undue interference  in its foreign policy. On the other hand, relations  between the Confederation and the cantons are  comparatively more stable. The question to be  discussed here is whether participatory federalism  should be extended, given the increasing influence  of EU law on national legislation.  If Parliament and the cantons are to cooperate  more closely with the Federal Council, this must  happen without restricting the latter’s capacity  to act. In 2028, the power to make foreign policy  must continue to lie, first and foremost, with the  government. The formal definition of responsibil- ities for foreign policy should remain unchanged  and serve as the basis for cooperation.   What measures are needed to consolidate a  shared understanding of the foreign policy  roles of the Federal Council and Parliament?  An important first step would be to improve the  way in which the existing rules are implemented.  In other words, the government must be made  more aware of Parliament’s rights to participate  in shaping foreign policy. At the same time, Par- liament’s involvement should concentrate on stra- tegic aspects. The government must enjoy more  freedom again when it comes to the operations  management side of foreign policy.   The vision   By 2028, foreign and domestic policy will be  closely linked.    Swiss foreign policy will have a broad  domestic support base as it meets the  expectations of the general public. It will be  based on continuous dialogue and a whole-of- Switzerland approach.    Foreign policy will have a fixed place  on the Federal Council’s agenda. The  latter will determine the direction of  foreign policy, in close consultation  with Parliament and the cantons, and  with clearly defined responsibilities.  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      20    However, there is also a need to define Parliament’s  participation rights more precisely. This applies  especially to soft law. The first point that should  be clarified is the content of this policy instrument  and how it is delineated from other instruments.  Second, it must be decided which soft law agree- ments the committees are to be consulted on and  in which form. Given the number of agreements  of this kind, Parliament will have to restrict itself to  the most significant cases. The challenge will lie in  assessing what qualifies as ‘significant’.  In addition to defining participation rights more  precisely, the Federal Council should advocate in  the international arena for parliamentarians to  be given a greater role in shaping soft law within  international organisations. The OECD consulta- tion mechanisms and the Parliamentary Assembly  of the Council of Europe and the OSCE can serve  as models here.  In the case of the cantons, there is a need to  clarify the extent of their rights to participate  in shaping foreign policy. The division of roles  is undisputed and the participation processes are  well established. The cantons are demanding to  be consulted more frequently on European policy  matters, and at an earlier stage: receiving compre- hensive information would enable them to play a  greater role in shaping the Swiss agenda on Euro- pean policy. The cantons would like to see their  concerns taken into account more systematically in  the preparations for treaty negotiations.  The cantons are proposing that any loss of auton- omy occasioned by the agreements with the EU be  compensated by according greater weight to their  own positions.  This would allow the federalist state structure to  be preserved. In the case of European policy plans  that touch on their powers, the cantons believe  their consolidated opinions should now be con- sidered ‘legally binding inter pares’ (in German:  ‘relative Bildungswirkung’). This means that the  Federal Council would only be able to deviate  from the agreed position if there were overriding  foreign policy interests for doing so. It would also  have to set down its reasons in writing. Lastly,  cantonal representatives are calling for the exist- ing mechanism through which the cantons discuss  European policy with the federal government to  be developed into a more formalised joint coordi- nation body.  The Confederation and the cantons aim to main- tain their well-functioning partnership on foreign  policy. A joint analysis should determine whether  the opportunities for the cantons to have a say  need to be adapted.  It should be added that there is no adequate legal  basis for foreign policy at present. There is no  framework act for foreign policy, and the Federal  Act on Development Cooperation is outdated.

Now is the time to review whether new  legal bases that reflect the growing importance of  foreign policy will be required for the future.   3.2.2. Expanding the dialogue  on foreign policy   Looking beyond Parliament and the cantons, for- eign policy must gain broader support among the  general public. A national dialogue on foreign pol- icy and Switzerland’s interests is desirable. A cit- izen-centred foreign policy that enables ordinary  people to seize the opportunities presented by  rapid change is a fundamental cornerstone of the  Switzerland of tomorrow.  Greater use should be made of relevant com- petencies and networks outside of the Federal  Administration in achieving foreign policy goals.  The FDFA should pursue a whole-of-Switzer- land approach. Cooperation with Swiss NGOs  is already well established and important. These  organisations play a major role in realising inter- national cooperation goals. However, the partner- ships could benefit from an even clearer strategic  direction inspired by the 2030 Agenda. The new  SDC strategy for cooperation with Swiss NGOs  provides a good basis from which to start.  The FDFA also maintains regular contact with sci- entific institutions and think tanks. This could be  stepped up: shared expertise strengthens Switzer- land’s capacity to act in a foreign policy context.  The Swiss Institute of International Studies (SIAF)  was set up back in 1943, with the aim of providing  “qualified guidance in difficult times”. The Federal  Council was one of the driving forces behind this  decision. With the three Geneva Centres and sev- eral other centres of excellence in peace, security,  European and economic policy issues, Switzerland  now has a wealth of expertise in global matters  at its disposal. Much could be done to build on  cooperation with the Swiss business world too,  whose competencies, contact networks and local  knowledge could be of great benefit in shaping  and implementing foreign policy (chapter 3.3).  Citizens’ forums attended by diplomats  could make a significant contribution to bring- ing foreign and domestic policy closer together.  Switzerland’s representatives around the world  work in an environment which is sometimes  far removed from ‘everyday life at home’. It is  important for them to remain in touch with the  debates and finer feelings regarding domestic   policy. At the same time, the general public is  not necessarily all that familiar with foreign poli- cy. People in Switzerland should get to know the  Federal Council’s foreign policy priorities better.  The opportunity to exchange views directly with  Swiss diplomats stationed around the globe will  boost interest in foreign policy and encourage  greater awareness on both sides. Organising a  ‘Tour de Suisse’ of community halls could spark  genuine debate on current foreign policy issues  from Geneva to Appenzell.  Another option would be to put more foreign  policy matters out to consultation. Consulta- tion procedures offer all stakeholders the opportu- nity to state their position and viewpoints early in  the decision-making process. This instrument has  seldom been used in relation to foreign policy thus  far. Doing so in future would allow the Federal  Council to generate broader domestic support for  its foreign policy at an earlier stage. Conducting  periodic surveys on foreign policy – using social  media, among other things – could also help take  the pulse of the people.   3.2.3. The Federal Council preserving  the lead in foreign policy  Today, federal councillors have little time to spend  on foreign policy and visits abroad, even though  international regulation is becoming increasing- ly important in every department. Switzerland’s  political system is geared towards domestic policy.  Improvements are possible without having to fun- damentally reform the system. However, paying  more attention to public opinion at home must  not cause the Federal Council to relinquish its lead  role in foreign policy.  It should attach greater weight to foreign policy  issues at its meetings, and ensuring that suffi- cient time is set aside to deal with these issues will  become even more important in future. The Fed- eral Council could increase its strategic scope for  decision-making by holding more special closed  sessions on foreign policy topics while at the same  time reaffirming its claim to leadership.  The Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy  for the legislative periods should set a clear direc- tion and be implemented consistently. To date,  these strategies have not had sufficient impact  on the practical work of the Federal Administra- tion. In addition, the wider public has barely been  aware of them.   The strategic bases of the Federal Council’s for- eign policy should serve as actual mandates that   2028 Foreign Policy Vision      22    improve the convergence between Swiss foreign  and domestic policy. Clear goals and measures are  required.  3.2.4. Communication is  integral to foreign policy  Communication is essential in linking foreign and  domestic policy more closely. It not only consti- tutes a form of management support, but can  also serve as a strategic foreign policy instrument.  On the one hand, the task is to create a broader  domestic support base for foreign policy by com- municating and explaining it in an easy-to-under- stand manner.  On the other, communication is growing in impor- tance as a means of safeguarding foreign policy  interests. How Switzerland is seen by the rest  of the world has an impact on its opportunities  for action and its attractiveness as a place to live  and do business. Given the global competition  between states, Switzerland must actively shape  the way in which it is perceived abroad. It must not  allow its image to be determined by actors seek- ing to create advantages for themselves according  to their own interests and agenda.  Consequently, communication must be more  closely linked to content. Switzerland must  develop key messages and strategic narratives  for the relevant dossiers and communicate them  whenever it has the opportunity. Targeted mar- keting is one way of supporting foreign policy by  influencing how Switzerland is seen abroad.  The majority of new communication instruments  and arenas are digital. They should be used sys- tematically as an effective means of conveying the  key messages of foreign and domestic policy to  the relevant target groups. This is an area in which  government politics lags behind. Non-state actors  use digital communication to increase their power  to define topics and thus boost their political influ- ence. Completely new political marketing instru- ments have emerged in the digital sphere, such as  collecting signatures over the internet or crowd- sourced lobbying. This refers to the sending of a  vast number of emails from members of the public  to members of Parliament, for instance, and marks  the beginning of a new political trend.  Social media open up opportunities for foreign  policy. But they also decentralise communication,  which can be challenging for an organisation like  the FDFA. A clear definition of responsibilities and  powers is required, and employees must be given  more training.  Lastly, communication plays a key role in protect- ing against disinformation. Although Switzer- land clearly does not require a Ministry of Truth, it  should nevertheless counter fake news with effec- tive, fact-based information. At the same time,  the education of tomorrow will also mean helping  citizens to exercise and preserve their digital sov- ereignty.  3.3. A greater focus on the needs  of citizens and businesses  Foreign policy should put citizens first and pro- mote economic interests to a greater extent than  before. The support of citizens and the Swiss busi- ness community must become a core element of  foreign policy.  Services for citizens are an established area of  foreign policy, and one that is appreciated by the  public. The challenge here is to adapt the services  on offer to changing needs and to keep up with  rising expectations.  Switzerland’s foreign policy has room for improve- ment when it comes to supporting foreign trade  interests. Considerable opportunities for entering  into win-win cooperation agreements will open  up in this area. However, placing greater emphasis  on economic issues should not detract from other  FDFA priorities such a peace, security and develop- ment. On the contrary – it could lend them new  dynamism.  The vision    Services for Swiss citizens and close  cooperation with Swiss businesses are  recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy in  2028.    Both target groups will receive unbureaucratic  help, more and more delivered through digital  channels. Foreign policy and trade policy will  operate as a homogeneous whole. Market  access, legal certainty and protecting the  investments of Swiss companies are priority  foreign policy commitments.    At the same time, the private sector is an  active partner in addressing sustainable  development and climate change mitigation.  23      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    3.3. A greater focus on the needs  of citizens and businesses  Foreign policy should put citizens first and pro- mote economic interests to a greater extent than  before. The support of citizens and the Swiss busi- ness community must become a core element of  foreign policy.  Services for citizens are an established area of  foreign policy, and one that is appreciated by the  public. The challenge here is to adapt the services  on offer to changing needs and to keep up with  rising expectations.  Switzerland’s foreign policy has room for improve- ment when it comes to supporting foreign trade  interests. Considerable opportunities for entering  into win-win cooperation agreements will open  up in this area. However, placing greater emphasis  on economic issues should not detract from other  FDFA priorities such a peace, security and develop- ment. On the contrary – it could lend them new  dynamism.  Looking forward to 2028, the following three  building blocks create a suitable foundation:  3.3.1. Tailored services   abroad  There are over 760,000 Swiss nationals living  abroad, and the trend is rising. Foreign travel is  also increasing. Whereas the Swiss made 11.5 mil- lion trips abroad in 2012, that number had risen to  more than 15.5 million in 2017.  Providing support to Swiss nationals residing  abroad and travellers in need is one of the basic  tasks of foreign policy. Any Swiss citizen requir- ing help in an emergency situation will receive  consular protection. Thus, for example, Swiss  representations will advise the relatives of people  who have gone missing or been kidnapped.  This area of foreign policy will see many changes  in the coming years. New technologies will open  the way to greater efficiency and better services  that are more in touch with citizens’ needs. The  result: a more personal form of support, and  bundled consular services. A considerable  number of consular functions involve standardised  work processes. Intelligent machines can reduce  the workload of employees and boost service effi- ciency. Providing a range of digital consular ser- vices will create a one-stop shop where customer  needs can be addressed quickly and straightfor- wardly. Using AI-supported solutions would allow  Switzerland to deliver a tailored service to its citi- zens abroad in future – both remotely and locally.  Consular activities could be linked more  closely with other areas of foreign policy.  Digital transformation creates new potential  for Switzerland to market its consular activities.  Regional communities of Swiss abroad can be  addressed more specifically through digital chan- nels. They can be made more aware of Switzer- land’s position on European policy issues or other  international topics.   The vision    Services for Swiss citizens and close  cooperation with Swiss businesses are  recognised assets of Swiss foreign policy in  2028.    Both target groups will receive unbureaucratic  help, more and more delivered through digital  channels. Foreign policy and trade policy will  operate as a homogeneous whole. Market  access, legal certainty and protecting the  investments of Swiss companies are priority  foreign policy commitments.    At the same time, the private sector is an  active partner in addressing sustainable  development and climate change mitigation.  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      24    3.3.2. Foreign policy is also  foreign economic policy  Switzerland generates more than of half of its GDP  abroad. Since 1995, its trade-to-GDP ratio – i.e. the  sum of exports and imports measured as a share  of gross domestic product – has risen from 69% to  over 90%. In addition to multinationals, two-thirds  of Swiss SMEs also operate internationally.  Of the 5,000 Swiss companies with fixed places of  business abroad, 4,000 are SMEs. Swiss compa- nies have created two million jobs abroad through  direct investment. Three quarters of all Swiss  employees work for companies involved in inter- national trade.  The Swiss export industry contributes significantly  to Switzerland’s prosperity. In some cases, techno- logical upheaval and growing geopolitical tension  present it with major challenges: competition is  fiercer than ever and market access more difficult.  In future, the Swiss economy will no longer have  the same exclusive access to the innovations and  technology developments on which its success is  based.  Currency risks must be added to this scenario. The  euro has fallen by more than 30% in value against  the Swiss franc since it was first introduced. A  scenario in which the two currencies reach pari- ty cannot be ruled out. The extent to which cen- tral banks will still be able to intervene in future  remains uncertain. Great-power rivalries are also  having an effect on currency movements. Russia  and China are calling the US dollar into question as  a reserve currency and have reduced their purchas-  es of US Treasuries. Experts doubt that Switzerland  would be able to handle a further exchange rate  shock as well as it did in 2015.  Commitment to a successful Swiss export  industry should be put back at the heart of  Swiss foreign policy. It is true that this topic  has always been part of foreign policy and that  the external network plays an important role in  this respect. Nevertheless, the FDFA should attach  greater importance to promoting foreign trade  interests and should coordinate closely with the  other competent agencies in doing so. Despite the  administrative lines that separate them, foreign  and trade policy should be thought of as one. The  whole-of-government approach that has proven  its worth in migration and health policy points the  way forward.  More market access, more legal certainty and  proper protection for innovations are topics that  should be placed high up on the bilateral and mul- tilateral foreign policy agenda. Air transport con- nections are another factor of importance to the  Swiss economy.  The agendas being set by international organ- isations are becoming more important. This is  especially true in relation to issues such as cli- mate change that cut across countries and remits.  Although these topics are not being addressed by  trade organisations, they are relevant to global  trade and have the ability to distort it. Stepping  up foreign policy engagement in this area will only  be successful, however, if Switzerland develops a  common agenda for its export and domestic econ- omies. That way, trade-offs between further free                                                                                               3 .19                                                                                2  .8 7                                                                              2.  77                                        1 .5  2                         1.  06           0. 57      0.  42      0.  40    0 .3  3  0. 29  200,000  150,  000  100,000  50,000  0  Fr an  ce  Ge rm  an y  US A   Ita ly  Ca na  da    UK    Au st  ra lia  Sp ai  n  Is ra  el  Au st  ria  Top ten: Swiss abroad 2017  Swiss nationals living abroad  Number of persons   3.5  3.0  2.5  2.0  1.5  1.0  0.5  0  Fr an  ce  Ita ly  Ge rm  an y  Sp ai  n  Au st  ria UK  Po rt  ug al  Ne th  er la  nd s  US A  Gr ee  ce  Travel destinations Number of overnight stays in million                                                             19 6,  30 0   | 2 6.  1%                                        8 8,  60 0   | 1 1.8  %                                   7  9, 90  0  | 1  0. 6%                    49 ,6  00  |   6. 6%             3 9,  70 0   | 5 .3  %           35 ,0  00  |   4. 7%      24  ,9 00   |  3.  3%    2 3,  50 0   | 3 .1%   19 ,9  00  |   2. 6%  16 ,2  00  |   2. 2%      Source: Swiss Federal Statistical Office  Top ten: Swiss abroad 2017  25      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    trade agreements and agricultural policy could be  reduced.  As well as becoming more important, Swiss  export promotion still has improvement poten- tial. A large number of actors are currently involved  in delivering support to Swiss businesses abroad:  Switzerland Global Enterprise with its Swiss Busi- ness Hubs in over 20 target markets, bilateral  chambers of commerce, cantonal economic pro- motion bodies, Swissnex, Switzerland Tourism and  Switzerland’s diplomats.  However, there is neither a global strategy nor any  form of global branding in place. Creating a syner- getic platform would allow the business commu- nity to satisfy all its needs for information, advi- sory and support services in foreign markets via  one central point of contact. The Swedish model  is a source of inspiration: Business Sweden runs  50 offices in 4 priority regions and offers a wide  range of services in 7 priority export areas.   3.3.3. Swiss business as a  partner for the 2030 Agenda  and climate change mitigation  Any form of foreign policy partnership with the  business community cannot be a one-way street.  Increasing the promotion of foreign trade interests  cannot be the sole objective. It would also be in  the economy’s interest for Swiss companies to  make a greater contribution to implementing the  Federal Council’s foreign policy strategy. Business  representatives should be more involved in foreign  policy discussions, as they were in the past. The  divide between business and politics that opened  up in the wake of the financial crisis must be  closed again.  Swiss businesses could play a greater role in the  country’s international cooperation activities. Thus  far, the focus has been on financing solutions  for public-private partnerships and guidelines  for doing business in a way that respects human  rights. The goal should now be to create a gen- uine partnership drawing on private-sector  expertise through which joint projects are  realised. This also forms part of the 2030 Agen- da. The ability of the private sector to create new  markets and scalable innovations will help achieve  the Sustainable Development Goals (chapter 3.4).  Partnership between the state and the business  community is especially important in relation to  climate and environmental issues. There is a grow- ing need for action on both sides that calls for  joint solutions: foreign policy should help establish   a global framework of action which permits inter- nationally agreed rules and implementation mech- anisms to be adopted and creates general condi- tions conducive to innovation, thus leaving room  for entrepreneurial solutions. The international  environmental regime must become more coher- ent, effective and efficient. When implementing  the Paris Agreement, it is essential that we comply  with the transparency rules and promote a green  economy. The marketplace for emissions trading  should be internationalised and include countries  outside Europe. Switzerland can do more to help  developing countries carry out climate and envi- ronmental measures.  As for the business community, it has a duty to  make better use of resources and generate few- er emissions, and to push ahead in finding entre- preneurial solutions to environmental and cli- mate problems. In addition to the real economy,  the financial sector should also make more of a  contribution to mitigating climate change and  promoting sustainable development. Sustainable  finance, which integrates environmental, social  and governance criteria into financing and invest- ment decisions, improves the chances of achieving  the 2030 Agenda. As a financial hub, Switzerland  could play a leading role here.  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      26    3.4. Leveraging Swiss soft power for a  more peaceful and stable world  The commitment to sustainable development,  peace and security and a rules-based international  order will remain a priority for Swiss foreign poli- cy. The need for international action is great, and  Switzerland has much to offer. Guided by its com- prehensive understanding of security, it makes  high-quality contributions geared towards the  long term and pursues a complementary foreign  and security policy.  By working towards a more peaceful and stable  world, Switzerland is investing in its own prosper- ity, security and independence. This commitment  gives its foreign policy greater impact and reso- nance. Switzerland’s engagement builds networks  and goodwill for Swiss interests in other areas.  Switzerland can create and shape more here than  in other foreign policy fields, and is seen as a cred- ible and reliable partner in international cooper- ation.  However, domestic political expectations mean  that Switzerland needs to act in a more focused  and efficient way in the future. For this reason,  its efforts to promote a more peaceful and stable  world must have stronger backing within society  and dovetail more with its domestic policy con- cerns. In addition, individual instruments must be  adapted in accordance with the global changes  underway.   The following building blocks will help to create a  sustainable policy combining development cooper- ation, peacebuilding and security, as well as com- mitment to a rules-based international order:   3.4.1. The profile of development  cooperation sharpened and  anchored domestically   In many ways, development cooperation is a major  component of Swiss foreign policy, accounting for  over half of the FDFA’s budget. Thanks to a strong  international presence, it is an important element  in Switzerland’s external relations, and projects  the country’s values and image around the world.  Properly deployed, it can achieve greater strategic  impact than many other instruments.  For a globalised economy such as Switzerland’s,  sustainable development is a necessity. Precise- ly because of its relative weight, development  cooperation, more than other instruments, needs  political backing within Switzerland. Measures will  take time to implement, but they will make Swiss  development cooperation more agile in its imple- mentation of the 2030 Agenda.  The vision   Swiss foreign policy in 2028 will leverage its  core strengths to build a more peaceful and  stable world.    Development cooperation will be focused,  with a broad domestic support base, and  will attach strategic importance to reducing  migratory pressure. Switzerland will help  to foster economic development in close  cooperation with the private sector and other  partners. It will create jobs and improve  prospects in target countries, relay Swiss  know-how on governance, education and  environmental issues, and find innovative  solutions to reduce poverty.     Swiss expertise in peacebuilding will be much  sought after in 2028. Peacebuilding will be  backed by a clear strategy, broad-based  political support and attractive packages    of good offices. Switzerland will be able to  respond quickly and flexibly to requests  for its good offices. Important peace  negotiations will take place in Switzerland  or with Switzerland as an intermediary.   Peacebuilding efforts and development  cooperation will be closely coordinated.    In 2028, Switzerland will adopt effective  initiatives promoting results-oriented  multilateralism in order to bolster the  rules-based international order. It will work,  both offline and online, to foster respect  for international law and human rights.  Switzerland will set international benchmarks  by involving companies in the promotion of  human rights and the development of global  standards. International Geneva will be a  leading and innovative centre of governance,  a place that shapes the digital transformation.    27      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    Development cooperation – high-profile,  interest-led and focused  Development cooperation is both an expression of  Switzerland’s solidarity and part of its interest-driv- en policy approach. Establishing clear links between  development cooperation and Switzerland’s own  interests will help to boost domestic political accept- ance of the former. The principle that development  cooperation is a foreign policy instrument should be  given greater emphasis. This will require action at  the FDFA head office, in terms of communication  and on the actual form of development coopera- tion.  The stronger focus on geographical and themat- ic priorities is an important step towards making  development cooperation even more effective and  giving it greater political support within Switzer- land. In 2016/17, the 20 countries that benefited  most from Swiss bilateral development assistance  accounted for 24% of total development assistance  expenditure. This percentage should be significantly  higher in 2028. Bilateral development cooperation  should focus on regions whose political and eco- nomic stabilisation creates maximum leverage for  the countries concerned, as well as for Switzerland.  Priority consideration should be given to Europe’s  southern and eastern neighbourhoods, namely Afri- ca, the Middle East, the Western Balkans and Eastern  Europe. In these focus regions, Switzerland’s securi- ty, economic and migration interests converge. The  prosperity gap between Africa and Western Europe   must be reduced in a sustainable way. Finally, the  prospects for people in crisis-hit regions of the Mid- dle East should be improved.  Greater weight on economic development  The private sector creates 90% of all jobs world- wide and plays a crucial role in tackling poverty.  Sustainable economic growth is the best way to  reduce poverty. There is no magic formula for  achieving this, but a key ingredient is promoting  local entrepreneurship and innovation.  Switzerland should focus more on sustainable  local economic ecosystems by working with  international companies and NGOs and engaging  closely with the state-owned Swiss Investment  Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM), which aims  to give local SMEs access to capital and exper- tise. As an umbrella fund, SIFEM invests primarily  in other funds. Another model worth exploring  for Switzerland is that of the Dutch development  bank FMO, which invests directly in the private  sector in 85 developing countries and emerging  markets, mainly in infrastructure, microfinance  and sustainability. The aim of such public invest- ment is to enable, rather than to replace, private  investment. SIFEM’s capital base is small by inter- national standards. It would need to be increased  as the fund develops.      0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  1950 1965 1980 1995 2010 2025 2040 2055 2070 2085 2100  Africa Asia   Europe    Latin America and the Caribbean  Forecast share of world total of working age population (15–64) by region (percentage)  Africa needs jobs  Source: UNCTAD Economic Development in Africa Report 2018  Africa needs jobs  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      28    As well as agile entrepreneurship, sustainable  growth also requires the right framework condi- tions. There is need in many cases to modernise  governance structures and promote good gov- ernance, as functioning state institutions and the  rule of law are prerequisites for economic devel- opment. To achieve this goal, it will sometimes be  necessary to work with corrupt regimes and state  administrations, unsatisfactory though this is.   In the choice of priority areas, greater emphasis  should be placed on countries where growth and  its effects can spill over into neighbouring coun- tries. Swiss business interests will act as a leading  indicator in this regard. In Africa, for example,  Angola, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana,  Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa are con- sidered potential drivers of economic growth.  Rather than comprehensive development cooper- ation programmes, these countries tend to need  ad hoc assistance with combating corruption and  money laundering as well as with better legisla- tion, investment protection, justice and tax policy.   Step up cooperation with Swiss companies   It is not only large corporations that should be  looking to the African continent. Swiss SMEs can  play a key role in promoting local entrepreneurship  as a driver of development. Private investment in  Africa is key. The federal government should do  more to foster and safeguard this investment by  further developing tools and instruments such as  start-up support and high-quality advisory ser- vices, provided for example by Swiss representa- tions in the countries concerned.  New forms of cooperation and interaction  between governmental and non-governmental  actors are needed, going beyond private sector  funding of development cooperation activities.  An indicator of this is the transfer of expertise  by the private sector, for economic development  requires input from professionals with the rele- vant practical experience. One approach would  be to create a pool of experts from the private  sector, the federal government and cantons,  deployed on missions lasting several months,  along the lines of the peacebuilding and Swiss  Humanitarian Aid corps.   Build on Swiss strengths: governance,  education, environment, innovation  International development cooperation is chang- ing. Some donor countries, such as China and the  Gulf States, have a different development philos- ophy from Switzerland. A clear profile is therefore  all the more important: Switzerland needs to focus  on strengths that are embedded in its own political  system but which also confer added value globally.  In other words, it has to harness its soft power.  Switzerland’s core strengths will be increasingly in  demand internationally.  Switzerland has strengths in the following areas:   • Governance: this is often where the greatest  barriers to development lie. Switzerland has  experience and credibility when it comes to the  rule of law, good governance, human rights,  proximity to citizens and subsidiarity.  • Education: Switzerland’s experience with educa- tion at all levels, and especially with vocational  skills development, can improve the prospects  of young people in developing countries and  emerging economies. Education is becoming  more important than ever for economic devel- opment.  • Environment and climate change: the need for  expertise to reduce emissions and pollution  and use natural resources more efficiently will  increase. For example, technical assistance and  investment will be needed to enable develop- ing countries to generate energy for electricity,  heating and cooling in a cleaner, more efficient  and sustainable way. The Swiss cleantech indus- try can help to deliver solutions here. Expertise  in coping with more frequent and intense natu- ral disasters and dealing with major challenges  in water supply will be increasingly sought after.   However, the way in which Switzerland does  development cooperation is also a key aspect of  its profile. Its capacity for innovation is an asset  that deserves to be made more of:   • Firstly, the international programmes through  which Switzerland helps to address global chal- lenges are pioneering, as in areas such as food  security and health. Swiss know-how and resourc- es may be instrumental in the development of  innovative global solutions.  • Secondly, according to the OECD, Switzerland  is characterised by innovative partnerships and  financing models, as well as the flexibility to adapt  programmes as needed.  29      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    • Thirdly, Switzerland could help to boost the effec- tiveness of development cooperation by means  of new technologies. For example, artificial intel- ligence (AI) could improve the early detection of  negative trends and thus strengthen prevention.  Switzerland could help developing countries to  harness the opportunities offered by the digital  transformation while reducing the associated risks  (see section 3.5).  Focus on tackling causes in Swiss  foreign policy on migration  Switzerland needs safe and regular labour migra- tion to maintain its prosperity. However, it also has  every interest in preventing irregular migration.  This can only be achieved through multilateral  efforts and bilateral engagement. The strategic  linking of development cooperation and migration  policy should be put into practice systematically.  Switzerland will remain true to its development  approach. While many countries, under heavy  political pressure, are opting to channel their  development funds into short-term security solu- tions designed to tackle unwanted immigration,  Switzerland should continue to pursue a foreign  policy on migration that is both holistic in its  impact and geared towards the long term.  Within this context, Switzerland should invest even  more heavily in addressing the causes of migration  as a means of preventing it. First and foremost,  this means working in regions of origin to improve  the economic, social and political prospects of  people there. Protecting and looking after refu- gees and migrants in the places where they are  should be a priority. Where there is no foreseeable   prospect of return, Switzerland should promote  the economic self-reliance of people in countries  of first refuge. It can assist displaced persons with  repatriation and help them to rebuild their lives  after returning to their countries of origin, as well  as helping countries of origin and transit to put in  place migration policies. Bilateral migration part- nerships should be expanded.  A key factor in foreign policy on migration is  demographics. In Africa, lowering the birth rate  is vital to secure significantly greater prosperity for  the population. Among other things, this requires  specific preventive education to improve family  planning and an overall rise in education levels for  the entire population. The current literacy rate is  stagnating at just over 60%.   Forge close links between development  cooperation and humanitarian aid   Humanitarian aid plays a key role in ensuring the  stability needed to create prospects for displaced  persons in the places where they find themselves,  usually regions of countries of first refuge which  adjoin the crisis-hit areas. Development coopera- tion and humanitarian aid must engage with each  other more closely and on a continuous basis. In  protracted crises, it becomes impossible to divide  up the needs of the population according to dif- ferent international cooperation instruments.  An integrated approach is needed, aimed at free- ing people from their dependence on emergency  relief. Humanitarian aid can help to create better  long-term prospects for the population so that  they no longer have to rely on emergency relief.  Conversely, development cooperation, which   Less than 0 0 to less than 50 50 to less than 100 100 to less than 150 150 and over Source: Berlin Institute for Population and Development  Based on data from: UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs  Population development 2015–60 Percentage   2028 Foreign Policy Vision      30    is geared towards long-term impact, needs to  become more operationally flexible so that it can  respond appropriately to rapidly changing con- texts.  Switzerland’s humanitarian tradition is integral to  its good reputation, and a distinct profile and uni- versal approach will help to ensure that it remains  a credible humanitarian actor in the future. The  country has soft power and internationally recog- nised expertise in the form of the Swiss Humani- tarian Aid Unit.  Regarding the future direction of Swiss Humani- tarian Aid, it should be borne in mind that coun- tries affected by natural disasters are making few- er appeals for international assistance. Thanks in  part to Swiss support, many countries now have  their own structures to deal with such crises inde- pendently. Indeed, the last time that Swiss Res- cue responded to an earthquake was in 2009.  The question of whether Swiss Humanitarian Aid  should undertake more direct action needs to be  examined. Such action is exemplified by the aid  convoys that it has been organising successfully in  Ukraine for some years. The need is there – not  least in Africa. At the same time, Switzerland is  well placed to make humanitarian aid more effi- cient by harnessing the potential of digitalisation.  The ICRC, its most important humanitarian part- ner, is a pioneer and a source of inspiration in this  area.  Maintain flexibility and a  willingness to take risks  Partly because of its financial weight, develop- ment cooperation has been in the political spot- light of late. Striking a balance between accounta- bility and operational freedom is vital. Too tight a  bureaucratic straitjacket would make development  cooperation actors unwilling to take risks in dif- ficult and fragile contexts, yet the ability to take  such risks is essential. It should be possible to try  out new approaches, for example on strengthen- ing ownership by the local population or promot- ing the rights of entrepreneurs.  3.4.2. Switzerland’s good offices  modernised and optimally positioned  Civilian peacebuilding enjoys widespread support  in Switzerland, and is part of the country’s foreign  policy DNA. By contributing to conflict prevention  and management, Switzerland enhances its own  security. Through its good offices, Switzerland  also strengthens its political contacts with senior  officials in the countries concerned.  While demand for mediation by independent third  parties is likely to increase by 2028, there are two  reasons why Switzerland, despite its excellent rep- utation as a promoter of peace, cannot afford to  rest on its laurels.  Firstly, peacebuilding has become more challeng- ing. Many conflicts are extremely complex, with  some involving ten or more parties, each with  widely differing interests, diffuse structures and  opaque chains of responsibility. The causes of con- flict have also become more complicated and the  forms of conflict more varied. Furthermore, the  global political environment is making conflicts  harder to resolve.  Secondly, peacebuilding is becoming increasingly  fragmented and the number of potential media- tors is growing. More and more European coun- tries are positioning themselves as mediators, with  more non-Western players also vying for conten- tion. In a competitive market for good offices,  Switzerland has to affirm its credentials and adapt  its offer accordingly.  Guiding principle: build peace from the  bottom up, leveraging Swiss strengths   As a result of political stalemates, the number of  major peace processes involving comprehensive  peace agreements is likely to decline. In many cas- es, peacebuilding activities will shift to the local  level and focus on certain aspects of a conflict,  with peace being built on more of a step-by-step  basis. This kind of bottom-up principle is ideal- ly suited to Switzerland, the holistic, long-term  approach to promoting peace reflecting its own  functioning as a state and as a society.  The promotion of dialogue, power sharing and  the involvement of all interests are increasingly  important factors in peacebuilding. Facilitating  local dialogue processes involving different social  groups should remain part of Switzerland’s peace  policy. Supporting women and young people in  conflicts and involving them in prevention and   31      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    peace processes can help to unleash new social  dynamics. Swiss expertise will remain in demand,  for example on constitutional issues, dealing with  the past and fighting impunity for war crimes.   Give peacebuilding a stronger political profile  In the future, simply offering standard mediation  services will no longer be sufficient. Such mandates  require political investment. While preserving the  discretion that is highly prized internationally, Swit- zerland should also try to be more politically active  in obtaining mandates. This is the only way that  it will hold on to its reputation as a leading play- er in mediation processes, alongside its bottom-up  peacebuilding work.  Achieving this will require political commitment,  a willingness to take risks and a clear strategy. An  attractive package of services and an involvement  on substantive issues are also important. In addition  to International Geneva, other locations could offer  the privacy and seclusion that parties in mediation  processes often say they need.  Swiss peace specialists promote peace policy efforts  and build up relationships of trust with conflict par- ties.     Where required, it should be possible to deploy  teams with the necessary expertise at short notice,  headed up by experienced diplomats and/or medi- ators. More special envoys, for specific conflicts or  issues such as water diplomacy, would give greater  political clout to efforts in this area.  If its application is successful, Switzerland’s mem- bership of the UN Security Council will raise its pro- file in the domain of peace policy by emphasising  Swiss soft power both internationally and domes- tically. It will give Switzerland, as a credible and  pragmatic player, the opportunity to build bridges  and will also have a positive impact on Geneva in  particular. Intensive discussions with member states  – including those with veto powers – will provide  Switzerland with an important additional platform  for safeguarding its interests bilaterally.   Good offices: look to the future  while holding on to tradition  The increase in tensions between states is leading  to a revival of interest in traditional forms of good  offices. These include protecting power mandates  as well as trust-building measures such as those  developed during the Cold War with substantial  Swiss input.

For  example, the basic concept of good offices should  become an integral part of a new foreign policy  on technology (see section 3.5). It could also be  applied to the business arena. Dispute settlement  mechanisms in the commercial sector are becom- ing increasingly ineffective due to the fragment- ed nature of legal systems. Swiss mediation in  economic and trade disputes would represent a  sensible addition to the good offices provided by  Switzerland. Indeed, there are already examples of  this in practice, as in the context of the Georgia  crisis, where Switzerland brokered an agreement  between Russia and Georgia governing customs  administration and the monitoring of trade in  goods.   Harness expertise and practical  knowledge for peacebuilding  Conflict resolution à la suisse should become a  brand that can be deployed even without direct  Swiss involvement. The courses launched by ETH  Zurich and the FDFA to train international and  Swiss mediators are one part of this approach.  Another idea would be a Swiss ‘manual’ setting  out practical peacebuilding measures. Bilateral  mediation dialogues, including with non-Western  countries, should be expanded.   Switzerland at the interface between  peace and development  The 2030 Agenda recognises that peace and sus- tainable development are mutually dependent.  In Switzerland, peacebuilding and development  cooperation are already closely linked in the con- text of international cooperation, thanks to com- mon reference documents and regional strategies.  However, the potential of international coopera- tion could be further maximised at an operational  level.  Switzerland’s water diplomacy activities illustrate  what it can achieve at the interface between  peace and development. Now a global brand,  Blue Peace sees Switzerland working in the Middle  East and Central Asia to transform water from a  possible cause of conflict into a driving force for  cooperation and peace. Such approaches to con- flict prevention have great potential  .   3.4.3. Building bridges to consolidate  a rules-based international order  Binding rules applying to large and small countries  alike are the prerequisite for peaceful coexistence  within the international community.  Switzerland  is dependent on a rules-based order for its pros- perity, security and independence. Effective mul- tilateralism is an integral part of this. Today, it is  easy to forget the huge benefits that Switzerland  derived from the international order established  after 1945. These benefits should be the subject  of renewed focus and communicated accordingly.  In our politically fragmented world, multilateral  action is becoming more challenging but also more  important. With power distributed more widely  between countries in all parts of the world, there  are growing divergences in interests and values.  The current changes in multilateralism are  ultimately the expression of a crisis of con- fidence in globalisation. These changes have  affected all international organisations, albeit in  different ways. Heavily value-based organisations  such as the Council of Europe are increasingly sub- ject to centrifugal interests, whereas organisations  like the UN, which act more as platforms for bal- ancing interests, are proving to be more stable.  Switzerland should continue to advocate tireless- ly for multilateral solutions and an international  order based on the rule of law. There is a growing  need for mediators that can conciliate between  competing interests. With its stable set of values  and its focus on practical compromise solutions,  Switzerland is well placed to build bridges.  Promote multilateral  organisations‘ ability to act  Multilateralism is in need of reform to reduce  bureaucracy, boost efficiency and improve out- comes. One area for improvement is the way that  organisations reach joint decisions between their  member states. The operational performance of  some organisations also needs to be enhanced.  Switzerland, together with partners, should sub- mit reform proposals in both these areas. Its  strong multilateral engagement means that it can  contribute credibly to these discussions.  The UN, with its universal membership and legiti- macy, is an important instrument for safeguarding  Swiss interests. At the economic level, Switzerland  should seek to be included in the G20 as a per- manent invitee, like Spain and Singapore. Discus- sions at this forum encompass a range of Swiss  interests, not only financial ones. In Europe, the   33      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    OSCE and the Council of Europe remain particular- ly important. At the same time, Switzerland should  continue its successful strategy of establishing for- mal relations with non-European regional organi- sations such as the African Union and ASEAN in  order to ensure more broad-based support for its  independent foreign policy.  In the multilateral context as elsewhere, Swit- zerland must pay particular attention to security  policy issues. The erosion of international arms  control is making Europe less safe. In cyberspace  and in the field of artificial intelligence, rules are  needed to prevent an arms race. Similarly, conflict  prevention can only succeed if it is underpinned by  multilateral agreements. Last but not least, Swit- zerland’s multilateral engagement should be more  firmly rooted in domestic policy.   Geneva as a laboratory for  reformed multilateralism  Over the past 100 years, Switzerland has succeed- ed in making Geneva one of the world’s leading  centres of international governance, where count- less decisions are taken that improve the lives of  millions of people. This focus on operational action  is one of Geneva’s strengths. For Swiss foreign pol- icy, Geneva offers a unique network of contacts  that could be even more systematically utilised.  In addition, International Geneva is a source of  prosperity, accounting for more than 10% of can- tonal GDP. The benefits for the country as a whole  far outweigh the costs. The International Geneva  brand, and indeed multilateralism itself, should  feature more prominently in domestic politics.  To help it achieve critical mass, International Gene- va should also become more broadly based within  the surrounding area, with the Lake Geneva and  French border regions more closely integrated.  This will require political commitment by Swiss pol- iticians and the development of a forward-looking  host state strategy.  Geneva’s unique assets, including its diversity of  actors, together with the neutrality and credibility  of Switzerland as a whole provide ideal conditions  for positioning Geneva favourably for the future.  This is all the more important given the mounting  global competition for dialogue and regulation  ‘hubs’.  Geneva will be able to stand out from this com- petition by establishing itself as a leading centre  for innovative forms of governance. These have  qualities that go beyond intergovernmental coop- eration as it currently exists, promoting the emer- gence of dynamic ecosystems involving a wide  range of actors and helping to develop solutions  on important future issues such as digitalisation.  Defend international law and  apply it in new areas  International law is a life insurance policy for Swit- zerland. The country should therefore prioritise  better compliance with existing obligations, espe- cially in the area of international humanitarian law,  which is coming under increasing pressure.  In new fields such as digital transformation, legal  instruments must be clarified and adapted to the  new realities (see section 3.5). Switzerland should  be at the forefront of these efforts. The same goes   GDP 11.3%  GDP 1%  =14% of jobs in the canton   of Geneva  30,000 indirect and induced jobs  =  4,000 employees  = 177  states represented by  a permanent mission  37 international  organisations  20,000 employees  = 2,700 employees  = 400 NGOs  = = > 3,300  meetings per year > 2,200  delegates 4,400   visits by heads of state,  ministers and other senior   officials  International Geneva facts and figures (2018)  Source: FDFA  International Geneva facts and figures (2018)  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      34    for the application of international law in cyber- space. The final item on this to-do list is working  out how to better involve non-state actors in inter- national agreements.  In the area of soft law, Switzerland must ensure  that it has the necessary expertise. Know-how in  international dispute resolution should be expand- ed. Given the fragmented nature of the interna- tional trade system, Switzerland will become a  party in disputes more frequently, with a grow- ing risk that countervailing measures will be taken  against it or that it will be taken to court. Swit- zerland will thus need to assert its interests with  equivalent means.   Protect the rule of law, human  rights and democracy   The rule of law, human rights and democracy are  three cornerstones of the current international  order, enabling individual freedom and allow- ing people to live their lives in the way that they  choose. But there is no guarantee that they will  remain in place by 2028 given the number of  countries now leaning towards the principle of  non-interference in internal affairs. Swiss efforts  in this area will remain important, but will become  more challenging owing to the increase in conflict- ing objectives.  Swiss efforts must not have the effect of pitting  human rights against economic interests. Swit- zerland has developed a number of promising  approaches aimed at working with the private  sector to develop standards on corporate respect  for and promotion of human rights, based on the  principle of self-responsibility. This partnership  approach to human rights policy has great poten- tial. Companies have a fundamental interest in  respecting human rights. At the same time, they  can help to improve the human rights situation  through their local engagement.  With the international understanding of human  rights also showing signs of fragmentation, Swit- zerland should work to promote human rights  dialogue between countries. Finally, the same  observation applies to human rights as to other  areas: new fields of activity throw up new chal- lenges, such as protection against identity theft or  cyberbullying, but they also bring opportunities. It  is therefore time to think seriously about the issue  of digital human rights.   35      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    3.5. Technology as a new topic  of Swiss foreign policy   Technology will drive not just far-reaching global  changes, it will also impact foreign policy. It would  be reductive to regard new technologies merely  as a tool. Rather, Switzerland should conceptualise  technology as a new foreign policy topic. A tech  foreign policy can help optimise the opportunities  afforded by new technologies while minimising  their risks for Switzerland and the world.  The Federal Institutes of Technology and other  research centres position Switzerland at the cut- ting edge of research in new technologies. This  is underscored by the country’s Impact per Paper  ranking in research on artificial intelligence (AI).  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the deep learn- ing process that is integral to all smartphones  today, was developed in Switzerland. The coun- try is, after all, a world leader in engineering and  robotics.  The relevant tech companies are located in Swit- zerland, and there is a high density of AI start-ups  per capita. In biotechnology, successful global  Swiss companies in the pharmaceutical, chemi- cal and agricultural sectors and the food industry  are playing a significant role. All of these compa- nies are shoring up Switzerland’s reputation as a  hub for innovation. Numerous other international  organisations and key players such as the WEF and  the ICRC are headquartered in Switzerland. They  are also key influencers in the debate on digital  transformation. Other multilateral organisations,  such as the UN, can benefit by networking locally  with these knowledge centres.  Switzerland’s foreign policy profile also predis- poses it to be a hub for technology themes. Swiss  neutrality is the basis for a credible tech foreign  policy. Its independence and reputation for medi- ation and building bridges serve as enablers for  new opportunities.  Consequently, the prerequisites for engaging with  technology themes through a distinct foreign pol- icy are there. At present, they are not being opti- mally combined. Switzerland has so far not been  well represented in the debates on new technolo- gies: the United States and China have been set- ting the benchmarks for AI, and Europe’s position  is being shaped by countries such as the United  Kingdom, Germany, France, Finland, the Nether- lands and Denmark.  In the time frame until 2028, three building blocks  will lay the foundation for Switzerland to consoli- date its position in new technologies:   3.5.1. Switzerland as a hub for  governance and innovation  in new technologies  To project itself as a location for new technol- ogies, Switzerland will need to adopt measures  that go beyond foreign policy. They must include  developing a national strategy on AI, a favoura- ble regulatory environment for start-ups as well  as internationally competitive government incen- tives to halt the brain drain that has already beset  the Swiss AI development sector and other sec- tors such as biotechnology.  Foreign policy can play an important role here.  Switzerland should project International Gene- va as the leading destination for the global  debates on digitalisation and technology.  Geneva is already known for its dynamic ecosys- tem embracing diverse stakeholder groups. This  ecosystem must be nurtured and encouraged to  develop innovative governance models for new  technologies. Governmental and government-re- lated institutions across the world are currently  finding it difficult to keep pace with the speed  of technological development. The future will be  shaped in creative interactions between various  stakeholders on suitable platforms.  Expanding these capacities and networks could  be one element of a host country policy. A step  in that direction was the decision of the Federal  Council along with the Canton and City of Gene- va in spring 2019 to establish the Geneva Science  and Diplomacy Anticipator foundation. There is   The vision   By 2028, new technologies are an established topic of  Swiss foreign policy.    Switzerland is a leading global hub for governance  and research in artificial intelligence and other new  technologies.     It has a clearly defined profile and is a leading  contributor to international policy debates.    Switzerland utilises new technologies to enhance the  impact of its foreign policy actions and commitments.  Stakeholders from industry and the scientific community  will become established partners in this process.  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      36    tremendous scope in combining science policy  and Swiss diplomacy.  Switzerland should also strengthen federal  government, research and industry net- works in the area of new technologies. Com- petence clusters create the critical mass in the  competition between geographical locations. An  AI cluster involving partners can help to establish  the right priorities for a tech foreign policy and to  develop the required know-how.  The scientific community has proposed the idea  of a foreign policy initiative to support basic  research in artificial intelligence. The objec- tive is to achieve transparent, fair and peaceful  use of AI as a counterpoint to a technological  arms race. There is a proposal to set up an AI  organisation in Switzerland along the lines of  CERN. Such an ambitious plan would need to be  supported by a supraregional group of like-mind- ed countries.  Another promising approach is positioning Swit- zerland as a safe harbour for data. Data pro- tection as well as secure information systems and  data infrastructure are increasingly critical issues  – for international organisations too. A digital  safe deposit box could emerge as a new form  of good offices and simultaneously strength- en Switzerland’s position as an IT and business  location. Swiss neutrality, political stability, data  protection regulations and acknowledged tech- nological know-how provide an excellent foun- dation.   3.5.2. Tech diplomacy  In the last 30 years, Switzerland has been glob- ally acknowledged for its peace-building efforts.  The geopolitically motivated technology race  could present an opportunity for similar ambition  in establishing a high-profile Swiss tech foreign  policy. It can serve as an important link between  peace policy, development cooperation, environ- mental and foreign policy, thereby strengthening  the rules-based international order.  New standards and regulatory models are a long- term goal. In the short and medium-term, asking  the right questions and finding solutions that enjoy  broad societal support are key. Existing interna- tional law should be applied as widely as possible.  Until such time as there is agreement on generally  applicable standards, self regulation through vol- untary commitments on the use of AI algorithms  appears to be a promising approach. The interna- tional organisations based in Geneva would be  particularly interested in such benchmarks.  Switzerland should focus on building a tech foreign  policy profile in three policy and governance areas,  and on contributing to the respective international  debates:  The first area pertains to security issues. Auton- omous weapons and the militarisation of space  using high-tech weapons call for a rethink of arms  control and international humanitarian law in this  new scenario. A further topic to be addressed  is influence operations and the corresponding  defence capabilities. Switzerland’s cyber foreign  policy could be developed within the framework  of its tech foreign policy.  1500  1200  900  600  300  0  Source: Roland Berger and ASGARD, Artificial Intelligence – A strategy for European startups  Un ite  d  St  at es    Ch  in a   Is ra  el    UK    Ca na  da    Ja pa  n  Fr  an ce    Ge  rm an  y  In  di a   Sw ed  en    Fi nl  an d   So ut  h  Ko  re a   Sp ai  n  Si  ng ap  or e   Sw itz  er la  nd    Au st  ra lia    Br  az il   Ne th  er la  nd s   Ita ly    Ru  ss ia  Top 20 countries for AI start-ups                                                                                                     13 93                          3  83                         3 62                 2  45          13  1        1 13       10  9       10 6      82    5 5   4 5   4 2   3 9   3 5   2 8  27 26 26 22 19  Top 20 countries for AI start-ups  37      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    The second area pertains to democracy and eth- ical issues. Citizens must be put at the heart of  technological change. The key parameters for this  objective are digital privacy protection and social  norms for digital platforms. Human rights must be  defended equally – online or offline. In this con- text, Switzerland can raise its profile by pioneering  the development and application of responsible  and human-oriented AI and other new technol- ogies.  The third area pertains to social and economic  transformation. Switzerland can provide inputs  for formulating an international response to the  challenges posed by the Fourth Industrial Revolu- tion and thereby maximise the opportunities for  OECD and developing countries. One focus area  could be strategies for technological innovations  to become growth drivers in developing countries.   3.5.3. Making foreign  policy more effective  Digital transformation offers tremendous oppor- tunities for shaping and implementing foreign pol- icy. Its impact can be enhanced through the use  of AI as an instrument for analysing and sup- porting decision-making. For instance, social  media analytics can provide multifaceted insights  into international perceptions of Switzerland  (Chapter 3.2.4 and 3.3.1).  Peacebuilding can be supported with big data  analytics providing early recognition of poten- tial conflicts. Humanitarian crises can be better  responded to by pinpointing needs more quickly  and precisely (Chapter 3.4.1).  In this way, digital transformation facilitates  achieving the 2030 Agenda’s sustainable  development goals. Swiss foreign policy should  accord high priority to this core idea. In concrete  terms, it should expand both digital services and  digital service delivery.  Digitalisation in a cross-cutting issue: in order to  leverage the potential of new technologies for for- eign policy and to carve out a distinct profile, the  FDFA needs to develop specific competencies  by working together with industry and the scien- tific community. An organisational unit for tech  foreign policy could bring together data specialists  and tech diplomats. Such a unit could become a  nodal point of contact for all stakeholders. A tech  ambassador and relevant know-how in its over- seas missions, such as San Francisco, could extend  the reach of Swiss tech foreign policy.  2028 Foreign Policy Vision      38    3.6. Self-confident with and  vis-à-vis the EU  Switzerland’s relations with Europe are the  core issue of its foreign policy. Global and  trade-related trends indicate that this will not  change (Chapter 2). Access to the EU single  market remains central to Swiss prosperity: trade  with the EU comprises over half of Switzerland’s  foreign trade. The single market is expected to  grow again in significance – also as a labour mar- ket. The same holds for the role of the EU as a  partner in the fields of science, education and  innovation. The ongoing fragmentation of the  world trade order further increases the relevance  of the homogenous and rules-based EU market,  as does the technology-driven reshoring of pro- duction plants.  Developments in mainland European also have  implications for Swiss security. The future course  will be determined by how Europe is able to  assert its position among the global powers.  Should the European countries prove unable to  safeguard their interests and values externally, this  critical development would also impact Switzer- land. Within Europe, cooperation between police  and judicial authorities will gain greater impor- tance. Joint solutions will be sought for an asylum  policy. Had Switzerland not been associated with  the Schengen and Dublin Agreements, it would,  from a technical perspective, already be worse off  today.  What is the role that Switzerland needs to play in  the present European context? Greater prosperity  and security through Europe can reinforce Swiss  independence. At the same time, Switzerland’s  political identity is being put to the test by Europe- an unification, as reflected in the anxieties voiced  during the current debate on Switzerland’s Euro- pean policy.  In sum, the implications are that Switzerland needs  a close partnership with the EU and its member  states, a partnership that is capable of evolv- ing. The question of acceding to the EU will not  arise, even in 2028. Switzerland will continue to  pursue a bilateral path that strikes an optimum  balance between extensive market access and  maintaining the greatest possible political inde- pendence.   The three building blocks below set out the con- tours of a sound and stable relationship between  Switzerland and the EU in 2028:  3.6.1. Regulated participation in  the single market is the key  Non-discriminatory access to the EU market has  been a core concern of Swiss foreign policy since  the 1950s, and will remain so until 2028. Three  developments have a crucial bearing on formulat- ing the requirements for a future model of coop- eration:   1. A strong EU single market will persist (Chap- ter 2.1). Switzerland therefore requires a viable  model for preserving and structuring its access  to the market in the long term.  2. Both in economic and social terms, Switzerland  is more strongly connected with the EU than  many member states. The volume of trade with  the EU amounts to CHF 1 billion per workday.  Every day, some 1.5 million persons and 1 mil- lion vehicles cross Swiss borders. The model  must take into account these very close links,  while still remaining flexible.  3. Switzerland desires to retain its independent  policy vis-à-vis Europe. The model must preser- ve the achievements of the bilateral approach  and make it viable for the future.  The vision    Having consolidated its bilateral approach,  Switzerland will work with the EU, as a non- member state, in shaping Europe.    The various institutional issues will have been  settled and a self-aware and strategic approach  will guide the internal debate on Europe.  Switzerland is a European country both in  cultural and geographical terms and defending  its global interests must start with Europe.  Switzerland will strive to put in place jointly  agreed arrangements for regional cooperation.    It will take an active role in shaping decisions,  providing effective input into policy areas  coordinated by the EU at European level.  Switzerland thereby contributes to preserving  Europe’s attractiveness as a location for  global business and innovation. In return, as  a partner it benefits from the political clout  of like-minded neighbouring EU countries.   39      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    An institutional agreement is best suited to meet  these three requirements from among all the Euro- pean policy options available. It would institution- ally cement bilateral relations, continue to guar- antee sectoral participation in the single market  and consequently enhance legal certainty. Finally,  such an agreement would allow for the further  development of Switzerland’s independent  path. The dynamic incorporation of new EU leg- islation within the scope of market access agree- ments guarantees that the existing agreements  will remain applicable, and that they may be fur- ther developed based on situational requirements,  while also providing for new participatory rights  to Switzerland.  Active participation in the framing of EU legisla- tion strengthens Swiss sovereignty. Participation  in preparing norms should therefore be given  preference over autonomous adoption. The close  involvement of Parliament and the cantons will  reflect the convergence of foreign and domestic  policy. Both will have a growing role in shaping  Switzerland’s European policy. A mixed parliamen- tary committee of representatives from the Feder- al Assembly and the European Parliament would  create new opportunities for influence. An insti- tutional agreement will underscore Switzerland’s  importance as a sectoral partner in the single mar- ket.  It is in Switzerland’s interest to have defined pro- cedures for accepting or rejecting new EU legis- lation and for arbitration. Such arrangements  can prevent arbitrary political influence. While  relations with the EU will not be entirely free of  conflict – relations between sovereign partners by  definition never are – there would nevertheless  be capacity for constructive conflict. Differences  in opinion would be resolved in an orderly way,  with law prevailing over power. The principle of  proportionality applicable to any compensato- ry measures would also relativise the guillotine  clause. In sum, relations between Switzerland and  the EU would become more symmetrical, stable  and consequently more predictable. Overall,  this would have a positive impact on Swiss foreign  and European policy, and also widen the scope of  their application.  3.6.2. Preserving sectoral  interests at all levels  Switzerland has much to offer Europe: from cut- ting edge research to contributing towards reduc- ing economic and social disparities in an enlarged  EU. Switzerland is respected and welcome as a  partner in those areas where it wishes to pursue  its interests jointly with Europe.  For regional cooperation within Europe, Switzer- land has a selection of policy instruments that are  flexible and related to specific thematic areas at  various levels: national/independent, cross-border  with neighbouring countries, bilateral or plurilater- al ventures with like-minded countries or regional  organisations, such as the OSCE and the Council  of Europe. In all such forums it meets member  states of the EU.  EU-driven approaches will become increasing- ly important if there is Swiss interest in pursuing  cooperation at the European level in any policy  area. There are several such areas ranging from  digitalisation, energy transition, promotion  of culture and armaments cooperation. Har- monious relations with the EU are consequent- ly crucial. Opportunities to cooperate are the  basis for contributing Swiss concerns, ideas and  strengths. It will bolster the Swiss negotiating  position if the EU perceives it as constructive and  solution-oriented.  Long-term support for research cooperation  must be ensured. The networking of cross- border  research capabilities will strengthen innovation on  both sides. 45% of research staff at Swiss research  institutes are from the EU zone. Over half of the  professors at the Federal Institutes of Technology  (ETH) are from Europe. From a scientific, techno- logical and economic perspective, Switzerland’s  full participation in the EU’s framework pro- grammes for research is in the interests of the EU  and Switzerland.   2028 Foreign Policy Vision      40    3.6.3. Striking a balance  between independence and  partnering with Europe  Switzerland cannot influence Europe’s leverage as  a global force. It is therefore all the more important  that it appraises how closely it wishes to cooperate  with the EU in those foreign policy areas where  the EU can and does act effectively. On numerous  fronts, Swiss values and interests coincide with  those of its neighbours, including with regard to  shared risk analyses.  Switzerland has supported various EU sanctions  that go beyond existing UN resolutions. For many  years it has participated in civilian and military EU  peacekeeping operations – in the Ukraine, the  Western Balkans and the Sahel. It is one of the  few third countries to have a cooperation agree- ment with the European Defence Agency (EDA),  giving it access to the EDA’s forums and projects.  Switzerland also maintains active contact with  the European Union’s External Action Service on  specific issues: coordination in multilateral forums,  regional strategies as well as development assis- tance and humanitarian commitments.  On the other hand, Switzerland has no structured  political dialogue with the EU. Cooperation  is also limited in other areas in comparison with  other non-EU countries in Europe. Switzerland is  the only country in the Euro-Atlantic region, for  instance, that does not formally endorse positions  and declarations emerging from the EU’s common  foreign and security policy. It also does not join EU  sanctions if this would jeopardise a possible role  for Switzerland as a mediator.  A Swiss foreign policy that is guided by self-in- terest consequently requires space – also and  especially as far as the EU is concerned. The Swiss  policy of dialogue demonstrates the opportunities  that emerge from an independent position – often  for all actors.  The goal is to objectively analyse by what means  Swiss interests can best be served. In some cases,  more can be achieved by acting in concert with  the EU and thereby leveraging its critical mass in  negotiations. At the same time, Switzerland must  ensure that it does not become a victim of this  mass. Were the EU to conclude better free trade  agreements with third countries than Switzer- land is able to, for example, this could negatively  impact Swiss competitiveness.     The discussions on the future development of  cooperation with Europe are worth following  closely. It does not serve Swiss interests to have  the EU moving towards becoming a European  superstate, nor to have Europe disintegrate. An EU  that is a union of European nations helping them  to achieve greater prosperity and security while  respecting their uniqueness also benefits Switzer- land. In light of this, the proposal to establish a  European Security Council with the participation  of the United Kingdom will be of interest for Swiss  foreign policy.  What is certain is that neither Switzerland  nor other European states can individually  defend the liberal international order. In the  future, Switzerland will demonstrate the same  commitment and confidence vis-à-vis the EU as it  has within the UN, the OSCE and other organisa- tions.  41      2028 Foreign Policy Vision    Foundations of an agile foreign policy  A vision is not a utopia. All the developments set  out in AVIS28 can be implemented. Switzerland  can develop its foreign policy in a way that reflects  its own interests and has a broader domestic sup- port base. Focusing on the needs of its citizens  and the economy makes sense. With political will,  the proposed innovations in Switzerland’s engage- ment for development, peace and a rules-based  international order can be achieved. The same  applies to establishing a Swiss foreign policy on  technology and to the relationship with Europe.  A Switzerland that plays its part self-assuredly and  does not confine its policy on the EU to damage  limitation will forge its own identity with foresight.  Realising the 2028 Vision will require adjustments  to the foundations of Swiss foreign policy, which  will need to be more agile to meet the challenges  of tomorrow’s world. AVIS28 therefore concludes  with some reflections on four factors underpin- ning Swiss foreign policy: personnel, the external  network, anticipation, and the need for coherence  and efficiency. These reflections may stimulate  further in-depth discussion in the wake of AVIS28.   Foreign policy needs generalists,  but also more specialists  The foreign policy outlined in AVIS28 will require  a broader range of skills within the FDFA. This  means more economic expertise, both in the work  of Swiss diplomacy and in international cooperation  activities, as well as specialist knowledge of new  technologies. More staff in responsible positions  at head office and in the representations will have  to communicate differently and more intensively.  These skills will need to be developed. In addition,  foreign policy should be developed in closer coor- dination with the domestic policy agenda. This will  be a challenge facing all levels of management.  In-depth knowledge of non-European countries  and cultures will also become more important.  All these elements are in addition to an already very  demanding competency profile. Job profiles will  need to be adapted. On the one hand, there will  still be a need for proven all-rounders who are will- ing to bring their expertise to maturity in a range  of disciplines by dint of many years of training.  Generalists with broad skill sets will be particularly  in demand in the external network. On the other  hand, more specialists will also be required, includ- ing for the diplomatic corps, in areas such as medi-  ation, economic diplomacy, international law and  multilateral engagement.  In general, both the diplomatic corps and interna- tional cooperation bodies should be aiming for a  greater variety of expertise, whether through  recruitment or increased use of secondments. Pri- vate sector experience will be more important for  diplomatic careers than it is today. At the same  time, the secondment of FDFA personnel to spe- cialist departments and international organisations  could be expanded. Conversely, foreign policy could  make greater use of external expertise, for example  in the form of a pool of experts for development  cooperation (see section 3.4). The FDFA needs to  become more permeable, in both directions.  Ensuring that FDFA personnel are representative  of the wider population strengthens the legitima- cy and domestic credibility of Swiss foreign policy.  Accordingly, the country’s different language com- munities should be appropriately reflected in the  staff composition.  Employees are the most important asset of Swiss  foreign policy. Switzerland is politically and eco- nomically a middle-ranking power with global  interests. Ensuring that these interests are intelli- gently, sensitively and realistically represented is  vital to the country’s success. This applies to all job  profiles. To attract the most talented young people  into these demanding roles, flexible working mod- els are essential.  Balancing work, family and free time is also key  in terms of equal opportunities. Gender equity  boosts productivity and will underpin the success  of a future foreign policy. With women making up  50% of its staff, the FDFA is well positioned in this  respect. At senior management level, the propor- tion has risen to 25% in recent years. Neverthe- less, it is important that further efforts are made to  achieve gender parity at all managerial levels, and  that gender equality and women’s rights are given  a high profile in foreign policy activities.  4  Foundations of an agile foreign policy      42    Successful foreign policy relies on a  flexible and innovative external network  Switzerland currently has an official presence in  over 120 countries. It has 102 embassies, 12 per- manent missions to international organisations,  29 consulates general and 19 cooperation offices.  According to an international study, Switzerland is  ranked number 16 in the world for the size of its  external network.  This network represents Switzerland’s strength.  It is an expression of the country’s independent  foreign policy and an important instrument for  protecting Switzerland’s global interests. It per- forms a range of tasks, from fostering relation- ships and promoting business interests to looking  after Swiss nationals abroad. Relationships of trust  forged in these countries can also lead to requests  for good offices.  However, there is a risk that the external network  could become overstretched. For example, there  are currently around 20 micro-representations  consisting of only one transferable staff mem- ber plus local employees. The usefulness of such  representations is debatable. Generally speaking,  Switzerland is now present in too many locations  with too few resources. Possible solutions would  be either to increase the transferable human  resources or to concentrate funding and rely on  more cross accreditations for countries in which  Switzerland is not physically present.  The principle of universality, whereby Switzerland  maintains diplomatic relations with all countries,  has been a cornerstone of Swiss foreign policy  since 1945. New states, regardless of their political  orientation, should be recognised once they meet  the relevant criteria under international law. It is  only in recent years that the principle of universal- ity has also been applied to the external network.  A dogmatic interpretation is not expedient: the  network should reflect political priorities rather  than the other way around.  Apart from universality, the current strategy for  the external network also specifies the principles  of flexibility and efficiency. Since 1990, 38  representations have closed and 39 have opened.  Switzerland has expanded its presence to a further  20 countries, primarily those classed as emerging  economies. By having a range of Swiss actors  together in one place and by strengthening coop- eration with partner countries, it is able to exploit  synergies within its external network. Flexibility  must also mean being able to transfer resources  from lower priority areas within head office or the  external network to strategically important loca- tions, or to undertake closures.  As the world and societies change, it is impor- tant to think about the form and function of rep- resentations abroad. It is also worth exploring a  network- based approach that would see the  representations cooperate more with each other on  substantive issues and become less reliant on head  office alone. This would enable representations   Switzerland’s external network  Source: FDFA  Embassies (102)  Permanent UN/OI missions (12)  General Consulates (29)  Swiss Cooperation Offices (19)  Other representations (4)  43      Foundations of an agile foreign policy    within a region to specialise in particular areas and  enhance their expertise through exchange, with- out the need for additional resources.  In the future, representations should be  designed more as innovative platforms for  Switzerland, and should be open to a wide range  of actors from politics, business, science/academ- ia, innovation, culture and the media. The main  aim of these platforms would be to promote inter- action between people from Switzerland and the  host country. Modern representations are already  seeing a demand for this kind of service, especially  in big cities, which are increasingly important driv- ing forces on foreign policy and economic issues.   Providing resources for a strategic framework  will strengthen the ability to anticipate  The representations act as Switzerland’s external  antennas. Their reports help build up a picture of  what is going on, the quality of which is essen- tial to Switzerland’s independence. They give early  warning signals and suggest new foreign policy  options.  Head office needs to be able to draw the right con- clusions from this information and to act quickly.  Compared to many other foreign ministries, the  FDFA’s capacity for anticipation and analysis is very  modest. Models such as an internal think tank  or a planning unit would enhance its ability to  process information from the external network.  Such a unit could help to ensure a high-quality  overall view of foreign policy. As specialisation  increases, classifications within a strategic frame- work will be required. It is equally important that  this unit can provide ‘rolling’ risk analysis. Global  political and economic volatility means that deci- sion-makers need regular, comprehensive and  accurate information about how situations are  developing.   Coherence and efficiency will be  central to future foreign policy  The world is changing and Swiss foreign policy  is changing with it. More and more units within  the administration work in, or in connection with,  international contexts. In their respective thematic  sectors, the offices in effect operate their own for- eign policy and maintain their own international  networks. This departmentalisation of foreign pol- icy began three decades ago and now extends far  beyond European issues.  AVIS28 has deliberately made only marginal ref- erence to sectoral foreign policies. Some con- cluding remarks on the vital role of coherence are  therefore all the more important. Coordinating  the departments’ foreign policy activities with  Swiss interests in mind will become a core task for  the FDFA. The aim must be to combine specialist  sectoral expertise and diplomatic knowledge in  order to create administratively lean coordination  models that enable the units to interact and work  together in an overall political context. This would  be a milestone for Switzerland on the path to a  coherent safeguarding of its foreign policy inter- ests.  Conflicting objectives are the expression of a plu- ralist society. The aim is not to overcome such  conflicts but rather to ensure transparency: the  conflicts should be clearly stated and carefully  weighed up, and decisions taken in a transparent  way.  The need for efficiency is equally important.  AVIS28 identifies a number of innovations that  could make Swiss foreign policy fit for the future.  They range from new economic development  instruments to the creation of a tech ambassador  profile and a planning unit in the FDFA. Rather  than simply supplementing existing foreign policy,  these innovations should be linked to clear prior- itisation and retrenchment planning. Swit- zerland cannot do everything. But it does have to  know how it intends to position itself in order to  work efficiently towards meeting the goals it sets.  If it achieves this, Switzerland’s 2028 Foreign Poli- cy Vision will become a reality, enjoying domestic  political support and generating great benefits.  Switzerland’s success is not guaranteed, but  it is the author of its own success story. By  having the courage to embrace change, it can  add a new chapter to that story.

Mr Cassis and the FDFA would then  draw on the working group’s report as a source  of inspiration in further developing Swiss foreign  policy and aligning its instruments with the chal- lenges and opportunities ahead. The report is also  intended to encourage a broad debate on the  future of Swiss foreign policy.  The working group met for six workshops between  October 2018 and May 2019, and developed the  2028 Vision on the basis of intensive dialogue  and discussions. In line with Mr Cassis’s instruc- tions, FDFA staff were also able to contribute their  analyses, plans and ideas. To this end, the FDFA  General Secretariat set up a number of sound- ing boards.Round-table discussions on numerous  foreign policy topics as well as events with exter- nal experts were held. There was also an AVIS28  blog. The results of these discussions and inputs  were made available to the working group.  The working group comprised senior FDFA staff,  the president of the Conference of the Canton- al Governments of Switzerland and experts from  academia, business and civil society. The experts  were appointed personally by Mr Cassis to provide  an outside perspective on global affairs and Swiss  foreign policy and augment the internal views put  forward within the FDFA.   Members of the AVIS28 Working Group:  • Dr Philipp Aerni,  Director of the Center for  Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability at  the University of Zurich  • Pascale Baeriswyl, State Secretary, Head of  the Directorate of Political Affairs, FDFA  • Dr Roberto Balzaretti,  State Secretary, Head  of the Directorate for European Affairs, FDFA  • Alenka Bonnard, Director and co-founder of  staatslabor  • Dr Manuel Sager, Ambassador, SDC Director- General, FDFA  • Dr Markus Seiler, FDFA General Secretary  (head of the working group)  •  Peter R. Voser, Chairman of the Board of  Directors, ABB  • Dr Thomas Wellauer, Group Chief Operating  Officer, Swiss Re  • Benedikt Würth, Cantonal Councillor,  President of the Conference of the Cantonal  Governments of Switzerland    Secretary: Dr Daniel Möckli, Policy Advisor, FDFA  General Secretariat.  The above titles refer to the positions held at the  time of appointment to the working group.  The working group analysed the factors driving  changes in Switzerland’s global and regional con- text and drew conclusions for Swiss foreign policy  in the medium term. It examined Swiss interests,  identified regional and thematic priorities and set  out proposals concerning the future capacities and  expertise of the FDFA.  The working group’s report outlines a target vision  for foreign policy in 2028 and identifies ways how  the vision can be realised. It is available to down- load from the FDFA website in German, French,  Italian, and English: www.fdfa.admin.ch. The report  reflects the opinions of the working group: it is not  a report by the FDFA or the Federal Council.         46  http://www.eda.admin.ch/avis28-en?pk_campaign=avis28&pk_kwd=QR-report           Publication details  Switzerland in the World 2028.

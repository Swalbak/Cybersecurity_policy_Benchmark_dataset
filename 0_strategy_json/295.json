Enhanced access to information and knowledge is rapidly becoming a potent tool for individuals and communities everywhere in their quest for new opportunities, for dignity and for a better life. Clearly underscoring the paramount role placed on and desired of the ICT sector, the Royal Government of Bhutan has established the Ministry of Information and Communications. However, Bhutan faces a number of challenges in harnessing the benefits of ICT, including difficult terrain, dispersed population and limited private sector activities. A coordinated policy approach is the first step to ensuring that Bhutan does not miss out on the opportunities of the information revolution. Notwithstanding the achievements we have made and the many ICT activities carried out in the last couple of years, with the new Ministry in place, it is timely to take stock of what we have accomplished as well as look forward, and to effect a clear, focused and a collective policy alignment.

This Policy expresses a firm commitment of the Government to maximise the contribution, ef- ficiency and effectiveness of information and communication technologies in achieving the National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu”, thereby empowering and ben- efiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. This Government’s commitment will first of all be expressed through actions in a number of priority areas. Access to ICTs in schools in partic- ular, and also for Vanuatu citizens and residents in general, will be radically expanded. ICTs will transform government services and public ad- ministration, as well as supercharge advance in all areas related to the socio-economic develop- ment of the country. Importantly, the Policy also recognises risks and downsides of the increased utilisation of and dependence on ICTs and provides an impe- tus for their mitigation, especially through empowerment of users of respective tools and services. Furthermore, the Policy will enhance relevance of ICTs for the Vanuatu population by promoting availability of locally relevant content, as well as our ability to develop and utilise ICTs through capacity building programmes. Finally, the Policy unleashes creative collaboration and action of various public and private entities, academia, civil society and the public in general by setting up a platform for multi-stakeholder and multi-sector coordination and collabora- tion. This will ensure that the development kick-started by this Policy will extend much further than the Government’s actions alone could reach. Furthermore, this will significantly increase the value, effectiveness and efficiency of initiatives of Access to ICTs in schools in particular, and also for Vanuatu citizens and residents in general, will be radically expanded. ICTs will transform government services and public administration, as well as supercharge advance in all areas related to the socio-economic development” Hon. Moana Carcasses Katokai Kalosil, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu 5 National Information and Communication Technology Policy individual stakeholders due to synergies and cost savings achieved through joint efforts. This Policy is neither the beginning nor the conclusion of the national ICT development. Market liberalisation has already expanded availability of ICTs, es- pecially mobile communications, to virtually everyone in Vanuatu. A significant part of our population can have access to the Internet. A submarine fibre cable project, which will provide a high-speed reliable link for Vanuatu to the World, is well underway. National infrastructure has been further strengthened by launch- ing the first Internet Exchange Point in the Pacific. The high-quality Government Broadband Network, connecting all the provinces, has brought the Government much closer to everyone across Vanuatu. ICTs are already transforming public administration. Multiple public and private services can be accessed via mobile phones or online, and the public debate has been significantly enhanced by so- cial networks. Sector institutions, specifically the multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator, provide a best-practice foundation for further development of the sector. In our work we have enjoyed support of our friends in a multitude of interna- tional and regional organisations, as well as our development partners. I would like to express a special thanks to the Australian Government, which has con- sistently supported the institutional and policy development in the ICT area in Vanuatu in general, and this policy process in particular. A lot has been achieved. However, a lot is yet to be done. ICTs have a strong potential to transform education of our children, expand and improve govern- ment services, make us more resilient in the face of natural disasters, preserve and promote our culture, as well as provide new business opportunities, and gen- erally enhance our livelihoods. They will bring us closer together and strengthen our connection to the World. In short, expansion and utilisation of ICTs will cre- ate jobs, provide economic growth and enrich our social lives. I believe that this Policy will provide a good platform for such further developments. However, ac- tual benefits depend on all of us working together—the Government, businesses, academia, users, civil society, and, ultimately, every citizen and resident. Only to- gether can we transform this potential into reality that we will feel every day. I am especially proud that this is truly a Vanuatu policy. We have learned from other countries and taken advice from international and regional experts and documents. However, experience and insights from all of us here in Vanuatu made this document into what it is today. Numerous stakeholder consultations, an industry roundtable, input from multiple stakeholders through the National ICT Development Committee, as well as obtaining public views through an unprece- dented Call for Public Input formed the basis of this Policy. I am pleased that our efforts have been recognised by various stakeholders ICTs have a strong potential to transform education of our children, expand and improve government services, make us more resilient in the face of natural disasters, preserve and promote our culture” 6 Foreword and observers. The Pacific Chapter of the Internet Society suggested that our pro- cess for the development of this Policy “offer a model of practice that will be very helpful to other Pacific nations who may wish to redevelop their own ICT policies”. A submission from an international stakeholder, received through the Call-for- Public-Input process, went even further by stating that “Vanuatu is poised to take the region by storm in setting an example for the Pacific in accelerating ICT. It has all the relevant ingredients to succeed. There is political will, commitment, energy and drive to ensure the vision of a vibrant nation will emerge.” We all should take this praise as a push to do even more. I am calling on all stakeholders to embrace this Policy, which is a result of our joint efforts to date, and work together to develop our country and harness the power of ICTs in these efforts. Moana CARCASSES KATOKAI KALOSIL Prime Minister 7 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Executive Summary This Policy expresses a commitment of the Government of Vanuatu to maximise the contribution, efficiency and effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in achieving the National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu” thereby empowering and benefiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. This document will serve as a tool for an effective coordination of efforts of all of the various stakeholders to- wards achieving this commitment. The Government has identified the following priority areas for this National ICT Policy: 1 Access to ICTs in Education; 2 Access to ICT Infrastructure and Devices; 3 E-Government; 4 Integration of ICTs into Sectoral Policies; 5 Building Trust (Mitigating Risks and Threats related to the ICT Development); 6 Locally Relevant Content; 7 Capacity Building; and 8 Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Coordination and Collaboration. The Government has also outlined a set of approaches and principles, which, in its opinion, should enhance success of achieving individual Priorities as well as the overall objective of this Policy, in particular by: (a) facilitating synergies among different strategies to achieve Priorities set out in this document as well as other national developmental objectives; (b) building on previous achievements; and (c) employing most affordable, efficient and effective solutions. Such approaches and principles specifically include: 1 Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Collaboration; 2 Pragmatic Approach; 3 Private, in particular Locally-Based, Sector Driven Development; 4 Sustainable Best Practice ICT Sector Governance; 5 Fair and Effective Competition and Enhancement of Economies of Scale; 6 “Squeezing-the-Assets” and “Thinking-of-a-Greater-Good”; 7 Kick-Starting Sustainable Development; 8 Subsidiarity and Stakeholder Ownership and Drive; 9 Policy as a Process; 10 Integration into the Work as Usual; 11 Socially Inclusive and Equitable Development; 8 Executive Summary 12 Being a Responsible Member of the International and Regional Community; 13 Prioritising the Priorities; and 14 Utilisation of Appropriate Tools. Implementation of this Policy will fall into the remit of the Honourable Prime Minister, as the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications. He/ she will be supported by the multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, which shall have the primary responsibility for the further develop- ment and implementation of this Policy. Overarching support will also be pro- vided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR). Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities will be responsi- ble for the implementation of this Policy in their respective areas. This Policy will be implemented through a programmatic approach, based on the principles of results-based-management, and supported by a consolidated list of strategies1, implementation plan, issue- and sector-specific policies and/ or strategies, corporate and business plans as well as expenditure frameworks and budgets of respective stakeholders. Initiatives under this Policy, requiring public funding, will be funded from regular funds of respective stakeholders (including regular budgets of respective Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities), as well as the ICT Development Fund and Universal Access Policy Fund. The Government will seek to partner with development partners, international and regional organisations as well as local and international public, private and non-profit and volunteer organisations, including multinational corporations as well as international and regional civil society organisations, in implementing this Policy. An implementation plan for the initial consolidated list of strategies shall be approved within 3 months from the adoption of this Policy. The Government envisages that this plan will cover a 5 year period. The implementation will be supported by an effective monitoring and evaluation framework. The National ICT Development Committee will report on the implementation of this Policy on an annual basis. The Government will seek to ensure that the National ICT Policy stays sufficiently up-to-date, and will generally aim to review and, where appropriate, revise this Policy within 5 years from its adoption. 1 Initial list is attached to the Policy as Annex C. 9 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Their Contribution to the National Development Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Their Contribution to the National Development The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) defines2 informa- tion and communication technologies (ICTs) as “basically information handling tools—a varied set of goods, applications and services that are used to produce, store, process, distribute and exchange information. They include the ‘old’ ICTs of radio, television and telephone, and the ‘new’ ICTs of computers, satellite and wireless technology and the internet.” ICTs also include various applications and services provided using computing devices, including office productivity software (such as MS Office), electronic mail, databases, news sites, electronic entertainment (such as video and audio content), social network- ing applications (such as Facebook), voice-over-internet applications (e.g., Skype), video games etc. ICTs contribute to the social and economic development by enabling access to and exchange of information and services anywhere and anytime, together with rapid processing and vast storage of such information. Thereby ICTs make the provision of public and private services, including education and professional development, health information and services, government services, entertainment, information services, professional services and commerce in general, much more effective, efficient, accessible and affordable. They also enhance access to markets, disaster management, as well as democratic participation. ICTs also provide more cost efficient and effective ways to preserve and promote local culture. Costs of economic and social activities are decreased, when ICTs replace transport and postal services. Furthermore, they open new previously non-existent business opportunities (such as ICT services, business process outsourcing, and content-related businesses). ICTs’ contribution to the national development has been a subject of numerous studies. A widely cited research3, represented in the graph below, demonstrates that ICTs, in particular fast access to the Internet, accelerates economic growth, especially in less developed countries. 2 UNDP Evaluation Office (2011). UNDP Essentials No. 5. 3 Qiang (2009) as referred to in World Bank (2009). Information and Communications for Development 2009. ICTs contribute to the social and economic development by enabling access to and exchange of information and services anywhere and anytime, together with rapid pro- cessing and vast storage of such information.” 11 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Figure 1.

The Government embraces the statement of the Pacific ICT Minister’s Wellington Declaration of 2006 that “infor- mation and communications technologies (ICTs), while not an end in themselves, have a key role as a basis for economic development, while also promoting and enhancing social cohesion, cultural enrichment and environmental conservation”. The regional framework for ICT development provides a context for national objectives. The vision set out in the Framework for Action on ICT for Development in the Pacific (FAIDP), as endorsed by the Pacific ICT Ministers’ Tonga Declaration of 2010, is “Improved livelihood of the Pacific communities through effective utilisation of ICT”. Main goals of the FAIDP are: “(1) Access to affordable ICT; (2) Efficient and effective utilisation of ICT for sustainable development; and (3) Adoption of ICT as a national priority in PICTs”. Its’ sought outcome is defined as “Enhanced social and economic sustainable development, good governance and security through better access and use of ICT”. In line with the global and regional objectives set out above, the Government believes that an effective use of ICTs is a must and is indispensable in achieving the National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu”. ICTs have a potential to significantly contribute to (or be a part of) all the strategic priorities, defined in the Priorities and Action Agenda, namely: 1 Private Sector Development and Employment Creation; 2 Macroeconomic Stability and Equitable Growth; 3 Good Governance and Public Sector Reform; ICTs… can foster sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, compet- itiveness, access to information and knowledge, poverty eradication and social inclusion” 13 National Information and Communication Technology Policy 4 Primary Sector Development, Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management; 5 Provision of Better Basic Services, especially in Rural Areas ; 6 Education and Human Resource Development; 7 Economic Infrastructure and Support Services. In the context above, the overall objective of the National ICT Policy is to maxim- ise the contribution, efficiency and effectiveness of ICTs in achieving the National Vision, thereby empowering and benefiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. The Government considers this objective to be a national priority. By aiming for the objective above and having regard to approaches and principles below, this Policy will directly contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular by implementing their Target 8.F that aims to “[i]n cooperation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications”. The Government considers that this target and goals of the FAIDP are not ultimate objectives, but rather instruments appropriate in achieving the overall objective above (and the Millennium Development Goals in general). It has accordingly embedded such an approach into this Policy. Pacific Energy, ICT and Transport Ministers in their meeting in Noumea in 2011 “recognized that national ICT policies are essential for effective multi- stakeholder coordination and partnerships to fully utilise ICT as a tool for development and to ensure that national development priorities are addressed”. Therefore the meeting “encouraged […] governments to adopt a more coordinated and planned approach to developing ICT as a key tool for sustainable development”. In this regard, the purpose of the National ICT policy is to serve as a framework and tool for an effective coordination of efforts of various stakeholders towards achieving the overall objective above. 14 Current Situation and Challenges Current Situation and Challenges Current Situation In the recent years the Vanuatu ICT sector has witnessed a major transfor- mation. The telecommunications sector reform, which entailed a full liberal- isation of the telecommunications market, has attracted new market players. Telecom Vanuatu Limited (TVL) was joined by such new entrants like Digicel, Telsat and Can’L. This led to a remarkable increase in the availability of and ac- cess to telecommunications services, especially mobile telephony. The Pacific Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) reports that currently 99.4% of households sur- veyed use and 95.5% own a mobile phone (making a mobile phone the most com- mon electrical appliance in Vanuatu homes). 4 out of 5 respondents have their own mobile phone.4 Achievements of the liberalisation are safeguarded and further enhanced by a strong, competent and independent regulator—the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR). To provide further impetus to the sector development process, the ICT (including telecommunications) policy portfolio has been consolidated under the Honourable Prime Minister, who is currently also the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) has been tasked to support the Honourable Prime Minister in relation to the policy development and coordination of its implementation. In addition to the above, the Honourable Prime Minister has set up the multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, chaired by him. That Committee has developed this Policy. It is envisaged that it will also play a leading role in the implementation and further development of this Policy. Vanuatu has a rather elaborate ICT-related legal framework in place. This framework includes: 1 Laws governing the telecommunications sector—specifically: 2 Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulation Act No. 30 of 2009; 3 Telecommunications Act [CAP 206]; and 4 Wireless Telegraph (Ships) Act [CAP 5]; 5 Electronic Transactions Act No. 24 of 2000 (as amended by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act No. 2 of 2010), which governs elec- tronic transactions and related matters, including legal recognition of and requirements for electronic records, formation and validity of elec- tronic contracts as well as other communication of electronic records, 4 Pacific Institute of Public Policy (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and inter- net in Vanuatu. 15 National Information and Communication Technology Policy electronic signatures, encryption and data protection as well as obliga- tions and liability of intermediaries and e-commerce service providers; 6 E-Business Act No. 25 of 2000 (as amended by the E-Business (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2007), which aims to “provide a robust and sustainable environment for the development and growth of electronic business in or that is associated with Vanuatu and to regulate such elec- tronic business” (section 2 (1) of the E-Business Act); 7 Broadcasting and Television Act [CAP 214], which governs radio and tel- evision broadcasting activities. Private and public sector stakeholders have been implementing projects that have further enhanced the ICT sector or have a strong potential to do so in the near future. Such projects include the deployment of the first Vanuatu’s international submarine cable, which will significantly enhance international connectivity for Vanuatu and is due to be ready for service by early 2014. Furthermore, telecommu- nications infrastructure has been strengthened by a recently launched national in- ternet exchange point, which is the first of its kind in the Pacific. The Government has deployed the Government Broadband Network (GBN), connecting all the provinces. The Ministry of Health is also implementing a separate programme to connect hospitals and major health centres. Some Government agencies, notably the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department, provide current and highly useful online information to residents. The Government has launched the Integrated Government (iGov) initiative and adopted the E-Government Strategic Roadmap to drive further utilisation of ICTs in public administration. These recent achievements establish a solid foundation for Vanuatu to achieve a significant progress from the relatively low current levels of e-government development. Access to the Internet in lower-income as well as remote communities is expanded by various Government and private initiatives, including the Rensarie Telecenter, a Wan Smolbag computer classroom as well as commercial or community-run public Internet access points available in Lakatoro (Malakula), Loltong (North Pentecost) and other localities. Although access to ICTs in schools remains very low5, where such access is available, it produces remarkable results. For example, a 55% increase in students’ pass rate from year 12 to year 13 was reported in Rensarie following provision of the Internet to Rensarie College. Importantly, virtually all relevant stakeholders, including the Ministry of Education, school administrations, provincial education officers and community representatives, are in a broad agreement that schools are well placed to serve community needs for access to ICTs by becoming Community Learning, Information and Communication Centres. In recognition of the importance of ICTs in the education sector and a role that this sector could play in serving ICT needs of the population, the OGCIO and the Ministry of Education signed a Memorandum of Understanding, outlining a comprehensive framework for collaboration in this regard. 5 A recent study conducted by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), Ministry of Education (MoE) and Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR) suggests that only about 5% of students have access to ICTs and only about 6% of schools nationwide have access to the Internet.

The First Survey of ICT Usage in the Vanuatu Schools. 16 Current Situation and Challenges The private sector has started leveraging the ICT infrastructure for provision of its services. For example, tourism and travel services could be procured online or via phone, Internet banking is available to residents and businesses, and the network of ATMs is expanding. Even such traditional product as ready-for- consumption kava is available for ordering online6. Similarly, Vanuatu National Providence Fund provides a host of services, enabling its members to manage their accounts via ICT tools, including SMS and online. Vanuatu has a number of information technology companies. They play an important role in supporting the use of ICTs in the public and private sectors. Use of ICT tools by the local population has been enhanced by Bislama- adapted ICT tools, including a dictionary and a spelling tool, produced by community/non-governmental initiatives7. ICTs play an increasingly important role in a democratic participation and dialogue. The first ever nationwide Leaders’ Face-to-Face discussion, which connected the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Leader of the Opposition with communities in all provinces via video-conference links, was held in 2012. Traditional media is discovering the Internet, which can already be used to access daily newspapers and local radio, as well as distributing news via SMS. Online-only media, such as the Vanuatu Daily Digest and the Pacific Politics Blog of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, is emerging and becoming an increasingly important source of information. An increasing number of Facebook groups enhance the social and economic conversation. The largest of such groups (Yumi Toktok Stret) has more than 10,000 members. Currently around 9,000 Vanuatu residents (around 4% of the population) use Facebook8. The Government also pays a significant attention to ICT-related awareness and education of the public and specific stakeholders. A tradition to celebrate the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day with a host of public events commenced in 2012. Furthermore, a number of ICT-related workshops were organized to enhance capabilities of ICT professionals. Civil society, including such organizations and groups as the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, the Vanuatu IT Users Society, ViewPex and the Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Society (PICISOC), is playing an increasingly important role in promoting and facilitating development and utilisation of ICTs. Local communities are also actively seeking to avail themselves of ICT-driven opportunities9. 6 7 See 8 April 2013. 9 E.g., Women from Nguna Island organized themselves and, with help from the United States Peace Corps, obtained computers and relevant training. Use of ICT tools by the local population has been en- hanced by Bislama-adapted ICT tools, including a dictionary and a spelling tool, produced by community/ non-governmental initiatives” 17 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Vanuatu’s efforts to develop its ICT sector have been strongly supported by a number of development partners as well as international and regional organizations, including the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), World Bank, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Asia- Pacific Telecommunity (APT, Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank), Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC), United States Peace Corps, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA). The Government has been discussing opportunities for collaboration with other public and private partners. Achievements to date have established a solid foundation for further development of the sector and its enhanced contribution to the socio-economic development of the country in general. A lot is yet to be done, however—as evidenced by the still very low level of use of Internet services10. Furthermore, the availability of radio broadcasting, which still is the most used and most trusted mass medium, is far from universal—especially in rural areas and more remote provinces11. Increased access to such services will open up a lot of opportunities for the ICT-supported socio-economic development. Furthermore, currently widely available services12 (including mobile voice and SMS) could be further leveraged for delivery of public and private services. Importantly, the environment seems to be ripe for further development. For example, only 10.9% of the population (including those, who never seen or used the Internet) do not perceive any benefit of using the Internet13. Therefore it is clear that efforts of the Government and other stakeholders to further develop the ICT sector will find a fertile ground. Challenges Despite a lot of potential that ICTs could bring in terms of the socio-economic development of Vanuatu, the country faces certain serious challenges to the sec- tor development. It is not unique in this regard—the Pacific ICT Ministers in the Wellington Declaration of 2006 noted that “[t]he Pacific region faces a number of obstacles to the effective deployment of communications and other infrastruc- ture”. Such challenges relate to all elements of the ICT ecosystem, including infra- structure, devices, users, as well as content and applications. In terms of infrastructure deployment, primary challenges are presented by geography and topography of Vanuatu. First of all, distance to points-of-presence of submarine-fibre-based international connectivity means that, even if (when) Vanuatu is connected to international communications networks via a submarine cable, costs of such connectivity might restrict the extent to which such connections could translate into lower prices for end users. A study commissioned 10 The Pacific Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) reports that 72% of the general and 79% of the rural population have never used or seen the Internet. PIPP (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and internet in Vanuatu. 11 InterMedia (2013). Citizen Access to Information in Vanuatu. Study supported by ABC International Development and AusAID. 12 Admittedly, quality of such services may still need to be improved. 13 PIPP (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and internet in Vanuatu. 18 Current Situation and Challenges by the World Bank and conducted by Polyconseil suggested that international connectivity could cost as much as US$1310 per Mbps per month14,15. This is hundreds of times more expensive than IP Transit in developed markets—e.g., in New York a comparable price is US$3.50 per Mbps per month, with pricing for short-term promotions and high capacities below US$1.00 per Mbps16 (i.e., 374-1310 times cheaper). Assuming a 1:20 contention ratio, the wholesale IP Transit costs would translate into US$65.5 per Mbps per month for retail users, or US$6,550 for 100 Mbps package per month (not including national infrastructure). The context for this could be provided by the United Nations Broadband Commission’s recommendation for the broadband price not to exceed 5% of average monthly income17—in Vanuatu this would be US$1118. Thus the costs and resulting prices are likely to remain a significant obstacle to an aggressive expansion of the broadband Internet use, as affordability of such services remains an issue. In addition to the international connectivity costs, topography and the current level of supportive infrastructure make deployment, operation and maintenance of national networks challenging and costly as well. First of all, 234,023 residents of Vanuatu19 inhabit 60 islands (out of 83 in total). These islands are dispersed in a rather large ocean territory (around 1300 km from north to south). Only 25% of the total population live in the two urban centres. Furthermore, the road infrastructure outside main areas of Efate and Espiritu Santo is not well developed. Grid power is provided only in 4 islands, and even where it is available it is rather costly. 25.5% of all households and 32% of rural ones have no access to electricity20—this makes powering ICT devices, including end-user equipment, rather challenging. Furthermore, climatic conditions (including humidity) as well as prevalence of small generators as a source of power makes for an unfavourable environment for the use of laptops and other ICT devices. Development and operation of ICT and supportive infrastructures are made more challenging by the Vanuatu‘s vulnerability to tropical cyclones and 14 $1000 for the Vanuatu-Fiji segment, $250 for a backhaul from Fiji to Sydney and $60 for IP transit from Sydney.

World Bank. 15 Even if increased utilisation of the submarine cable could drive the costs lower, OGCIO’s assessments suggest that it is unlikely for the wholesale costs to go below US$300-500 per Mbps per month (depending on scenarios). This is without prejudice to a possible assessment of costs that could be conducted by the TRR as per its functions. TRR has not contributed to the cost assessment referred to in this document. 16 Telegeography (2012). IP transit price declines steepen.

In 2012, a report commissioned by the United Nations University ranked Vanuatu the most at risk country in the World to natural disasters.21 In terms of user-related challenges, the primary challenge is a limited buying power of residents, arising from high costs of ICTs coupled with low incomes. This seriously impacts affordability of ICT services and products. Further to the affordability-related concerns above, the extent of the challenge is demonstrated by a fact that in 2012 the ITU ranked22 Vanuatu 143 out of 161 countries in terms of ICT prices. Moreover, as demonstrated in the figure below, ICT prices in Vanuatu seem to be much higher than the average for countries with similar incomes (measured as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita). Gross Domestic Product per capita in Vanuatu (adjusted for the purchasing power parity; current international US$) in 2010 was US$4449.7323. Furthermore, Vanuatu has dramatic rural-urban income inequalities—over 80% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, yet the rural sector contributes only 21 Submission to the National ICT Policy from the National Disaster Management Office and Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department, 15 May 2013. 22 International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (2012).

Development of digital skills will likely be constrained by the lack of basic literacy and skills. As per the World Bank data, 82% of adults in Vanuatu are literate25. Local studies, however, present an even more pessimistic picture. A recent survey suggested that the literacy rate in Shefa province was only 27.6% of the population26. Data from the Ministry of Education indicates very high rates of “critical underachievement” in basic literacy and numeracy—namely 59% in Anglophone and 65% in Francophone literacy, and 66% in Anglophone and 61% in Francophone numeracy27. A similarly bleak picture is presented by school enrolment rates—gross secondary school enrolment currently stands at 54.69%28. In encouraging the development of content and applications, a vicious circle 24 Government of Vanuatu (2012). Vanuatu Education Sector Public Expenditure Review.

Vicious Circle—Challenges related to Content and Applications No users No incentive to produce content No content No incentives to connect 21 National Information and Communication Technology Policy (depicted below), caused by a low-level of consumption, content (applications) and infrastructure availability, will need to be broken. Development of e-Government is also constrained by a number of specific challenges, including: 1 Operational challenges with current non-electronic processes; 2 Wide-ranging levels of readiness, including capacity and preparedness, of various Ministries and Government Departments; 3 Financial constraints, in particular in relation to recurrent operational expenditures; 4 Many competing priorities; 5 Difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified ICT staff. Successful development of the ICT sector will have to take into account and, to the extent possible, mitigate the challenges outlined above. However, many of such challenges, constraining ICT development, especially in its early stages, also strengthen a business case for it. Challenges of a similar nature are faced by other solutions for public and private service delivery in Vanuatu (especially when transport, postal or similar services are required). ICTs provide a more effective and cost-efficient way to overcome them, including by enabling: 1 Savings in transport and postal services as information could be transmitted using ICT networks; 2 Much easier distribution and storage of educational material29; 3 Opportunities to strengthen education and make it more engaging30; 4 More effective and cost-efficient public services; 5 Cost-efficient way to distribute content; 6 Better mitigation, preparation for, response to and recovery from disasters and other emergencies31. Therefore the successful development of the ICT sector will offer clear rewards to the Government and the public of Vanuatu. It will enable kick-starting of a self-re- inforcing virtuous circle, which will ensure more effective and cost-efficient pro- vision of public and private services by increasing utilisation of ICT services and tools, which will in turn open up further demand and free up funds for even more products and services provided by the sector32. This will not only make the ICT development much easier and more self-supporting, but will also enable the Government to support the general socio-economic development in an increas- ingly sustainable, effective and cost-efficient manner. 29 As noted in a joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the Ministry of Education— i.e., the Curriculum Development Unit, Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education, In-Service Training Unit, Education Assessment Unit, and Joint EPublications and Security Course Committee, 16 May 2013. 30 A joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the Ministry of Education noted: “Young people all over the world are taking to ICT in a way that has never been seen before inside education. The technology appears to address many different learning styles and has an intrinsic fascination for most people, especially the young.”, ibid. 31 Submission to the National ICT Policy from the National Disaster Management Office and Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department, 15 May 2013. 32 Source for this insight is in this OECD/UNESCO/ISOC Report: clear-correlation-between-local-content-internet-development-and-access-prices 22 Priorities Priorities Criteria for Selecting Priorities The Government acknowledges that the successful development of mod- ern ICTs needs to involve all interconnected elements of the ICT eco- system, including infrastructure, content and applications, devices and users. Many potentially useful policy interventions could be identified. However, in light of limited financial and human resources, it is important to choose priorities by identifying areas where policy interventions would: 1 Give impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise. The Government believes that it shall only intervene, where and to the extent it adds a significant value. If favourable outcomes are or can be achieved by the private sector, communities, civil society, citizens or other stakeholders, without a need of action from the Government, such development should be left to the respective stakeholders. 2 Produce a significant impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for the broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda (i.e., have strong positive externalities). Attention should be first paid to matters that have a potential to kick-start a virtuous circle of ICT development, which could later be taken over and continued by activities of non-Government actors, or integrated into standard day-to-day Government operations or sector-specific policies. 3 Have relatively lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders. Higher programme and project management complexity decreases the probability of successfully realizing planned outcomes of policy interventions—especially in light of rather limited programme and project capacity, as well as wide-ranging levels of capacity and preparedness of various stakeholders. This takes into consideration that the cost of failure for such initiatives should be kept low and is tailored to Vanuatu’s unique needs. 4 Rely, as much as possible, on the ready demand as well as existing models of ICT development and readily available implementation capacity. In a number of areas awareness of potential benefits of ICTs in Vanuatu is very high. Furthermore, private sector players and other stakeholders have already employed various models of extending benefits of ICTs to various communities in Vanuatu (such as providing schools with computers and Internet facilities, as well as setting up Internet Cafes). Building on such awareness, existing models and capacity significantly increases stakeholder buy-in (and reduces 23 National Information and Communication Technology Policy change-management related challenges), ability to implement policy interventions using local resources, and ultimate sustainability of results. The most successful ICT-related policy intervention in Vanuatu to date—the lib- eralization of the telecommunications market—met all of the criteria above. Therefore the Government intends to build on this positive experience when pur- suing further initiatives. The Government will apply the criteria above not only when selecting specific priorities, but also when choosing and designing strategies meant to implement such priorities. Specific Priorities Having regard to the above, The Government has identified the following priori- ties for this National ICT Policy33: 1 Access to ICTs in Education: Providing educational institutions with access to ICT infrastructure and related services (especially, the Internet) and equipment adequate to support the educational process, providing students with access to ICT devices, as well as providing appropriate ICT-based educational content. 2 Access to ICT Infrastructure and Devices: Enhancing general access to as well as availability and affordability of the reliable ICT infrastructure (including, wireless voice, voice-related services, and the Internet, but also radio), related services and devices, with an emphasis on demand side measures, enhancing overall resiliency of the national infrastructure, and lowering costs of services and devices as they are delivered to end-users. 3 E-Government: Enhancing effective and cost-efficient use of ICTs (including wireless communications) in Government operations, in particular in terms of internal administration; and promoting ICT- enabled interaction between the Government and other stakeholders, including citizens34. 4 Integration of ICTs into Sectoral Policies: Recognising an enabling and transforming potential of ICTs for every sector and policy area, in particular such key areas as education, health, productive sectors, transport (especially maritime), trade and attraction of foreign investment, gender equality, social equity, democratic participation, preservation and promotion of local culture (including arts), protection of environment35 as well as disaster management; and achieving a strong direction towards realising such potential through the development and subsequent implementation of appropriate sectoral policies. 5 Building Trust (Mitigating Risks and Threats related to the ICT Development): Recognizing that alongside numerous benefits, ICTs also bring various dangers, including an exposure to harmful information; 33 See Annex A for an explanation on how these Priorities meet the respective selection criteria. 34 Developing tools for enhanced subject-specific interactions will, however, generally be addressed under Priority 4. 35 Potential of a negative impact of ICT tools on the environment (e.g., in terms of electronic waste, energy consumption) needs to be recognized as well, and appropriately mitigated. 24 Priorities new avenues for criminal, including fraudulent, activities; new threats for protection of confidential information and important infrastructure; as well as new risks of disruption of social and economic life; and ensuring that those dangers are properly addressed and managed, in particular through appropriate preparedness, education and awareness building. Individual privacy should be maintained throughout. 6 Locally Relevant Content: Increasing availability of locally relevant sustainably supported content, especially by making global content accessible in local languages. 7 Capacity Building: Enhancing skills necessary to utilize and develop ICTs, especially in the public service. 8 Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Coordination and Collaboration: Recognizing that any pre-established policy cannot foresee every initiative that could benefit the development of the ICT sector, neither any one central agency can envisage and direct all of them; and therefore setting up a platform for expertise, knowledge and skills to be shared among various stakeholders and sectors, duplications to be eliminated and potential synergies exploited, thereby enabling a substantially self-organizing (although enabled and coordinated) ICT development process. Annex B sets out anticipated results (in terms of outcomes and impacts) that the Government expects to achieve by addressing the Priorities above. General Considerations The Government acknowledges that the Priorities above do not include immedi- ate and ambitious agenda in certain important areas, including health and produc- tive sectors as well as disaster management. The Government considers, however, that the effective utilisation of ICTs in such areas requires strengthening of the preparedness of respective institutions first, and applying an appropriate process of strategic planning. This is needed to ensure that the promotion of ICTs does not become a standalone isolated activity, but that it meaningfully contributes to the operation and development of the respective sectors. This will be achieved by implementing strategies under Priorities 4 and 7. Importantly, implementation of strategies under the Priorities above, in particular Priorities 1, 2, 3 and 5, will prepare the ground and provide a platform for initiatives in other areas. Implementation of Priority 8 will facilitate utilisation of ICTs across all areas important for socio-economic development, by enabling cross-pollination of experiences and more effective cross-utilization of resources and platforms. 25 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Approaches and Principles In working towards Priorities of this Policy, the Government intends to apply a set of approaches and principles, set out below. These approaches and prin- ciples should enhance success of achieving individual Priorities as well as the overall objective, in particular by: (a) facilitating synergies among different strategies to achieve Priorities set out in this document as well as other national developmental objectives; (b) building on previous achievements; and (c) employ- ing most affordable, efficient and effective solutions (rather than “coolest” or most marketed). Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Collaboration The Government recognizes that it is not possible to achieve the overall objec- tive and Priorities of this Policy through Government actions alone. Therefore the Government accepts an approach of multi-stakeholder collaboration as en- dorsed by outcomes of the World Summit of the Information Society, in partic- ular the Geneva Plan of Action of 2003, as well as Resolution 67/195 of 2012 of the United Nations General Assembly and the FAIDP. The Government acknowl- edges of key stakeholders such as ICANN, IANA, APNIC, ISOC, PICISOC, W3C, IETF and other regional and global partners in internet governance and standards definition. The framework of multi-stakeholder collaboration, in particular as enshrined in Paragraph 3 of the Geneva Plan of Action36 and the FAIDP, provides for specific roles for various stakeholders, namely: 1 “Governments have a leading role in developing and implementing comprehensive, forward-looking and sustainable national e-strategies. The private sector and civil society, in dialogue with governments, have an important consultative role to play in devising national e-strategies.” 2 “The commitment of the private sector is important in developing and diffusing information and communication technologies (ICTs), for infrastructure, content and applications. The private sector is not only a market player, but also plays a role in a wider sustainable development context.” 3 “The commitment and involvement of civil society is equally important in creating an equitable Information Society, and in implementing ICT- related initiatives for development.” As per the FAIDP, the civil society has an important role in working with communities. 36 Quotes below are from the Geneva Plan of Action. 26 Approaches and Principles 4 The FAIDP also recognizes a role for communities to own and drive initiatives. 5 “International and regional institutions, including international financial institutions, have a key role in integrating the use of ICTs in the development process and making available necessary resources for building the Information Society and for the evaluation of the progress made.” In addition to the specific stakeholders mentioned above, the Government notes the significance of such stakeholders as development partners, academia and us- ers. The Government further recognises the importance of such locally relevant stakeholders as churches and custom chiefs, which work closely with the civil so- ciety and communities on the socio-economic development, in particular in rela- tion to social and cultural aspects of such development. Ultimately and importantly, success of any developmental effort relies on the input of every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. The Government will therefore make efforts to engage the public-at-large in the policy development and implementation process, and, on the other hand, will expect an active participation of every citizen and resident in this undertaking. Furthermore, the Government recognizes that ICTs both enable development of other sectors, and are dependent (especially in relation to the energy sector) on them. The ICT development needs to recognize such interlinkages. Pacific ICT Ministers in their Tonga meeting of 2009 also acknowledged “the need for a strategic approach to the development and use of these technologies that recognizes the important role of the private sector and the value of building synergies with developments in other sectors, including health, education and energy”. Therefore the Government endorses a multi-sector approach in the development of ICTs. The multi-stakeholder (and multi-sector) approach has been instrumental in the development of the Vanuatu’s ICT sector so far. The Government reaffirms its commitment to such an approach. It fully accepts “the concept of ‘many partners, one team’ in progressing a more coordinated and coherent approach to ICT development”, as endorsed by the Pacific ICT Ministers’ Tonga Declaration of 2010. The Government believes that an effective implementation of its role in this framework of a multi-stakeholder cooperation requires the Government to generally follow best-practice procedural principles, including: (a) transparency; (b) stakeholder involvement; (c) clear procedures; (d) planning; and (e) accountability. Therefore it will, wherever feasible, conduct public consultations and actively seek input from relevant stakeholders. It will also aim to base its activities on, preferably, rolling multi-annual, work plans; measure them against Ultimately and importantly, success of any developmen- tal effort relies on the input of every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. The Government will therefore make efforts to engage the public-at-large.” 27 National Information and Communication Technology Policy pre-established key performance indicators; and produce annual reports. It will also seek to formalize its procedures, including procedures for interaction with stakeholders. Where appropriate, the Government will also consider special arrangements enabling and encouraging effective participation of all stakeholders, including stakeholder groups that face specific barriers to such participation37. The approach, described in this section, should be applied both in implementing strategies under Priorities 1-7, as well as in identifying, defining, developing and implementing new initiatives under Priority 8. Importantly, such an approach should be employed not only when implementing initiatives falling directly under this National Policy, but also when developing and, subsequently, implementing sectoral ICT policies under Priority 4. This should be done by, in particular: (a) involving relevant stakeholders; (b) recognising synergies with other sectors, and purposefully seeking for opportunities beyond traditional remits of respective organizations through exploiting potential for positive externalities outside narrowly defined sectors; (c) employing coordination mechanisms set out in and established for the implementation of this Policy; and (d) following best-practice procedural principles. Pragmatic Approach The Government believes in the importance of an ambitious, but pragmatic ap- proach in achieving the overarching objective of this Policy. In following this ap- proach, the Government intends (and will encourage other stakeholders) to: 1 Make use of most appropriate, affordable, efficient and effective technologies, business and operational models and services, having due regard to technologies, models and services that: a are already prevalent and could be further utilised; b are offered or are included in plans of service providers; c could be rolled-out relatively easily using existing infrastructure and having due regard to local circumstances. In this context, the Government specifically notes the widespread availability38 of 2.5G mobile communications services in Vanuatu, as well as nearly universal39 use of such services, especially basic mobile voice and SMS. The Government also acknowledges that service providers have commenced deployment of 3.5G mobile communications services. Availability (especially of 3.5G services) and, in particular, quality of such services still needs to be enhanced and improved, and the Government intends to encourage this. The Government will also encourage further upgrade of such infrastructure. Nevertheless, the Government intends to encourage utilisation of infrastructure and services deployed, in particular by recognizing 37 e.g. people with disabilities. 38 Reportedly such services cover more than 90% of population. 39 Pacific Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) in its study Net Effects: Social and Economic Impacts of Telecommunications and Internet in Vanuatu (2011) reports that 99.4% of households use mobile phones, 95.5% of households own one (making a mobile phone the most common electrical appliance in Vanuatu homes), and 4 out 5 persons surveyed have their own mobile phone. 28 Approaches and Principles the potential of and promoting mobile applications, including M-Government, in achieving Priorities of this Policy. The Government recognises that in many cases achievement of Priorities under this Policy entails expanded access to specific services— namely the relatively high-speed Internet. Furthermore, as demonstrated above, access to the broadband Internet generally delivers much greater economic impact than access to other telecommunications services. Therefore the Government will not shy away from promoting expanded access to the high-speed Internet as an important tool in achieving the overall objective of this Policy and especially Priorities 1 and 2. Specific characteristics of such high-speed Internet will generally be determined in the context of specific priorities, strategies and/or projects, having regard to the local needs, requirements associated with specific uses of such Internet and pragmatically attainable levels of service at specific locations. Nevertheless, taking into account market developments, including those referred to above, the Government considers that high-speed Internet services should be universally available at speeds attributable to at least 3.5G mobile communications technologies, having regard to: (a) that 2.5G mobile communications technologies may be used in the interim, while infrastructure capable of delivering higher speeds is deployed; and (b) potential of shared use of services as described below. The Government will, however, expect for certain areas to benefit from higher speed broadband Internet, including based on optical fibre, in particular in urban centres, especially in Port Vila and Luganville, where government offices and businesses that rely or would greatly benefit from such services are concentrated. In any case, the Government notes that the ICT sector is characterised by very rapid innovation and improvements. Therefore it expects that speeds and quality of telecommunications services will be constantly upgraded to reflect capabilities of current technologies as well as changing needs of users. The Government also recognises that services at the access network level need to be supported by appropriate backhaul networks as well as international connectivity. Therefore, whenever promoting infrastructure development, the Government will take an end-to-end network approach. In this regard it will aim to identify bottlenecks or obstacles to the development of such infrastructure. Where appropriate, regulatory or policy interventions will be designed and implemented to address such bottlenecks and obstacles. Specifically the Government acknowledges its role in facilitating appropriate solutions for reliable cost-efficient high- capacity and high-quality international connectivity, as well as solutions reducing reliance on such connectivity (such as a well-developed internet exchange point). Importantly, references to specific technologies in this Policy should only be considered as a manner to refer to specific functionality of services. The Government will by no means limit implementation of this Policy to specific technologies and, to the extent feasible, will not prescribe any specific technologies in its instruments. It will also 29 National Information and Communication Technology Policy encourage all parties to take a technologically neutral approach. The Government generally prefers decisions on specific technologies and solutions to be taken by users and providers of such solutions, unless a choice of specific technologies is justified by public interest imperatives, such as significant reductions in costs resulting from harmonized approaches to the provision or procurement of services or other solutions. The Government also recognises the continuing importance of ‘old’ ICTs, in particular traditional terrestrial radio40, for achieving the overall objective of this Policy. Television could potentially also serve important needs of residents. However, costs and benefits of expanding television services would need to be further evaluated, especially in light of convergence of technologies, networks and services leading to a potential to provide television-like services over Internet-type networks. The Government also acknowledges that models of shared and common use of ICT services, such as Public Internet Access Points (including Internet Cafes) and, more traditionally, communal use of radio and television41, have found their acceptance in Vanuatu. While ensuring that it remains vendor-neutral, the Government will generally promote use of devices that are suitable for specific conditions of use, in particular when respective ICT solutions are implemented in outer islands42. However, regard should always be had to the considerations outlined in point 2 below. In this context, for example, durability of devices should be weighed against easiness and affordability of replacement as well as initial acquisition barriers. The Government will also take a pragmatic approach when selecting software platforms, tools and solutions to use. It will make decisions on whether to use Free and Open Source Software or commercial products on a case-by-case basis, having regard to total costs of ownership, capabilities of available human resources and other relevant factors. 2 Have reasonable expectations for the appropriate level of access to ICTs and their reliability, quality and sophistication provided and utilised in the context of specific solutions. The ultimate goal of this Policy, in particular as sought via Priority 2, is to provide residents with individualised access to ICTs, which they could use to maximise their personal utility. However, the Government acknowledges that this may not be immediately feasible. Therefore it con- siders shared access to ICTs, including via use of ICTs in shared (com- mon) facilities or sharing access to telecommunications services via wireless or other similar networks covering specific localities, to be an 40 As demonstrated by the findings of InterMedia (2013). Citizen Access to Information in Vanuatu. Study supported by ABC International Development and AusAID. 41 InterMedia (2013). Citizen Access to Information in Vanuatu. Study supported by ABC International Development and AusAID. 42 e.g. in many circumstances mobile devices, which would be more resilient to elements (including sun and rain) and powered by a battery, which ideally could be charged using solar or small-generator-based power sources, might be better suited for use in outer islands than stationary devices requiring an uninterrupted external power source. 30 Approaches and Principles appropriate tool to come closer to achieving objectives of this Policy. As referred to above, such a manner of using similar services is rather preva- lent and accepted in Vanuatu. The Government also accepts that an incremental reliability of ICT services (including the reliability of power supply) as well as their incre- mental accessibility (e.g., specific hours of operation) comes at an incre- mental cost. This may be particularly significant in places where support- ive infrastructure (including transport and energy infrastructure) is weak or non-existent. Such considerations similarly apply to quality, including reliability, and comprehensiveness of solutions addressing various Prior- ities of this Policy. The Government will have regard to realistic requirements for solu- tions that would be appropriate to local circumstances, locally relevant levels of utility and expectations; and will encourage other parties to do the same. Maximum flexibility should be afforded to implementers of pro- jects to decide on operational arrangements. Moreover, when deciding on a required level of comprehensiveness and sophistication of specific solutions, the benefits of such solutions shall be assessed realistically. Such assessment should not be based on an optimistic evaluation of the maximum utility that could possibly be derived from respective solutions, but on a reasonably expected level of a long-term utility, having regard to available capabilities to make use of such solutions, as well as the capacity to support and maintain such solu- tions over time. 3 Adopt and encourage an add-on approach to developing ICT infrastructure and related facilities. The Government recognises the importance of supportive infra- structures and facilities, especially energy infrastructure and appropri- ate premises for shared (common) use of ICTs, for the development of ICT infrastructure and related facilities and extending access to ICTs. As much as possible, ICT infrastructure should not be developed on a stan- dalone basis, but, to maximise cost-efficiencies, as an add-on to the exist- ing infrastructure or facilities and/or as follow-on projects to the develop- ment of such supportive infrastructure. In exceptional situations, where it is necessary to establish such supportive infrastructure to enable pro- vision of ICTs, due regard should be given to an ability to re-use such infrastructure to support general needs of respective communities or or- ganisations, even if such re-use could marginally increase costs of such facilities. In the context above, the Government will seek to coordinate ICT de- velopment initiatives with other developmental initiatives, such as the de- velopment of rural electricity. Furthermore, shared (common) access to ICTs could be best provided at premises that are already widely recog- nized as neutral community facilities (such as schools) and/or commonly frequented by the public (such as shops, postal offices or bank branches). General supportive infrastructure (including electricity) available at such facilities would normally also support provision of ICTs. 31 National Information and Communication Technology Policy 4 Adopt a “push—don’t jump” approach in expanding availability of, access to and utilisation of ICTs. The Government recognises that expanding availability of, access to and utilisation of technologies in the developmental context should fol- low the same laws that apply to diffusion of technologies in general, and network-type technologies, including ICTs, in particular. An appropriate policy should not attempt to overcome such laws, but employ them to en- hance effectiveness and sustainability of policy interventions. The above includes such mutually reinforcing laws as: (a) Metcalfe’s law, which characterises network effects; and (b) the technology adoption curve. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network (whether physical, virtual or logical) is proportional to the square of users (or devices) con- nected to such a system. This is derived from the pattern of growth in po- tential links (bilateral connections and communication opportunities) as a number of users (or devices) increases. Metcalfe’s law, as represented in the graph below, explains why every new user will find, in an accelerating manner, it incrementally more valuable to use specific ICT services or ap- plications, and how new additions increase the value to existing users. The Technology Adoption Curve, as represented below, demon- strates how diffusion of a technology starts with a small number of in- novators, who are followed by a larger number of early adopters, subse- quently followed by a majority of users, until finally it is adopted by late comers. Naturally, encouraging adoption of a technology by innovators and early adopters is relatively easy and cheap, whereas adoption by late comers is dependent on them being able to derive a significant value from such a technology. When put together, Metcalfe’s Law and the Technology Adoption Curve mean that the most reasonable way to encourage adoption of a Figure 4. Metcalfe’s Law Va lu e of a N et w or k Number of Users 32 Approaches and Principles network-based technology in a sustainable and, potentially, self-reinforc- ing manner is to follow the logic of the Technology Adoption Curve. That way a relatively easy enticement of earlier adopters will increase the value of such a technology to later comers and will, in turn, make it easier to at- tract the latter and sustain their interest in the technology. At the same time, working against such laws hinders the reinforcing sustainable de- velopment and kick-starting of a virtuous circle of network-effects-based development, in which an increasing user base attracts new users, and new users make it more attractive for existing ones to stay connected. A simplified representation of those opposite approaches is shown in the graph on the next page43. If ICTs, contrary to the preferred approach described above, were to be first provided to the most remote and most challenging areas to the people who need most support in using such tools and services, with- out such ICTs being available in less challenging areas, the beneficiar- ies of such initiatives would not derive much value from them. Such ben- eficiaries would not have anyone to communicate to using such tools and services, and not much content and applications to make such ICTs use- ful. Furthermore, in such a scenario there would be no indigenous sup- port system that would ensure sustenance of implemented solutions and maintenance of infrastructure, facilities and devices. Isolated projects in very remote areas have small chances of success, and/or require very sub- stantial recurrent resources leading to high costs for relatively moderate benefits. 43 See the gap between the value and costs/effort for each of the two approaches. The Government considers that its’ primary role should be to provide a direction to, enable, facilitate, and encour- age development of the ICT sector, including via setting appropriate policies.” Figure 5. Technology Adoption Curve Late Majority 34% Laggards 16% Early Adopters 13.5% Early Majority 34% Innovators 2.5% 33 National Information and Communication Technology Policy A “pushing from the centre” approach naturally entices new users at the “edges” with relatively smaller efforts and costs, as well as provides a more sustainable support to such “edges”. Therefore, although alterna- tive approaches may appear socially and politically more appealing, their overall benefit to the society (and, ultimately, even to disadvantaged ar- eas) is likely to be much more limited than an “expanding-from-the-cen- tre” approach. The “push—don’t jump” approach, together with the below-described reliance on the private sector, means that the Government will aim to constantly push boundaries of a reachable market that the private sector could address by itself. The Government will then seek to enable the pri- vate sector to take over and serve the expanded market to an as sustaina- ble extent as possible, leaving the Government to push such boundaries even further—as represented in the graph below.

In the Priorities and Action Agenda the Government also expressed its belief “that the role of Government is to promote inclusive eco- nomic growth, and that the private sector should be the engine of this growth”. The Government also notes the positive experience in Vanuatu where the private sector, unleashed by the liberalisation of the telecommunications market, tremendously expanded access to mobile communications. Furthermore, the vibrant local information technology sector has also contributed to the development of ICTs in Vanuatu. The Government therefore considers that its’ primary role should be to provide a direction to, enable, facilitate, and encourage development of the ICT sector, including via setting appropriate policies, establishing an appropriate legal framework, providing effective regulation, and, where appropriate, implementing initiatives that would expand and enhance the sector. Its interventions should be limited to cases (and extent), where the Government’s actions would add a significant value in terms of the socio-economic development that would not happen otherwise. Generally, however, the deployment of infrastructure as well as the provision of services, content, applications and solutions should be left to the private sector. The Government believes that the private sector should be unleashed to play such a role in the most effective manner. The Government considers that generally profit and private value motives provide an appropriate basis for sustainable solutions contributing to the achievement of the overall objective of this Policy. It, however, expects the private sector to take a long-term approach to value (including shared value44) creation, rather than short-term profit maximisation, and to demonstrably and proactively seek to satisfy current and future ICT needs of businesses, residents and the public sector, in particular in relation to the overall objective and Priorities of this Policy. Without prejudice to the importance of sustainable competition, the Government also expects private sector players to collaborate among themselves in ensuring that ICT sector development needs are met in the most-cost efficient manner. The Government recognises that the transparency and predictability of the business environment is important for the private sector to be able to take a long-term shared-value-creating approach. This Policy provides a degree of this. The Government is committed to further improve such transparency and predictability, including in such areas as tax and customs policies. The Government is also committed to provide a non-discriminatory environment, without undue favouritism, that would enable private sector players that serve 44 Porter and Kramer (2011) describe creating shared value as creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges. They further explain that “[t]he concept of shared value can be defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simul- taneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress.” Porter, M. E. and Kramer, M. R. (2011). ‘Creating Shared Value’. Harvard Business Review. January 2011. Accessible at: 35 National Information and Communication Technology Policy needs of the community best to succeed. When creating an enabling environment attractive to private investments, the Government will pay significant attention to the sustainability of such environment. The Government considers that such sustainability requires for private investments to deliver demonstrably tangible value to the national socio-economic development. Therefore its policies aimed at attracting such investments and investor-targeting will consider both: (a) comparative attractiveness of Vanuatu; and (b) public value of such investments (in terms of jobs, public sector revenues and other factors). The Government will also promote and, where appropriate, ensure that publicly or centrally controlled resources (such as radio spectrum, numbering, IP addresses, and national “.vu” domain names), necessary to support provision of infrastructure and services, contributing to the socio-economic development, are readily available and accessible in a transparent, fair, non-discriminatory and efficient manner as per swift procedures, based on objective and proportionate criteria, conditions and procedures, and are utilised in an efficient manner for the benefit of Vanuatu users, citizens and residents. A level of public control exercised over such resources should be minimum necessary to achieve the overall objective of this Policy. Having regard to the above, the Government’s preference is for a Universal Access Policy (UAP) that would, where feasible, be implemented not by redistributing levies, collected from market players (“pay” approach), but by service providers directly undertaking and implementing commitments to expand the reach of telecommunications services beyond profitable areas (“play” approach). In the context above, the Government generally considers that it is prudent to restrict provision of retail services of Government-owned or operated telecommunications networks (specifically the Government Broadband Network (GBN)) for the Government use only. To the extent permitted by its international commitments, the Government will put a special emphasis on the development of the local ICT-related private sector and its participation in the implementation of this Policy. A sustainably vibrant local ICT sector is essential in significantly enhancing the sustainability of ICT sector development efforts. It ensures that resources and skills, needed to maintain and further develop ICT solutions, are readily available in a cost-efficient manner. Furthermore, development of such sector provides positive broader socio-economic externalities, including higher-skilled and higher-paid local jobs, greater economic multiplier effect of funds spent for ICT solutions, and fostering emergence and development of business activities needed to support the local ICT sector45. Therefore, when undertaking any actions related to this Policy or the ICT sector in general, the Government will seek for a deliberate externality—to foster the local ICT industry. Importantly, however, the Government considers that any 45 Porter and Kramer (2011) note (specifically referring to firms that actively engage in shaping local business environment, especially by participating in developing local clusters) that “[w]hen a firm builds clusters in its key locations, it also amplifies the connection between its success and its communities’ success. A firm’s growth has multiplier effects, as jobs are created in supporting industries, new companies are seeded, and demand for ancil- lary services rises.” Ibid. 36 Approaches and Principles protectionist measures or special treatment of any specific companies would be counterproductive to achieving such objective and, in a longer term, would actually weaken the local sector by lowering standards and breeding complacency. Supportive measures would generally include (but may not necessarily be limited to): 1 Having due regard to an ability of the local industry to serve expanding local demand, including the demand created or expanded by policy interventions, in a sustainable manner. In this context, the Government will aim to avoid inducing sudden increases in demand for ICT products and services, especially when it is likely for such increases to be followed by abrupt contractions of such demand. The Government favours a gradual and sustainable ramp-up of the private sector capacity. Where appropriate, the Government will aim to time policy interventions in a counter-cyclical manner; 2 Encouraging foreign suppliers and investors to collaborate with the local private sector, as well as to contribute to upgrading of the local business environment; 3 Encouraging and, where appropriate, facilitating upgrading of the local ICT-related private sector, including by supporting establishment and subsequent development of a local ICT industry association (or a respective group within the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry) as well as stronger collaboration between the industry, the academia, other entities contributing to capacity development and other stakeholders. Notwithstanding the above, the Government will not shy away from taking a more proactive role in developing the ICT sector (including, where necessary, by de- ploying or investing into telecommunications networks and/or redistributing UAP-type levies) to meet the ultimate objective of this Policy, if the private sec- tor will not prove capable to play the role envisaged in this Policy with a suffi- cient certainty. Where necessary, the Government will take appropriate actions to ensure that the national socio-economic development is not constrained by inad- equate inputs from the private sector. However, even in such circumstances the Government will aim to limit its interventions to addressing the needs not met by the private sector only, and, where possible, will have an exit strategy allowing the market to take over, when its ability to do so is demonstrated. Sustainable Best Practice ICT Sector Governance The Government recognises that effective ICT sector development in general, and effective private sector participation in the socio-economic development in It is important that such guidance and influence are sub- ject to limits that ensure that the regulator is not subjected to day-to-day political decision making, but only to appro- priately developed and promulgated transparent policies.” 37 National Information and Communication Technology Policy particular are reliant on effective regulation and policy making. In this regard, it reaffirms its commitment to securing independence, impartiality as well as suffi- cient human and financial capacity of respective regulatory authorities, in partic- ular the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR) or any successor to it, which should operate in a stable and predictable regulatory envi- ronment in an efficient, effective, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. International commitments, specifically Section 5 of the Reference Paper included in the Vanuatu commitments undertaken in the context of acceding to the World Trade Organization, requires any regulatory body to be “separate from […] any supplier of basic telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.” Further to this, the international best practice, which the Government accepts, requires independence and impartiality of regulatory entities in relation to market players, consumers, but also with regard to political influence46. Independence does not mean a disregard of interests of the above-mentioned groups. On the contrary, their interests are important and should be taken into account in the regulatory process. Therefore an appropriate definition of independence is “keeping equal distance from all involved parties”47. In terms of independence from political influence, in particular, it is important to recognize that no regulator can be absolutely independent. It will always be constrained by laws, political realities, public sentiments, budgets, license provisions, etc.48 Absolute independence is neither possible, nor desirable. The international regulatory theory and practice also recognize that there is no requirement for a regulator to be independent from the Government’s long- term policy or its powers to formulate such policy—it is solely required to be independent from day-to-day undue interference49. Furthermore, appropriate controls are necessary to ensure that a regulator is acting in the public interest. Therefore it is important to achieve an appropriate degree of independence that would guarantee necessary freedom for a regulator to act for the long-term benefit of the society and implement long-term policy, without being distracted by short-term interests, while at the same time recognising the reality (and, to some extent, desirability) of various practical influences on the activities of the regulator50. In the context above, it is clear that the regulatory independence does not restrict the Government and the Minister responsible for a specific policy area, 46 Smith, W. (1997). ‘Utility Regulators—The Independence Debate’. Public Policy for the Private Sector. Note No. 127, October 1997, Washington, World Bank Group; Lamanauskas, T.

P. 71-82. 38 Approaches and Principles as representatives of citizens of the country, from providing a policy direction to the regulator and, in certain cases predefined in the primary legislation, resorting to even more prescriptive modes of influencing regulatory decisions. On the contrary, this may be important to ensure that the regulator acts as an integral part of the system of good governance, promoting socio-economic interests of the country. However, it is important that such guidance and influence are subject to limits that ensure that the regulator is not subjected to day-to-day political decision making, but only to appropriately developed and promulgated transparent policies, defining long-term objectives of the Government. The Government considers that independent, sufficient, sustainable and predictable financing of a regulatory authority is an important condition of its independence and its ability to effectively exercise its functions. In this regard, the Government continues to support the system, under which the regulator is funded through fees collected from market players. However, it is important for such a system to also include regulator’s accountability for its use of funds collected, as well as results of regulatory activities. Furthermore, the Government believes that long-term sustainability of such a system can only be achieved, if costs of administering the regulatory framework, particularly recurrent costs, are kept within the means of the sector. Therefore the Government will encourage the regulator to gradually ensure that its recurrent costs are fully funded from reasonable fees collected locally, and reliance on external funding is gradually eliminated. One-off costs, related to investments that would significantly enhance the functioning of the regulatory framework and that would not be possible to make without an external support, are not covered by this approach. The Government also believes that independent, efficient and swift judicial review of regulatory decisions, as the only avenue for formal review of such decisions, is an essential part of a well-functioning regulatory framework and will, in collaboration with the judicial system, work to support this. Further to the above, the Government will continue to support such best- practice requirements for regulatory independence as transparent, impartial and merits-based selection of a head of the regulator; and a fixed-term in office for such a head, allowing early removal only on clear statutory predefined grounds and authority. Transparency and clear accountability of the regulatory authority for its work is another side of regulatory independence. However, the regulator should be primarily accountable for results, measured as per pre-defined performance criteria, rather than for day-to-day actions. In addition to external safeguards, including those set out above, the Government also acknowledges importance of internal safeguards of regulatory independence and impartiality, preventing regulatory capture and conflicts of interests of the regulatory staff. In the context above, the Government continues to be committed to the A policy-making body will continue to play a leading role in areas that are closely linked to the general social policy of the country and may require politically-driven trade-offs between economic efficiencies and social objectives.” 39 National Information and Communication Technology Policy best practice institutional setup for the ICT sector governance, in which the role of a policy maker is to set public and transparent policy and monitor its implementation, and the role for a regulator is to implement such policy within the confines of its remit and the legal framework, and at an arm’s-length from day- to-day political decision making. The regulator, however, should be sufficiently accountable for its work and outcomes of such work. It is also important for the remit and responsibilities of each party to be clearly defined. Within such remit and responsibilities each party should have sufficient freedom to exercise its functions. A policy-making body will continue to play a leading role in areas that are closely linked to the general social policy of the country and may require politically-driven trade-offs between economic efficiencies and social objectives (including in such areas as universal access and universal services). On the other hand, areas, where economic and technical considerations play a primary role (as contrary to the political balancing of social and economic objectives), will normally be left to the regulator to address with a considerable discretion. The Government believes that it is important for the interaction between a policy maker and the regulator to comply with the following principles51: 1 In exercising its policy-making powers, a policy maker shall be bound by the respective legislation. Policy should be consistent with the purpose and objective of the law (including the legislative intent). 2 Direction from a policy maker to the regulator must be one that is possible for the regulator to follow in carrying out its duties under the legislation and it should not prohibit the regulator from carrying out her/ his duties. 3 Policy is generally defined as “a course or principle of action”52. Policy should leave sufficient level of discretion to the regulator to implement its functions within the legislative and policy framework. Specific regulatory decisions should always be made on their merits. 4 In developing a policy the policy maker will follow procedural requirements set out by the law. As the ICT sector is constantly changing, new needs for Government (in a broad sense) action may arise from time to time. Such new areas and responsibilities should be eventually reflected in the primary legislation. No coercive actions could be taken without appropriate powers being granted by such legislation. However, a naturally slow pace of the legislative process may not always be able to keep up with changing needs; and some useful actions could still be exercised without formal powers—especially, activities related to awareness and education. In addressing such areas, a policy maker and the regulator would comply with their general respective roles as outlined above. Generally a policy maker will take the lead responsibility for matters requiring a legislative or policy action, or where 51 These principles are primarily based on the foreign case law—specifically the Judgment of the UK Privy Council of 21 January 2010 in case No 0079 of 2009 in Mossell (Jamaica) Limited (T/A Digicel) v Office of Utilities Regulation, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited and Centennial Jamaica Limited; and the Judgment in the High Court of Justice of the British Virgin Islands BVIHCV2007/0095 of 18 and 25 May 2007 in Digicel Limited v the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission. 52 The Concise Oxford Dictionary 9th Edn. 40 Approaches and Principles coordination with international or foreign partners or other public stakeholders is needed. The regulator will primarily be responsible for matters closely related to its existing areas of responsibility, where addressing such matters needs substan- tial economic, technical and/or legal expertise in the ICT area, especially where the long-termism and sustainability of activities are important. While the respective roles of different bodies must and will be respected, and due care will be exercised not to undermine independence and impartiality of the regulator, the Government will seek to ensure that overall consistency and effectiveness of the Government (in a broad sense) actions are achieved. Importantly, the requirements set out above should apply not merely to the regulation of telecommunications, but with respect to any regulation of private sector activity (including radio and television broadcasting, electronic signatures etc.). In order to achieve this as well as to ensure maximum cost-efficiency and effective utilisation of regulatory expertise, the Government, in accordance with the multi-sector collaboration approach, intends to review the current regulatory structure for ICT and related sectors, including utility regulation, general competition protection and consumer protection. The Government considers that requirements of impartiality with respect to market players and other stakeholders, applicable to regulatory bodies, should also apply to bodies involved in the policy making, especially the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications and the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer (OGCIO). In this regard, such bodies will generally restrain from pursuing any activities that could potentially compete with private players in the ICT sector. This concerns ownership (including shareholding and board membership) functions in relation to telecommunications service providers and other ICT market players, as well as direct implementation of such projects (e.g., development of competing telecommunications networks). Where such functions are exercised by the Government, it will aim to do so at a sufficient “arm’s length” from the sector policy making bodies, or, at least, to design and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that potential conflicts of interest would be avoided in practice and that stakeholders would be sufficiently assured of this. The main such safeguard is transparency—i.e., providing stakeholders with as much information as possible on the rationale of specific decisions. Administrative arrangements (e.g., involving appropriate third parties in decision making; conducting public consultations before decisions are made) are also useful. The Government considers that efficient and effective policy making requires that a policy maker is sufficiently resourced and has appropriate expertise available to it. It will therefore appropriately strengthen the OGCIO as well as ICT-policy-related administrative capabilities in other Ministries and Government Departments. Noteworthy, procurement of telecommunications and other ICT services and The Government appreciates that the size of Vanuatu to- gether with rather challenging market conditions… make it important to explore and implement ways to reduce costs of services by enhancing economies of scale.” 41 National Information and Communication Technology Policy products for the Government could also raise a potential for conflict of interests. It is therefore important that in exercising such functions the Government does not leverage its policy maker role to obtain, as a buyer, a special treatment from telecommunications service providers and other vendors. Fair and Effective Competition and Enhancement of Economies of Scale The Government remains committed to safeguarding sustainable, fair and effec- tive competition as the market structure that ensures that market players satisfy needs of the local community to the maximum possible extent. Tremendous ex- pansion of mobile communications in Vanuatu is a demonstration of the appro- priateness of this approach. In general, the Government believes that its any intervention should be structured in a way that would, to the maximum possible extent, avoid favouring specific market players, support competitive market forces and avoid a risk of undermining them. In this context, the Government will normally prefer demand- side interventions (i.e., supporting users) to supply-side interventions (i.e., supporting providers). The Government believes that generally such an approach would enhance competition, as private sector players would compete to satisfy the extra demand. It would also increase cost-efficiency of Government interventions, as they could be better directed to meet needs of specific social or other target groups (such as low income residents). However, there might be situations, where, because of the nature and extent of specific market challenges, demand-side interventions might not provide a sufficient “pull” for the needed supply. This may, for example, happen if the end- user-generated demand is too distant from such market challenges (as it may be with respect to international connectivity). In any case, the Government will aim to base its supply-side interventions on a clear analysis of unfeasibility of demand- side approaches, limit such interventions to the extent necessary to achieve their objectives, and implement appropriate safeguards to avoid or minimise any impact on the competitive environment. At the same time, the Government appreciates that the size of Vanuatu together with rather challenging market conditions, as described above in this document, make it important to explore and implement ways to reduce costs of services by enhancing economies of scale. In this regard the Government, while being careful not to undermine fair, sustainable and effective competition in the ICT sector, will encourage, promote and support: 1 minimization of market fragmentation, while avoiding counterproductive artificial protection of market players and barriers for entry, which could encourage complacency of current market players; 2 private (and public) sector collaboration to reduce costs, including by involving third parties to provide elements of infrastructure or shared services, and developing neutral facilities, such as an internet exchange point. The Government believes that the objective to promote fair and effective compe- tition and the objective to enhance economies of scale are not trade-offs, but, spe- cifically in the Vanuatu context, reinforce each other—as competitive market entry 42 Approaches and Principles and expansion (at least where it is possible at all) are made more feasible and sus- tainable when the cost-base is reduced. To the extent the Government participates in the ICT sector, especially by developing its own ICT infrastructure (in particular the Government Broadband Network (GBN)), it will follow the same approach as outlined above. In this regard, the Government is prepared to consider procurement of wholesale services provided by licensed service providers, as well as shared use of telecommunications facilities when further expanding, upgrading and strengthening its network. The Government will also offer its facilities, infrastructure as well as associated services for the use, on a wholesale basis, by the private sector subject to demand and technical feasibility. It will also continue and enter into new reciprocal mutually beneficial arrangements aimed to strengthen the national infrastructure, such as exchanging redundant links to enhance resiliency of telecommunications networks. The Government will engage into and implement such arrangements in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. Whenever Government’s activities have a potential to interfere with the operation of the private sector, especially in case of its one-way wholesale activities, the Government will exercise due care not to undermine sustainable, fair and effective competition in the market. The Government will ensure that it: (a) conducts such activities in a formal, transparent, fair, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner; (b) adheres to the principle of cost-orientation with a reference not merely to its own costs, but to the costs attainable by efficient private-sector players; (c) sets its tariffs in a transparent manner; and (d) publishes criteria and procedures for obtaining access to such infrastructure, facilities and services. Outsourcing such activities to a third-party entity may also be considered as an additional safeguard. The Government considers that such safeguards will generally be sufficient to ensure that private-sector operations are not unduly undermined. In any case, the Government will avoid implementing safeguards that would unduly favour or protect specific market players. The cautious approach, including cost-based price setting, may not be applicable in cases where Government activities would not compete with private sector players—neither presently (e.g., no one provides a similar service), nor potentially (e.g., absent Government’s investments private players would not invest into similar infrastructure). In such cases, the Government may decide to subsidise the development of the market, for example by subsidising wholesale services. The Government will seek, however, to ensure that such subsidy is explicit and transparent. Furthermore, such interventions would have to be reviewed from time-to-time as private sector investments and competition may be made more feasible, including by: (a) new technologies; and (b) success of Government’s interventions. Therefore the Government will seek to conduct such Although it may appear that embracing regionalisation may have a negative effect on local jobs and businesses, the Government does not believe that an artificial protec- tion of local ICT sector players is an appropriate response.” 43 National Information and Communication Technology Policy evaluations on timely basis in order to reduce the risk for an initially positive intervention to start stifling the market development. The Government recognises that its procurement of ICT services, products and solutions has a potential to affect the operation of the private sector, especially having regard to the scale of such procurement. In this context, the Government expresses its commitment to act in this role as any other reasonable and prudent large buyer of respective goods or services, seeking to maximise the long-term value for its money. It believes that such best practice modes of procurement as competitive tendering are the best tools to achieve such objectives. In any case, the Government will avoid arbitrary assignment or distribution of its procurement to specific market players. Where appropriate and subject to other provisions of this Policy, the Government will also evaluate a potential of “build” versus “buy” options, similarly to any other rational user of similar services or buyer of goods. The Government is mindful, however, that it should seek to conduct its procurement in a way that would avoid disrupt changes in market conditions (such as resulting from a change of a supplier of services that constitute a significant proportion of the market). Therefore it will investigate options to reduce an impact of its tendering on the market, while still supporting and benefiting from the market-force-driven operation of the sector. The Government recognises that fair competition may, in certain cases, be negatively impacted by “cream skimming”53. It considers, however, that direct or indirect barriers for market entry or expansion would be a counterproductive way to address such abuses, as they would enable complacency by existing market players. Negative effects of such practices could be addressed by such policy and regulatory instruments as coverage obligations, in particular associated with radio spectrum assignments, and an appropriate Universal Access Policy (UAP), especially the one formulated along the “pay or play” principles (i.e., requiring every licensee to participate in the delivery of services to less economically attractive users either by investing in the provision of such services or paying money into the fund subsidizing such provision). The Government acknowledges a potential, but also challenges presented by internationalisation (and especially regionalisation) of ICT markets in enhancing economies of scale. Many developing regions have been facing such trends. The Pacific currently seems to be somewhat lagging behind in this process, but the potential that such developments represent, especially for private sector players, makes it likely that it will start catching up. Internationalisation (in particular regionalisation) of ICT markets has a potential to bring access to international expertise, new technologies, innovative services and lower costs. Economies of scale, brought by this process, have a potential of enabling stronger and more resourceful regional competitors and enhancing competitive landscape by making national multiple-player markets more viable. The Government, however, also recognises potential challenges presented by regionalisation and internationalisation of ICT markets, especially to national policy makers and regulators constrained by the boundaries of their jurisdictions. Local private sector players may also face challenges, if they do not find effective 53 “Cream skimming” is a practice of serving only high-value low-cost customers, and avoiding investments needed to serve less profitable ones. 44 Approaches and Principles responses to greater capabilities and expertise as well as lower costs of regional players. Although it may appear that embracing regionalisation may have a negative effect on local jobs and businesses, the Government does not believe that an artificial protection of local ICT sector players is an appropriate response. Such protection would increase prices, constrain innovation and limit offerings for ICT services and products, which are crucial inputs into the general socio-economic development. A protection-based approach would also be unsustainable, as regional counterparts embrace more open markets. Early and effective opening of the telecommunications market proved that Vanuatu stand to benefit from embracing, rather than resisting change. Therefore the Government intends to apply the same approach in relation to regionalisation and internationalisation of ICT markets. The Government is therefore committed, especially via an enhanced collaboration with its counterparts regionally and internationally as well as regional and international organisations, to develop and implement effective solutions that would embrace benefits of regionalisation and internationalisation, at the same time offering appropriate responses to challenges presented by these processes. “Squeezing-the-Assets” and “Thinking-of-a-Greater-Good” Vanuatu’s challenging market conditions make it crucial to consider ways to min- imise costs and maximise efficient utilisation of ICT investments—not only for in- dividual stakeholders, but nationally. This is not just about marginal affordability of ICTs. In many cases, this is crucial to cross the feasibility threshold, and is a question of whether a significant part of the Vanuatu’s population will obtain ac- cess to ICTs at all. In the context above, the Government recognises that access to ICTs could be significantly expanded by enhancing the use of existing infrastructure and facilities, including facilities originally deployed to service specific needs or entities (e.g., connecting specific educational institutions, or banks). The Government will therefore encourage, especially in more remote locations, replacing an exclusive use of ICT facilities with an “anchor tenant” approach, whereby an initial user of such facilities allow and, where appropriate, actively enable and participate in providing such facilities, infrastructure and services to satisfy other existing and future needs in such locations and communities. This will apply not only to the ICT infrastructure as such, but also to supportive infrastructure (e.g., electricity, including an ability to charge end-user devices). The Government also believes that it is important to deliberately consider a potential of wider positive effects of ICT development projects that could The Government also believes that it is important to delib- erately consider a potential of wider positive effects of ICT development projects that could originally be envisaged to meet rather narrow needs.” 45 National Information and Communication Technology Policy originally be envisaged to meet rather narrow needs. Cost-related challenges in Vanuatu make it unaffordable and wasteful to satisfy such needs separately without maximising cross-utilisation of ICT facilities. For example, appropriate Government procurement policies, primary purpose of which may be to satisfy Government’s ICT needs, can be an effective tool to encourage the private sector to deploy ICT infrastructure in areas, which the private sector would otherwise consider commercially unviable, but which could be attractive as part of a larger commercial opportunity. Furthermore, projects, aimed at expanding ICTs to specific facilities in specific localities, should take into account a potential to serve broader needs of respective communities. In this context, the Government has specifically identified a potential for schools to also serve as Community Information, Learning and Communication Centres. The Government acknowledges, however, that an approach outlined above may appear to increase costs of individual ICT deployment projects, if such projects are evaluated separately. Therefore it will strongly promote inclusion of considerations of “greater good”, including a potential for ICT-related positive externalities, into evaluation of costs and benefits of different procurement approaches as well as specific programmes, projects and initiatives. The Government will employ a multi-stakeholder and multi-sector framework to promote the above. It will specifically encourage development partners to support this approach. Kick-Starting Sustainable Development The Government, wherever possible, will aim for its policy interventions to be limited in time, and ICT-policy-specific resources to be primarily used for inter- ventions that provide an impetus for development that could be taken over and continued by other stakeholders, particularly the private sector. It believes that such an approach is important in the context of constrained financial and human resources and a multitude of priorities. Generally, the Government will aim for its policy (especially ICT-policy-specific) interventions to be time-limited and with a clear exit-strategy. The Government notes that such an approach is specifically fitting the ICT sector. Interdependent elements of the ICT ecosystem, specifically infrastructure, applications (content) and services, devices and users, make natural development extremely difficult initially, but, once kick-started, supports a self-generating growth and development. This is demonstrated by simplified negative and positive feedback loops below. Subsidiarity and Stakeholder Ownership and Drive The Government believes that, while a comprehensive national policy is needed to provide a direction to all stakeholders and coordinate their actions, it is the stake- holders who: (a) have direct expertise in specific subject-matter areas that ICTs would be enabling (line-stakeholders), and/or (b) are close (including geograph- ically) to the matters addressed and people affected or will likely be the ones to feel the effect of specific actions (local-stakeholders),—that are best placed to iden- tify the most appropriate actions, modalities and ways necessary to achieve policy 46 Approaches and Principles objectives and implement respective initiatives in a locally appropriate, effective and efficient manner54. Therefore the Government believes that, wherever possi- ble, such stakeholders should be the ones making decisions and taking actions needed to implement the Policy. Central authority should perform only those tasks that cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level55. More ag- gregated (including, national) level actions should only be taken, when they would add specific and substantial value (e.g., by enabling synergies via stakeholder coordination). On the basis of local and international experience, the Government believes that successful implementation of policy interventions requires projects to be owned and driven by local and/or line stakeholders. To achieve this such stakeholders should: (a) have a clear stake in outcomes of respective policy interventions (including in terms of substantive as well as reputational outcomes (including the attribution of success)); (b) make a substantial contribution to the respective project (and, to a reasonable extent, take responsibility for project- related uncertainties); and (c) have substantial freedom and be able to exercise considerable discretion in taking actions. Stakeholder ownership and drive is not an objective by itself. It is a tool to achieve objectives of this Policy in general and of specific policy interventions in particular. The Government considers that clear and meaningful outcome- oriented expectations for and/or commitments of implementing stakeholders is an appropriate mechanism to achieve an alignment between actions of stakeholders and policy objectives, at the same time providing an environment enabling stakeholder ownership and drive. In the context of this section, the Government specifically notes the importance of local communities for implementation of projects at a local level. Demonstrable support of local communities is an important precondition for successful implementation of such projects. While local stakeholders are best placed to identify the best manner to attain and demonstrate such support, the 54 An example of a specific area, where decisions will have to be made by most appropriate line and local stakehold- ers, is limits to electronic content available via ICT tools to students in schools. 55 This is essentially how the Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘subsidiarity’. Figure 8. Negative Feedback Loop (l) /Positive Feedback Loop (r) No incentives to develop infra- structure No incentives to produce content No incentives to use infra - structure More infrastructure More content More demand 47 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Government will encourage reliance on existing forms of community organisation, including the chiefly system, religious communities and school committees. The Government acknowledges that, even if efforts are made to create an enabling environment as per the criteria above, not every stakeholder will exercise the same ownership and drive. Furthermore, the capacity of various stakeholders to implement specific projects would also differ. Therefore, especially in the context of plentiful opportunities for actions that would contribute to the overall objective of this Policy, the Government considers that actual levels of ownership and drive as well as stakeholder preparedness and capacity are important factors in deciding on priorities for initiatives. The Government will use appropriate mechanisms, including competitive application processes, for the purpose of identifying and evaluating such. Reasonable requirements for stakeholders to demonstrate capacity (including appropriate external support) to implement specific initiatives before being entrusted such implementation would normally not be considered to be a violation of a requirement for such stakeholders to be afforded substantial freedom and discretion. Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that line and local stakeholders need to be appropriately supported in order for them to effectively exercise their role described in this section. Therefore the Government will establish, support and/or promote an appropriate supportive environment that would include such elements as peer-support networks (where appropriately, assisted by experts) and other forms of sharing of best practices; awareness, education and capacity building initiatives; guidance, mentorship and advice; coordination, central knowledge-base and, where appropriate, centralised services (such as marketing or a marketplace of solutions) that would enable appropriate synergies; as well as monitoring and evaluation as a basis for learning and feedback. In certain cases specific technical measures will have to be made available to support line or local decision making56. Policy as a Process The Government notes that the policy development is not a one-off exercise. Complexity of systems affecting ICT development means that it is impossible to identify and address all the risks and other factors, affecting success of chosen policy tools and policy implementation, in advance. An invincibly future-proof policy design is an unattainable objective. Therefore the Government considers that it is important to put in place systems and processes that would ensure con- stant adaptability of the Policy. The way to achieve this is to ensure that policy de- sign and implementation are not treated as standalone separated activities, but are integrated into one cohesive process with built-in feedback loops (as per the figure below). The Government will integrate the approach above into the ICT development governance systems and processes. In this context, the Government recognises importance of a meaningful framework for monitoring and evaluation, which would be based on clear targets evaluated using “SMART” (i.e., specific; 56 e.g., implementation of decisions on electronic content that should and could be accessible in schools may need to be supported by appropriate technical measures (e.g., appropriate content management systems). 48 Approaches and Principles measurable; attainable; relevant; and time-bound57) indicators, supported by an appropriate statistical and reporting framework, and would provide continuous feedback that would be used to improve progress towards achieving objectives of this Policy. The Government recognises that not every policy intervention will be successful. It will use the policy development and implementation mechanism, as described above, to identify and accept failures, note lessons learned and discontinue support for unsuccessful policy interventions, unless there is a strong potential that a substantial redesign could provide significant improvements. Integration into the Work as Usual As noted above, the Government believes that ICTs should not be an end in them- selves, but should support activities of stakeholders in all spheres of the socio- economic development. To achieve that, ICT-related policy development and implementation need to be an integral part of policy making and implementation in respective sector policy areas. ICT-related policies should not constitute stan- dalone and isolated policy activities, detached from overall objectives in respec- tive sectors. Similarly, ICT development activities, including policy development and implementation, should, wherever possible, utilise existing institutional, po- litical, policy, public administration, custom-based, community, religious, civil so- ciety as well as similar frameworks and structures. Stakeholder and community engagement should, wherever possible, be conducted through existing commu- nity systems (e.g., chiefly system, religious communities and institutions, school committees), rather than creating ICT-specific frameworks. In the context above, the Government will aim to ensure that ICT development objectives and activities are fully integrated into and support implementation of corporate and business plans of respective Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities; are led by respective bodies, and are supported by their general budgets. The Government recognises that specific 57 United Nations Joint Inspection Union (2004). Report: Implementation of Results-Based Management in the United Nations Organizations. Figure 9. Policy Development-Implementation Process Design ImplementationFeedback 49 National Information and Communication Technology Policy policies for development and utilisation of ICTs with respect to specific sectors58 are a useful instrument to achieve objectives of this Policy. However, development of such sector-specific ICT policies should primarily be used as a tool to inform thinking of sector policy makers and implementers. Resulting objectives and strategies should be integrated into general sector policy planning and implementation frameworks (i.e., overarching policies, strategies, corporate and business plans, expenditure frameworks and budgets). At times it may be justifiable or even desirable to design financial or similar incentive programmes specifically for ICT development initiatives. However, the Government will, wherever possible, primarily use such ICT-specific programmes and projects to investigate, demonstrate and/or trial appropriateness of certain approaches in achieving specific developmental objectives. Once concepts are proven, they, as a general principle, should be integrated into generic sector development programmes, administered by entities (Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and or Statutory Entities, Stated Owned Enterprises etc.) responsible for respective sectors. The Government recognises the value of pilots, demonstration models and other similar initiatives, which could inform policy thinking, demonstrate potential of ICT tools to stakeholders and provide models and/or lessons for policy approaches that could be implemented on a broader scale. The Government will support such initiatives, as long as they fit within broad objectives of this Policy, are limited in time, scale and scope, involve all relevant stakeholders (in particular, Ministries and Government Departments responsible for respective sector policies), and include a strategy of how such initiatives would inform or be integrated into the general policy process. The Government will support establishing a mechanism (including a fund) for instigating and supporting such initiatives (as an addition to, and not a replacement of, general sector-based policy formulation, implementation, and funding instruments). In any case, strong involvement of sector-specific policy makers and implementers (with them having a lead role, or at least a strong involvement, in the design and implementation of such initiatives) will be a requirement to proceed with such initiatives. The OGCIO will primarily programme-manage, coordinate, support and guide government ICT-related programmes, projects, initiatives or elements of such, without undermining stakeholder ownership and leadership. Where centralised design or implementation of such programmes, projects, or initiatives is required, it will still be important to ensure stakeholder engagement for utilising (and, possibly, maintaining) outcomes of such initiatives as well as to avoid undermining long term stakeholder ownership. 58 e.g., ICT in Health, ICT in Agriculture and other similar policies. Vanuatu will, without prejudice to its sovereignty, seek to closely coordinate its actions and positions with its re- gional partners, especially within the Melanesian Region, but also the South Pacific and the Pacific in general.” 50 Approaches and Principles Socially Inclusive and Equitable Development It is important for the ICT-fuelled development to benefit all groups of the soci- ety, including, in particular, vulnerable groups, including women, children, lower income people, and people with disabilities. However, overall level of access to and utilisation of ICTs across all social groups is currently very low. Therefore the Government considers it pragmatic, especially at this stage, to primarily con- centrate on programmes and initiatives supporting the contribution of ICTs to the general socio-economic development, rather than on specifically targeted programmes. In the first instance, the Government intends to emphasise absolute gains from the increased ICT utilisation, rather than a specific focus on relative gains for specific social groups. Such general development would provide greatest socio- economic advances for the country as such, and would enable identification of developmental gaps, which could then be specifically addressed by more targeted approaches. This is also in line with international observations, recognizing that marginalised groups are most effectively served by “general, non-targeted interventions” rather than “targeted efforts”59. Notwithstanding the above, the Government is committed to remain vigilant in monitoring development outcomes for all groups in the society, so that gaps in the development could be identified and addressed before they result in significant developmental divides, which would seriously disadvantage certain social groups. Furthermore, the Government recognises importance of including all social groups as beneficiaries of generic developmental initiatives. Frequently more inclusive and equitable development outcomes can be achieved without significantly increasing costs or complexity of respective initiatives, but by simply ensuring that the design and manner of implementation of such initiatives give due regard to challenges faced by different groups60. In this context, wherever appropriate, the Government will promote availability and use of universally designed ICT-related goods, services, equipment and facilities, as required by Article 4 (1) (f) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities61. Being a Responsible Member of the International and Regional Community The Government considers that, in achieving the objectives of this Policy, it is important for Vanuatu to have regard to its international and regional com- mitments, including its rights and duties as a member of such organisations as the International Telecommunication Union, Asia-Pacific Telecommunity, Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation, World Trade Organization, World Intellectual Property Organization, and United Nations Educational, 59 The Independent Evaluation Group/The World Bank Group (2011). Capturing Technology for Development. An Evaluation of World Bank Group Activities in Information and Communication Technologies. 60 e.g., moving from an original male-only Rensarie Telecentre staff team to mixed-gender one significantly improved prospects of women and girls using services of the facility. 61 Article 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines universal design as “the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. “Universal design” shall not exclude assistive devices for particular groups of persons with disabilities where this is needed.” 51 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Scientific and Cultural Organization, internet governance and technical standards entities. Vanuatu will not only aim to effectively implement its current obligations, but will also undertake and meet additional commitments, fitting to a responsible member of the international community. To the extent feasible, Vanuatu will seek to be an active and constructive player in international and regional organisations, including the ones listed above, as well as international and regional forums and processes, such as the Internet Governance Forum, post-World Summit on the Information Society process, and Governmental Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers. In deciding on priorities and extent of the international and regional involvement, the Government will give due regard to the national priorities, available human and financial resources, as well as costs and benefits of such participation. In the context above, Vanuatu will, without prejudice to its sovereignty, seek to closely coordinate its actions and positions with its regional partners, especially within the Melanesian Region, but also the South Pacific and the Pacific in general, as well as its development partners. Furthermore, the Government recognises the value in learning from experiences of other countries, especially countries that share similar characteristics. It also notes synergies and cost efficiencies that could be achieved in designing and implementing or advocating certain initiatives on a regional or international level. Therefore it will seek to actively collaborate with its regional and international partners, wherever such collaboration could contribute to the achievement of the overall objective of this Policy. In undertaking and implementing international commitments, and otherwise exercising its rights and responsibilities, the Government will have due regard to the realistic ability, capacity and time needed for Vanuatu to meet such commitments in a sustainable manner without curtailing socio-economic development. Appropriate transition periods as well as understanding and support from development partners as well as other international partners will be sought for the implementation of such approach. Prioritising the Priorities Given the level of current availability and utilisation of ICTs and a potential for contribution to the socio-economic development from an increased adoption of ICTs, the Government could identify a very long list of important activities in this area. However, the Government also appreciates limitations with respect to finan- cial and human resources as well as, importantly, its programme and project man- agement capacity. Therefore the Government will seek to identify and work on a realistic number of priorities. Generally, criteria set out in Part IV of this Policy will be used to identify such priorities. The Government recognises that an effective use of resources and achievement of tangible results requires consistency of efforts over time. Therefore it will seek to ensure stability of its priorities. However, due to an extremely dynamic nature of the ICT sector, a periodic reassessment of such priorities is appropriate. The above, however, should not be interpreted as restricting other stakeholders from undertaking activities that contribute to the overall objective 52 Approaches and Principles of this Policy and comply with its principles. Moreover, where specific sector Ministries or Government Departments have resources to undertake initiatives, contributing to the overall objective of this Policy, without a need to rely on special central resources provided for the implementation of this Policy, this Policy shall not be interpreted as preventing such Ministries and Government Departments to undertake such initiatives. However, such Ministries and Government Departments shall ensure that their initiatives abide by principles of this Policy and do not contradict initiatives otherwise undertaken under it. Utilisation of Appropriate Tools The Government recognises that, in addition to such tools as laws, regulations and enforcement, which governments traditionally use to effect policy implemen- tation, implementation of this Policy could also be achieved or influenced by: 1 informing and guiding stakeholders; 2 educating; 3 coordinating; 4 promoting, encouraging and facilitating; 5 inspiring; 6 using procurement policies and power; 7 designing and implementing taxation and customs frameworks; 8 investing into and financing entities and projects; 9 directly implementing specific initiatives and projects; 10 utilising other tools, which incentivise, enable or guide stakeholders to contribute to the overall objective of this Policy. The Government also notes such approaches as self-regulation and co-regulation, and their potential to achieve objectives of this Policy in an effective and cost-effi- cient manner. In implementing this Policy, the Government will utilise an appropriate set of tools, suitable to specific aims and initiatives, which would be least interventionist, most effective and cost-efficient, most sustainable, most fitting with the apprwoaches set out in this Policy, and which would maximise long-term returns of respective initiatives. 53 Operationalizing Implementation of this Policy Operationalizing Implementation of this Policy Responsibility for the implementation of this Policy rests with: 1 The Honourable Prime Minister as the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications; 2 The multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, which has been established and is chaired by the Honourable Prime Minister. This Committee shall have the primary responsibility for the further development and coordinated implementation of this Policy. The Committee shall have a right to set up working and advisory groups to assist it in its work and take other appropriate actions that are necessary or useful in achieving objectives of this Policy; 3 The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which shall support the Honourable Prime Minister, as the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications, in her/his duties, as well as act as a secretariat to and otherwise facilitate the work of the Committee. The OGCIO will also support stakeholders in their efforts to implement this Policy; 4 The Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR) shall act as the sector regulator as well as an implementing agency for specific ICT development initiatives, particularly where such implementation could not be more effectively done by a sector-specific Ministry or Government Department; 5 Responsible Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities and other stakeholders, which are responsible for implementation of this Policy in their respective areas. The Government envisages that this Policy will be implemented through a pro- grammatic approach, based on the principles of results-based-management, and supported by: 1 Consolidated list of strategies for implementation of specific Priorities set out by this Policy, which would also specify responsible and supporting Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional or Statutory Entities, and, where appropriate, other stakeholders. This list will be initially approved by the Council of Ministers. However, the National ICT Development Committee will have a power to update it; 2 Implementation plan, which will be based on the consolidated list of strategies and, based on submissions from and after consultation with stakeholders responsible for implementation of specific strategies, will also include specific activities, outputs and timelines for implementing such strategies, key performance indicators (including targets), as well as related risks and strategies for their mitigation. The implementation 55 National Information and Communication Technology Policy plan shall be approved and updated by the National ICT Development Committee. The implementation plan for the initial consolidated list of strategies shall be approved within 3 months from the adoption of this Policy. The Government envisages that this plan will cover a 5 year period; 3 Issue- and sector-specific policies and/or strategies, which will address specific aspects of the implementation of this Policy62 in detail. These policies, to the extent they fall within the scope of this Policy, shall be endorsed by the National ICT Development Committee and, where required by specific laws, approved by the Council of Ministers; 4 Corporate and business plans as well as expenditure frameworks and budgets of sector Ministries and Government Departments, as well as similar plans and budgets of Constitutional and Statutory Entities and other stakeholders. To the extent public funding is required to implement this Policy, such funding will be provided from: 1 Funds of respective stakeholders, including regular budgets of respective Ministries, Government Departments, as well as Constitutional and Statutory Entities; 2 ICT Development Fund, which will primarily be used to provide seed funding for initiatives covered by this Policy, including piloting and testing policy approaches and establishing demonstration models, which could subsequently be integrated into generic programmes of sector Ministries and Government Departments. This fund may be managed as per the framework applicable to the Universal Access Policy Fund, without restrictions for using such funds set out in sections 17(1), 18(1) and 19(3) of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulation Act No. 30 of 2009; 3 Universal Access Policy Fund, set up and administered under section 19 of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulation Act No. 30 of 2009. Support of development partners as well as international and regional organisa- tions will be sought to fund the implementation of this Policy. Furthermore, in ac- cordance with the principles of multi-stakeholder collaboration, the Government will seek to partner with local, regional and international public, private, non-profit and volunteer organisations, including multinational corporations as well as in- ternational and regional civil society organisations (such as the Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Society), in implementing this Policy. The Government will enable and facilitate such partnerships, including by accepting and encour- aging contributions, including targeted ones, to the ICT Development Fund and Universal Access Policy Fund. Where various organisations seek to design and/or implement their own programmes, projects or initiatives falling within the scope of this Policy, the Government will encourage and facilitate coordination of such design and implementation with activities under this Policy, as well as promote application 62 E.g., Universal Access Policy, Cybersecurity Policy etc. 56 Final Provisions of principles and approaches of this Policy to such programmes, projects or initiatives. The Government through the National ICT Development Committee will develop an effective monitoring and evaluation framework, based on the principles of results-based-management and supported by an adequate statistical and reporting framework, in order to track success of the implementation of this Policy, compare achievements with the progress in other similar jurisdictions, and to provide information necessary to adjust or revise this Policy or specific strategies under it. The National ICT Development Committee shall prepare and submit to the Council of Ministers an annual report on the implementation of this Policy within 3 months from every anniversary of its adoption. The Government, through the National ICT Development Committee and the OGCIO, will seek to ensure that international and local stakeholders, as well as the public at large, are well aware of this Policy, its benefits, the progress towards implementation of it, as well as opportunities to contribute to its further development and implementation. It will also seek to recognise and showcase sector development achievements. The Government will also encourage research relevant to further development and implementation of this Policy. Where appropriate, the organizational structure for the implementation of this Policy will be supported by appropriate legislation, decisions of the Council of Ministers, Memoranda of Understanding and other appropriate instruments. Final Provisions Having regard to rapid developments in the ICT sector, the Government, assisted by the National ICT Development Committee, will seek to ensure that this Policy is sufficiently up-to-date. Generally, the Government will aim to review and, where appropriate, revise this Policy within 5 years from its adoption. This Policy supersedes the Telecommunications Policy Statement of 2009. 57 Annex A // Selecting Policy Priorities Annex A Selecting Policy Priorities Currently very few students have access to and are able to use ICTs: 5% of students have access to ICTs, 4% of students are computer literate, number of students per computer is 205, and only about 6% of schools have access to the Internet with only about 1% of schools accessing broadbandA1. Interviews with stakeholders suggest that affordability is a major issue. A design of specific interventions aimed at expanding access to ICTs should ensure, however, that they would not extend beyond what is neces- sary to catalyse provision of such access, with a preference of private provision of such ICT tools and services. Furthermore, development and distribution of educational materials supporting the national curriculum has primarily been a function of the Ministry of Education. As noted by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, “[t]he use of ICTs in the context of information society hinges largely upon having a population that can use them, which implies that all will need to acquire the skills needed to use them”A2. Computer literacy and ICT knowledge rise substantially in schools with computer labs (and pre- sumably with tablets or computing devices in the (future) classrooms)—up to 71% are computer-liter- ate in such schools, compared to close to zero in schools with no student access to computersA3. As demonstrated by Rensarie College, access to ICTs also has a significant impact on general educational achievementA4. Furthermore, as noted in a joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various en- tities under the MoEA5 and MYDST: “Young people all over the world are taking to ICT in a way that has never been seen before inside education. The technology appears to address many different learn- ing styles and has an intrinsic fascination for most people, especially the young.”A6 Young people in general and students specifically comprise a significant part of population. 47% of the population is 19 years or youngerA7. There are 18,064 secondary school students and 42,352 students at primary schools. A8 In addition to raising the level of education, as well as preparing the future work force (and thereby opening up business development and employment opportunities) and democratic participants of Vanuatu, providing access to ICTs to students has strong additional positive externalities, as there is a high likelihood that they would transfer such skills to their families, and assist such families in 1.

Annual Statistical Report 2010-11. 59 National Information and Communication Technology Policy Although it is important to involve relevant experts in implementing projects under this Priority, rele- vant initiatives primarily need coordination only among the OGCIOA9, TRRA10 and MoE. It is envisaged that schools will primarily (but not necessarily exclusively) receive support based on a competitive ap- plication process—this will allow collaboration with the most ready stakeholders. Furthermore, expe- rience has demonstrated that even mere provision of ICT tools and services to students and teachers provides strong beneficial effects (that will be enhanced by providing additional specialised content and services, but do not depend on them). In terms of providing educational content, a joint submis- sion to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the MoEA11 noted that a lot of suitable mate- rial that could be rather easily repurposed for ICT-based use already exists. A good number of school principals as well as the staff of the MoE, including provincial education of- ficers, recognise a potential of ICTs. Local information technology companies have experience in pro- viding schools with ICT tools and services (and maintaining them), and have reported requests from additional schools to support them in this regard. However, there is an affordability gap, which the Government support could assist in bridging. Furthermore, a joint submission to the National ICT Pol- icy from various entities under the MoEA12 noted availability of appropriate materials that could be de- livered via electronic means, as well as readiness and commitment of the Curriculum Development Unit and Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education to develop appropriate ICT-based locally-relevant ed- ucational materials. The Curriculum Development Unit has already produced around 200 readers in both English and French for the early years in school and many teacher guides that are currently being upgraded. As per the submission, these materials can be turned into ebooks relatively easily. Further- more, the Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education is considering creating course materials for teach- ers, which can also be turned into ebooks and possibly further developed for long distance training for teachers in outlying regions. Moreover, Wan Smol Bag creates many educational materials along with Live and Learn and other Non-governmental Organizations. Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity obtaining benefits of the use of ICT (which would contribute to them being able to have a better access to business opportunities, government services, professional development opportunities etc.). Further- more, it is envisaged that schools should become Community Learning, Information and Communica- tion Centres—such a policy would extend benefits of ICTs to surrounding communities. Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders Low level of access to the Internet, especially broadband, as well as sparse radio coverage, demon- strates a need for an action from the Government. Affordability challenges are demonstrated by a fact that in 2012 the ITU rankedA13 Vanuatu 143 out of 161 countries in terms of ICT prices. Moreover, ICT prices in Vanuatu seem to be much higher than the average for countries with similar incomes (meas- ured as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita). Furthermore, despite generally good coverage of 2.

Measuring the Information Society 2012. 60 Annex A // Selecting Policy Priorities Generally coordinated action of the OGCIO, TRR and telecommunications service providers is suffi- cient. Collaboration from other stakeholders would add value to initiatives, but would not be a precon- dition for their success. Primary responsibility for such measures rests with the OGCIO. Specific applications will be prior- itised based on the preparedness, buy-in and capacity of respective Ministries, Government Depart- ments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities. The OGCIO has already been coordinating, implementing and supporting initiatives, corresponding to this Priority, under the Integrated Government (iGov) initiative and on the basis of the E-Govern- ment Strategic Roadmap. It is envisaged that policy interventions will primarily support, extend and strengthen deployment and operation of as well as provision of access to ICT infrastructure, deployment of which has already been started by private service providers (i.e., deployment of telecommunications networks) and other stakeholders (e.g., Internet Cafes, a number of which has already been established). An affordability gap could be bridged by the Government support and appropriate policies geared to lower costs of ICTs. Such policies will also facilitate making mass-market ICT devices more available to the public. Readiness of demand is also demonstrated by the fact that only 10.9% of the population do not know what they would use the Internet forA14. Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity mobile services, quality of wireless voice and voice-related services (including SMS) would clearly ben- efit from an improvement. In any case, specific interventions should address areas, which would not be addressed otherwise by other stakeholders, in the least interventionist and proportional manner. Access to ICT infrastructure and devices establishes an enabling platform for the delivery of other pri- vate and public services, as well as for residents to seek for employment, business and professional de- velopment opportunities. Impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders E-Government services, as part of public administration, are direct responsibility of the Government. 3. E-Government Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise Government services will be delivered in a much more effective, transparent and efficient way and will be made much more accessible to residents and businesses across Vanuatu, including in rural areas. Furthermore, E-Government services will strengthen demand for ICT tools and services in general, by providing a cost efficient way to satisfy specific day-to-day needs of residents and businesses. Impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda A14 PIPP (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and internet in Vanuatu. 61 National Information and Communication Technology Policy The OGCIO will coordinate with respective sector Ministries, Government Departments, Constitu- tional and Statutory Entities on the one-to-one basis, having regard to the preparedness and buy-in of respective stakeholders. OGCIO will work with stakeholders and the CoM to develop (as directed by the PM) an agreed-upon reasonable target percentage for spending on ICTs, as a percent of total project budgets, for all major future and recently developed projects in all sectors, across the GoV. This target will tentatively be in the range of 3.0 to 5.0 percent to be spent on ICTs within each project. This Priority enables mitigating risks associated with achieving other Priorities and the ICT develop- ment in general. A failure to address this priority could, with increased utilisation of ICTs, increase vul- nerability of Vanuatu to various disruptions and even cause a backlash against the ICT development. Existing policy development and implementation instruments, including sector policies, corporate and business plans, expenditure frameworks and budgets, will be utilised. The first meeting of the National ICT Development Committee demonstrated that various Ministries and Government Departments (as well as Constitutional and Statutory Entities) acknowledge a potential of ICT contributions to their specific areas. The process of integration will be designed so that to enable such entities to transform an abstract need into specific fully understood policy actions. Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders Policy development and implementation is direct responsibility of the Government. Achieving this Priority will likely require legislative measures, including adjustments to the Penal Code. Furthermore, such areas as protection of critical infrastructure specifically require attention of the Government, as disruption of such infrastructure would have serious consequences for the life of the country. The state is also well placed to kick-start other measures, including related to awareness and education. Whenever other stakeholders demonstrate readiness to take over specific responsibil- ities, e.g., in terms of raising awareness and levels of education, the need for a state action should be re-evaluated. 4. Integration of ICTs into Sectoral Policies 5. Building Trust Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise Integration of ICTs into sectoral policies will enable enhanced utilisation of such tools across the broad spectrum of socio-economic activities with a transformative effect. The process of integration will enable sector Ministries, Government Departments, as well as Constitutional and Statutory Enti- ties to fully discover potential of ICTs and obtain a necessary understanding of how such tools could contribute to the development of respective sectors. Impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda Impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda 62 Annex A // Selecting Policy Priorities Activities will be undertaken in the context of existing structures, including the Cybersecurity Policy and Legislation Working Group. Furthermore, the TRR has already been undertaking initiatives in this area. Relevant policy interventions have already been supported by international partners—in particu- lar, the International Telecommunication Union, but also the World Bank. This area is also one of the themes of the Framework for Action on ICT for Development in the Pacific (FAIDP). The Government has already established the Cybersecurity Policy and Legislation Working Group. Specific policy interventions will be developed and implemented in the context of this group. A num- ber of stakeholders, involved in specific interventions under this Priority, will be relatively limited (al- though an overall range of stakeholders affected is likely to be rather broad). Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity Ready demand, existing models of ICT development and available implementation capacity Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders Lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple stakeholders Vanuatu is the World’s most linguistically dense country—i.e., has the highest number of languages per population. Besides 2 official (English and French) and 1 national (Bislama) languages, Vanuatu also has more than 105 local languagesA15 that are rather actively used. Currently content in such languages is virtually non-existent. The Government will primarily aim to kick-start the development of content in such languages, leaving the further process to relevant stakeholders, including, particularly, local communities. Furthermore, although commercially attractive part of the population has a good com- mand of English and French (thereby reducing incentives to provide ICT tools in Bislama), expanding use of ICTs would be clearly facilitated by availability of ICT tools adapted to Bislama. 6. Locally Relevant Content Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise Studies demonstrate a strong link between local content and the development of network infrastruc- tureA16. Furthermore, this will enhance the community buy-in into the value of ICT tools. Access to electronic content in local languages will also expand professional development and education opportunities. The Government will primarily engage in initiatives that require minimal stakeholder collaboration— e.g., by facilitating translation of existing content into Bislama and local languages; as well as making existing content available in electronic form (including online). Communities will be engaged on the basis of their commitments to make significant contributions (particularly, in terms of their effort) in this regard. Adaptation of ICT tools will rely on involving active and enthusiastic local community of ICT professionals. Tools for translation of existing content into variety of languages are readily available. A number of communities have produced dictionaries for their languages or material in their languages (e.g., bi- bles), which could be utilised for the purposes of this Priority. Furthermore, various stakeholders, espe- cially Ministries and Government Departments as well as media organisations, possess and constantly produce content that could be readily made available online. Moreover, community/non-governmental initiatives have produced useful Bislama-enabled ICT tools.A17 Impact in terms of both the matters addressed, but also for broader socio-economic development as sought by the Priorities and Action Agenda A15 Government of Vanuatu (2012).

By the nature of its place in the society and its functions, the Government is well placed to facilitate such coordination and collaboration. Stakeholders have been naturally relying on the Government for such activities. 7. Capacity Building 8. Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Coordination and Collaboration Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise Impetus to the socio-economic development that would not be achieved otherwise ICT and related skills are needed to utilise platforms created under other Priorities (as well as to fur- ther develop such platforms). As more public servants obtain ICT and related skills, they will be able to more independently devise further ideas and policies for ICT utilisation, leading to a self-fuelling further development of ICT development initiatives. They will also contribute to provision of more ef- ficient and effective Government services. Furthermore, such public servants will be able to increase awareness of ICT benefits in their families and communities. This Priority will enable a multiplicity of stakeholders to undertake initiatives aimed at developing the ICT sector and enhancing its contribution to the socio-economic development, including initiatives that could neither be envisaged, nor, possibly, implemented by the Government alone. Thereby this will unleash creativity and actions of such stakeholders. Furthermore, this will significantly increase the value, effectiveness and efficiency of initiatives of individual stakeholders due to synergies and cost savings achieved through joint efforts with other stakeholders. With respect to the public service, primarily collaboration of the Public Service Commission and OG- CIO, where required supported by contractors, will be required. Participation in such a platform will largely be voluntary, especially for non-governmental stakehold- ers. Therefore establishment of it only requires actions from the OGCIO, supported by the Honoura- ble Prime Minister and the National ICT Development Committee, and willing stakeholders. Individ- ual stakeholders will be able to choose their own pace and levels of involvement. Measures, encourag- ing enhanced involvement, will be developed, without, however, relying on such level of participation from specific stakeholders. As E-Government facilities and services were being implemented for a while, this created a ready de- mand for public servants to obtain required skills to utilise opportunities, provided by such facilities and services. Various capacity building initiatives have been undertaken. Furthermore, Vanuatu has both public and private sector providers, capable to implement respective initiatives (e.g., the Vanuatu Institute of Technology and CNS).

present to you this  National Information and Communication  Technology (ICT) Policy. This Policy  expresses a firm commitment of the   Government to maximise the contribution, ef- ficiency and effectiveness of information and  communication technologies in achieving the  National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and  Wealthy Vanuatu”, thereby empowering and ben- efiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu.   This Government’s commitment will first of  all be expressed through actions in a number of  priority areas. Access to ICTs in schools in partic- ular, and also for Vanuatu citizens and residents  in general, will be radically expanded. ICTs will  transform government services and public ad- ministration, as well as supercharge advance in  all areas related to the socio-economic develop-  ment of the country. Importantly, the Policy also recognises risks and downsides  of the increased utilisation of and dependence on ICTs and provides an impe- tus for their mitigation, especially through empowerment of users of respective  tools and services. Furthermore, the Policy will enhance relevance of ICTs for the  Vanuatu population by promoting availability of locally relevant content, as well  as our ability to develop and utilise ICTs through capacity building programmes.  Finally, the Policy unleashes creative collaboration and action of various public  and private entities, academia, civil society and the public in general by setting  up a platform for multi-stakeholder and multi-sector coordination and collabora- tion. This will ensure that the development kick-started by this Policy will extend  much further than the Government’s actions alone could reach. Furthermore, this  will significantly increase the value, effectiveness and efficiency of initiatives of   Access to ICTs in schools in particular, and also for  Vanuatu citizens and residents in general, will be radically  expanded. ICTs will transform government services and  public administration, as well as supercharge advance in  all areas related to the socio-economic development”  Hon. Moana Carcasses Katokai Kalosil,  Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu  5    National Information and Communication Technology Policy   individual stakeholders due to synergies and cost savings achieved through joint  efforts.  This Policy is neither the beginning nor the conclusion of the national ICT  development. Market liberalisation has already expanded availability of ICTs, es- pecially mobile communications, to virtually everyone in Vanuatu. A significant  part of our population can have access to the Internet. A submarine fibre cable  project, which will provide a high-speed reliable link for Vanuatu to the World, is  well underway. National infrastructure has been further strengthened by launch- ing the first Internet Exchange Point in the Pacific. The high-quality Government  Broadband Network, connecting all the provinces, has brought the Government  much closer to everyone across Vanuatu. ICTs are already transforming public  administration. Multiple public and private services can be accessed via mobile  phones or online, and the public debate has been significantly enhanced by so- cial networks. Sector institutions, specifically the multi-stakeholder National ICT  Development Committee, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer  and the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator, provide a  best-practice foundation for further development of the sector.  In our work we have enjoyed support of our friends in a multitude of interna- tional and regional organisations, as well as our development partners. I would  like to express a special thanks to the Australian Government, which has con- sistently supported the institutional and policy development in the ICT area in  Vanuatu in general, and this policy process in particular.  A lot has been achieved. However, a lot is yet to be done. ICTs have a strong  potential to transform education of our children, expand and improve govern- ment services, make us more resilient in the face of natural disasters, preserve  and promote our culture, as well as provide new business opportunities, and gen- erally enhance our livelihoods. They will bring us closer together and strengthen  our connection to the World. In short, expansion and utilisation of ICTs will cre-  ate jobs, provide economic growth and enrich our social lives. I believe that this  Policy will provide a good platform for such further developments. However, ac- tual benefits depend on all of us working together—the Government, businesses,  academia, users, civil society, and, ultimately, every citizen and resident. Only to- gether can we transform this potential into reality that we will feel every day.  I am especially proud that this is truly a Vanuatu policy. We have learned  from other countries and taken advice from international and regional experts  and documents. However, experience and insights from all of us here in Vanuatu  made this document into what it is today. Numerous stakeholder consultations, an  industry roundtable, input from multiple stakeholders through the National ICT  Development Committee, as well as obtaining public views through an unprece- dented Call for Public Input formed the basis of this Policy.  I am pleased that our efforts have been recognised by various stakeholders   ICTs have a strong potential to transform education of our  children, expand and improve government services, make  us more resilient in the face of natural disasters, preserve  and promote our culture”  6    Foreword  and observers. The Pacific Chapter of the Internet Society suggested that our pro- cess for the development of this Policy “offer a model of practice that will be very  helpful to other Pacific nations who may wish to redevelop their own ICT policies”.  A submission from an international stakeholder, received through the Call-for- Public-Input process, went even further by stating that “Vanuatu is poised to take  the region by storm in setting an example for the Pacific in accelerating ICT. It has  all the relevant ingredients to succeed. There is political will, commitment, energy  and drive to ensure the vision of a vibrant nation will emerge.” We all should take  this praise as a push to do even more.   I am calling on all stakeholders to embrace this Policy, which is a result of  our joint efforts to date, and work together to develop our country and harness the  power of ICTs in these efforts.  Moana CARCASSES KATOKAI KALOSIL  Prime Minister  7    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  Executive Summary  This Policy expresses a commitment of the Government of Vanuatu to  maximise the contribution, efficiency and effectiveness of information  and communication technologies (ICTs) in achieving the National Vision  of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu” thereby empowering   and benefiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. This document will serve as  a tool for an effective coordination of efforts of all of the various stakeholders to- wards achieving this commitment.  The Government has identified the following priority areas for this National  ICT Policy:  1 Access to ICTs in Education; 2 Access to ICT Infrastructure and Devices; 3 E-Government; 4 Integration of ICTs into Sectoral Policies; 5 Building Trust (Mitigating Risks and Threats related to the ICT   Development); 6 Locally Relevant Content; 7 Capacity Building; and 8 Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Coordination and   Collaboration.  The Government has also outlined a set of approaches and principles, which, in its  opinion, should enhance success of achieving individual Priorities as well as the  overall objective of this Policy, in particular by: (a) facilitating synergies among  different strategies to achieve Priorities set out in this document as well as other  national developmental objectives; (b) building on previous achievements; and (c)  employing most affordable, efficient and effective solutions. Such approaches and  principles specifically include:  1 Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Collaboration; 2 Pragmatic Approach; 3 Private, in particular Locally-Based, Sector Driven Development; 4 Sustainable Best Practice ICT Sector Governance; 5 Fair and Effective Competition and Enhancement of Economies of Scale; 6 “Squeezing-the-Assets” and “Thinking-of-a-Greater-Good”; 7 Kick-Starting Sustainable Development; 8 Subsidiarity and Stakeholder Ownership and Drive; 9 Policy as a Process; 10 Integration into the Work as Usual; 11 Socially Inclusive and Equitable Development;  8    Executive Summary  12 Being a Responsible Member of the International and Regional  Community;  13 Prioritising the Priorities; and 14 Utilisation of Appropriate Tools.  Implementation of this Policy will fall into the remit of the Honourable Prime  Minister, as the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications. He/ she will be supported by the multi-stakeholder National ICT Development  Committee, which shall have the primary responsibility for the further develop- ment and implementation of this Policy. Overarching support will also be pro- vided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and  the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR). Ministries,  Government Departments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities will be responsi- ble for the implementation of this Policy in their respective areas.  This Policy will be implemented through a programmatic approach, based  on the principles of results-based-management, and supported by a consolidated  list of strategies1, implementation plan, issue- and sector-specific policies and/ or strategies, corporate and business plans as well as expenditure frameworks  and budgets of respective stakeholders. Initiatives under this Policy, requiring  public funding, will be funded from regular funds of respective stakeholders  (including regular budgets of respective Ministries, Government Departments,  Constitutional and Statutory Entities), as well as the ICT Development Fund  and Universal Access Policy Fund. The Government will seek to partner with  development partners, international and regional organisations as well as local  and international public, private and non-profit and volunteer organisations,  including multinational corporations as well as international and regional civil  society organisations, in implementing this Policy.  An implementation plan for the initial consolidated list of strategies shall  be approved within 3 months from the adoption of this Policy. The Government  envisages that this plan will cover a 5 year period.  The implementation will be supported by an effective monitoring and  evaluation framework. The National ICT Development Committee will report on  the implementation of this Policy on an annual basis.  The Government will seek to ensure that the National ICT Policy stays  sufficiently up-to-date, and will generally aim to review and, where appropriate,  revise this Policy within 5 years from its adoption.  1 Initial list is attached to the Policy as Annex C.  9    Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Their Contribution to the National Development  Information and  Communication Technologies  (ICTs) and Their Contribution  to the National Development  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) defines2 informa- tion and communication technologies (ICTs) as “basically information  handling tools—a varied set of goods, applications and services that are  used to produce, store, process, distribute and exchange information.   They include the ‘old’ ICTs of radio, television and telephone, and the ‘new’ ICTs of  computers, satellite and wireless technology and the internet.” ICTs also include  various applications and services provided using computing devices, including  office productivity software (such as MS Office), electronic mail, databases, news  sites, electronic entertainment (such as video and audio content), social network- ing applications (such as Facebook), voice-over-internet applications (e.g., Skype),  video games etc.  ICTs contribute to the social and economic development by enabling  access to and exchange of information and services anywhere and anytime,  together with rapid processing and vast storage of such information. Thereby  ICTs make the provision of public and private services, including education  and professional development, health information and services, government  services, entertainment, information services, professional services and commerce  in general, much more effective, efficient, accessible and affordable. They   also enhance access to markets, disaster management, as well as democratic  participation. ICTs also provide more cost efficient and effective ways to preserve  and promote local culture. Costs of economic and social activities are decreased,  when ICTs replace transport and postal services. Furthermore, they open new  previously non-existent business opportunities (such as ICT services, business  process outsourcing, and content-related businesses).  ICTs’ contribution to the national development has been a subject of  numerous studies. A widely cited research3, represented in the graph below,  demonstrates that ICTs, in particular fast access to the Internet, accelerates  economic growth, especially in less developed countries.  2 UNDP Evaluation Office (2011).

The Government embraces the  statement of the Pacific ICT Minister’s Wellington Declaration of 2006 that “infor- mation and communications technologies (ICTs), while not an end in themselves,  have a key role as a basis for economic development, while also promoting and  enhancing social cohesion, cultural enrichment and environmental conservation”.   The regional framework for ICT development provides a context for  national objectives. The vision set out in the Framework for Action on ICT for  Development in the Pacific (FAIDP), as endorsed by the Pacific ICT Ministers’  Tonga Declaration of 2010, is “Improved livelihood of the Pacific communities  through effective utilisation of ICT”. Main goals of the FAIDP are: “(1) Access   to affordable ICT; (2) Efficient and effective utilisation of ICT for sustainable  development; and (3) Adoption of ICT as a national priority in PICTs”. Its’ sought  outcome is defined as “Enhanced social and economic sustainable development,  good governance and security through better access and use of ICT”.  In line with the global and regional objectives set out above, the Government  believes that an effective use of ICTs is a must and is indispensable in achieving  the National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu”. ICTs  have a potential to significantly contribute to (or be a part of) all the strategic  priorities, defined in the Priorities and Action Agenda, namely:  1 Private Sector Development and Employment Creation; 2 Macroeconomic Stability and Equitable Growth; 3 Good Governance and Public Sector Reform;  ICTs… can foster sustained, inclusive and equitable  economic growth and sustainable development, compet- itiveness, access to information and knowledge, poverty  eradication and social inclusion”  13    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  4 Primary Sector Development, Environment, Climate Change, and  Disaster Risk Management;  5 Provision of Better Basic Services, especially in Rural Areas ; 6 Education and Human Resource Development; 7 Economic Infrastructure and Support Services.  In the context above, the overall objective of the National ICT Policy is to maxim- ise the contribution, efficiency and effectiveness of ICTs in achieving the National  Vision, thereby empowering and benefiting every citizen and resident of Vanuatu.  The Government considers this objective to be a national priority.  By aiming for the objective above and having regard to approaches and  principles below, this Policy will directly contribute to the achievement of the  Millennium Development Goals, in particular by implementing their Target  8.F that aims to “[i]n cooperation with the private sector, make available the  benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications”. The  Government considers that this target and goals of the FAIDP are not ultimate  objectives, but rather instruments appropriate in achieving the overall objective  above (and the Millennium Development Goals in general). It has accordingly  embedded such an approach into this Policy.  Pacific Energy, ICT and Transport Ministers in their meeting in Noumea  in 2011 “recognized that national ICT policies are essential for effective multi- stakeholder coordination and partnerships to fully utilise ICT as a tool for  development and to ensure that national development priorities are addressed”.  Therefore the meeting “encouraged […] governments to adopt a more coordinated  and planned approach to developing ICT as a key tool for sustainable  development”.  In this regard, the purpose of the National ICT policy is to serve as a  framework and tool for an effective coordination of efforts of various stakeholders  towards achieving the overall objective above.  14    Current Situation and Challenges  Current Situation  and Challenges  Current Situation  In the recent years the Vanuatu ICT sector has witnessed a major transfor- mation. The telecommunications sector reform, which entailed a full liberal- isation of the telecommunications market, has attracted new market players.  Telecom Vanuatu Limited (TVL) was joined by such new entrants like Digicel,   Telsat and Can’L. This led to a remarkable increase in the availability of and ac- cess to telecommunications services, especially mobile telephony. The Pacific  Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) reports that currently 99.4% of households sur- veyed use and 95.5% own a mobile phone (making a mobile phone the most com- mon electrical appliance in Vanuatu homes). 4 out of 5 respondents have their  own mobile phone.4  Achievements of the liberalisation are safeguarded and further enhanced  by a strong, competent and independent regulator—the Telecommunications  and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR). To provide further impetus to the  sector development process, the ICT (including telecommunications) policy  portfolio has been consolidated under the Honourable Prime Minister, who is  currently also the Minister responsible for ICT and Telecommunications. The  Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) has been tasked to  support the Honourable Prime Minister in relation to the policy development and  coordination of its implementation.   In addition to the above, the Honourable Prime Minister has set up the  multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, chaired by him. That  Committee has developed this Policy. It is envisaged that it will also play a leading  role in the implementation and further development of this Policy.  Vanuatu has a rather elaborate ICT-related legal framework in place. This  framework includes:  1 Laws governing the telecommunications sector—specifically: 2 Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulation Act No. 30   of 2009; 3 Telecommunications Act [CAP 206]; and 4 Wireless Telegraph (Ships) Act [CAP 5]; 5 Electronic Transactions Act No. 24 of 2000 (as amended by the Statute   Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act No. 2 of 2010), which governs elec- tronic transactions and related matters, including legal recognition of  and requirements for electronic records, formation and validity of elec- tronic contracts as well as other communication of electronic records,   4 Pacific Institute of Public Policy (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and inter-  net in Vanuatu.  15    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  electronic signatures, encryption and data protection as well as obliga- tions and liability of intermediaries and e-commerce service providers;  6 E-Business Act No. 25 of 2000 (as amended by the E-Business  (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2007), which aims to “provide a robust and  sustainable environment for the development and growth of electronic  business in or that is associated with Vanuatu and to regulate such elec- tronic business” (section 2 (1) of the E-Business Act);  7 Broadcasting and Television Act [CAP 214], which governs radio and tel- evision broadcasting activities.  Private and public sector stakeholders have been implementing projects that have  further enhanced the ICT sector or have a strong potential to do so in the near  future. Such projects include the deployment of the first Vanuatu’s international  submarine cable, which will significantly enhance international connectivity for  Vanuatu and is due to be ready for service by early 2014. Furthermore, telecommu- nications infrastructure has been strengthened by a recently launched national in- ternet exchange point, which is the first of its kind in the Pacific.  The Government has deployed the Government Broadband Network (GBN),  connecting all the provinces. The Ministry of Health is also implementing  a separate programme to connect hospitals and major health centres. Some  Government agencies, notably the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards  Department, provide current and highly useful online information to residents.  The Government has launched the Integrated Government (iGov) initiative and  adopted the E-Government Strategic Roadmap to drive further utilisation of ICTs  in public administration. These recent achievements establish a solid foundation  for Vanuatu to achieve a significant progress from the relatively low current levels  of e-government development.  Access to the Internet in lower-income as well as remote communities is  expanded by various Government and private initiatives, including the Rensarie  Telecenter, a Wan Smolbag computer classroom as well as commercial or  community-run public Internet access points available in Lakatoro (Malakula),  Loltong (North Pentecost) and other localities.   Although access to ICTs in schools remains very low5, where such access is  available, it produces remarkable results. For example, a 55% increase in students’  pass rate from year 12 to year 13 was reported in Rensarie following provision of  the Internet to Rensarie College. Importantly, virtually all relevant stakeholders,  including the Ministry of Education, school administrations, provincial education  officers and community representatives, are in a broad agreement that schools  are well placed to serve community needs for access to ICTs by becoming  Community Learning, Information and Communication Centres. In recognition of  the importance of ICTs in the education sector and a role that this sector could  play in serving ICT needs of the population, the OGCIO and the Ministry of  Education signed a Memorandum of Understanding, outlining a comprehensive  framework for collaboration in this regard.  5 A recent study conducted by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), Ministry of   Education (MoE) and Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR) suggests that only about   5% of students have access to ICTs and only about 6% of schools nationwide have access to the Internet. OGCIO,   MoE and TRR (2013). The First Survey of ICT Usage in the Vanuatu Schools.  16    Current Situation and Challenges  The private sector has started leveraging the ICT infrastructure for provision  of its services. For example, tourism and travel services could be procured online  or via phone, Internet banking is available to residents and businesses, and the  network of ATMs is expanding. Even such traditional product as ready-for- consumption kava is available for ordering online6. Similarly, Vanuatu National  Providence Fund provides a host of services, enabling its members to manage  their accounts via ICT tools, including SMS and online.   Vanuatu has a number of information technology companies. They play an  important role in supporting the use of ICTs in the public and private sectors.  Use of ICT tools by the local population has been enhanced by Bislama- adapted ICT tools, including a dictionary and a spelling tool, produced by  community/non-governmental initiatives7.  ICTs play an increasingly important role in a democratic participation and  dialogue. The first ever nationwide Leaders’ Face-to-Face discussion, which  connected the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Leader of the  Opposition with communities in all provinces via video-conference links, was held  in 2012. Traditional media is discovering the Internet, which can already be used  to access daily newspapers and local radio, as well as distributing news via SMS.  Online-only media, such as the Vanuatu Daily Digest and the Pacific Politics Blog  of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, is emerging and becoming an increasingly  important source of information. An increasing number of Facebook groups  enhance the social and economic conversation. The largest of such groups (Yumi  Toktok Stret) has more than 10,000 members. Currently around 9,000 Vanuatu  residents (around 4% of the population) use Facebook8.   The Government also pays a significant attention to ICT-related awareness  and education of the public and specific stakeholders. A tradition to celebrate  the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day with a host of public  events commenced in 2012. Furthermore, a number of ICT-related workshops were   organized to enhance capabilities of ICT professionals. Civil society, including such organizations and groups as the Pacific   Institute of Public Policy, the Vanuatu IT Users Society, ViewPex and the Pacific  Islands Chapter of the Internet Society (PICISOC), is playing an increasingly  important role in promoting and facilitating development and utilisation of ICTs.  Local communities are also actively seeking to avail themselves of ICT-driven  opportunities9.   6 http://www.enakamal.com.vu 7 See http://www.swtech.com.au/bislama/index.html 8 http://www.socialbakers.com, April 2013. 9 E.g., Women from Nguna Island organized themselves and, with help from the United States Peace Corps, obtained   computers and relevant training.  Use of ICT tools by the local population has been en- hanced by Bislama-adapted ICT tools, including a  dictionary and a spelling tool, produced by community/  non-governmental initiatives”  17  http://www.enakamal.com.vu http://www.swtech.com.au/bislama/index.html http://www.socialbakers.com   National Information and Communication Technology Policy  Vanuatu’s efforts to develop its ICT sector have been strongly supported  by a number of development partners as well as international and regional  organizations, including the Australian Agency for International Development  (AusAID), World Bank, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Asia- Pacific Telecommunity (APT, Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank),  Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Asia-Pacific Network Information  Centre (APNIC), United States Peace Corps, Japan International Cooperation  Agency (JICA) and Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation  (CTA). The Government has been discussing opportunities for collaboration with  other public and private partners.  Achievements to date have established a solid foundation for further  development of the sector and its enhanced contribution to the socio-economic  development of the country in general.  A lot is yet to be done, however—as  evidenced by the still very low level of use of Internet services10. Furthermore, the  availability of radio broadcasting, which still is the most used and most trusted  mass medium, is far from universal—especially in rural areas and more remote  provinces11. Increased access to such services will open up a lot of opportunities  for the ICT-supported socio-economic development. Furthermore, currently widely  available services12 (including mobile voice and SMS) could be further leveraged  for delivery of public and private services.   Importantly, the environment seems to be ripe for further development. For  example, only 10.9% of the population (including those, who never seen or used  the Internet) do not perceive any benefit of using the Internet13. Therefore it is  clear that efforts of the Government and other stakeholders to further develop the  ICT sector will find a fertile ground.  Challenges Despite a lot of potential that ICTs could bring in terms of the socio-economic  development of Vanuatu, the country faces certain serious challenges to the sec- tor development. It is not unique in this regard—the Pacific ICT Ministers in the  Wellington Declaration of 2006 noted that “[t]he Pacific region faces a number  of obstacles to the effective deployment of communications and other infrastruc- ture”. Such challenges relate to all elements of the ICT ecosystem, including infra- structure, devices, users, as well as content and applications.  In terms of infrastructure deployment, primary challenges are presented by  geography and topography of Vanuatu. First of all, distance to points-of-presence  of submarine-fibre-based international connectivity means that, even if (when)  Vanuatu is connected to international communications networks via a submarine  cable, costs of such connectivity might restrict the extent to which such  connections could translate into lower prices for end users. A study commissioned   10 The Pacific Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) reports that 72% of the general and 79% of the rural population have   never used or seen the Internet. PIPP (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and   internet in Vanuatu. 11 InterMedia (2013). Citizen Access to Information in Vanuatu.

Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and internet in Vanuatu.  18    Current Situation and Challenges  by the World Bank and conducted by Polyconseil suggested that international  connectivity could cost as much as US$1310 per Mbps per month14,15. This is  hundreds of times more expensive than IP Transit in developed markets—e.g., in  New York a comparable price is US$3.50 per Mbps per month, with pricing for  short-term promotions and high capacities below US$1.00 per Mbps16 (i.e., 374-1310  times cheaper). Assuming a 1:20 contention ratio, the wholesale IP Transit costs  would translate into US$65.5 per Mbps per month for retail users, or US$6,550 for  100 Mbps package per month (not including national infrastructure). The context  for this could be provided by the United Nations Broadband Commission’s  recommendation for the broadband price not to exceed 5% of average monthly  income17—in Vanuatu this would be US$1118. Thus the costs and resulting prices  are likely to remain a significant obstacle to an aggressive expansion of the  broadband Internet use, as affordability of such services remains an issue.  In addition to the international connectivity costs, topography and the current  level of supportive infrastructure make deployment, operation and maintenance  of national networks challenging and costly as well. First of all, 234,023 residents  of Vanuatu19 inhabit 60 islands (out of 83 in total). These islands are dispersed in a  rather large ocean territory (around 1300 km from north to south). Only 25% of the  total population live in the two urban centres. Furthermore, the road infrastructure  outside main areas of Efate and Espiritu Santo is not well developed. Grid power  is provided only in 4 islands, and even where it is available it is rather costly.  25.5% of all households and 32% of rural ones have no access to electricity20—this  makes powering ICT devices, including end-user equipment, rather challenging.   Furthermore, climatic conditions (including humidity) as well as prevalence of  small generators as a source of power makes for an unfavourable environment for  the use of laptops and other ICT devices.   Development and operation of ICT and supportive infrastructures are  made more challenging by the Vanuatu‘s vulnerability to tropical cyclones and   14 $1000 for the Vanuatu-Fiji segment, $250 for a backhaul from Fiji to Sydney and $60 for IP transit from Sydney.

World Bank. 15 Even if increased utilisation of the submarine cable could drive the costs lower, OGCIO’s assessments suggest   that it is unlikely for the wholesale costs to go below US$300-500 per Mbps per month (depending on scenarios).   This is without prejudice to a possible assessment of costs that could be conducted by the TRR as per its functions.   TRR has not contributed to the cost assessment referred to in this document. 16 Telegeography (2012). IP transit price declines steepen.

In 2012, a report  commissioned by the United Nations University ranked Vanuatu the most at risk  country in the World to natural disasters.21  In terms of user-related challenges, the primary challenge is a limited buying  power of residents, arising from high costs of ICTs coupled with low incomes.  This seriously impacts affordability of ICT services and products.   Further to the affordability-related concerns above, the extent of the challenge   is demonstrated by a fact that in 2012 the ITU ranked22 Vanuatu 143 out of 161  countries in terms of ICT prices. Moreover, as demonstrated in the figure below,  ICT prices in Vanuatu seem to be much higher than the average for countries with  similar incomes (measured as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita).  Gross Domestic Product per capita in Vanuatu (adjusted for the purchasing  power parity; current international US$) in 2010 was US$4449.7323. Furthermore,  Vanuatu has dramatic rural-urban income inequalities—over 80% of the population  depends on agriculture for their livelihood, yet the rural sector contributes only   21 Submission to the National ICT Policy from the National Disaster Management Office and Vanuatu Meteorology   and Geo-Hazards Department, 15 May 2013. 22 International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (2012).

Development of digital skills will likely be constrained by the lack of basic  literacy and skills. As per the World Bank data, 82% of adults in Vanuatu are   literate25. Local studies, however, present an even more pessimistic picture.   A recent survey suggested that the literacy rate in Shefa province was only 27.6%  of the population26. Data from the Ministry of Education indicates very high rates  of “critical underachievement” in basic literacy and numeracy—namely 59% in  Anglophone and 65% in Francophone literacy, and 66% in Anglophone and 61%  in Francophone numeracy27. A similarly bleak picture is presented by school  enrolment rates—gross secondary school enrolment currently stands at 54.69%28.

Development of e-Government is also constrained by a number of specific  challenges, including:  1 Operational challenges with current non-electronic processes; 2 Wide-ranging levels of readiness, including capacity and preparedness,   of various Ministries and Government Departments; 3 Financial constraints, in particular in relation to recurrent operational   expenditures; 4 Many competing priorities; 5 Difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified ICT staff.  Successful development of the ICT sector will have to take into account and, to  the extent possible, mitigate the challenges outlined above. However, many of  such challenges, constraining ICT development, especially in its early stages,  also strengthen a business case for it. Challenges of a similar nature are faced by  other solutions for public and private service delivery in Vanuatu (especially when  transport, postal or similar services are required). ICTs provide a more effective  and cost-efficient way to overcome them, including by enabling:  1 Savings in transport and postal services as information could be  transmitted using ICT networks;  2 Much easier distribution and storage of educational material29; 3 Opportunities to strengthen education and make it more engaging30; 4 More effective and cost-efficient public services; 5 Cost-efficient way to distribute content; 6 Better mitigation, preparation for, response to and recovery from   disasters and other emergencies31.  Therefore the successful development of the ICT sector will offer clear rewards to  the Government and the public of Vanuatu. It will enable kick-starting of a self-re- inforcing virtuous circle, which will ensure more effective and cost-efficient pro- vision of public and private services by increasing utilisation of ICT services  and tools, which will in turn open up further demand and free up funds for even  more products and services provided by the sector32. This will not only make the  ICT development much easier and more self-supporting, but will also enable the  Government to support the general socio-economic development in an increas- ingly sustainable, effective and cost-efficient manner.  29 As noted in a joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the Ministry of Education—  i.e., the Curriculum Development Unit, Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education, In-Service Training Unit,   Education Assessment Unit, and Joint EPublications and Security Course Committee, 16 May 2013. 30 A joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the Ministry of Education noted:   “Young people all over the world are taking to ICT in a way that has never been seen before inside education. The   technology appears to address many different learning styles and has an intrinsic fascination for most people,   especially the young.”, ibid. 31 Submission to the National ICT Policy from the National Disaster Management Office and Vanuatu Meteorology   and Geo-Hazards Department, 15 May 2013. 32 Source for this insight is in this OECD/UNESCO/ISOC Report: http://www.internetsociety.org/news/  clear-correlation-between-local-content-internet-development-and-access-prices   22  http://www.internetsociety.org/news/clear-correlation-between-local-content-internet-development-and-access-prices http://www.internetsociety.org/news/clear-correlation-between-local-content-internet-development-and-access-prices   Priorities  Priorities  Criteria for Selecting Priorities  The Government acknowledges that the successful development of mod- ern ICTs needs to involve all interconnected elements of the ICT eco- system, including infrastructure, content and applications, devices and  users. Many potentially useful policy interventions could be identified.   However, in light of limited financial and human resources, it is important to  choose priorities by identifying areas where policy interventions would:  1 Give impetus to the socio-economic development that would not  be achieved otherwise. The Government believes that it shall only  intervene, where and to the extent it adds a significant value. If  favourable outcomes are or can be achieved by the private sector,  communities, civil society, citizens or other stakeholders, without a need  of action from the Government, such development should be left to the  respective stakeholders.  2 Produce a significant impact in terms of both the matters addressed,  but also for the broader socio-economic development as sought by the  Priorities and Action Agenda (i.e., have strong positive externalities).  Attention should be first paid to matters that have a potential to kick-start  a virtuous circle of ICT development, which could later be taken over  and continued by activities of non-Government actors, or integrated into  standard day-to-day Government operations or sector-specific policies.  3 Have relatively lower complexity and reliance on inputs from multiple  stakeholders. Higher programme and project management complexity  decreases the probability of successfully realizing planned outcomes of  policy interventions—especially in light of rather limited programme  and project capacity, as well as wide-ranging levels of capacity and  preparedness of various stakeholders. This takes into consideration that  the cost of failure for such initiatives should be kept low and is tailored to  Vanuatu’s unique needs.  4 Rely, as much as possible, on the ready demand as well as existing  models of ICT development and readily available implementation  capacity. In a number of areas awareness of potential benefits of ICTs  in Vanuatu is very high. Furthermore, private sector players and other  stakeholders have already employed various models of extending  benefits of ICTs to various communities in Vanuatu (such as providing  schools with computers and Internet facilities, as well as setting up  Internet Cafes). Building on such awareness, existing models and  capacity significantly increases stakeholder buy-in (and reduces   23    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  change-management related challenges), ability to implement policy  interventions using local resources, and ultimate sustainability of results.  The most successful ICT-related policy intervention in Vanuatu to date—the lib- eralization of the telecommunications market—met all of the criteria above.  Therefore the Government intends to build on this positive experience when pur- suing further initiatives.  The Government will apply the criteria above not only when selecting specific  priorities, but also when choosing and designing strategies meant to implement  such priorities.  Specific Priorities Having regard to the above, The Government has identified the following priori- ties for this National ICT Policy33:  1 Access to ICTs in Education: Providing educational institutions with  access to ICT infrastructure and related services (especially, the Internet)  and equipment adequate to support the educational process, providing  students with access to ICT devices, as well as providing appropriate  ICT-based educational content.  2 Access to ICT Infrastructure and Devices: Enhancing general access to  as well as availability and affordability of the reliable ICT infrastructure  (including, wireless voice, voice-related services, and the Internet, but  also radio), related services and devices, with an emphasis on demand  side measures, enhancing overall resiliency of the national infrastructure,  and lowering costs of services and devices as they are delivered to  end-users.  3 E-Government: Enhancing effective and cost-efficient use of ICTs  (including wireless communications) in Government operations, in  particular in terms of internal administration; and promoting ICT- enabled interaction between the Government and other stakeholders,  including citizens34.   4 Integration of ICTs into Sectoral Policies: Recognising an enabling  and transforming potential of ICTs for every sector and policy area,  in particular such key areas as education, health, productive sectors,  transport (especially maritime), trade and attraction of foreign  investment, gender equality, social equity, democratic participation,  preservation and promotion of local culture (including arts), protection  of environment35 as well as disaster management; and achieving a strong  direction towards realising such potential through the development and  subsequent implementation of appropriate sectoral policies.  5 Building Trust (Mitigating Risks and Threats related to the ICT  Development): Recognizing that alongside numerous benefits, ICTs also  bring various dangers, including an exposure to harmful information;   33 See Annex A for an explanation on how these Priorities meet the respective selection criteria.  34 Developing tools for enhanced subject-specific interactions will, however, generally be addressed under Priority 4. 35 Potential of a negative impact of ICT tools on the environment (e.g., in terms of electronic waste, energy   consumption) needs to be recognized as well, and appropriately mitigated.  24    Priorities  new avenues for criminal, including fraudulent, activities; new threats for  protection of confidential information and important infrastructure; as  well as new risks of disruption of social and economic life; and ensuring  that those dangers are properly addressed and managed, in particular  through appropriate preparedness, education and awareness building.  Individual privacy should be maintained throughout.  6 Locally Relevant Content: Increasing availability of locally relevant  sustainably supported content, especially by making global content  accessible in local languages.  7 Capacity Building: Enhancing skills necessary to utilize and develop  ICTs, especially in the public service.  8 Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Coordination and  Collaboration: Recognizing that any pre-established policy cannot  foresee every initiative that could benefit the development of the ICT  sector, neither any one central agency can envisage and direct all of  them; and therefore setting up a platform for expertise, knowledge and  skills to be shared among various stakeholders and sectors, duplications  to be eliminated and potential synergies exploited, thereby enabling a  substantially self-organizing (although enabled and coordinated) ICT  development process.  Annex B sets out anticipated results (in terms of outcomes and impacts) that the  Government expects to achieve by addressing the Priorities above.  General Considerations The Government acknowledges that the Priorities above do not include immedi- ate and ambitious agenda in certain important areas, including health and produc- tive sectors as well as disaster management. The Government considers, however,  that the effective utilisation of ICTs in such areas requires strengthening of the  preparedness of respective institutions first, and applying an appropriate process  of strategic planning. This is needed to ensure that the promotion of ICTs does  not become a standalone isolated activity, but that it meaningfully contributes to  the operation and development of the respective sectors. This will be achieved by  implementing strategies under Priorities 4 and 7.   Importantly, implementation of strategies under the Priorities above, in  particular Priorities 1, 2, 3 and 5, will prepare the ground and provide a platform  for initiatives in other areas. Implementation of Priority 8 will facilitate utilisation  of ICTs across all areas important for socio-economic development, by enabling  cross-pollination of experiences and more effective cross-utilization of resources  and platforms.  25    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  Approaches and Principles  In  working towards Priorities of this Policy, the Government intends to apply  a set of approaches and principles, set out below. These approaches and prin- ciples should enhance success of achieving individual Priorities as well as the  overall objective, in particular by: (a) facilitating synergies among different   strategies to achieve Priorities set out in this document as well as other national  developmental objectives; (b) building on previous achievements; and (c) employ- ing most affordable, efficient and effective solutions (rather than “coolest” or most  marketed).  Multi-Stakeholder and Multi-Sector Collaboration The Government recognizes that it is not possible to achieve the overall objec- tive and Priorities of this Policy through Government actions alone. Therefore  the Government accepts an approach of multi-stakeholder collaboration as en- dorsed by outcomes of the World Summit of the Information Society, in partic- ular the Geneva Plan of Action of 2003, as well as Resolution 67/195 of 2012 of  the United Nations General Assembly and the FAIDP. The Government acknowl- edges of key stakeholders such as ICANN, IANA, APNIC, ISOC, PICISOC, W3C,  IETF and other regional and global partners in internet governance and standards  definition.  The framework of multi-stakeholder collaboration, in particular as enshrined  in Paragraph 3 of the Geneva Plan of Action36 and the FAIDP, provides for specific  roles for various stakeholders, namely:  1 “Governments have a leading role in developing and implementing  comprehensive, forward-looking and sustainable national e-strategies.  The private sector and civil society, in dialogue with governments, have  an important consultative role to play in devising national e-strategies.”  2 “The commitment of the private sector is important in developing and  diffusing information and communication technologies (ICTs), for  infrastructure, content and applications. The private sector is not only a  market player, but also plays a role in a wider sustainable development  context.”  3 “The commitment and involvement of civil society is equally important  in creating an equitable Information Society, and in implementing ICT- related initiatives for development.” As per the FAIDP, the civil society  has an important role in working with communities.  36 Quotes below are from the Geneva Plan of Action.  26    Approaches and Principles  4 The FAIDP also recognizes a role for communities to own and drive  initiatives.  5 “International and regional institutions, including international  financial institutions, have a key role in integrating the use of ICTs in  the development process and making available necessary resources for  building the Information Society and for the evaluation of the progress  made.”  In addition to the specific stakeholders mentioned above, the Government notes  the significance of such stakeholders as development partners, academia and us- ers. The Government further recognises the importance of such locally relevant  stakeholders as churches and custom chiefs, which work closely with the civil so- ciety and communities on the socio-economic development, in particular in rela- tion to social and cultural aspects of such development.  Ultimately and importantly, success of any developmental effort relies on the  input of every citizen and resident of Vanuatu. The Government will therefore  make efforts to engage the public-at-large in the policy development and  implementation process, and, on the other hand, will expect an active participation  of every citizen and resident in this undertaking.  Furthermore, the Government recognizes that ICTs both enable development  of other sectors, and are dependent (especially in relation to the energy sector)  on them. The ICT development needs to recognize such interlinkages. Pacific  ICT Ministers in their Tonga meeting of 2009 also acknowledged “the need  for a strategic approach to the development and use of these technologies that  recognizes the important role of the private sector and the value of building  synergies with developments in other sectors, including health, education and  energy”. Therefore the Government endorses a multi-sector approach in the  development of ICTs.  The multi-stakeholder (and multi-sector) approach has been instrumental in  the development of the Vanuatu’s ICT sector so far. The Government reaffirms its  commitment to such an approach. It fully accepts “the concept of ‘many partners,  one team’ in progressing a more coordinated and coherent approach to ICT  development”, as endorsed by the Pacific ICT Ministers’ Tonga Declaration of  2010.   The Government believes that an effective implementation of its role in  this framework of a multi-stakeholder cooperation requires the Government to  generally follow best-practice procedural principles, including: (a) transparency;  (b) stakeholder involvement; (c) clear procedures; (d) planning; and (e)  accountability. Therefore it will, wherever feasible, conduct public consultations  and actively seek input from relevant stakeholders. It will also aim to base its  activities on, preferably, rolling multi-annual, work plans; measure them against   Ultimately and importantly, success of any developmen- tal effort relies on the input of every citizen and resident  of Vanuatu. The Government will therefore make efforts to  engage the public-at-large.”  27    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  pre-established key performance indicators; and produce annual reports. It will  also seek to formalize its procedures, including procedures for interaction with  stakeholders. Where appropriate, the Government will also consider special  arrangements enabling and encouraging effective participation of all stakeholders,  including stakeholder groups that face specific barriers to such participation37.  The approach, described in this section, should be applied both in  implementing strategies under Priorities 1-7, as well as in identifying, defining,  developing and implementing new initiatives under Priority 8. Importantly, such  an approach should be employed not only when implementing initiatives falling  directly under this National Policy, but also when developing and, subsequently,  implementing sectoral ICT policies under Priority 4. This should be done by, in  particular: (a) involving relevant stakeholders; (b) recognising synergies with  other sectors, and purposefully seeking for opportunities beyond traditional  remits of respective organizations through exploiting potential for positive  externalities outside narrowly defined sectors; (c) employing coordination  mechanisms set out in and established for the implementation of this Policy; and  (d) following best-practice procedural principles.  Pragmatic Approach The Government believes in the importance of an ambitious, but pragmatic ap- proach in achieving the overarching objective of this Policy. In following this ap- proach, the Government intends (and will encourage other stakeholders) to:  1 Make use of most appropriate, affordable, efficient and effective  technologies, business and operational models and services, having  due regard to technologies, models and services that:  a are already prevalent and could be further utilised; b are offered or are included in plans of service providers; c could be rolled-out relatively easily using existing infrastructure   and having due regard to local circumstances.  In this context, the Government specifically notes the widespread  availability38 of 2.5G mobile communications services in Vanuatu, as well  as nearly universal39 use of such services, especially basic mobile voice  and SMS. The Government also acknowledges that service providers  have commenced deployment of 3.5G mobile communications services.  Availability (especially of 3.5G services) and, in particular, quality of such  services still needs to be enhanced and improved, and the Government  intends to encourage this. The Government will also encourage further  upgrade of such infrastructure.  Nevertheless, the Government intends to encourage utilisation  of infrastructure and services deployed, in particular by recognizing   37 e.g. people with disabilities. 38 Reportedly such services cover more than 90% of population. 39 Pacific Institute of Public Policy (PIPP) in its study Net Effects: Social and Economic Impacts of   Telecommunications and Internet in Vanuatu (2011) reports that 99.4% of households use mobile phones, 95.5% of   households own one (making a mobile phone the most common electrical appliance in Vanuatu homes), and 4 out   5 persons surveyed have their own mobile phone.  28    Approaches and Principles  the potential of and promoting mobile applications, including  M-Government, in achieving Priorities of this Policy.  The Government recognises that in many cases achievement of  Priorities under this Policy entails expanded access to specific services— namely the relatively high-speed Internet. Furthermore, as demonstrated  above, access to the broadband Internet generally delivers much greater  economic impact than access to other telecommunications services.  Therefore the Government will not shy away from promoting expanded  access to the high-speed Internet as an important tool in achieving the  overall objective of this Policy and especially Priorities 1 and 2. Specific  characteristics of such high-speed Internet will generally be determined  in the context of specific priorities, strategies and/or projects, having  regard to the local needs, requirements associated with specific uses of  such Internet and pragmatically attainable levels of service at specific  locations.   Nevertheless, taking into account market developments, including  those referred to above, the Government considers that high-speed  Internet services should be universally available at speeds attributable  to at least 3.5G mobile communications technologies, having regard  to: (a) that 2.5G mobile communications technologies may be used in  the interim, while infrastructure capable of delivering higher speeds is  deployed; and (b) potential of shared use of services as described below.  The Government will, however, expect for certain areas to benefit  from higher speed broadband Internet, including based on optical fibre,  in particular in urban centres, especially in Port Vila and Luganville,  where government offices and businesses that rely or would greatly  benefit from such services are concentrated.   In any case, the Government notes that the ICT sector is  characterised by very rapid innovation and improvements. Therefore it  expects that speeds and quality of telecommunications services will be  constantly upgraded to reflect capabilities of current technologies as well  as changing needs of users.  The Government also recognises that services at the access network  level need to be supported by appropriate backhaul networks as well as  international connectivity. Therefore, whenever promoting infrastructure  development, the Government will take an end-to-end network approach.  In this regard it will aim to identify bottlenecks or obstacles to the  development of such infrastructure. Where appropriate, regulatory or  policy interventions will be designed and implemented to address such  bottlenecks and obstacles. Specifically the Government acknowledges its  role in facilitating appropriate solutions for reliable cost-efficient high- capacity and high-quality international connectivity, as well as solutions  reducing reliance on such connectivity (such as a well-developed internet  exchange point).  Importantly, references to specific technologies in this Policy  should only be considered as a manner to refer to specific functionality  of services. The Government will by no means limit implementation  of this Policy to specific technologies and, to the extent feasible, will  not prescribe any specific technologies in its instruments. It will also   29    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  encourage all parties to take a technologically neutral approach. The  Government generally prefers decisions on specific technologies and  solutions to be taken by users and providers of such solutions, unless a  choice of specific technologies is justified by public interest imperatives,  such as significant reductions in costs resulting from harmonized  approaches to the provision or procurement of services or other solutions.  The Government also recognises the continuing importance of ‘old’  ICTs, in particular traditional terrestrial radio40, for achieving the overall  objective of this Policy. Television could potentially also serve important  needs of residents. However, costs and benefits of expanding television  services would need to be further evaluated, especially in light of  convergence of technologies, networks and services leading to a potential  to provide television-like services over Internet-type networks.  The Government also acknowledges that models of shared and  common use of ICT services, such as Public Internet Access Points  (including Internet Cafes) and, more traditionally, communal use of radio  and television41, have found their acceptance in Vanuatu.   While ensuring that it remains vendor-neutral, the Government  will generally promote use of devices that are suitable for specific  conditions of use, in particular when respective ICT solutions are  implemented in outer islands42. However, regard should always be had to  the considerations outlined in point 2 below. In this context, for example,  durability of devices should be weighed against easiness and affordability  of replacement as well as initial acquisition barriers.  The Government will also take a pragmatic approach when selecting  software platforms, tools and solutions to use. It will make decisions on  whether to use Free and Open Source Software or commercial products  on a case-by-case basis, having regard to total costs of ownership,  capabilities of available human resources and other relevant factors.   2 Have reasonable expectations for the appropriate level of access to  ICTs and their reliability, quality and sophistication provided and  utilised in the context of specific solutions.  The ultimate goal of this Policy, in particular as sought via Priority  2, is to provide residents with individualised access to ICTs, which they  could use to maximise their personal utility. However, the Government  acknowledges that this may not be immediately feasible. Therefore it con- siders shared access to ICTs, including via use of ICTs in shared (com- mon) facilities or sharing access to telecommunications services via  wireless or other similar networks covering specific localities, to be an   40 As demonstrated by the findings of InterMedia (2013).

As  referred to above, such a manner of using similar services is rather preva- lent and accepted in Vanuatu.  The Government also accepts that an incremental reliability of ICT  services (including the reliability of power supply) as well as their incre- mental accessibility (e.g., specific hours of operation) comes at an incre- mental cost. This may be particularly significant in places where support- ive infrastructure (including transport and energy infrastructure) is weak  or non-existent. Such considerations similarly apply to quality, including  reliability, and comprehensiveness of solutions addressing various Prior- ities of this Policy.   The Government will have regard to realistic requirements for solu- tions that would be appropriate to local circumstances, locally relevant  levels of utility and expectations; and will encourage other parties to do  the same. Maximum flexibility should be afforded to implementers of pro- jects to decide on operational arrangements.  Moreover, when deciding on a required level of comprehensiveness  and sophistication of specific solutions, the benefits of such solutions  shall be assessed realistically. Such assessment should not be based on  an optimistic evaluation of the maximum utility that could possibly be  derived from respective solutions, but on a reasonably expected level of  a long-term utility, having regard to available capabilities to make use of  such solutions, as well as the capacity to support and maintain such solu- tions over time.   3 Adopt and encourage an add-on approach to developing ICT  infrastructure and related facilities.   The Government recognises the importance of supportive infra- structures and facilities, especially energy infrastructure and appropri- ate premises for shared (common) use of ICTs, for the development of  ICT infrastructure and related facilities and extending access to ICTs. As  much as possible, ICT infrastructure should not be developed on a stan- dalone basis, but, to maximise cost-efficiencies, as an add-on to the exist- ing infrastructure or facilities and/or as follow-on projects to the develop- ment of such supportive infrastructure. In exceptional situations, where  it is necessary to establish such supportive infrastructure to enable pro- vision of ICTs, due regard should be given to an ability to re-use such  infrastructure to support general needs of respective communities or or- ganisations, even if such re-use could marginally increase costs of such  facilities.  In the context above, the Government will seek to coordinate ICT de- velopment initiatives with other developmental initiatives, such as the de- velopment of rural electricity. Furthermore, shared (common) access to  ICTs could be best provided at premises that are already widely recog- nized as neutral community facilities (such as schools) and/or commonly  frequented by the public (such as shops, postal offices or bank branches).  General supportive infrastructure (including electricity) available at such  facilities would normally also support provision of ICTs.  31    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  4 Adopt a “push—don’t jump” approach in expanding availability of,  access to and utilisation of ICTs.   The Government recognises that expanding availability of, access to  and utilisation of technologies in the developmental context should fol- low the same laws that apply to diffusion of technologies in general, and  network-type technologies, including ICTs, in particular. An appropriate  policy should not attempt to overcome such laws, but employ them to en- hance effectiveness and sustainability of policy interventions.  The above includes such mutually reinforcing laws as: (a) Metcalfe’s  law, which characterises network effects; and (b) the technology adoption   curve.  Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network (whether physical,   virtual or logical) is proportional to the square of users (or devices) con- nected to such a system. This is derived from the pattern of growth in po- tential links (bilateral connections and communication opportunities) as  a number of users (or devices) increases. Metcalfe’s law, as represented in  the graph below, explains why every new user will find, in an accelerating  manner, it incrementally more valuable to use specific ICT services or ap- plications, and how new additions increase the value  to existing users.   The Technology Adoption Curve, as represented below, demon- strates how diffusion of a technology starts with a small number of in- novators, who are followed by a larger number of early adopters, subse- quently followed by a majority of users, until finally it is adopted by late  comers. Naturally, encouraging adoption of a technology by innovators  and early adopters is relatively easy and cheap, whereas adoption by late  comers is dependent on them being able to derive a significant value  from such a technology.   When put together, Metcalfe’s Law and the Technology Adoption  Curve mean that the most reasonable way to encourage adoption of a   Figure 4. Metcalfe’s Law  Va lu  e  of   a  N  et w  or k  Number of Users  32    Approaches and Principles  network-based technology in a sustainable and, potentially, self-reinforc- ing manner is to follow the logic of the Technology Adoption Curve. That  way a relatively easy enticement of earlier adopters will increase the value  of such a technology to later comers and will, in turn, make it easier to at- tract the latter and sustain their interest in the technology. At the same  time, working against such laws hinders the reinforcing sustainable de- velopment and kick-starting of a virtuous circle of network-effects-based  development, in which an increasing user base attracts new users, and  new users make it more attractive for existing ones to stay connected. A  simplified representation of those opposite approaches is shown in the  graph on the next page43.  If ICTs, contrary to the preferred approach described above, were to  be first provided to the most remote and most challenging areas to the  people who need most support in using such tools and services, with- out such ICTs being available in less challenging areas, the beneficiar-  ies of such initiatives would not derive much value from them. Such ben- eficiaries would not have anyone to communicate to using such tools and  services, and not much content and applications to make such ICTs use- ful. Furthermore, in such a scenario there would be no indigenous sup- port system that would ensure sustenance of implemented solutions and  maintenance of infrastructure, facilities and devices. Isolated projects in  very remote areas have small chances of success, and/or require very sub- stantial recurrent resources leading to high costs for relatively moderate  benefits.   43 See the gap between the value and costs/effort for each of the two approaches.   The Government considers that its’ primary role should  be to provide a direction to, enable, facilitate, and encour- age development of the ICT sector, including via setting  appropriate policies.”  Figure 5. Technology Adoption Curve  Late Majority  34%  Laggards  16%  Early  Adopters   13.5% Early Majority   34%  Innovators  2.5%   33    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  A “pushing from the centre” approach naturally entices new users at  the “edges” with relatively smaller efforts and costs, as well as provides  a more sustainable support to such “edges”. Therefore, although alterna- tive approaches may appear socially and politically more appealing, their  overall benefit to the society (and, ultimately, even to disadvantaged ar- eas) is likely to be much more limited than an “expanding-from-the-cen- tre” approach.   The “push—don’t jump” approach, together with the below-described  reliance on the private sector, means that the Government will aim to  constantly push boundaries of a reachable market that the private sector  could address by itself. The Government will then seek to enable the pri- vate sector to take over and serve the expanded market to an as sustaina- ble extent as possible, leaving the Government to push such boundaries  even further—as represented in the graph below.

In the Priorities and Action Agenda the Government  also expressed its belief “that the role of Government is to promote inclusive eco- nomic growth, and that the private sector should be the engine of this growth”.  The Government also notes the positive experience in Vanuatu where  the private sector, unleashed by the liberalisation of the telecommunications  market, tremendously expanded access to mobile communications. Furthermore,  the vibrant local information technology sector has also contributed to the  development of ICTs in Vanuatu.  The Government therefore considers that its’ primary role should be to  provide a direction to, enable, facilitate, and encourage development of the ICT  sector, including via setting appropriate policies, establishing an appropriate legal  framework, providing effective regulation, and, where appropriate, implementing  initiatives that would expand and enhance the sector. Its interventions should  be limited to cases (and extent), where the Government’s actions would add a  significant value in terms of the socio-economic development that would not  happen otherwise. Generally, however, the deployment of infrastructure as well  as the provision of services, content, applications and solutions should be left to  the private sector.  The Government believes that the private sector should be  unleashed to play such a role in the most effective manner.  The Government considers that generally profit and private value motives  provide an appropriate basis for sustainable solutions contributing to the  achievement of the overall objective of this Policy. It, however, expects the private  sector to take a long-term approach to value (including shared value44) creation,  rather than short-term profit maximisation, and to demonstrably and proactively  seek to satisfy current and future ICT needs of businesses, residents and the  public sector, in particular in relation to the overall objective and Priorities of  this Policy. Without prejudice to the importance of sustainable competition, the  Government also expects private sector players to collaborate among themselves  in ensuring that ICT sector development needs are met in the most-cost efficient  manner.   The Government recognises that the transparency and predictability of  the business environment is important for the private sector to be able to take  a long-term shared-value-creating approach. This Policy provides a degree  of this. The Government is committed to further improve such transparency  and predictability, including in such areas as tax and customs policies. The  Government is also committed to provide a non-discriminatory environment,  without undue favouritism, that would enable private sector players that serve   44 Porter and Kramer (2011) describe creating shared value as  creating economic value in a way that also creates   value for society by addressing its needs and challenges. They further explain that “[t]he concept of shared value   can be defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simul-  taneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value   creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress.” Porter,   M. E. and Kramer, M. R. (2011). ‘Creating Shared Value’. Harvard Business Review. January 2011. Accessible at:   http://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value.   35  http://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value   National Information and Communication Technology Policy  needs of the community best to succeed. When creating an enabling environment attractive to private investments,   the Government will pay significant attention to the sustainability of such  environment. The Government considers that such sustainability requires for  private investments to deliver demonstrably tangible value to the national  socio-economic development. Therefore its policies aimed at attracting  such investments and investor-targeting will consider both: (a) comparative  attractiveness of Vanuatu; and (b) public value of such investments (in terms of  jobs, public sector revenues and other factors).  The Government will also promote and, where appropriate, ensure that  publicly or centrally controlled resources (such as radio spectrum, numbering,  IP addresses, and national “.vu” domain names), necessary to support provision  of infrastructure and services, contributing to the socio-economic development,  are readily available and accessible in a transparent, fair, non-discriminatory and  efficient manner as per swift procedures, based on objective and proportionate  criteria, conditions and procedures, and are utilised in an efficient manner for the  benefit of Vanuatu users, citizens and residents. A level of public control exercised  over such resources should be minimum necessary to achieve the overall objective  of this Policy.  Having regard to the above, the Government’s preference is for a Universal  Access Policy (UAP) that would, where feasible, be implemented not by  redistributing levies, collected from market players (“pay” approach), but by  service providers directly undertaking and implementing commitments to  expand the reach of telecommunications services beyond profitable areas (“play”  approach).  In the context above, the Government generally considers that it is prudent  to restrict provision of retail services of Government-owned or operated  telecommunications networks (specifically the Government Broadband Network  (GBN)) for the Government use only.  To the extent permitted by its international commitments, the Government  will put a special emphasis on the development of the local ICT-related private  sector and its participation in the implementation of this Policy. A sustainably  vibrant local ICT sector is essential in significantly enhancing the sustainability  of ICT sector development efforts. It ensures that resources and skills, needed to  maintain and further develop ICT solutions, are readily available in a cost-efficient  manner. Furthermore, development of such sector provides positive broader  socio-economic externalities, including higher-skilled and higher-paid local jobs,  greater economic multiplier effect of funds spent for ICT solutions, and fostering  emergence and development of business activities needed to support the local  ICT sector45.  Therefore, when undertaking any actions related to this Policy or the ICT  sector in general, the Government will seek for a deliberate externality—to foster  the local ICT industry. Importantly, however, the Government considers that any   45 Porter and Kramer (2011) note (specifically referring to firms that actively engage in shaping local business   environment, especially by participating in developing local clusters) that “[w]hen a firm builds clusters in its key   locations, it also amplifies the connection between its success and its communities’ success. A firm’s growth has   multiplier effects, as jobs are created in supporting industries, new companies are seeded, and demand for ancil-  lary services rises.” Ibid.   36    Approaches and Principles  protectionist measures or special treatment of any specific companies would  be counterproductive to achieving such objective and, in a longer term, would  actually weaken the local sector by lowering standards and breeding complacency.  Supportive measures would generally include (but may not necessarily be limited  to):  1 Having due regard to an ability of the local industry to serve expanding  local demand, including the demand created or expanded by policy  interventions, in a sustainable manner. In this context, the Government  will aim to avoid inducing sudden increases in demand for ICT products  and services, especially when it is likely for such increases to be followed  by abrupt contractions of such demand. The Government favours a  gradual and sustainable ramp-up of the private sector capacity. Where  appropriate, the Government will aim to time policy interventions in a  counter-cyclical manner;  2 Encouraging foreign suppliers and investors to collaborate with the  local private sector, as well as to contribute to upgrading of the local  business environment;  3 Encouraging and, where appropriate, facilitating upgrading of the  local ICT-related private sector, including by supporting establishment  and subsequent development of a local ICT industry association (or  a respective group within the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and  Industry) as well as stronger collaboration between the industry, the  academia, other entities contributing to capacity development and other  stakeholders.  Notwithstanding the above, the Government will not shy away from taking a more  proactive role in developing the ICT sector (including, where necessary, by de- ploying or investing into telecommunications networks and/or redistributing   UAP-type levies) to meet the ultimate objective of this Policy, if the private sec- tor will not prove capable to play the role envisaged in this Policy with a suffi- cient certainty. Where necessary, the Government will take appropriate actions to  ensure that the national socio-economic development is not constrained by inad- equate inputs from the private sector. However, even in such circumstances the  Government will aim to limit its interventions to addressing the needs not met by  the private sector only, and, where possible, will have an exit strategy allowing the  market to take over, when its ability to do so is demonstrated.  Sustainable Best Practice ICT Sector Governance The Government recognises that effective ICT sector development in general,  and effective private sector participation in the socio-economic development in   It is important that such guidance and influence are sub- ject to limits that ensure that the regulator is not subjected  to day-to-day political decision making, but only to appro- priately developed and promulgated transparent policies.”  37    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  particular are reliant on effective regulation and policy making. In this regard, it  reaffirms its commitment to securing independence, impartiality as well as suffi- cient human and financial capacity of respective regulatory authorities, in partic- ular the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR) or any  successor to it, which should operate in a stable and predictable regulatory envi- ronment in an efficient, effective, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.   International commitments, specifically Section 5 of the Reference Paper  included in the Vanuatu commitments undertaken in the context of acceding  to the World Trade Organization, requires any regulatory body to be “separate  from […] any supplier of basic telecommunications services. The decisions of  and the procedures used by regulators shall be impartial with respect to all  market participants.” Further to this, the international best practice, which the  Government accepts, requires independence and impartiality of regulatory  entities in relation to market players, consumers, but also with regard to political  influence46.   Independence does not mean a disregard of interests of the above-mentioned  groups. On the contrary, their interests are important and should be taken  into account in the regulatory process. Therefore an appropriate definition of  independence is “keeping equal distance from all involved parties”47.   In terms of independence from political influence, in particular, it is important  to recognize that no regulator can be absolutely independent. It will always  be constrained by laws, political realities, public sentiments, budgets, license  provisions, etc.48 Absolute independence is neither possible, nor desirable.  The international regulatory theory and practice also recognize that there is no  requirement for a regulator to be independent from the Government’s long- term policy or its powers to formulate such policy—it is solely required to be  independent from day-to-day undue interference49. Furthermore, appropriate  controls are necessary to ensure that a regulator is acting in the public interest.   Therefore it is important to achieve an appropriate degree of independence  that would guarantee necessary freedom for a regulator to act for the long-term  benefit of the society and implement long-term policy, without being distracted  by short-term interests, while at the same time recognising the reality (and, to  some extent, desirability) of various practical influences on the activities of the  regulator50.  In the context above, it is clear that the regulatory independence does not  restrict the Government and the Minister responsible for a specific policy area,   46 Smith, W.

On the  contrary, this may be important to ensure that the regulator acts as an integral  part of the system of good governance, promoting socio-economic interests  of the country. However, it is important that such guidance and influence are  subject to limits that ensure that the regulator is not subjected to day-to-day  political decision making, but only to appropriately developed and promulgated  transparent policies, defining long-term objectives of the Government.   The Government considers that independent, sufficient, sustainable and  predictable financing of a regulatory authority is an important condition of its  independence and its ability to effectively exercise its functions. In this regard,  the Government continues to support the system, under which the regulator  is funded through fees collected from market players. However, it is important  for such a system to also include regulator’s accountability for its use of funds  collected, as well as results of regulatory activities. Furthermore, the Government  believes that long-term sustainability of such a system can only be achieved, if  costs of administering the regulatory framework, particularly recurrent costs, are  kept within the means of the sector. Therefore the Government will encourage  the regulator to gradually ensure that its recurrent costs are fully funded from  reasonable fees collected locally, and reliance on external funding is gradually  eliminated. One-off costs, related to investments that would significantly enhance  the functioning of the regulatory framework and that would not be possible to  make without an external support, are not covered by this approach.  The Government also believes that independent, efficient and swift judicial  review of regulatory decisions, as the only avenue for formal review of such  decisions, is an essential part of a well-functioning regulatory framework and will,  in collaboration with the judicial system, work to support this.  Further to the above, the Government will continue to support such best- practice requirements for regulatory independence as transparent, impartial and  merits-based selection of a head of the regulator; and a fixed-term in office for such  a head, allowing early removal only on clear statutory predefined grounds and  authority. Transparency and clear accountability of the regulatory authority for its  work is another side of regulatory independence. However, the regulator should  be primarily accountable for results, measured as per pre-defined performance  criteria, rather than for day-to-day actions.   In addition to external safeguards, including those set out above, the  Government also acknowledges importance of internal safeguards of regulatory  independence and impartiality, preventing regulatory capture and conflicts of  interests of the regulatory staff.  In the context above, the Government continues to be committed to the   A policy-making body will continue to play a leading role  in areas that are closely linked to the general social policy  of the country and may require politically-driven trade-offs  between economic efficiencies and social objectives.”  39    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  best practice institutional setup for the ICT sector governance, in which the  role of a policy maker is to set public and transparent policy and monitor its  implementation, and the role for a regulator is to implement such policy within  the confines of its remit and the legal framework, and at an arm’s-length from day- to-day political decision making. The regulator, however, should be sufficiently  accountable for its work and outcomes of such work. It is also important for the  remit and responsibilities of each party to be clearly defined. Within such remit  and responsibilities each party should have sufficient freedom to exercise its  functions.   A policy-making body will continue to play a leading role in areas that  are closely linked to the general social policy of the country and may require  politically-driven trade-offs between economic efficiencies and social objectives  (including in such areas as universal access and universal services). On the other  hand, areas, where economic and technical considerations play a primary role  (as contrary to the political balancing of social and economic objectives), will  normally be left to the regulator to address with a considerable discretion.   The Government believes that it is important for the interaction between a  policy maker and the regulator to comply with the following principles51:  1 In exercising its policy-making powers, a policy maker shall be bound by  the respective legislation. Policy should be consistent with the purpose  and objective of the law (including the legislative intent).  2 Direction from a policy maker to the regulator must be one that is  possible for the regulator to follow in carrying out its duties under the  legislation and it should not prohibit the regulator from carrying out her/ his duties.  3 Policy is generally defined as “a course or principle of action”52. Policy  should leave sufficient level of discretion to the regulator to implement  its functions within the legislative and policy framework. Specific  regulatory decisions should always be made on their merits.  4 In developing a policy the policy maker will follow procedural  requirements set out by the law.  As the ICT sector is constantly changing, new needs for Government (in a broad  sense) action may arise from time to time. Such new areas and responsibilities  should be eventually reflected in the primary legislation. No coercive actions  could be taken without appropriate powers being granted by such legislation.  However, a naturally slow pace of the legislative process may not always be able  to keep up with changing needs; and some useful actions could still be exercised  without formal powers—especially, activities related to awareness and education.  In addressing such areas, a policy maker and the regulator would comply with  their general respective roles as outlined above. Generally a policy maker will take  the lead responsibility for matters requiring a legislative or policy action, or where   51 These principles are primarily based on the foreign case law—specifically the Judgment of the UK Privy Council   of 21 January 2010 in case No 0079 of 2009 in Mossell (Jamaica) Limited (T/A Digicel) v Office of Utilities   Regulation, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited and Centennial Jamaica Limited; and the Judgment in the High   Court of Justice of the British Virgin Islands BVIHCV2007/0095 of 18 and 25 May 2007 in Digicel Limited v the   Telecommunications Regulatory Commission. 52 The Concise Oxford Dictionary 9th Edn.  40    Approaches and Principles  coordination with international or foreign partners or other public stakeholders is  needed. The regulator will primarily be responsible for matters closely related to  its existing areas of responsibility, where addressing such matters needs substan- tial economic, technical and/or legal expertise in the ICT area, especially where  the long-termism and sustainability of activities are important.   While the respective roles of different bodies must and will be respected,  and due care will be exercised not to undermine independence and impartiality  of the regulator, the Government will seek to ensure that overall consistency and  effectiveness of the Government (in a broad sense) actions are achieved.  Importantly, the requirements set out above should apply not merely to the  regulation of telecommunications, but with respect to any regulation of private  sector activity (including radio and television broadcasting, electronic signatures  etc.). In order to achieve this as well as to ensure maximum cost-efficiency and  effective utilisation of regulatory expertise, the Government, in accordance with  the multi-sector collaboration approach, intends to review the current regulatory  structure for ICT and related sectors, including utility regulation, general  competition protection and consumer protection.  The Government considers that requirements of impartiality with respect to  market players and other stakeholders, applicable to regulatory bodies, should also  apply to bodies involved in the policy making, especially the Minister responsible  for ICT and Telecommunications and the Office of the Chief Government  Information Officer (OGCIO). In this regard, such bodies will generally restrain  from pursuing any activities that could potentially compete with private players  in the ICT sector. This concerns ownership (including shareholding and board  membership) functions in relation to telecommunications service providers and  other ICT market players, as well as direct implementation of such projects (e.g.,  development of competing telecommunications networks). Where such functions  are exercised by the Government, it will aim to do so at a sufficient “arm’s length”   from the sector policy making bodies, or, at least, to design and implement  appropriate safeguards to ensure that potential conflicts of interest would be  avoided in practice and that stakeholders would be sufficiently assured of this. The  main such safeguard is transparency—i.e., providing stakeholders with as much  information as possible on the rationale of specific decisions. Administrative  arrangements (e.g., involving appropriate third parties in decision making;  conducting public consultations before decisions are made) are also useful.  The Government considers that efficient and effective policy making requires  that a policy maker is sufficiently resourced and has appropriate expertise  available to it. It will therefore appropriately strengthen the OGCIO as well as  ICT-policy-related administrative capabilities in other Ministries and Government  Departments.  Noteworthy, procurement of telecommunications and other ICT services and   The Government appreciates that the size of Vanuatu to- gether with rather challenging market conditions… make it  important to explore and implement ways to reduce costs  of services by enhancing economies of scale.”  41    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  products for the Government could also raise a potential for conflict of interests.  It is therefore important that in exercising such functions the Government does  not leverage its policy maker role to obtain, as a buyer, a special treatment from  telecommunications service providers and other vendors.   Fair and Effective Competition and  Enhancement of Economies of Scale The Government remains committed to safeguarding sustainable, fair and effec- tive competition as the market structure that ensures that market players satisfy  needs of the local community to the maximum possible extent. Tremendous ex- pansion of mobile communications in Vanuatu is a demonstration of the appro- priateness of this approach.  In general, the Government believes that its any intervention should be  structured in a way that would, to the maximum possible extent, avoid favouring  specific market players, support competitive market forces and avoid a risk of  undermining them. In this context, the Government will normally prefer demand- side interventions (i.e., supporting users) to supply-side interventions (i.e.,  supporting providers). The Government believes that generally such an approach  would enhance competition, as private sector players would compete to satisfy the  extra demand. It would also increase cost-efficiency of Government interventions,  as they could be better directed to meet needs of specific social or other target  groups (such as low income residents).   However, there might be situations, where, because of the nature and extent  of specific market challenges, demand-side interventions might not provide a  sufficient “pull” for the needed supply. This may, for example, happen if the end- user-generated demand is too distant from such market challenges (as it may be  with respect to international connectivity). In any case, the Government will aim  to base its supply-side interventions on a clear analysis of unfeasibility of demand- side approaches, limit such interventions to the extent necessary to achieve their  objectives, and implement appropriate safeguards to avoid or minimise any  impact on the competitive environment.  At the same time, the Government appreciates that the size of Vanuatu  together with rather challenging market conditions, as described above in this  document, make it important to explore and implement ways to reduce costs of  services by enhancing economies of scale. In this regard the Government, while  being careful not to undermine fair, sustainable and effective competition in the  ICT sector, will encourage, promote and support:   1 minimization of market fragmentation, while avoiding counterproductive  artificial protection of market players and barriers for entry, which could  encourage complacency of current market players;  2 private (and public) sector collaboration to reduce costs, including by  involving third parties to provide elements of infrastructure or shared  services, and developing neutral facilities, such as an internet exchange  point.  The Government believes that the objective to promote fair and effective compe- tition and the objective to enhance economies of scale are not trade-offs, but, spe- cifically in the Vanuatu context, reinforce each other—as competitive market entry   42    Approaches and Principles  and expansion (at least where it is possible at all) are made more feasible and sus- tainable when the cost-base is reduced.  To the extent the Government participates in the ICT sector, especially  by developing its own ICT infrastructure (in particular the Government  Broadband Network (GBN)), it will follow the same approach as outlined  above. In this regard, the Government is prepared to consider procurement of  wholesale services provided by licensed service providers, as well as shared  use of telecommunications facilities when further expanding, upgrading and  strengthening its network.   The Government will also offer its facilities, infrastructure as well as  associated services for the use, on a wholesale basis, by the private sector subject  to demand and technical feasibility. It will also continue and enter into new  reciprocal mutually beneficial arrangements aimed to strengthen the national  infrastructure, such as exchanging redundant links to enhance resiliency of  telecommunications networks. The Government will engage into and implement  such arrangements in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.   Whenever Government’s activities have a potential to interfere with the  operation of the private sector, especially in case of its one-way wholesale  activities, the Government will exercise due care not to undermine sustainable,  fair and effective competition in the market. The Government will ensure that it:  (a) conducts such activities in a formal, transparent, fair, non-discriminatory and  competitively neutral manner; (b) adheres to the principle of cost-orientation  with a reference not merely to its own costs, but to the costs attainable by efficient  private-sector players; (c) sets its tariffs in a transparent manner; and (d) publishes  criteria and procedures for obtaining access to such infrastructure, facilities and  services. Outsourcing such activities to a third-party entity may also be considered  as an additional safeguard. The Government considers that such safeguards will  generally be sufficient to ensure that private-sector operations are not unduly   undermined. In any case, the Government will avoid implementing safeguards  that would unduly favour or protect specific market players.  The cautious approach, including cost-based price setting, may not be  applicable in cases where Government activities would not compete with private  sector players—neither presently (e.g., no one provides a similar service), nor  potentially (e.g., absent Government’s investments private players would not  invest into similar infrastructure). In such cases, the Government may decide to  subsidise the development of the market, for example by subsidising wholesale  services. The Government will seek, however, to ensure that such subsidy is  explicit and transparent. Furthermore, such interventions would have to be  reviewed from time-to-time as private sector investments and competition may  be made more feasible, including by: (a) new technologies; and (b) success of  Government’s interventions. Therefore the Government will seek to conduct such   Although it may appear that embracing regionalisation  may have a negative effect on local jobs and businesses,  the Government does not believe that an artificial protec- tion of local ICT sector players is an appropriate response.”  43    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  evaluations on timely basis in order to reduce the risk for an initially positive  intervention to start stifling the market development.  The Government recognises that its procurement of ICT services, products  and solutions has a potential to affect the operation of the private sector, especially  having regard to the scale of such procurement. In this context, the Government  expresses its commitment to act in this role as any other reasonable and prudent  large buyer of respective goods or services, seeking to maximise the long-term  value for its money. It believes that such best practice modes of procurement as  competitive tendering are the best tools to achieve such objectives. In any case,  the Government will avoid arbitrary assignment or distribution of its procurement  to specific market players. Where appropriate and subject to other provisions of  this Policy, the Government will also evaluate a potential of “build” versus “buy”  options, similarly to any other rational user of similar services or buyer of goods.  The Government is mindful, however, that it should seek to conduct its  procurement in a way that would avoid disrupt changes in market conditions (such  as resulting from a change of a supplier of services that constitute a significant  proportion of the market). Therefore it will investigate options to reduce an  impact of its tendering on the market, while still supporting and benefiting from  the market-force-driven operation of the sector.  The Government recognises that fair competition may, in certain cases, be  negatively impacted by “cream skimming”53. It considers, however, that direct or  indirect barriers for market entry or expansion would be a counterproductive way  to address such abuses, as they would enable complacency by existing market  players. Negative effects of such practices could be addressed by such policy  and regulatory instruments as coverage obligations, in particular associated with  radio spectrum assignments, and an appropriate Universal Access Policy (UAP),  especially the one formulated along the “pay or play” principles (i.e., requiring  every licensee to participate in the delivery of services to less economically  attractive users either by investing in the provision of such services or paying  money into the fund subsidizing such provision).   The Government acknowledges a potential, but also challenges presented by  internationalisation (and especially regionalisation) of ICT markets in enhancing  economies of scale. Many developing regions have been facing such trends. The  Pacific currently seems to be somewhat lagging behind in this process, but the  potential that such developments represent, especially for private sector players,  makes it likely that it will start catching up.  Internationalisation (in particular regionalisation) of ICT markets has a  potential to bring access to international expertise, new technologies, innovative  services and lower costs. Economies of scale, brought by this process, have a  potential of enabling stronger and more resourceful regional competitors and  enhancing competitive landscape by making national multiple-player markets  more viable.  The Government, however, also recognises potential challenges presented  by regionalisation and internationalisation of ICT markets, especially to national  policy makers and regulators constrained by the boundaries of their jurisdictions.  Local private sector players may also face challenges, if they do not find effective   53 “Cream skimming” is a practice of serving only high-value low-cost customers, and avoiding investments needed   to serve less profitable ones.  44    Approaches and Principles  responses to greater capabilities and expertise as well as lower costs of regional  players.   Although it may appear that embracing regionalisation may have a negative  effect on local jobs and businesses, the Government does not believe that an  artificial protection of local ICT sector players is an appropriate response. Such  protection would increase prices, constrain innovation and limit offerings for ICT  services and products, which are crucial inputs into the general socio-economic  development. A protection-based approach would also be unsustainable, as  regional counterparts embrace more open markets. Early and effective opening  of the telecommunications market proved that Vanuatu stand to benefit from  embracing, rather than resisting change. Therefore the Government intends to  apply the same approach in relation to regionalisation and internationalisation of  ICT markets.  The Government is therefore committed, especially via an enhanced  collaboration with its counterparts regionally and internationally as well as  regional and international organisations, to develop and implement effective  solutions that would embrace benefits of regionalisation and internationalisation,  at the same time offering appropriate responses to challenges presented by these  processes.  “Squeezing-the-Assets” and “Thinking-of-a-Greater-Good” Vanuatu’s challenging market conditions make it crucial to consider ways to min- imise costs and maximise efficient utilisation of ICT investments—not only for in- dividual stakeholders, but nationally. This is not just about marginal affordability  of ICTs. In many cases, this is crucial to cross the feasibility threshold, and is a  question of whether a significant part of the Vanuatu’s population will obtain ac- cess to ICTs at all.  In the context above, the Government recognises that access to ICTs could  be significantly expanded by enhancing the use of existing infrastructure  and facilities, including facilities originally deployed to service specific needs  or entities (e.g., connecting specific educational institutions, or banks). The  Government will therefore encourage, especially in more remote locations,  replacing an exclusive use of ICT facilities with an “anchor tenant” approach,  whereby an initial user of such facilities allow and, where appropriate, actively  enable and participate in providing such facilities, infrastructure and services  to satisfy other existing and future needs in such locations and communities.  This will apply not only to the ICT infrastructure as such, but also to supportive  infrastructure (e.g., electricity, including an ability to charge end-user devices).  The Government also believes that it is important to deliberately consider  a potential of wider positive effects of ICT development projects that could   The Government also believes that it is important to delib- erately consider a potential of wider positive effects of ICT  development projects that could originally be envisaged  to meet rather narrow needs.”  45    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  originally be envisaged to meet rather narrow needs. Cost-related challenges  in Vanuatu make it unaffordable and wasteful to satisfy such needs separately  without maximising cross-utilisation of ICT facilities.   For example, appropriate Government procurement policies, primary purpose  of which may be to satisfy Government’s ICT needs, can be an effective tool to  encourage the private sector to deploy ICT infrastructure in areas, which the  private sector would otherwise consider commercially unviable, but which could  be attractive as part of a larger commercial opportunity.   Furthermore, projects, aimed at expanding ICTs to specific facilities in  specific localities, should take into account a potential to serve broader needs  of respective communities. In this context, the Government has specifically  identified a potential for schools to also serve as Community Information,  Learning and Communication Centres.   The Government acknowledges, however, that an approach outlined above  may appear to increase costs of individual ICT deployment projects, if such  projects are evaluated separately. Therefore it will strongly promote inclusion of  considerations of “greater good”, including a potential for ICT-related positive  externalities, into evaluation of costs and benefits of different procurement  approaches as well as specific programmes, projects and initiatives.  The Government will employ a multi-stakeholder and multi-sector framework  to promote the above. It will specifically encourage development partners to  support this approach.  Kick-Starting Sustainable Development The Government, wherever possible, will aim for its policy interventions to be  limited in time, and ICT-policy-specific resources to be primarily used for inter- ventions that provide an impetus for development that could be taken over and  continued by other stakeholders, particularly the private sector.  It believes that  such an approach is important in the context of constrained financial and human  resources and a multitude of priorities. Generally, the Government will aim for its  policy (especially ICT-policy-specific) interventions to be time-limited and with a  clear exit-strategy.   The Government notes that such an approach is specifically fitting the ICT  sector. Interdependent elements of the ICT ecosystem, specifically infrastructure,  applications (content) and services, devices and users, make natural development  extremely difficult initially, but, once kick-started, supports a self-generating  growth and development. This is demonstrated by simplified negative and  positive feedback loops below.  Subsidiarity and Stakeholder Ownership and Drive The Government believes that, while a comprehensive national policy is needed to  provide a direction to all stakeholders and coordinate their actions, it is the stake- holders who: (a) have direct expertise in specific subject-matter areas that ICTs  would be enabling (line-stakeholders), and/or (b) are close (including geograph- ically) to the matters addressed and people affected or will likely be the ones to  feel the effect of specific actions (local-stakeholders),—that are best placed to iden- tify the most appropriate actions, modalities and ways necessary to achieve policy   46    Approaches and Principles  objectives and implement respective initiatives in a locally appropriate, effective  and efficient manner54. Therefore the Government believes that, wherever possi- ble, such stakeholders should be the ones making decisions and taking actions  needed to implement the Policy. Central authority should perform only those tasks  that cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level55. More ag- gregated (including, national) level actions should only be taken, when they would  add specific and substantial value (e.g., by enabling synergies via stakeholder  coordination).  On the basis of local and international experience, the Government believes  that successful implementation of policy interventions requires projects to  be owned and driven by local and/or line stakeholders. To achieve this such  stakeholders should: (a) have a clear stake in outcomes of respective policy  interventions (including in terms of substantive as well as reputational outcomes  (including the attribution of success)); (b) make a substantial contribution to the  respective project (and, to a reasonable extent, take responsibility for project- related uncertainties); and (c) have substantial freedom and be able to exercise  considerable discretion in taking actions.   Stakeholder ownership and drive is not an objective by itself. It is a tool to  achieve objectives of this Policy in general and of specific policy interventions  in particular. The Government considers that clear and meaningful outcome- oriented expectations for and/or commitments of implementing stakeholders  is an appropriate mechanism to achieve an alignment between actions of  stakeholders and policy objectives, at the same time providing an environment  enabling stakeholder ownership and drive.   In the context of this section, the Government specifically notes the  importance of local communities for implementation of projects at a local level.  Demonstrable support of local communities is an important precondition for  successful implementation of such projects. While local stakeholders are best  placed to identify the best manner to attain and demonstrate such support, the   54 An example of a specific area, where decisions will have to be made by most appropriate line and local stakehold-  ers, is limits to electronic content available via ICT tools to students in schools.  55 This is essentially how the Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘subsidiarity’.

The Government acknowledges that, even if efforts are made to create an  enabling environment as per the criteria above, not every stakeholder will exercise  the same ownership and drive. Furthermore, the capacity of various stakeholders  to implement specific projects would also differ. Therefore, especially in the  context of plentiful opportunities for actions that would contribute to the overall  objective of this Policy, the Government considers that actual levels of ownership  and drive as well as stakeholder preparedness and capacity are important factors  in deciding on priorities for initiatives. The Government will use appropriate  mechanisms, including competitive application processes, for the purpose of  identifying and evaluating such.   Reasonable requirements for stakeholders to demonstrate capacity  (including appropriate external support) to implement specific initiatives before  being entrusted such implementation would normally not be considered to  be a violation of a requirement for such stakeholders to be afforded substantial  freedom and discretion.  Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that line and local  stakeholders need to be appropriately supported in order for them to effectively  exercise their role described in this section. Therefore the Government will  establish, support and/or promote an appropriate supportive environment that  would include such elements as peer-support networks (where appropriately,  assisted by experts) and other forms of sharing of best practices; awareness,  education and capacity building initiatives; guidance, mentorship and advice;  coordination, central knowledge-base and, where appropriate, centralised  services (such as marketing or a marketplace of solutions) that would enable  appropriate synergies; as well as monitoring and evaluation as a basis for learning  and feedback. In certain cases specific technical measures will have to be made  available to support line or local decision making56.  Policy as a Process The Government notes that the policy development is not a one-off exercise.  Complexity of systems affecting ICT development means that it is impossible to  identify and address all the risks and other factors, affecting success of chosen  policy tools and policy implementation, in advance. An invincibly future-proof  policy design is an unattainable objective. Therefore the Government considers  that it is important to put in place systems and processes that would ensure con- stant adaptability of the Policy. The way to achieve this is to ensure that policy de- sign and implementation are not treated as standalone separated activities, but  are integrated into one cohesive process with built-in feedback loops (as per the  figure below).  The Government will integrate the approach above into the ICT development  governance systems and processes. In this context, the Government recognises  importance of a meaningful framework for monitoring and evaluation, which  would be based on clear targets evaluated using “SMART” (i.e., specific;   56 e.g., implementation of decisions on electronic content that should and could be accessible in schools may need to   be supported by appropriate technical measures (e.g., appropriate content management systems).  48    Approaches and Principles  measurable; attainable; relevant; and time-bound57) indicators, supported by an  appropriate statistical and reporting framework, and would provide continuous  feedback that would be used to improve progress towards achieving objectives of  this Policy.  The Government recognises that not every policy intervention will be  successful. It will use the policy development and implementation mechanism,  as described above, to identify and accept failures, note lessons learned and  discontinue support for unsuccessful policy interventions, unless there is a strong  potential that a substantial redesign could provide significant improvements.  Integration into the Work as Usual As noted above, the Government believes that ICTs should not be an end in them- selves, but should support activities of stakeholders in all spheres of the socio- economic development. To achieve that, ICT-related policy development and  implementation need to be an integral part of policy making and implementation  in respective sector policy areas. ICT-related policies should not constitute stan- dalone and isolated policy activities, detached from overall objectives in respec- tive sectors. Similarly, ICT development activities, including policy development  and implementation, should, wherever possible, utilise existing institutional, po- litical, policy, public administration, custom-based, community, religious, civil so- ciety as well as similar frameworks and structures. Stakeholder and community  engagement should, wherever possible, be conducted through existing commu- nity systems (e.g., chiefly system, religious communities and institutions, school  committees), rather than creating ICT-specific frameworks.  In the context above, the Government will aim to ensure that ICT development  objectives and activities are fully integrated into and support implementation of  corporate and business plans of respective Ministries, Government Departments,  Constitutional and Statutory Entities; are led by respective bodies, and are  supported by their general budgets. The Government recognises that specific   57 United Nations Joint Inspection Union (2004). Report: Implementation of Results-Based Management in the   United Nations Organizations.  Figure 9. Policy Development-Implementation Process  Design  ImplementationFeedback  49    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  policies for development and utilisation of ICTs with respect to specific sectors58  are a useful instrument to achieve objectives of this Policy. However, development  of such sector-specific ICT policies should primarily be used as a tool to inform  thinking of sector policy makers and implementers. Resulting objectives  and strategies should be integrated into general sector policy planning and  implementation frameworks (i.e., overarching policies, strategies, corporate and  business plans, expenditure frameworks and budgets).  At times it may be justifiable or even desirable to design financial or similar  incentive programmes specifically for ICT development initiatives. However, the  Government will, wherever possible, primarily use such ICT-specific programmes  and projects to investigate, demonstrate and/or trial appropriateness of certain  approaches in achieving specific developmental objectives. Once concepts are  proven, they, as a general principle, should be integrated into generic sector  development programmes, administered by entities (Ministries, Government  Departments, Constitutional and or Statutory Entities, Stated Owned Enterprises  etc.) responsible for respective sectors.   The Government recognises the value of pilots, demonstration models  and other similar initiatives, which could inform policy thinking, demonstrate  potential of ICT tools to stakeholders and provide models and/or lessons for  policy approaches that could be implemented on a broader scale. The Government  will support such initiatives, as long as they fit within broad objectives of this  Policy, are limited in time, scale and scope, involve all relevant stakeholders (in  particular, Ministries and Government Departments responsible for respective  sector policies), and include a strategy of how such initiatives would inform  or be integrated into the general policy process. The Government will support  establishing a mechanism (including a fund) for instigating and supporting  such initiatives (as an addition to, and not a replacement of, general sector-based  policy formulation, implementation, and funding instruments). In any case, strong   involvement of sector-specific policy makers and implementers (with them having  a lead role, or at least a strong involvement, in the design and implementation of  such initiatives) will be a requirement to proceed with such initiatives.  The OGCIO will primarily programme-manage, coordinate, support and  guide government ICT-related programmes, projects, initiatives or elements  of such, without undermining stakeholder ownership and leadership. Where  centralised design or implementation of such programmes, projects, or initiatives  is required, it will still be important to ensure stakeholder engagement for utilising  (and, possibly, maintaining) outcomes of such initiatives as well as to avoid  undermining long term stakeholder ownership.  58 e.g., ICT in Health, ICT in Agriculture and other similar policies.  Vanuatu will, without prejudice to its sovereignty, seek  to closely coordinate its actions and positions with its re- gional partners, especially within the Melanesian Region,  but also the South Pacific and the Pacific in general.”  50    Approaches and Principles  Socially Inclusive and Equitable Development It is important for the ICT-fuelled development to benefit all groups of the soci- ety, including, in particular, vulnerable groups, including women, children, lower  income people, and people with disabilities. However, overall level of access to  and utilisation of ICTs across all social groups is currently very low. Therefore  the Government considers it pragmatic, especially at this stage, to primarily con- centrate on programmes and initiatives supporting the contribution of ICTs to  the general socio-economic development, rather than on specifically targeted  programmes.   In the first instance, the Government intends to emphasise absolute gains  from the increased ICT utilisation, rather than a specific focus on relative gains for  specific social groups. Such general development would provide greatest socio- economic advances for the country as such, and would enable identification of  developmental gaps, which could then be specifically addressed by more targeted  approaches. This is also in line with international observations, recognizing  that marginalised groups are most effectively served by “general, non-targeted  interventions” rather than “targeted efforts”59.  Notwithstanding the above, the Government is committed to remain vigilant  in monitoring development outcomes for all groups in the society, so that gaps  in the development could be identified and addressed before they result in  significant developmental divides, which would seriously disadvantage certain  social groups. Furthermore, the Government recognises importance of including  all social groups as beneficiaries of generic developmental initiatives. Frequently  more inclusive and equitable development outcomes can be achieved without  significantly increasing costs or complexity of respective initiatives, but by simply  ensuring that the design and manner of implementation of such initiatives give  due regard to challenges faced by different groups60. In this context, wherever  appropriate, the Government will promote availability and use of universally  designed ICT-related goods, services, equipment and facilities, as required by  Article 4 (1) (f) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities61.  Being a Responsible Member of the  International and Regional Community The Government considers that, in achieving the objectives of this Policy, it  is important for Vanuatu to have regard to its international and regional com- mitments, including its rights and duties as a member of such organisations  as the International Telecommunication Union, Asia-Pacific Telecommunity,  Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation, World Trade Organization,  World Intellectual Property Organization, and United Nations Educational,   59 The Independent Evaluation Group/The World Bank Group (2011). Capturing Technology for Development. An   Evaluation of World Bank Group Activities in Information and Communication Technologies. 60 e.g., moving from an original male-only Rensarie Telecentre staff team to mixed-gender one significantly improved   prospects of women and girls using services of the facility. 61 Article 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines universal design as   “the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent   possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. “Universal design” shall not exclude assistive   devices for particular groups of persons with disabilities where this is needed.”  51    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  Scientific and Cultural Organization, internet governance and technical standards  entities. Vanuatu will not only aim to effectively implement its current obligations,  but will also undertake and meet additional commitments, fitting to a responsible  member of the international community.   To the extent feasible, Vanuatu will seek to be an active and constructive  player in international and regional organisations, including the ones listed above,  as well as international and regional forums and processes, such as the Internet  Governance Forum, post-World Summit on the Information Society process, and  Governmental Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation of Assigned  Names and Numbers. In deciding on priorities and extent of the international  and regional involvement, the Government will give due regard to the national  priorities, available human and financial resources, as well as costs and benefits of  such participation.  In the context above, Vanuatu will, without prejudice to its sovereignty, seek  to closely coordinate its actions and positions with its regional partners, especially  within the Melanesian Region, but also the South Pacific and the Pacific in general,  as well as its development partners.  Furthermore, the Government recognises the value in learning from  experiences of other countries, especially countries that share similar  characteristics. It also notes synergies and cost efficiencies that could be achieved  in designing and implementing or advocating certain initiatives on a regional or  international level. Therefore it will seek to actively collaborate with its regional  and international partners, wherever such collaboration could contribute to the  achievement of the overall objective of this Policy.   In undertaking and implementing international commitments, and  otherwise exercising its rights and responsibilities, the Government will have  due regard to the realistic ability, capacity and time needed for Vanuatu to meet  such commitments in a sustainable manner without curtailing socio-economic  development. Appropriate transition periods as well as understanding and  support from development partners as well as other international partners will be  sought for the implementation of such approach.  Prioritising the Priorities Given the level of current availability and utilisation of ICTs and a potential for  contribution to the socio-economic development from an increased adoption of  ICTs, the Government could identify a very long list of important activities in this  area. However, the Government also appreciates limitations with respect to finan- cial and human resources as well as, importantly, its programme and project man- agement capacity. Therefore the Government will seek to identify and work on a  realistic number of priorities. Generally, criteria set out in Part IV of this Policy  will be used to identify such priorities.   The Government recognises that an effective use of resources and  achievement of tangible results requires consistency of efforts over time.  Therefore it will seek to ensure stability of its priorities. However, due to an  extremely dynamic nature of the ICT sector, a periodic reassessment of such  priorities is appropriate.  The above, however, should not be interpreted as restricting other  stakeholders from undertaking activities that contribute to the overall objective   52    Approaches and Principles  of this Policy and comply with its principles. Moreover, where specific sector  Ministries or Government Departments have resources to undertake initiatives,  contributing to the overall objective of this Policy, without a need to rely on special  central resources provided for the implementation of this Policy, this Policy shall  not be interpreted as preventing such Ministries and Government Departments  to undertake such initiatives. However, such Ministries and Government  Departments shall ensure that their initiatives abide by principles of this Policy  and do not contradict initiatives otherwise undertaken under it.  Utilisation of Appropriate Tools The Government recognises that, in addition to such tools as laws, regulations  and enforcement, which governments traditionally use to effect policy implemen- tation, implementation of this Policy could also be achieved or influenced by:  1 informing and guiding stakeholders; 2 educating; 3 coordinating; 4 promoting, encouraging and facilitating; 5 inspiring; 6 using procurement policies and power; 7 designing and implementing taxation and customs frameworks; 8 investing into and financing entities and projects; 9 directly implementing specific initiatives and projects; 10 utilising other tools, which incentivise, enable or guide stakeholders to   contribute to the overall objective of this Policy.  The Government also notes such approaches as self-regulation and co-regulation,  and their potential to achieve objectives of this Policy in an effective and cost-effi- cient manner.  In implementing this Policy, the Government will utilise an appropriate  set of tools, suitable to specific aims and initiatives, which would be least  interventionist, most effective and cost-efficient, most sustainable, most fitting  with the apprwoaches set out in this Policy, and which would maximise long-term  returns of respective initiatives.  53    Operationalizing Implementation of this Policy  Operationalizing  Implementation of this Policy  Responsibility for the implementation of this Policy rests with: 1 The Honourable Prime Minister as the Minister responsible for ICT and   Telecommunications; 2 The multi-stakeholder National ICT Development Committee, which   has been established and is chaired by the Honourable Prime Minister.  This Committee shall have the primary responsibility for the further  development and coordinated implementation of this Policy. The  Committee shall have a right to set up working and advisory groups to  assist it in its work and take other appropriate actions that are necessary  or useful in achieving objectives of this Policy;  3 The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO),  which shall support the Honourable Prime Minister, as the Minister  responsible for ICT and Telecommunications, in her/his duties, as well as  act as a secretariat to and otherwise facilitate the work of the Committee.  The OGCIO will also support stakeholders in their efforts to implement  this Policy;  4 The Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator  (TRR) shall act as the sector regulator as well as an implementing  agency for specific ICT development initiatives, particularly where such  implementation could not be more effectively done by a sector-specific  Ministry or Government Department;  5 Responsible Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional and  Statutory Entities and other stakeholders, which are responsible for  implementation of this Policy in their respective areas.  The Government envisages that this Policy will be implemented through a pro- grammatic approach, based on the principles of results-based-management, and  supported by:  1 Consolidated list of strategies for implementation of specific Priorities  set out by this Policy, which would also specify responsible and  supporting Ministries, Government Departments, Constitutional or  Statutory Entities, and, where appropriate, other stakeholders. This  list will be initially approved by the Council of Ministers. However, the  National ICT Development Committee will have a power to update it;  2 Implementation plan, which will be based on the consolidated list of  strategies and, based on submissions from and after consultation with  stakeholders responsible for implementation of specific strategies, will  also include specific activities, outputs and timelines for implementing  such strategies, key performance indicators (including targets), as well  as related risks and strategies for their mitigation. The implementation   55    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  plan shall be approved and updated by the National ICT Development  Committee. The implementation plan for the initial consolidated list  of strategies shall be approved within 3 months from the adoption of  this Policy. The Government envisages that this plan will cover a 5 year  period;  3 Issue- and sector-specific policies and/or strategies, which will address  specific aspects of the implementation of this Policy62 in detail. These  policies, to the extent they fall within the scope of this Policy, shall be  endorsed by the National ICT Development Committee and, where  required by specific laws, approved by the Council of Ministers;  4 Corporate and business plans as well as expenditure frameworks and  budgets of sector Ministries and Government Departments, as well as  similar plans and budgets of Constitutional and Statutory Entities and  other stakeholders.  To the extent public funding is required to implement this Policy, such funding  will be provided from:  1 Funds of respective stakeholders, including regular budgets of respective  Ministries, Government Departments, as well as Constitutional and  Statutory Entities;  2 ICT Development Fund, which will primarily be used to provide seed  funding for initiatives covered by this Policy, including piloting and  testing policy approaches and establishing demonstration models,  which could subsequently be integrated into generic programmes of  sector Ministries and Government Departments. This fund may be  managed as per the framework applicable to the Universal Access Policy  Fund, without restrictions for using such funds set out in sections 17(1),  18(1) and 19(3) of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications  Regulation Act No. 30 of 2009;  3 Universal Access Policy Fund, set up and administered under section 19  of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulation Act  No. 30 of 2009.  Support of development partners as well as international and regional organisa- tions will be sought to fund the implementation of this Policy. Furthermore, in ac- cordance with the principles of multi-stakeholder collaboration, the Government  will seek to partner with local, regional and international public, private, non-profit  and volunteer organisations, including multinational corporations as well as in- ternational and regional civil society organisations (such as the Pacific Islands  Chapter of the Internet Society), in implementing this Policy. The Government  will enable and facilitate such partnerships, including by accepting and encour- aging contributions, including targeted ones, to the ICT Development Fund and  Universal Access Policy Fund.  Where various organisations seek to design and/or implement their own  programmes, projects or initiatives falling within the scope of this Policy, the  Government will encourage and facilitate coordination of such design and  implementation with activities under this Policy, as well as promote application   62 E.g., Universal Access Policy, Cybersecurity Policy etc.  56    Final Provisions  of principles and approaches of this Policy to such programmes, projects or  initiatives.   The Government through the National ICT Development Committee  will develop an effective monitoring and evaluation framework, based on the  principles of results-based-management and supported by an adequate statistical  and reporting framework, in order to track success of the implementation of this  Policy, compare achievements with the progress in other similar jurisdictions,  and to provide information necessary to adjust or revise this Policy or specific  strategies under it.  The National ICT Development Committee shall prepare and submit to the  Council of Ministers an annual report on the implementation of this Policy within  3 months from every anniversary of its adoption.  The Government, through the National ICT Development Committee and  the OGCIO, will seek to ensure that international and local stakeholders, as  well as the public at large, are well aware of this Policy, its benefits, the progress  towards implementation of it, as well as opportunities to contribute to its further  development and implementation. It will also seek to recognise and showcase  sector development achievements. The Government will also encourage research  relevant to further development and implementation of this Policy.  Where appropriate, the organizational structure for the implementation of  this Policy will be supported by appropriate legislation, decisions of the Council of  Ministers, Memoranda of Understanding and other appropriate instruments.  Final Provisions  Having regard to rapid developments in the ICT sector, the Government,  assisted by the National ICT Development Committee, will seek  to ensure that this Policy is sufficiently up-to-date. Generally, the  Government will aim to review and, where appropriate, revise this   Policy within 5 years from its adoption. This Policy supersedes the Telecommunications Policy Statement of 2009.  57    Annex A // Selecting Policy Priorities  Annex A  Selecting Policy Priorities  Currently very few students have access to and are able to use ICTs: 5% of students have access to  ICTs, 4% of students are computer literate, number of students per computer is 205, and only about 6%  of schools have access to the Internet with only about 1% of schools accessing broadbandA1. Interviews  with stakeholders suggest that affordability is a major issue. A design of specific interventions aimed  at expanding access to ICTs should ensure, however, that they would not extend beyond what is neces- sary to catalyse provision of such access, with a preference of private provision of such ICT tools and  services. Furthermore, development and distribution of educational materials supporting the national  curriculum has primarily been a function of the Ministry of Education.  As noted by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, “[t]he use of ICTs in the context of information society  hinges largely upon having a population that can use them, which implies that all will need to acquire  the skills needed to use them”A2.  Computer literacy and ICT knowledge rise substantially in schools with computer labs (and pre- sumably with tablets or computing devices in the (future) classrooms)—up to 71% are computer-liter- ate in such schools, compared to close to zero in schools with no student access to computersA3. As  demonstrated by Rensarie College, access to ICTs also has a significant impact on general educational  achievementA4. Furthermore, as noted in a joint submission to the National ICT Policy from various en- tities under the MoEA5 and MYDST: “Young people all over the world are taking to ICT in a way that  has never been seen before inside education. The technology appears to address many different learn- ing styles and has an intrinsic fascination for most people, especially the young.”A6 Young people in  general and students specifically comprise a significant part of population. 47% of the population is 19  years or youngerA7. There are 18,064 secondary school students and 42,352 students at primary schools. A8 In addition to raising the level of education, as well as preparing the future work force (and thereby  opening up business development and employment opportunities) and democratic participants of  Vanuatu, providing access to ICTs to students has strong additional positive externalities, as there  is a high likelihood that they would transfer such skills to their families, and assist such families in   1.

Annual Statistical Report 2010-11.  59    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  Although it is important to involve relevant experts in implementing projects under this Priority, rele- vant initiatives primarily need coordination only among the OGCIOA9, TRRA10 and MoE. It is envisaged  that schools will primarily (but not necessarily exclusively) receive support based on a competitive ap- plication process—this will allow collaboration with the most ready stakeholders. Furthermore, expe- rience has demonstrated that even mere provision of ICT tools and services to students and teachers  provides strong beneficial effects (that will be enhanced by providing additional specialised content  and services, but do not depend on them). In terms of providing educational content, a joint submis- sion to the National ICT Policy from various entities under the MoEA11 noted that a lot of suitable mate- rial that could be rather easily repurposed for ICT-based use already exists.  A good number of school principals as well as the staff of the MoE, including provincial education of- ficers, recognise a potential of ICTs. Local information technology companies have experience in pro- viding schools with ICT tools and services (and maintaining them), and have reported requests from  additional schools to support them in this regard. However, there is an affordability gap, which the  Government support could assist in bridging. Furthermore, a joint submission to the National ICT Pol- icy from various entities under the MoEA12 noted availability of appropriate materials that could be de- livered via electronic means, as well as readiness and commitment of the Curriculum Development  Unit and Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education to develop appropriate ICT-based locally-relevant ed- ucational materials. The Curriculum Development Unit has already produced around 200 readers in  both English and French for the early years in school and many teacher guides that are currently being  upgraded. As per the submission, these materials can be turned into ebooks relatively easily. Further- more, the Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education is considering creating course materials for teach- ers, which can also be turned into ebooks and possibly further developed for long distance training for  teachers in outlying regions. Moreover, Wan Smol Bag creates many educational materials along with  Live and Learn and other Non-governmental Organizations.  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  obtaining benefits of the use of ICT (which would contribute to them being able to have a better access  to business opportunities, government services, professional development opportunities etc.). Further- more, it is envisaged that schools should become Community Learning, Information and Communica- tion Centres—such a policy would extend benefits of ICTs to surrounding communities.  Lower complexity and reliance on  inputs from multiple stakeholders  Low level of access to the Internet, especially broadband, as well as sparse radio coverage, demon- strates a need for an action from the Government.  Affordability challenges are demonstrated by a fact  that in 2012 the ITU rankedA13 Vanuatu 143 out of 161 countries in terms of ICT prices. Moreover, ICT  prices in Vanuatu seem to be much higher than the average for countries with similar incomes (meas- ured as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita). Furthermore, despite generally good coverage of   2.

Collaboration from other stakeholders would add value to initiatives, but would not be a precon- dition for their success.  Primary responsibility for such measures rests with the OGCIO. Specific applications will be prior- itised based on the preparedness, buy-in and capacity of respective Ministries, Government Depart- ments, Constitutional and Statutory Entities.  The OGCIO has already been coordinating, implementing and supporting initiatives, corresponding  to this Priority, under the Integrated Government (iGov) initiative and on the basis of the E-Govern- ment Strategic Roadmap.  It is envisaged that policy interventions will primarily support, extend and strengthen deployment  and operation of as well as provision of access to ICT infrastructure, deployment of which has already  been started by private service providers (i.e., deployment of telecommunications networks) and other  stakeholders (e.g., Internet Cafes, a number of which has already been established). An affordability  gap could be bridged by the Government support and appropriate policies geared to lower costs of  ICTs. Such policies will also facilitate making mass-market ICT devices more available to the public.  Readiness of demand is also demonstrated by the fact that only 10.9% of the population do not know  what they would use the Internet forA14.  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  mobile services, quality of wireless voice and voice-related services (including SMS) would clearly ben- efit from an improvement. In any case, specific interventions should address areas, which would not be  addressed otherwise by other stakeholders, in the least interventionist and proportional manner.  Access to ICT infrastructure and devices establishes an enabling platform for the delivery of other pri- vate and public services, as well as for residents to seek for employment, business and professional de- velopment opportunities.

E-Government  Impetus to the socio-economic  development that would not  be achieved otherwise  Government services will be delivered in a much more effective, transparent and efficient way and will  be made much more accessible to residents and businesses across Vanuatu, including in rural areas.  Furthermore, E-Government services will strengthen demand for ICT tools and services in general, by  providing a cost efficient way to satisfy specific day-to-day needs of residents and businesses.   Impact in terms of both the  matters addressed, but also  for broader socio-economic  development as sought by the  Priorities and Action Agenda  A14 PIPP (2011). Net Effects: Social and economic impacts of telecommunications and internet in Vanuatu.  61    National Information and Communication Technology Policy  The OGCIO will coordinate with respective sector Ministries, Government Departments, Constitu- tional and Statutory Entities on the one-to-one basis, having regard to the preparedness and buy-in  of respective stakeholders. OGCIO will work with stakeholders and the CoM to develop (as directed  by the PM) an agreed-upon reasonable target percentage for spending on ICTs, as a percent of total   project budgets, for all major future and recently developed projects in all sectors, across the GoV. This  target will tentatively be in the range of 3.0 to 5.0 percent to be spent on ICTs within each project.  This Priority enables mitigating risks associated with achieving other Priorities and the ICT develop- ment in general. A failure to address this priority could, with increased utilisation of ICTs, increase vul- nerability of Vanuatu to various disruptions and even cause a backlash against the ICT development.  Existing policy development and implementation instruments, including sector policies, corporate and  business plans, expenditure frameworks and budgets, will be utilised. The first meeting of the National  ICT Development Committee demonstrated that various Ministries and Government Departments (as  well as Constitutional and Statutory Entities) acknowledge a potential of ICT contributions to their  specific areas. The process of integration will be designed so that to enable such entities to transform  an abstract need into specific fully understood policy actions.  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  Lower complexity and reliance on  inputs from multiple stakeholders  Policy development and implementation is direct responsibility of the Government.  Achieving this Priority will likely require legislative measures, including adjustments to the Penal  Code. Furthermore, such areas as protection of critical infrastructure specifically require attention of  the Government, as disruption of such infrastructure would have serious consequences for the life of  the country. The state is also well placed to kick-start other measures, including related to awareness  and education. Whenever other stakeholders demonstrate readiness to take over specific responsibil- ities, e.g., in terms of raising awareness and levels of education, the need for a state action should be  re-evaluated.  4.

Furthermore, the TRR has already been undertaking initiatives in this  area. Relevant policy interventions have already been supported by international partners—in particu- lar, the International Telecommunication Union, but also the World Bank. This area is also one of the  themes of the Framework for Action on ICT for Development in the Pacific (FAIDP).  The Government has already established the Cybersecurity Policy and Legislation Working Group.  Specific policy interventions will be developed and implemented in the context of this group. A num- ber of stakeholders, involved in specific interventions under this Priority, will be relatively limited (al- though an overall range of stakeholders affected is likely to be rather broad).  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  Ready demand, existing models  of ICT development and available  implementation capacity  Lower complexity and reliance on  inputs from multiple stakeholders  Lower complexity and reliance on  inputs from multiple stakeholders  Vanuatu is the World’s most linguistically dense country—i.e., has the highest number of languages per  population. Besides 2 official (English and French) and 1 national (Bislama) languages, Vanuatu also  has more than 105 local languagesA15 that are rather actively used. Currently content in such languages  is virtually non-existent. The Government will primarily aim to kick-start the development of content  in such languages, leaving the further process to relevant stakeholders, including, particularly, local  communities. Furthermore, although commercially attractive part of the population has a good com- mand of English and French (thereby reducing incentives to provide ICT tools in Bislama), expanding  use of ICTs would be clearly facilitated by availability of ICT tools adapted to Bislama.  6.  Locally Relevant Content  Impetus to the socio-economic  development that would not  be achieved otherwise  Studies demonstrate a strong link between local content and the development of network infrastruc- tureA16. Furthermore, this will enhance the community buy-in into the value of ICT tools. Access  to electronic content in local languages will also expand professional development and education  opportunities.  The Government will primarily engage in initiatives that require minimal stakeholder collaboration— e.g., by facilitating translation of existing content into Bislama and local languages; as well as making  existing content available in electronic form (including online). Communities will be engaged on the  basis of their commitments to make significant contributions (particularly, in terms of their effort) in  this regard. Adaptation of ICT tools will rely on involving active and enthusiastic local community of  ICT professionals.  Tools for translation of existing content into variety of languages are readily available. A number of  communities have produced dictionaries for their languages or material in their languages (e.g., bi- bles), which could be utilised for the purposes of this Priority. Furthermore, various stakeholders, espe- cially Ministries and Government Departments as well as media organisations, possess and constantly  produce content that could be readily made available online. Moreover, community/non-governmental  initiatives have produced useful Bislama-enabled ICT tools.A17  Impact in terms of both the  matters addressed, but also  for broader socio-economic  development as sought by the  Priorities and Action Agenda  A15 Government of Vanuatu (2012).

Stakeholders have been naturally relying on the Government for  such activities.  7.   Capacity Building  8.  Platform for Multi-Stakeholder and   Multi-Sector Coordination and Collaboration  Impetus to the socio-economic  development that would not  be achieved otherwise  Impetus to the socio-economic  development that would not  be achieved otherwise  ICT and related skills are needed to utilise platforms created under other Priorities (as well as to fur- ther develop such platforms). As more public servants obtain ICT and related skills, they will be able  to more independently devise further ideas and policies for ICT utilisation, leading to a self-fuelling  further development of ICT development initiatives. They will also contribute to provision of more ef- ficient and effective Government services. Furthermore, such public servants will be able to increase  awareness of ICT benefits in their families and communities.  This Priority will enable a multiplicity of stakeholders to undertake initiatives aimed at developing the  ICT sector and enhancing its contribution to the socio-economic development, including initiatives  that could neither be envisaged, nor, possibly, implemented by the Government alone. Thereby this  will unleash creativity and actions of such stakeholders. Furthermore, this will significantly increase  the value, effectiveness and efficiency of initiatives of individual stakeholders due to synergies and  cost savings achieved through joint efforts with other stakeholders.  With respect to the public service, primarily collaboration of the Public Service Commission and OG- CIO, where required supported by contractors, will be required.  Participation in such a platform will largely be voluntary, especially for non-governmental stakehold- ers. Therefore establishment of it only requires actions from the OGCIO, supported by the Honoura- ble Prime Minister and the National ICT Development Committee, and willing stakeholders. Individ- ual stakeholders will be able to choose their own pace and levels of involvement. Measures, encourag- ing enhanced involvement, will be developed, without, however, relying on such level of participation  from specific stakeholders.  As E-Government facilities and services were being implemented for a while, this created a ready de- mand for public servants to obtain required skills to utilise opportunities, provided by such facilities  and services. Various capacity building initiatives have been undertaken. Furthermore, Vanuatu has  both public and private sector providers, capable to implement respective initiatives (e.g., the Vanuatu  Institute of Technology and CNS).

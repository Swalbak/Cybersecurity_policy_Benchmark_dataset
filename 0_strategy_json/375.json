It is an increasingly essential means for the private sector to compete and prosper, through its ability to connect to the local markets as well as to those beyond our shores, efficiently and cost effectively. Competitiveness in a digital economy however calls for resilience to the security challenges posed within the realm of cyber-space - ICT and its constituent elements and its dependents. This Strategy aims to establish the foundations to ensure effective cyber security within Government, the private sector and civil society. It does not simply entail technology security controls but involves measures related to regulation, legislation, awareness, education, expertise and foreign affairs. Striving for cyber security is a continuous journey. Cyber security can never be fully attained, considering that the technology itself, the day to day realities in technology adoption as well as the modes of cyber attack are in a continuous state of evolution. Hence the Strategy is not seen as cast in stone, but it shall need to evolve, in line with a national commitment and collective effort to adopt a cyber security culture. Embracing security as a normal way of everyone’s cyber lives is in the common interest. Ultimately, cyber security needs to be seen as a key cornerstone to Malta’s competitiveness within the digital world by positioning it as a secure online jurisdiction and potentially presenting opportunities for the development of centres of excellence in a number of local business sectors interacting within the realm of cyberspace. Hon Dr. Emmanuel Mallia Minister for Competitiveness and Digital, Maritime and Services Economy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 4 Executive Summary Cyber-space is far from perfect. It is at risk of vulnerabilities, some of which involve genuine human error, whilst others are exposed to malicious intent. Furthermore, global innovations within its realm are even faster than the ability to secure it. Hence the need for cyber security, that is, ensuring the safety, confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyber- space. Launching cyber security on a national scale, essentially calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach, thus leading to the need of a National Cyber Security Strategy. Digital Malta – the National Digital Strategy for Malta for the period 2014-2020 - recognises and proposes the fulfilment of such need, in the light of Malta’s increased dependence upon cyber-space in its day to day interactivity, within and beyond its shores. Indeed, in 2015, the European Commission’s e-Government Benchmark Report re-confirmed Malta as the leader in the delivery and performance of e-Government services amongst thirty-three countries. Malta is addressing such a need. A Green Paper for a National Cyber Security Strategy was launched in October 2015, as a basis for consultation. The Green Paper presented a high level, strategic approach for cyber security on a national scale. It intended to inculcate an awareness of cyber security, its extent and its implications of which Malta, as an integral part of cyber-space, needs to consider. The National Cyber Security Strategy being launched is a consolidation of the proposals presented by the Green Paper following online feedback and a number of consultation sessions held. The National Cyber Security Strategy recognises that tackling cyber security entails the need to: • Safeguard the rule of law in line with Malta’s Constitution and Malta’s role as a European Union Member State • Adopt a multi-disciplinary approach • Ensure that all stakeholders of cyber-space; government, private sector, and civil society understand their shared responsibility and thus commitment to collaboration and cooperation, to ensure a safe, stable and secure environment • Adopt a risk based approach, based upon the premise that it is impossible to guarantee immunity from any cyber attack. All of the above constitute the fundamental principles upon which the overall vision is based. In essence, the Vision covers the need and expectations of three key national stakeholders – the public sector, the private sector and civil society to ensure cyber security. Five dimensions enable articulation of the vision into the strategy. They are Policy, Legislation, Risk Management, Awareness and Education upon which the subsequent proposed strategy is based. Prior to proposing the strategy however, research and assessments have been made so as to enable a high level pragmatic approach towards cyber security within the local context. The ensuing strategic direction within the Green Paper is proposed to be attained by six goals, each of which carries a number of proposed measures, as follows: 1. Goal: Establish a Governance Framework that is based upon the premise that a cyber security strategy needs to be established, and more importantly, be effectively implemented and maintained on a continuous basis. Hence the need to ensure the key coordination structures, processes, roles and practice with particular focus on cyber risk management within the public and private sector. 2. Goal: Combat Cybercrime which aims to ensure and consolidate capabilities to tackle cybercrime. 3. Goal: Strengthen National Cyber Defence which aims to foster sharing of cyber security knowledge and intelligence, review current legislation and regulations in line with cyber- space developments and ensure digital resilience on a national and organisation wide MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 5 scale of particular consideration are recent legal developments at EU level, notably legislation pertaining to data protection and that related to Network and Information Security. 4. Goal: Secure cyber-space which aims to foster self regulation and voluntary self commitment, bearing in mind that legislation is not a panacea to cyber security commitments. It also aims to stimulate use of standards and best practices that guarantee security whilst allowing for interoperability. Special focus is also given to promote security and trust of online public services and to consolidate support to the private sector. 5. Goal: Cyber security Awareness and Education which aims to target academia, the public and private sector and citizens as a means to sensitize awareness, knowledge as well as capabilities and expertise in cyber security. A national strategic approach towards an ongoing educational and awareness campaign is especially recommended. 6. Goal: National and International Cooperation which aims to ensure effective consultation, cooperation and collaboration on a national level, on a European and on a global basis, enabled by EU and international institutions and activities, based on the understanding that cyber security has no bounds. All six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes expected of the Strategy, namely those of: • Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from cyber threats. • Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber-space. The proposed strategic approach is by no means the end in itself. It is understood that the launch of the Strategy is only the start of a continuous process that calls for its implementation, evaluation and maintenance so as to ensure its currency and effectiveness in line with: “ Launching cyber security on a national scale, essentially calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach, thus leading to the need of a National Cyber Security Strategy. ” • Increased recognition on a nation-wide scale of the importance to adopt cyber security measures in day to day corporate and individual activities • Evolving maturity of overall cyber security capability • Technological developments and applicability, along with related cyber security challenges • Evolution in cybercrime behaviour • Developments on a national scale, in line with European Union direction on cyber security to its Member States of which Malta forms part. Hence, the Strategy would be expected to be periodically reviewed and updated. Ultimately, the Strategy is understood as a means for national cyber security investment that indicates Malta as a : • Secure online jurisdiction • Centre of excellence in various business sectors interacting within cyber-space. MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 6 MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 7 Part One Introduction MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 8 1. BACKGROUND Up to a few decades ago, a country’s security interests focussed on protecting its borders, its waters and its airspace. Today, cyber-space forms an integral part of a country’s day to day reality. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) leads the way in interaction within and outside of a country’s territory and its disruption may potentially affect life. Hence, cyber-space cannot be left out of a country’s span of protection. Malta is no island within the realm of cyber-space! Cyber-space knows no boundaries. It transcends national borders, promoting online opportunities of dialogue, mutual cooperation and understanding beyond our shores. However, the cyber world makes no distinction between its users of good intent or not. Therefore, as opportunities are limitless, so are cyber threats. Such malicious attempts in cyber-space may be launched anywhere, in any vulnerable area of a digital network, instantaneously leaving no time for an appropriate response and with very minimal traceability or detection of its perpetrator. Ultimately, cyber-space is man-made and like anything else of its sort, it is never perfect. The rapid advances of technology itself and the opportunities that arise from it do not allow it either. Indeed the innovations in technology and its adoption are even faster than the ability to secure it. Malta’s security of cyber-space ultimately calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach that respects fundamental rights and freedoms whilst ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace on a day-to-day basis. Such is the intention of Digital Malta – the National Digital Strategy for the period 2014 till 2020 – which identifies a National Cyber Security Strategy as one of its required actions. Part One Introduction “ Everyone is affected by cyber issues and everyone needs mutual assistance. It is therefore in everyone’s interest and responsibility to ensure a secure and safe cyber-space for all. ” 2. PURPOSE AND SCOPE This Strategy intends to set an overall high level direction in cyber security across all strata of the Maltese economy and society. As a first issue, it also intends to consolidate a recognition of the need for a planned and concerted effort by the various stakeholders involved so as to protect Malta and its interests. This Strategy should translate into timely, specific and actionable measures that set the foundations for a national cyber security framework that shall need to be implemented, maintained and updated so as to ensure currency and relevance in a highly challenging, dynamic and complex environment as that posed by cyber-space. Through its various goals and corresponding measures, the National Cyber Security Strategy aims to: • Position cyber security as a national investment, that gives an indication beyond Malta’s shores of the country’s commitment to a secure cyber- space for online transaction and interaction • Convey the key message that cyber security cannot be achieved in isolation. It does not MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 9 simply fall within the domain of Information and Communications Technology experts and practitioners. Everyone is affected by cyber issues and everyone needs mutual assistance. It is therefore in everyone’s interest and responsibility to ensure a secure and safe cyber- space for all. The National Cyber Security Strategy, above all, aims to align itself within the scope of: • Specific EU legal requirements1. Reference to such legal requirements, however, does not preclude the need to refer to the specific legal requirements for further direction. • Digital Malta and other local strategy documents such as e-Commerce Malta - the National e-commerce Strategy (2014-2020) - published by the Malta Communications Authority2. 3. THE PRE-LAUNCH OF THE STRATEGY On 30th October 2015, the Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business launched a Green Paper for a National Cyber Security Strategy. The Green Paper followed extensive research based upon various published sources to assess cyber security from: (i) A global and from a European Union perspective, based on the understanding that the interconnectedness in cyberspace renders any challenge in cyber security as potentially impacting any country applying Information and Communications Technology, including Malta. (ii) A domestic perspective, particularly with respect to: • Experiences and concerns expressed by Maltese participants in annual Euro Barometer surveys specialising in cyber security • Malta’s current official position in particular aspects of cyber security Part One Introduction (iii) A multi-stakeholder perspective, based on the understanding that apart from technology, cyber security impacts upon all of country’s political, legal, economic and social well being. The Green Paper set the basis for consultation through: 1. Online feedback using and that lasted till 14 February 2016 2. A series of consultation events, which were held between March and June 2016 and which targeted a number of social and economic sectors, namely: • Economy and Finance • Education and National Awareness • Justice and Legislation • Infrastructure and Health • National Security • The Public The consultative process led to relevant updates to the proposals made within the Green Paper; leading to the issue of this first version of the National Cyber Security Strategy. MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 10 MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 11 Part Two Overall Direction MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 12 4. PRELUDE This Section sets the scene for the National Cyber Security Strategy, through a definition of what is meant by cyber-space and its security and an outline of the key principles leading to the vision expected to be attained through the strategy. A Cyber Security Model presented encapsulates the key dimensions that are to be addressed by means of goals and corresponding measures, proposed in Part 3, for the implementation of the Strategy. 5. WHAT IS MEANT BY CYBER SECURITY Definitions for cyber security abound; however they all essentially point to the security of the cyber- space; namely all: • Interconnected ICT hardware and software infrastructure • Data in transit and at rest on the networks • Connected users • Logical connections established among them In view of the above3, the following definition of cyber security is being adopted: It is the safeguards and actions that can be used to protect cyber domain from those threats that are associated with or that may harm its interdependent networks and information infrastructure. It strives to preserve the availability and integrity of the networks and infrastructure and the confidentiality of the information contained therein. Essentially, cyber security is based upon the foundations of information security, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability. However, whilst information security is business driven and results in prudent investment in safeguards and countermeasures, cyber security is threat driven where all cyber-space is at risk. The inherent interconnectedness of cyber-space exposes all of its constituents to a failure of their most vulnerable elements4 . Additionally effective cyber security cannot be reached by technological measures alone as modern cyber attacks could bypass all defence layers by exploiting the human factors through techniques such as social engineering5. Hence, safeguards and actions hereby refer to ongoing and planned measures which may potentially be of technical, operational, legislative, educational, behavioural or disseminative nature. Above all, cyber security cannot be seen from a technological aspect only, but needs to cover the needs and expectations of the state, the economy and society, all of which are increasingly active participants in an interactive digital world. 6. GUIDING PRINCIPLES Within this context, the Strategy, in its lifecycle, shall be guided by a number of principles as follows: Rule of Law The approach on cyber security shall respect and promote fundamental rights and freedoms as chartered within European Union and national legislation. All measures shall comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality, with appropriate safeguards to ensure accountability and redress. Multi-stakeholder, cooperative and collaborative approach The pervasive nature of cyber-space, essentially calls for a multi-stakeholder approach towards its security – both at a national level as well as beyond Malta’s shores. Hence, on a national level, cooperation and collaboration of various stakeholders, including the Part Two Overall Direction MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 13 public sector, the private sector, academia and civil society is necessary. A cooperative and collaborative approach at an EU and international level is also required. Shared goal and responsibility Effective cyber security essentially calls for the sharing of one common goal that transcends boundaries. Whilst leading in its commitment towards cyber security on a national scale, Government cannot assume sole responsibility for protecting all of cyberspace. All users of ICT are responsible to take reasonable steps to protect systems and data on an individual and on a collective basis. Risk Management The widely diffused use of cyberspace coupled with its rapid and continuous evolvement, renders it impossible to guarantee immunity from any form of cyber attack. Hence a risk-based approach to assess, prioritise and take measures to ensure cyber security, along with any technology investment is necessary. 7. OVERALL VISION Within the context of the articulated principles, an overall vision for the National Cyber Security Strategy is: To ensure a secure, resilient and trusted digital interactive environment that supports Malta’s safety and security whilst maximising on the benefits of a digital economy. In specific terms, the vision entails that: • Civil society is aware of cyber risks and undertakes necessary precautions to protect its privacy, confidentiality, personal integrity, identity and well-being • The Private Sector, whilst tapping the opportunities resulting from the technology developments, actively ensures that it operates in a secure and resilient digital economy, whilst ensuring effective delivery of their services and/ or goods and protection of their customer’s privacy and integrity • The Public Sector leads the way in ensuring a secure and resilient digital environment for its interaction with and/or service delivery to civil society, private enterprise and with regional and international partners, as well as in placing Malta as a secure online location for business interaction. The National Cyber Security Strategy aims to address the needs and expectations of each of the above stakeholders, in the light of the proposed vision. Part Two Overall Direction “ Whilst leading in its commitment towards cyber security on a national scale, Government cannot assume sole responsibility for protecting all of cyberspace. All users of ICT are responsible to take reasonable steps to protect systems and data on an individual and on a collective basis. ” MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 14 8. A CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY MODEL As outlined in Figure 1, the strategy addresses five dimensions which are identified within the Cyber Security Capability Maturity Model of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre, University of Oxford6. Proposed goals and related measures underscore in more specific terms how the strategy is expected to be implemented. Policy Legislation Risk Management Culture Education Devising cyber security policy and strategy that sets the direction on a national level. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks to support all aspects of the strategy. Controlling risks through organisation, standards and technology. Fostering awareness to encourage a responsible cyber culture throughout society. Building cyber skills into the workforce and leadership through effective education.

THE GOALS AND ACCOMPANYING MEASURES 9.1 The Goals Digital Malta, and in particular, Action 53, proposes four high level goals for a National Cyber Security Strategy, which are: • Combat Cybercrime Law enforcement agencies are to identify gaps and strengthen their capability to investigate and combat cybercrime. • Strengthen National Cyber Defence Public and private entities are to be guided and assisted in strengthening their cyber defence capabilities. • Secure Cyber-space Higher levels of trust are to be instilled through awareness programmes and the delivery of trustworthy, ICT-enabled services that assure confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy. • Build Capacity (Cyber security Awareness and Education) The skills and educational frameworks required are to be identified and developed. However, sound and stable governance essential for the effective ongoing implementation of a National Cyber Security Strategy, calls for two other goals, namely: • Establish a Governance Framework to attain a National Cyber Security Strategy Given that at this stage, only the technical and operational structures are in formation. The strategic level that focuses on the long term trends, analysis and coordination in cyber security is also necessary. • National and International Cooperation given that the borderless nature of cyber-related activity, essentially calls for particular regard to the global and regional aspect, apart from the national focus of related security. In all, the six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes expected from the Strategy, namely: • Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from cyber threats • Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber-space. 9.2 The Proposed Measures A set of measures to each corresponding goal are proposed below, based upon: • Analysis, as well as consultations undertaken within the local context, • Best practices noted in cyber security strategies within the European Union and worldwide, • EU legal requirements and direction. The measures outlined do not exclude action that may need to be taken with respect to specific EU legal requirements7. • Relevant action items within Digital Malta and other local strategies such as e-Commerce Malta.8 MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 17 Part Three The Strategy 1. Goal: Establish a governance framework The governance framework covers the necessary key functions and corresponding roles and responsibilities, as well as policies and processes necessary9 to constitute a robust foundation for an effective national cyber security strategy. i. Establish the necessary key coordination structures It is envisaged that the following functions (involving multiple stakeholders) shall be required to ensure sustainability of the National Cyber Security Strategy: a. At the strategic level: i. A function for the articulation and periodic review of the National Cyber Security Strategy. The creation of this function is required in the short term. This body would need to work in close cooperation with the strategy implementation function(s) referred to below ii. A strategy implementation function to oversee implementation of the strategy and monitor cyber security operations. Such function needs to have the necessary funding, resources and mandate to: • take a leading, active role in the implementation of the National Cyber security strategy, keeping in view of policy and planning developments within the realm of Malta’s digital economy and society as well as further cyber security related developments on a national, EU and international perspective • ensure security preparedness of the public and private sector of their ICT, in line with established security requirements. This implies driving for effective engagement and ongoing high level coordination across Malta’s public and private sector. b. At the operational level, function(s) for the national coordination of cyber detection and response. Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) tend to be of such technical and operational nature. This entails ensuring consolidation of a top level National CSIRT10. It also implies close communication and coordination of the CSIRT with the proposed strategy implementation function, given that it would need to be involved on: • Real-time information sharing and response to calls • Longer term planning11. Communication and coordination, as the need arises, with other CSIRTS existing in Malta would also be necessary. The structure12 and responsibilities of these functions is subject to further reference and alignment to the relevant European Union legal requirements13 as well as to further consultation. ii. Foster the coordination to protect national critical information infrastructure Measures of preparedness, response and recovery, including cooperation and ongoing coordination mechanisms are particularly necessary to protect national critical information infrastructure. It is thus necessary to ensure that such national coordination between all stakeholders concerned14 is fostered. iii. Ensure clear delineation and communication of roles and responsibilities Cyber related roles and responsibilities - such as those identified above and potentially those arising from the proposed measures, as well as those resulting from relevant EU legal requirements15, need to be clearly delineated and agreed upon accordingly. Communication of their establishment further ensures the effective coordination that may be necessary between the effected stakeholders themselves. iv. Ensure the conduct of a national cyber risk assessment exercise A National Cyber Risk Assessment exercise shall need to identify the major national cyber threats and risks, assess respective impacts and MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 18 suggest risk mitigation and management strategies accordingly. The exercise entails participation and coordination between all stakeholders involved16 and it needs to be updated on a regular basis, so as to ensure its currency with: • The cyber threat landscape • Evolution in the adoption of existing and emerging ICT. One key deliverable of the National Cyber Risk Assessment is a strategic plan that includes cooperation and communication processes needed to ensure prevention, detection, response, repair and recovery (including communication), that are modulated according to the alert level are to be ensured. Such processes also refer to national incident cyber handling procedures and business continuity plans to ensure resilience. Furthermore, it is understood that such processes need to be subject to a schedule of regular testing and validation exercises17, with the resulting outcome (including lessons learnt) used as a basis for any related updates. v. Ensure necessary measures in line with individual cyber risks assessments by key Public and Private sector organisations falling within the scope of related EU legal requirements The conduct of a National Cyber Risk Assessment does not exclude the conduct of individual cyber risk assessments particularly by the public and private sector organisations falling within the scope of related EU legal requirements on network and information security18. Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and other Directives coming into force by June 2018 across the EU, also call for all organisations to ensure regular risk assessments by organisations to understand the degree of threat imposed on them when processing personal data. The legislation demands a risk-based approach with the development of appropriate controls. vi. Encourage cyber risk assessments by other organisations not falling within the scope of Measure 1 (v) The emphasis on individual risk assessment made to specific organisations with respect to network and information security, in Measure 1 (v) should not however construe that other organisations need not adopt similar activities. Indeed, data protection legislation, also referred to in Measure 1 (v) is applicable to all organisations processing personal data. An assessment of financial risks related to cyber- related incidents could possibly also indicate a market in cyber insurance, which may in turn contribute to information sharing among its participants, apart from availability of financial coverage to mitigate consequential losses. Ultimately, however, it needs to be borne in mind that cyber insurance coverage alone is not a panacea to cyber security threats. It needs to be carried out with in conjunction with consideration and applicability of cyber security measures in line with the risks assessed. vii. Consolidate the Information Security Framework within the Public Sector The Government of Malta Information Security Policy is expected to come into force in the near future. It is based upon ISO 27001 Information Security international standard and applies to all of the Public Sector. viii. Ensure classification of data within the Public Sector and encourage it within the private sector The classification of electronic data within the Public Sector and the application of security controls commensurate to the security marking assigned is one area, among others, referred to Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 19 within the Information Security Policy, referred to in Measure 1 (vii). This aspect is a critical initial step in ensuring effective cyber security, also keeping in view of the inherent sensitivity of data dealt within the sector. Nonetheless, the classification of data as one of the primary tasks to be undertaken by any organisation (public sector or otherwise) is one of the key awareness targets that needs to be taken into account. 2. Goal: Combat Cybercrime i. Establish Forum for Internet Safety and Protection of Minors This measure is referred to in Digital Malta, and it proposes a number of relevant public sector stakeholders and industry representatives as the Forum’s members. The Forum aims to: • Share knowledge • Monitor developments • Put forward policy ideas • Represent Malta on European bodies working in this field This Forum could potentially help out in reviewing the Cyber security strategy itself with respect to combating cybercrime activity. ii. Identify gaps and strengthen capability to investigate and combat cybercrime A regular assessment of present state cybercrime capability in Malta among all relevant law enforcement, investigative and judicial roles and any related action necessary is indeed a prerequisite in the light of the continuously evolving threat vector landscape. Internal security is crucial. Yet, it also needs to be borne in mind that threats to EU citizens are increasingly cross border and varied in nature. EU Member states, including Malta, can thus no longer succeed on their own. The European Agenda on Security – the EU’s strategy to tackle security threats in the EU for period 2015-202019 is intended to contribute in this respect. Cybercrime is one of the Agenda’s priorities for the years 2015-2020. The Agenda aims to strengthen and make more effective the exchange of information and operational cooperation between Member states, EU Agencies and the critical information infrastructure sector; by aiming to: • Reinforce the capacity of law enforcement authorities in Member states, in particular through the Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre “ Internal security is crucial. Yet, it also needs to be borne in mind that threats to EU citizens are increasingly cross border and varied in nature. EU Member states, including Malta, can thus no longer succeed on their own. ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 20 • Address obstacles to criminal investigations on cybercrime, notably with respect to access to evidence • Prioritise the implementation of existing legislation on attacks against information systems and on combating child abuse. iii. Assess and consolidate on-line reporting of cybercrime The on-line mechanism is needed to report illicit online activity for the required action to be taken as well as to determine the extent of cybercrime. It entails: • The ability to track cybercrime at a national level • Ensuring further nation-wide related awareness, especially among citizens and small businesses. It is also recommended to ensure that a strategic approach on the applicability of online services related to cybercrime handling is taken, so as to enhance effectiveness, whilst maximising the use of resources. Additionally, the ability to handle cases related to cyber bullying (or any other form of cyber abuse) also needs to be ensured among online support personnel handling services pertaining to abuse. 3. Goal: Strenghten National cyber defence i. Establish a collective approach for sharing cyber security knowledge and intelligence A collective approach, involving both the public and private sector, potentially facilitated through the use of ICT is needed to: • Allow participants from across sectors and organisations to exchange information on cyber threats and to mutually strengthen response to cyber threats, vulnerabilities and incidents securely, efficiently and effectively20, whilst operating within a framework that protects the confidentiality of the shared information.21 It may also allow for intra-business sect oral communication, particularly in areas where particular information may be deemed as of a highly sensitive nature to be shared with all participants • Analyse new trends and identify opportunities and emerging threats • Work to strengthen cyber security • Provide framework for sharing best practice22 • Potentially improve professionalism in information assurance and cyber defence across the private and public sector through schemes for certifying related competence and specialist training. ii. Review existing legislation and provide measures through legislation and regulation to ensure relevance and effectiveness to the cyber world This measure builds upon two objectives of Digital Malta, as follows: • Objective 43 – review existing legislation to ensure relevance and effectiveness in the cyber world’ • Objective 44 – provide measures to maintain privacy, safety and security while surfing, transacting and operating on-line. Legislation will address several matters such as safeguarding intellectual property rights, patents, sensitive and personal information, cloud computing and Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 21 data ownership, contentious content, net neutrality, vendor lock-in and exit management strategies; online contracts and license agreements. The measure is also highly relevant taking into consideration: • The requirements arising from the European Agenda on Security, referred to in Measure 2.2. • Action 38 – Digital Single Market – of Digital Malta, which states Government’s intention to maximise the benefits and opportunities deriving from legislation adopted within the EU such as those related to data protection, electronic identification and trust, etc • Relevant EU Directive and regulation , notably among others, recent EU data protection legislation and legal requirements pertaining to Network and Information Security Within this light, the notion of having one national legislation for cyber security, merits active consideration. It is understood that its effectiveness would need to be backed by: • Prior multi-displinary wide national consultation • Consideration and alignment to existing national and EU legal requirements covering aspects of cyber security24 • A balance between incentives and sanctions • Promotion of related awareness and cooperation with the various stakeholders involved in working towards cyber resilience. The legislation may be positioned in a way so as to allow sectors (regulated or otherwise) to adopt any further measures as necessary. iii. Ensure the country’s digital resilience to cyber attack as well as the capability to protect its interests As an independent sovereign state and as a member of the United Nations (UN), Malta has the right to defend its own territory and its infrastructure from acts of aggression from other states25. Cyber-space is no exception and Malta has the right and obligation to defend its cyber-space territory to ensure that the security of the nation is maintained.Such measure entails ensuring that the following are addressed: • Cyber-space defences • Structures to counter terrorist attacks • Ability and capacity to detect threats in cyber- space • Capability to disrupt attacks on the country from cyber-space • Active consideration of direction being taken at EU level on areas such as cyber diplomacy26 and on ways to counter hybrid threats27. iv. Conduct national cyber simulation exercises Cyber simulation exercises are to be scheduled and conducted from time to time, at a national level. Such measure contributes to the need to review the ability to anticipate, prepare for, identify and attribute, combat hostile cyberspace acts. Apart from technical considerations, cyber simulation exercises should also assess non-technical areas both at an operational, tactical as well as at a strategic level such as testing national and international coordination and any relevant Standard Operational Practices. The participation of key public and private sector stakeholders28 in such exercises is crucial. The participation of other organisations is also encouraged. “ Malta has the right and obligation to defend its cyber-space territory to ensure that the security of the nation is maintained. ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 22 4. Goal: Secure Cyberspace i. Establish regulation and voluntary self- commitment for guaranteeing cyber security The current scenario analysis of cyber security in Malta indicates areas of regulation and policy particularly within the local regulated industry sectors. Focus appears to be mainly on policy frameworks covering the licensing approaches which seek to mitigate risk. Whilst legislation may help, Maltese regulatory authorities may also need to address further emerging technology such as cloud computing applicability, through regulation within their respective sectors. The formulation of regulation pertaining to cyber security would need to take into consideration, among others, the latest EU data protection legislation29 as well as of legal requirements pertaining to network and information security, where applicable. Regulation within sectors may also include conformance to internationally recognised security standards or industry led cyber security related standards or practices, with the aim of bolstering cyber security as well as establishing centres of excellence within the sectors themselves. Such alignment may also call for particular consideration, in terms of support, to organisations having limited or constrained resources (including human and financial). On the other hand, it is understood that legislation and regulation cannot necessarily cover all aspects of cyber security; particularly considering potential financial and human resource constraints for robust cyber security. Voluntary self commitment is, thus, also key to cyber security. The notion of the applicability of a European security trust mark, applied also in a number of EU states 31may encourage voluntary self commitment and may therefore be one item to explore the possibility of its use locally. Local national strategy may already serve as a potential opportunity for further consideration in fostering self commitment, such as: • e-Commerce Malta which highlights three pillars as its basis: i. Engendering trust in ecommerce ii. Transforming micro-enterprises iii. Taking Small to Medium sized Enterprises and industry to the next level; which specifically also refers to an audit-kit – through a Specialist advisory service (Measure 2) and the European trust-mark (Measure 9) • Digital Malta which refers to the Forum for the transformation of industries through ICT that aims to raise awareness about how ICT can help industries transform themselves and to discuss items such as self-regulation. Other potential opportunities which may be explored include financial incentives, such as in the form of grant schemes, as a means to entice the applicability of necessary cyber security related measures. ii. Stimulate use of interoperable and secure standards on the basis of good practice Digital Malta, through Action 42 – Standards and Good Practice, states Government’s intention to collaborate with stakeholders to support and promote “ Interoperability is one means of broadening and strenghtening collaboration, establishing intelligence and improving situational awareness, all of which are essential for effective cyber security. ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 23 National and EU cross-border interoperability, ICT standards based on industry best practices and Green ICT. Interoperability is one means of broadening and strenghtening collaboration, establishing intelligence and improving situational awareness32, all of which are essential for effective cyber security33. With respect to the notion of nationally and EU recognised interoperability, which also effectively promotes the use of safe secure standards, Digital Malta states as one of its objectives, Government’s commitment to revise and revamp the current National Interoperability Framework including related policies34. The implementation of internationally recognised information security standard35 controls within the public sector36 and potentially within the private sector should contribute to cyber security on the local scenario. The applicability of such controls may serve as a good initial basis. However consideration of industry led standards and guidance that put in place a series of measures specifically aimed to address cyber threats37 are also to be encouraged for use. This could form an integral part of what is proposed in Measure 4 (i). In particular, special consideration needs to be given by operators and users of emerging technologies. In such areas, related standards and security controls, may still be in the very early stages of maturity and may thus pose cyber security vulnerability challenges for interoperability which need to be carefully assessed. iii. Promote robust levels of cyber security in online public services Such measure may alleviate concerns expressed within Euro barometer findings with respect to Maltese accessing online services38. The applicability of interoperable and secure standards, as referred to in Measure 4 (ii), may potentially contribute for the attainment of such measure.It also calls for an emphasis to ensure security and privacy in the design of ICT products and services for Government as well as in other areas of application. Additionally, the use of cloud computing services within the public sector needs to be seen to in the light of EU legal requirements pertaining to security of network and information systems39 as well as those pertaining to the Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and other Directives. iv. Consolidate support to the private sector on cyber security Measure 4 (i) outlines how cyber security can be facilitated in the private sector. Apart from potential public sector driven incentives, private sector participation in awareness and advice programmes as well as cyber related exercises to specific sectors may additionally help. For example, ways may potentially be sought with business service providers (e.g. lawyers, insurers) of how they can potentially develop services to incentivise and help businesses manage and reduce risks40. “ A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Unfortunately, within the realm of cyber security, weakest link could, more often than not, be traced to the human factor. The behavioural and educational aspect of cyber security cannot thus be discounted. ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 24 5. Goal: Cyber security Awareness and Education i. Encourage cyber security education and training A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Unfortunately, within the realm of cyber security, weakest link could, more often than not, be traced to the human factor. The behavioural and educational aspect of cyber security cannot thus be discounted. It is therefore of tantamount importance to ensure a rigorous and ongoing educational and training exercise that targets both the current workforce as well as the younger student generation This measure thus primarily entials: • Further recognition of the need for cyber security skills and competencies • Academic and training programmes designed to consolidate cyber security expertise • The review of existing curricula that focusses on cyber security along with ICT and media competencies. Action 60 - Building national capacity in specialist skill sets - of Digital Malta states Government’s commitment, through educational institutions and industry to support the creation of specialist educational pathways, addressing labour market requirements and to develop the curriculum and provide technical materials. Cyber security expertise also needs to be seen within the context of such initiative. Specialist cyber-security related education and training is to be actively considered in areas such as those related to cybercrime41. Cyber security related training and certification programmes are to be further encouraged, as an opportunity to effectively increase security level42 of organisations and maintaining such increased level of security in the long term. Prior and post assessment of such programmes may serve as one way of ensuring their effectiveness. However, consideration should also be taken that such programmes may not necessarily focus only on traditional modes of education but also on experimentation of innovative ways of their conduct43. From a younger generation perspective, Action 2 - Empowering the young through a safer Internet - of Digital Malta states that “Digital Citizenship will become part of the National Education Curriculum, to equip children and youths with the abilities to interact and use the Internet safely and intelligently. Parents and carers will be involved together with educators and youth workers. This action will stimulate the production of creative online content, empower the younger generation and help create a safer environment. With the support of competent authorities this measure will help combat cyber child abuse and exploitation”. Within the current cyber security scenario, there appear to be related awareness campaigns, as well as curricular–related plans and developments in schools. The imparting of cyber security awareness in schools in particular calls for its sustainability in the long term, also keeping in view of related European Union direction to Member States with respect to teaching online safety in schools44. It also calls for consideration of a holistic perspective in the process, such as through: • A focus on basic cyber hygiene45 and protection of personal data • A sound understanding by students of the concepts behind Information and Communication technologies being used and their potential vulnerabilities and risks, apart from the opportunities that they offer46. This includes the proper handling and use of the technologies being applied for interaction • Ensuring cyber related training for all teachers • Ensuring effective engagement, participation and support of all school management on cyber security education and awareness • Seeking further ways to enage parents/ guardians of students in learning on cyber security related matters Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 25 • Ensuring the necessary legal safeguards to protect both the student as well as the teaching profession on cyber related challenges such as cyber bullying. Curricular developments and academic programmes aimed at establishing a cyber security focus47 is to be further encouraged, seeking further creative ways of instilling such education48 in the process. ii. Explore possibility of establishing a Cyber Centre of Excellence The establishment of a cyber centre of excellence may serve as: • A form of implementation of Action 60 – Building national capacity in specialist skill sets of Digital Malta , refered to in the previous measure • A training base for cyber security expertise. • Having a maintained comprehensive list of professionals certified under internationally recognised certification programs in cyber security49 • A source of promotion of related best practice • A means of proposing legislative or regulatory updates, based on relevant research or lessons learnt • A potential agent for future economic growth in Malta within the cyber security domain • A complementary mechanism to a collective approach for sharing cyber security knowledge and intelligence, proposed as Measure 3 (i). The establishment could potentially be enabled through: • Agreement of overseas cooperation on related matters • Related EU supporting initiatives • Inclusion of existing internationally certified local expertise in cyber security. iii. Ensure relevant education and training to public sector staff and other stakeholders50 Training and education on cyber security is one key priority within the public sector, especially given the sector’s wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data, compared to other sectors. In any office environment it needs to be kept in view, that technology controls are not sufficient to protect data from related cyber security threats. The controls need to go hand in hand with human resource, awareness and employee guidance programs51. The development of cyber security expertise within the public sector is another key area that merits particular attention. In the process, it also needs to be ensured that a comprehensive list of public sector professionals certified under internationally recognised certification programs in cyber security is established and maintained52. Furthermore, it needs to be ensured that ICT personnel are trained so as to enable them to recognise cyber incidents, to detect anomalies in their ICT systems and to respond and to report them accordingly. iv. Foster application of research and development on cyber security Such measure aims to ensure cyber security as among key research priorities. It effectively calls for encouragement and support for research in any “ It is highly recommended that a concerted, ongoing strategic approach is undertaken, potentially through a nationwide Communications strategy for cyber security; aimed at addressing the various strata of society, business and public sector along with their corresponding needs, expectations, and potential ICTs and concepts applied ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 26 national and EU research projects and initiatives on cyber security. Essentially, it entails participation not only from Government but also from the private sector and the academia. v. A Strategic, target-oriented national awareness and advice campaign It is highly recommended that a concerted, ongoing strategic approach is undertaken, potentially through a nationwide Communications strategy for cyber security53; aimed at addressing the various strata of society, business and public sector along with their corresponding needs, expectations, and potential ICTs and concepts applied54. Such an approach may ensure: • Avoiding piecemeal, potentially one-off approaches to awareness campaigns • No duplication of effort • Maximisation of cyber security related financial and human resources • Identification and engagement of all potential sources of dissemination of the awareness campaigns • Imparting effective awareness and knowledge on cyber security patterns and measures that is commensurate to the specific target audience and to the medium used55 • A measure of the extent of national awareness and understanding of cyber security over time • That cyber security is not simply a concern of ICT professionals. Ultimately, the key factors that need to be borne in mind in the establishment of such campaign is: • Finding the right way to raise awareness, keeping in view of the target audience • Ensuring motivation to learn and pay particular attention to various signals of fake communications on a day to day basis (particularly to counter social engineering threats) • Ingraining a culture of cyber security awareness on the potential misuse, vulnerabilities and risks potentially arising from the ICTs and concepts applied (particularly those emerging); whilst embracing the opportunities arising from their use • Imparting the key message that it is ultimately in everyone’s interest and responsibility to take the necessary relevant cyber security safeguards; keeping in view of the inherent inter- connectedness of individuals and organisations alike in cyber-space. Most measures highlighted within Goals 4 and 5 of this strategy as well as any established national way of sharing related knowledge, experience and insight as referred to in Measure 3 (i)56 may potentially serve as key sources for the establishment and maintenance of such a concerted strategic campaign. vi. Encourage ‘cyber hygiene’ and personal responsibility Ultimately, citizens are expected to apply at least some form of basic ‘cyber hygiene’ in using ICT, such as through careful disposition and use of personal information on-line, installing software updates and anti-virus software, using basic security controls such as strong passwords and, as much as possible, seeking to be more wary of any suspicious activity related to their personal on-line accounts. The national awareness campaign, as highlighted in Measure 5 (v), should help in reaching this objective. Furthermore, the possibility of a national responsible disclosure policy framework that enables well- intentioned system users to safely inform Government, businesses or institutions about detected vulnerabilities in their ICT systems or services may also be explored. The framework would need to establish the right parameters and conditions so as to ensure its effectiveness57. Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 27 6. Goal: National and International Cooperation i. Effective cooperation and collaboration on cyber security on a national, European and global basis On a national level, most of the measures highlighted earlier essentially call for national cooperation and coordination. Malta is no island in cyberspace. Hence, cooperation and collaboration on cyber security needs to be sustained both locally as well as on a European and on a global level. A co-ordinated approach, among all local key stakeholders in cyber security interacting locally and overseas needs to be ensured so as to ensure synergy of national and international effort, knowledge and expertise within the domain. Thus, active consideration needs to be given to: • Cyber related activities, such as those conducted by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which may potentially involve both local public as well as private sector organisations • EU legal requirements such as those pertaining to network and information security58 which, among others, calls for a body responsible for coordinating NIS issues and for acting as a single point of contact for cross-border cooperation and communication at EU level, within each Member State • Activities such as those undertaken by the Council of the European Union on cyber- diplomacy59 which aim to foster increased global cyber capacity building, as well as international cooperation and judicial capacity on cybercrime • Confidence Building Measures (CBMS) proposed by the Permanent Council of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which propose, among others, measures of mutual communication, dialogue and collaboration on the security and use of Information and Communication Technologies within and across OSCE participating states of the related Permanent Council Decision60 • Any other cyber security related initiatives on a European Union and/or on a wider international context. Ultimately, it needs to be borne in mind that mutual cooperation, openness and understanding is the success to effective cyber security61. “ Ultimately, it needs to be borne in mind that mutual cooperation, openness and understanding is the success to effective cyber security ” Part Three The Strategy MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 28 10.

It is the beginning of a continuum, starting with implementation that is in line with: • Increased awareness and recognition on a national scale of the importance to tackle cyber security in a comprehensive and systemic manner • Related ICT, legislative, regulatory, social and economic updates on a national scenario • Rapid developments within the cyber threat landcape. The implementation of the Strategy is expected to involve multiple stakeholders within the public and the private sector as well as cooperation and coordination with civil society. It is expected to be evaluated on a periodic basis, based upon the progress registered from such implementation, along with related directional developments on a national and European Union front. The evaluation is expected to lead to maintenance and updates of the Strategy, leading to a subsequent new version, reflecting the maturity undertaken in cyber security on a national scale since its initial launch.

Areas that could potentially be looked into may include risk assessment and apportioning security practices to risk levels, information security planning, processes, roles and assesments of preparedness. 24. Reference is made in particular to Note 1. 25. Article 2(4) of the UN states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nation”. This Article prohibits any state from attacking another state however in Article 51 of the same charter states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” 26.

The preparation for the GDPR calls for a review and assessment of number of organisational, procedural, communication steps that need to be undertaken to ensure conformance. 30. The latter aim may serve as good business opportunity, especially for export-oriented sectors, to strenghten their market share overseas. 31. For example Austria and the UK 32. One of the action items of the EU Cyber Security Strategy specifically calls for work on further development of globally interoperable standards and their promotion for their wider use by industry. Reference is made to EU Cyber Security Strategy: Roadmap Development – Council of the EU, Brussels, 7/10/2015. 33. This may imply, amongst others, the improvement of interoperability of national and international systems. Reference is made to measure 5 as part of law enforcement legislation and policy related implementation of the Information Management Strategy (Working Party on Information Exchange and Data Protection – Council of the EU) 34. Public consultation preliminary results on information and communication technologies published by the European Commission in early 2016, reveals cyber security as being one of the areas requiring common standards if completion of a single digital market is to be achieved. 35. Such as ISO 27001 36. Reference is made to Measure 1.7 37. Such as the UK’s Cyber Essentials Scheme, 38. The overall confidence to use the Internet for online services (e.g. banking, public services) has decreased from 74% in 2012 to 73% to 2013 across the EU. A proportional increase is noted in 2014 in the level of concern expressed by EU respondents in having access to online services, through the Internet, as a result of cyber attacks. In Malta’s case, the findings indicate an increase from 44% in 2013 to 61% in 2014. This could be potentially attributed to an increase in the proportion of the Maltese respondents, from 7% in 2013 to 10% in 2014 who complain of related incidents. 39. Reference is particularly made to the NIS Directive, referred to in Note 1. 40. Potential areas that can be seen to also relate to cyber insurance, due diligence to third party with which businesses may seek strategic relationships,etc 41. Including in roles such as those pertaing to law enforcement, prosecution services, the judiciary. 42. Including educating staff to understand what is harmful to an organisation and what can be done to prevent mistakes which may lead to data breaches. 43. For example apart from use of visual methods, rewards, social engagement and direct feedback during everyday working life; gamification may present one promising method. (Purcelli, op. cit, p.27). Other possiblities include cybercrime simulation workshops as another complementary means to induce awareness on the various forms of cybercrime, who is the likely target, what needs to be done to avoid falling a victim, and what action needs to be taken and to whom to refer to, in case of fallling a victim. 44. Reference is made to the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children - Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Brussels 2.2.2013, COM (2012) 196 final. 45. Such as effective password management 46. The increased focus on environmental concerns and measures within schools in recent years may serve as a potential model for a heightened awareness on cyber security and safety concerns and measures amongst the younger generation, which may in turn expand further within their home environments. 47. With special reference to secondary and tertiary level education 48. Such as through special events, apart from teaching through games, particularly to the younger generation. Estonia for example organises ‘Cyber olympics’ and specialised summer schools 49. A measure that is particularly required within the public sector as a domain having a wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data, relative to other sectors 50. In particular, CII operators, CI operators, Digital Service providers and other potential stakeholders 51. Puricelli, op.cit. This may be complemented by related policies, best practices and processes (including those on proper data handling) applied within the context itself. 52. So as to augment and enhance needed cyber security knowledge and expertise within the sector 53. A similar approach has been taken by the Netherlands and Austria MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016 36 54. For example, it may be appropriate to focus, among others, on cyber security related concerns and measures that may be taken in the applicability of cloud computing or mobile computing within office environments. 55. For example social media, TV, radio, etc 56. Apart from regular Euro barometer surveys dealing with cyber security which provide a significant insight on cyber security experiences and concerns on a domestic level. 57. Such policy is currently mainly applied by a number of organisations – European and worldwide, and also by some EU member states such as the Netherlands. Such framework could be enabled through self-regulation, promotion and encouragement by government as well as the proper framework to ensure responsible vulnerability disclosure. 58. Reference is made to the Network and Information Security - NIS - Directive 59. Reference is made to the Council Conclusions on Cyber Diplomacy (2015) and to the Global Conference on Cyberspace (2015) 60. Permanent Council Decision No. 1039 (26 April 2012) , whereby OSCE participating States, “decided to step up individual and collective efforts to address security of and in the use of ICTs in a comprehensive and cross-dimensional manner in accordance with OSCE commitments and cooperation with relevant international organisations”. This led to the adoption of a number of Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) through Permanent Council Decision 1106 on December 3, 2013, followed by additional, complementary CBMs adopted through Permanent Council Decision No. 1202 on March 10, 2016. 61. It needs to be seen within a ‘win-win’ perspective including in those areas where business related competition plays a key role. ENDNOTES",

It is an increasingly essential means for the private  sector to compete and prosper, through its ability  to connect to the local markets as well as to those  beyond our shores, efficiently and cost effectively.  Competitiveness in a digital economy however calls  for resilience to the security challenges posed within  the realm of cyber-space - ICT and its constituent  elements and its dependents.   This Strategy aims to establish the foundations to  ensure effective cyber security within Government,  the private sector and civil society. It does not  simply entail technology security controls but  involves measures related to regulation, legislation,  awareness, education, expertise and foreign affairs.  Striving for cyber security is a continuous journey.  Cyber security can never be fully attained, considering  that the technology itself, the day to day realities in  technology adoption as well as the modes of cyber  attack are in a continuous state of evolution. Hence  the Strategy is not seen as cast in stone, but it shall  need to evolve, in line with a national commitment  and collective effort to adopt a cyber security culture.   Embracing security as a normal way of everyone’s  cyber lives is in the common interest. Ultimately,  cyber security needs to be seen as a key cornerstone  to Malta’s competitiveness within the digital world  by positioning it as a secure online jurisdiction  and potentially presenting opportunities for the  development of centres of excellence in a number of  local business sectors interacting within the realm of  cyberspace.   Hon Dr. Emmanuel Mallia Minister for Competitiveness and Digital, Maritime and Services Economy     MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  4  Executive Summary  Cyber-space is far from perfect. It is at risk of  vulnerabilities, some of which involve genuine human  error, whilst others are exposed to malicious intent.  Furthermore, global innovations within its realm are  even faster than the ability to secure it. Hence the  need for cyber security, that is, ensuring the safety,  confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyber- space.   Launching cyber security on a national scale,  essentially calls for a planned, collective and systemic  approach, thus leading to the need of a National  Cyber Security Strategy. Digital Malta – the National  Digital Strategy for Malta for the period 2014-2020 -  recognises and proposes the fulfilment of such need,  in the light of Malta’s increased dependence upon  cyber-space in its day to day interactivity, within and  beyond its shores. Indeed, in 2015, the European  Commission’s e-Government Benchmark Report  re-confirmed Malta as the leader in the delivery and  performance of e-Government services amongst  thirty-three countries.   Malta is addressing such a need. A Green Paper for  a National Cyber Security Strategy was launched in  October 2015, as a basis for consultation. The Green  Paper presented a high level, strategic approach  for cyber security on a national scale. It intended  to inculcate an awareness of cyber security, its  extent and its implications of which Malta, as an  integral part of cyber-space, needs to consider. The  National Cyber Security Strategy being launched is  a consolidation of the proposals presented by the  Green Paper following online feedback and a number  of consultation sessions held.  The National Cyber Security Strategy recognises that  tackling cyber security entails the need to:   • Safeguard the rule of law in line with Malta’s          Constitution and Malta’s role as a European      Union Member State  • Adopt a multi-disciplinary approach  • Ensure that all stakeholders of cyber-space;         government, private sector, and civil society           understand their shared responsibility and          thus commitment to collaboration and    cooperation, to ensure a safe, stable and secure    environment  • Adopt a risk based approach, based upon the    premise that it is impossible to guarantee           immunity from any cyber attack.  All of the above constitute the fundamental principles  upon which the overall vision is based. In essence,  the Vision covers the need and expectations of three  key national stakeholders – the public sector, the  private sector and civil society to ensure cyber  security. Five dimensions enable articulation of the  vision into the strategy. They are Policy, Legislation,  Risk Management, Awareness and Education upon  which the subsequent proposed strategy is based.   Prior to proposing the strategy however, research  and assessments have been made so as to enable a  high level pragmatic approach towards cyber security  within the local context. The ensuing strategic  direction within the Green Paper is proposed to be  attained by six goals, each of which carries a number  of proposed measures, as follows:  1.   Goal: Establish a Governance Framework        that is based upon the premise that a cyber    security strategy needs to be established,           and more importantly, be effectively implemented       and maintained on a continuous basis. Hence                  the need to ensure the key coordination structures,      processes, roles and practice with particular      focus on cyber risk management within the          public and private sector.  2.    Goal: Combat Cybercrime           which aims to ensure and consolidate capabilities        to tackle cybercrime.  3.   Goal: Strengthen National Cyber Defence  which aims to foster sharing of cyber security  knowledge and intelligence, review current  legislation and regulations in line with cyber- space developments and ensure digital  resilience on a national and organisation wide     MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  5  scale of particular consideration are recent legal  developments at EU level, notably legislation  pertaining to data protection and that related to  Network and Information Security.  4.  Goal: Secure cyber-space which aims to foster self regulation and  voluntary self commitment, bearing in mind that  legislation is not a panacea to cyber security  commitments. It also aims to stimulate use of  standards and best practices that guarantee  security whilst allowing for interoperability.  Special focus is also given to promote security  and trust of online public services and to  consolidate support to the private sector.   5. Goal: Cyber security Awareness and    Education  which aims to target academia, the public  and private sector and citizens as a means to  sensitize awareness, knowledge as well as  capabilities and expertise in cyber security.  A national strategic approach towards an  ongoing educational and awareness campaign  is especially recommended.  6.  Goal: National and International Cooperation  which aims to ensure effective consultation,  cooperation and collaboration on a national  level, on a European and on a global basis,  enabled by EU and international institutions  and activities, based on the understanding that  cyber security has no bounds.  All six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes  expected of the Strategy, namely those of:  • Defending and protecting the national  information infrastructure from cyber threats. • Ensuring the security, safety and protection  of users of cyber-space.  The proposed strategic approach is by no means  the end in itself. It is understood that the launch  of the Strategy is only the start of a continuous  process that calls for its implementation, evaluation  and maintenance so as to ensure its currency and  effectiveness in line with:   “ Launching cyber  security on a national  scale, essentially calls for  a planned, collective and  systemic approach, thus  leading to the need of a  National Cyber Security  Strategy. ”   • Increased recognition on a nation-wide scale of  the importance to adopt cyber security measures  in day to day corporate and individual activities  • Evolving maturity of overall cyber security  capability   • Technological developments and applicability,  along with related cyber security challenges  • Evolution in cybercrime behaviour  • Developments on a national scale, in line with  European Union direction on cyber security to its  Member States of which Malta forms part.  Hence, the Strategy would be expected to be  periodically reviewed and updated. Ultimately, the  Strategy is understood as a means for national cyber  security investment that indicates Malta as a :  • Secure online jurisdiction  • Centre of excellence in various business sectors          interacting within cyber-space.    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  6    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  7  Part One  Introduction    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  8  1. BACKGROUND  Up to a few decades ago, a country’s security interests  focussed on protecting its borders, its waters and its  airspace. Today, cyber-space forms an integral part  of a country’s day to day reality.   Information and Communications Technology (ICT)  leads the way in interaction within and outside of a  country’s territory and its disruption may potentially  affect life. Hence, cyber-space cannot be left out of a  country’s span of protection.  Malta is no island within the realm of cyber-space!  Cyber-space knows no boundaries. It transcends  national borders, promoting online opportunities of  dialogue, mutual cooperation and understanding  beyond our shores. However, the cyber world makes  no distinction between its users of good intent or not.   Therefore, as opportunities are limitless, so are cyber  threats. Such malicious attempts in cyber-space  may be launched anywhere, in any vulnerable area  of a digital network, instantaneously leaving no time  for an appropriate response and with very minimal  traceability or detection of its perpetrator.   Ultimately, cyber-space is man-made and like  anything else of its sort, it is never perfect. The rapid  advances of technology itself and the opportunities  that arise from it do not allow it either. Indeed the  innovations in technology and its adoption are even  faster than the ability to secure it.  Malta’s security of cyber-space ultimately calls for  a planned, collective and systemic approach that  respects fundamental rights and freedoms whilst  ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability  of cyberspace on a day-to-day basis. Such is the  intention of Digital Malta – the National Digital  Strategy for the period 2014 till 2020 – which  identifies a National Cyber Security Strategy as one  of its required actions.  Part One Introduction  “ Everyone is affected by  cyber issues and everyone  needs mutual assistance.  It is therefore in everyone’s  interest and responsibility  to ensure a secure and safe  cyber-space for all. ”   2.  PURPOSE AND SCOPE  This Strategy intends to set an overall high level  direction in cyber security across all strata of the  Maltese economy and society. As a first issue, it  also intends to consolidate a recognition of the need  for a planned and concerted effort by the various  stakeholders involved so as to protect Malta and its  interests.  This Strategy should translate into timely, specific  and actionable measures that set the foundations  for a national cyber security framework that shall  need to be implemented, maintained and updated  so as to ensure currency and relevance in a highly  challenging, dynamic and complex environment as  that posed by cyber-space.  Through its various goals and corresponding  measures, the National Cyber Security Strategy aims  to:  • Position cyber security as a national investment,  that gives an indication beyond Malta’s shores  of the country’s commitment to a secure cyber-  space for online transaction and interaction  • Convey the key message that cyber security  cannot be achieved in isolation. It does not     MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  9  simply fall within the domain of Information  and Communications Technology experts and  practitioners. Everyone is affected by cyber  issues and everyone needs mutual assistance.  It is therefore in everyone’s interest and  responsibility to ensure a secure and safe cyber- space for all.   The National Cyber Security Strategy, above all, aims  to align itself within the scope of:  • Specific EU legal requirements1. Reference  to such legal requirements, however, does not  preclude the need to refer to the specific legal  requirements for further direction.   •  Digital Malta and other local strategy documents  such as e-Commerce Malta - the National  e-commerce Strategy (2014-2020) - published  by the Malta Communications Authority2.  3. THE PRE-LAUNCH OF  THE STRATEGY  On 30th October 2015, the Minister for the Economy,  Investment and Small Business launched a Green  Paper for a National Cyber Security Strategy. The  Green Paper followed extensive research based  upon various published sources to assess cyber  security from:  (i) A global and from a European Union  perspective, based on the understanding that  the interconnectedness in cyberspace renders  any challenge in cyber security as potentially  impacting any country applying Information and   Communications Technology, including Malta.  (ii)     A domestic perspective, particularly with respect  to:   • Experiences and concerns expressed by  Maltese participants in annual Euro Barometer  surveys specialising in cyber security  • Malta’s current official position in particular  aspects of cyber security  Part One Introduction  (iii) A multi-stakeholder perspective, based on the  understanding that apart from technology, cyber  security impacts upon all of country’s political, legal,  economic and social well being.  The Green Paper set the basis for consultation  through:  1. Online feedback using http://mita.gov.mt/ncss    and http://www.konsultazzjoni.gov.mt that    lasted till 14 February 2016  2. A series of consultation events, which were held    between March and June 2016 and which    targeted a number of social and economic    sectors, namely:  • Economy and Finance • Education and National Awareness • Justice and Legislation • Infrastructure and Health • National Security • The Public  The consultative process led to relevant updates to  the proposals made within the Green Paper; leading  to the issue of this first version of the National Cyber  Security Strategy.

PRELUDE  This Section sets the scene for the National Cyber  Security Strategy, through a definition of what is  meant by cyber-space and its security and an outline  of the key principles leading to the vision expected to  be attained through the strategy.   A Cyber Security Model presented encapsulates the  key dimensions that are to be addressed by means of  goals and corresponding measures, proposed in Part  3, for the implementation of the Strategy.   5. WHAT IS MEANT BY  CYBER SECURITY  Definitions for cyber security abound; however they  all essentially point to the security of the cyber- space; namely all:  • Interconnected ICT hardware and software  infrastructure   • Data in transit and at rest on the networks  • Connected users  • Logical connections established among them  In view of the above3, the following definition of cyber  security is being adopted:  It is the safeguards and actions that can be used to  protect cyber domain from those threats that are  associated with or that may harm its interdependent  networks and information infrastructure. It strives to  preserve the availability and integrity of the networks  and infrastructure and the confidentiality of the  information contained therein.  Essentially, cyber security is based upon the  foundations of information security, namely  confidentiality, integrity and availability. However,  whilst information security is business driven and  results in prudent investment in safeguards and  countermeasures, cyber security is threat driven  where all cyber-space is at risk. The inherent   interconnectedness of cyber-space exposes all of  its constituents to a failure of their most vulnerable  elements4 .  Additionally effective cyber security cannot be  reached by technological measures alone as modern  cyber attacks could bypass all defence layers by  exploiting the human factors through techniques  such as social engineering5.   Hence, safeguards and actions hereby refer to  ongoing and planned measures which may potentially  be of technical, operational, legislative, educational,  behavioural or disseminative nature.   Above all, cyber security cannot be seen from a  technological aspect only, but needs to cover the  needs and expectations of the state, the economy  and society, all of which are increasingly active  participants in an interactive digital world.    6. GUIDING PRINCIPLES  Within this context, the Strategy, in its lifecycle, shall  be guided by a number of principles as follows:  Rule of Law  The approach on cyber security shall respect  and promote fundamental rights and freedoms  as chartered within European Union and national  legislation. All measures shall comply with the  principles of necessity, proportionality and legality,  with appropriate safeguards to ensure accountability  and redress.  Multi-stakeholder, cooperative and  collaborative approach  The pervasive nature of cyber-space, essentially calls  for a multi-stakeholder approach towards its security  – both at a national level as well as beyond Malta’s  shores. Hence, on a national level, cooperation and  collaboration of various stakeholders, including the   Part Two Overall Direction    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  13  public sector, the private sector, academia and civil  society is necessary. A cooperative and collaborative  approach at an EU and international level is also  required.  Shared goal and responsibility  Effective cyber security essentially calls for the  sharing of one common goal that transcends  boundaries. Whilst leading in its commitment towards  cyber security on a national scale, Government  cannot assume sole responsibility for protecting all of  cyberspace. All users of ICT are responsible to take  reasonable steps to protect systems and data on an  individual and on a collective basis.   Risk Management  The widely diffused use of cyberspace coupled  with its rapid and continuous evolvement, renders  it impossible to guarantee immunity from any form   of cyber attack. Hence a risk-based approach to  assess, prioritise and take measures to ensure cyber  security, along with any technology investment is  necessary.  7. OVERALL VISION  Within the context of the articulated principles, an  overall vision for the National Cyber Security Strategy  is:   To ensure a secure, resilient and trusted digital  interactive environment that supports Malta’s safety  and security whilst maximising on the benefits of a  digital economy.  In specific terms, the vision entails that:  • Civil society is aware of cyber risks and  undertakes necessary precautions to protect  its privacy, confidentiality, personal integrity,  identity and well-being  •  The Private Sector, whilst tapping the  opportunities resulting from the technology  developments, actively ensures that it operates  in a secure and resilient digital economy, whilst  ensuring effective delivery of their services and/ or goods and protection of their customer’s  privacy and integrity  • The Public Sector leads the way in ensuring a  secure and resilient digital environment for its  interaction with and/or service delivery to civil  society, private enterprise and with regional and  international partners, as well as in placing  Malta as a secure online location for business  interaction.  The National Cyber Security Strategy aims to address  the needs and expectations of each of the above  stakeholders, in the light of the proposed vision.   Part Two Overall Direction  “ Whilst leading in its  commitment towards  cyber security on a national  scale, Government cannot  assume sole responsibility  for protecting all of  cyberspace. All users of  ICT are responsible to  take reasonable steps to  protect systems and data  on an individual and on a  collective basis. ”    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  14  8. A CYBER SECURITY     STRATEGY MODEL   As outlined in Figure 1, the strategy addresses five  dimensions which are identified within the Cyber  Security Capability Maturity Model of the Global  Cyber Security Capacity Centre, University of  Oxford6.  Proposed goals and related measures underscore in  more specific terms how the strategy is expected to  be implemented.   Policy Legislation Risk Management Culture Education  Devising cyber  security policy and  strategy that sets  the direction on a  national level.  Creating  effective legal  and regulatory  frameworks to  support all aspects  of the strategy.  Controlling  risks through  organisation,  standards and  technology.  Fostering  awareness to  encourage a  responsible cyber  culture throughout  society.  Building cyber  skills into the  workforce and  leadership  through effective  education.

THE GOALS AND   ACCOMPANYING      MEASURES  9.1 The Goals  Digital Malta, and in particular, Action 53, proposes  four high level goals for a National Cyber Security  Strategy, which are:  • Combat Cybercrime  Law enforcement agencies are to  identify gaps  and strengthen their capability to investigate and  combat cybercrime.  • Strengthen National Cyber Defence   Public and private entities are to be guided and  assisted in strengthening their cyber defence  capabilities.  • Secure Cyber-space   Higher levels of trust are to be instilled through  awareness programmes and the delivery of  trustworthy, ICT-enabled services that assure  confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy.  • Build Capacity (Cyber security Awareness and Education)   The skills and educational frameworks required are  to be identified and developed.  However, sound and stable governance essential for  the effective ongoing implementation of a National  Cyber Security Strategy, calls for two other goals,  namely:   • Establish a Governance Framework to attain a National  Cyber Security Strategy   Given that at this stage, only the technical and  operational structures are in formation. The  strategic level that focuses on the long term trends,  analysis and coordination in cyber security is also  necessary.  • National and International Cooperation   given that the borderless nature of cyber-related  activity, essentially calls for particular regard to the   global and regional aspect, apart from the national  focus of related security. In all, the six goals aim to  cover two key strategic outcomes expected from  the Strategy, namely:  • Defending and protecting the national    information infrastructure from cyber threats  • Ensuring the security, safety and protection of    users of cyber-space.  9.2 The Proposed Measures A set of measures to each corresponding goal are  proposed below, based upon:  • Analysis, as well as consultations undertaken    within the local context,  • Best practices noted in cyber security strategies    within the European Union  and worldwide,   • EU legal requirements and direction. The     measures outlined do not exclude action that    may need to be taken with respect to specific EU    legal requirements7.  • Relevant action items within Digital Malta and    other local strategies such as e-Commerce    Malta.8      MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  17  Part Three The Strategy  1. Goal: Establish a governance framework The governance framework covers the   necessary key functions and corresponding roles   and responsibilities, as well as policies and   processes necessary9 to constitute a robust   foundation for an effective national cyber   security strategy.   i. Establish the necessary key coordination  structures  It is envisaged that the following functions   (involving multiple stakeholders) shall be   required to ensure sustainability of the National   Cyber Security Strategy:  a. At the strategic level:  i. A function for the articulation and periodic review  of the National Cyber Security Strategy. The   creation of this function is required in the short  term. This body would need to work in close  cooperation with the strategy implementation  function(s) referred to below  ii. A strategy implementation function to oversee  implementation of the strategy and monitor cyber  security operations.  Such function needs to have  the necessary funding, resources and mandate to:  • take a leading, active role in the implementation  of the National Cyber security strategy, keeping  in view of policy and planning developments  within the realm of Malta’s digital economy  and society as well as further cyber security  related developments on a national, EU and  international perspective   • ensure security preparedness of the public and   private sector of their ICT, in line with established  security requirements. This implies driving for  effective engagement and ongoing high level  coordination across Malta’s public and private  sector.  b. At the operational level, function(s) for the  national coordination of cyber detection and   response. Computer Security Incident Response  Teams (CSIRTs)  tend to be of such technical and   operational nature. This entails ensuring consolidation  of a top level National CSIRT10. It also implies close  communication  and coordination of the CSIRT with  the proposed strategy implementation function,   given that it would  need to be involved on:  • Real-time information sharing and response to  calls  • Longer term planning11. Communication and  coordination, as the need arises, with other  CSIRTS existing in Malta would also be necessary.  The structure12  and responsibilities of these functions  is subject to further reference and alignment to the  relevant European Union legal requirements13 as well  as to further consultation.  ii. Foster the coordination to protect national  critical information infrastructure  Measures of preparedness, response and   recovery, including cooperation and ongoing   coordination mechanisms are particularly   necessary to protect national critical information   infrastructure. It is thus necessary to ensure that   such national coordination between all   stakeholders concerned14 is fostered.   iii. Ensure clear delineation and communication  of roles and responsibilities  Cyber related roles and responsibilities - such   as those identified above and potentially those   arising from the proposed measures, as well as   those resulting from relevant EU legal   requirements15, need to be clearly delineated   and agreed upon accordingly.  Communication   of their establishment further ensures the   effective coordination that may be necessary   between the effected stakeholders themselves.  iv. Ensure the conduct of a national cyber risk  assessment exercise   A National Cyber Risk Assessment exercise   shall need to identify the major national cyber   threats and risks, assess respective impacts and      MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  18  suggest risk mitigation and management   strategies accordingly. The exercise entails   participation and coordination between all   stakeholders involved16 and it needs to be   updated on a regular basis, so as to ensure its   currency with:  • The cyber threat landscape  • Evolution in the adoption of existing and emerging          ICT.  One key deliverable of the National Cyber Risk  Assessment is a strategic plan that  includes   cooperation and communication processes needed  to ensure prevention, detection, response, repair  and recovery (including communication), that are  modulated according to the alert level are to be  ensured.   Such processes also refer to national incident cyber  handling procedures and business continuity plans  to ensure resilience. Furthermore, it is understood  that such processes need to be subject to a schedule  of regular testing and validation exercises17, with the  resulting outcome (including lessons learnt) used as  a basis for any related updates.  v. Ensure necessary measures in line with  individual cyber risks assessments by key Public  and Private sector organisations      falling within  the scope of related EU legal requirements  The conduct of a National Cyber Risk   Assessment does not exclude the conduct of   individual cyber risk assessments particularly   by the public and private sector organisations   falling within the scope of related EU legal   requirements on network and information   security18.  Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and   other Directives coming into force by June   2018 across the EU, also call for all organisations   to ensure regular risk assessments by   organisations to understand the degree of threat   imposed on them when processing personal    data. The legislation demands a risk-based   approach with the development of appropriate  controls.  vi. Encourage cyber risk assessments by other  organisations  not falling within the scope of  Measure 1 (v)  The emphasis on individual risk assessment   made to specific organisations with respect to   network and information security, in Measure 1 (v)   should not however construe that other   organisations need not adopt similar activities.   Indeed, data protection legislation, also referred   to in Measure 1 (v) is applicable to all   organisations processing personal data.  An assessment of financial risks related to cyber- related incidents could possibly also indicate a market  in cyber insurance, which may in turn contribute to  information sharing among its participants, apart  from availability of financial coverage to mitigate  consequential losses.   Ultimately, however, it needs to be borne in mind that  cyber insurance coverage alone is not a panacea to  cyber security threats.  It needs to be carried out with  in conjunction with  consideration and applicability  of cyber security measures in line with the risks  assessed.  vii. Consolidate the Information Security  Framework within the Public Sector  The Government of Malta Information Security Policy  is expected to come into force in the near future.  It is based upon ISO 27001 Information Security  international standard and applies to all of the Public  Sector.   viii. Ensure classification of data within the Public  Sector and encourage it within the private sector  The classification of electronic data within the  Public Sector and the application of security  controls commensurate to the security marking  assigned is one area, among others, referred to   Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  19  within the Information Security Policy, referred to in  Measure 1 (vii). This aspect is a critical initial step  in ensuring effective cyber security, also keeping in  view of the inherent sensitivity of data dealt within  the sector. Nonetheless, the classification of data as  one of the primary tasks to be undertaken by any  organisation (public sector or otherwise)  is one of  the key awareness targets that needs to be taken into  account.     2. Goal: Combat Cybercrime i. Establish Forum for Internet Safety and  Protection of Minors  This measure is referred to in Digital Malta, and  it proposes a number of relevant public sector  stakeholders and industry representatives as the  Forum’s members. The Forum aims to:  • Share knowledge • Monitor developments • Put forward policy ideas • Represent Malta on European bodies working in     this field  This Forum could potentially help out in reviewing  the Cyber security strategy itself with respect to  combating cybercrime activity.  ii. Identify gaps and strengthen capability to  investigate and combat cybercrime  A regular assessment of present state cybercrime  capability in Malta among all relevant law enforcement,  investigative and judicial roles  and  any related action  necessary is indeed a prerequisite in the light of the  continuously evolving threat vector landscape. Internal security is crucial. Yet, it also needs to be borne  in mind that threats to EU citizens are increasingly  cross border and varied in nature. EU Member states,  including Malta, can thus no longer succeed on their  own. The European Agenda on Security – the EU’s  strategy to tackle security threats in the EU for period  2015-202019 is intended to contribute in this respect.  Cybercrime is one of the Agenda’s priorities for the  years 2015-2020.   The Agenda aims to strengthen and make more  effective the exchange of information and operational  cooperation between Member states, EU Agencies  and the critical information infrastructure sector; by  aiming to:  • Reinforce the capacity of law enforcement    authorities in Member states, in particular    through the Europol’s European Cybercrime    Centre  “    Internal security is crucial.  Yet, it also needs to be  borne in mind that threats to  EU citizens are increasingly  cross border and varied in  nature. EU Member states,  including Malta, can thus  no longer succeed on their  own. ”  Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  20  • Address obstacles to criminal investigations on    cybercrime, notably with respect to access to    evidence   • Prioritise the implementation of existing    legislation on attacks against information    systems and on combating child abuse.  iii. Assess and consolidate on-line  reporting of     cybercrime  The on-line mechanism is needed to report illicit online  activity for the required action to be taken as well as  to determine the extent of cybercrime. It entails:       • The ability to track cybercrime at a national level       • Ensuring further nation-wide related awareness,    especially among citizens and small businesses.  It is also recommended to ensure that a strategic  approach on the applicability of online services   related to cybercrime handling is taken, so as to  enhance effectiveness, whilst maximising the use of  resources.  Additionally, the ability to handle cases related to  cyber bullying (or any other form of cyber abuse) also  needs to be ensured among online support personnel  handling services pertaining to abuse.   3. Goal: Strenghten National cyber defence i. Establish a collective approach for sharing  cyber security knowledge and intelligence  A collective approach, involving both the public and  private sector, potentially facilitated through the use  of ICT is needed to:   • Allow participants from across sectors and    organisations to exchange information on cyber    threats and to mutually strengthen response to    cyber threats, vulnerabilities and  incidents    securely, efficiently and effectively20, whilst    operating within  a framework that protects the    confidentiality of the shared information.21  It may    also allow for intra-business sect oral    communication, particularly in areas where    particular information may be deemed as    of a highly sensitive nature to be shared with all    participants  • Analyse new trends and identify opportunities    and emerging threats  • Work to strengthen cyber security  • Provide framework for sharing best practice22   • Potentially improve professionalism in    information assurance and cyber defence across    the private and public sector through schemes for    certifying related competence and specialist    training.  ii. Review existing legislation and provide  measures through legislation and regulation to  ensure relevance and effectiveness to the cyber  world  This measure builds upon two objectives of Digital  Malta, as follows:  • Objective  43 – review existing legislation to    ensure relevance and effectiveness in the cyber    world’  • Objective 44 – provide measures to maintain    privacy, safety and security while surfing,    transacting and operating on-line. Legislation    will address several matters such as safeguarding    intellectual property rights, patents, sensitive    and personal information, cloud computing and    Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  21   data ownership, contentious content, net    neutrality, vendor lock-in and exit management    strategies; online contracts and license    agreements.  The measure is also highly relevant taking into  consideration:  • The requirements arising from the European    Agenda on Security, referred to in Measure 2.2.  • Action 38 – Digital Single Market – of Digital    Malta, which states Government’s intention to    maximise the benefits and opportunities deriving    from legislation adopted within the EU such    as those related to data protection, electronic    identification and trust, etc  • Relevant EU Directive and regulation , notably    among others,  recent EU data protection    legislation and legal requirements pertaining to    Network and Information Security  Within this light, the notion of having one national  legislation for cyber security, merits active  consideration. It is understood that its effectiveness  would need to be backed by:   • Prior multi-displinary wide national consultation  • Consideration and alignment to existing national    and EU legal requirements covering aspects of    cyber security24    • A balance between incentives and sanctions  • Promotion of related awareness and cooperation    with the various stakeholders involved in working    towards cyber resilience.  The legislation may be positioned in a way so as to  allow sectors (regulated or otherwise) to adopt any  further measures as necessary.  iii. Ensure the country’s digital resilience to    cyber attack as well as the capability to protect  its interests   As an independent sovereign state and as a member  of the United Nations (UN), Malta has the right to  defend its own territory and its infrastructure from  acts of aggression from other states25. Cyber-space  is no exception and Malta has the right and obligation   to defend its cyber-space territory to ensure that the  security of the nation is maintained.Such measure  entails ensuring that the following are addressed:  • Cyber-space defences  • Structures to counter terrorist attacks  • Ability and capacity to detect threats in cyber-   space  • Capability to disrupt attacks on the country from    cyber-space  • Active consideration of direction being taken at    EU level on areas such as cyber diplomacy26     and on ways to counter hybrid threats27.   iv. Conduct national cyber simulation exercises  Cyber simulation exercises are to be scheduled and  conducted from time to time, at a national level.  Such measure contributes to the need to review  the ability to anticipate, prepare for, identify and  attribute, combat hostile cyberspace acts. Apart from  technical considerations, cyber simulation exercises  should also assess non-technical areas both at an  operational, tactical as well as at a strategic level such  as testing national and international coordination and  any relevant Standard Operational Practices.  The participation of key public and private sector  stakeholders28 in such exercises is crucial.  The participation of other organisations is also  encouraged.  “    Malta has the right and  obligation to defend its  cyber-space territory to  ensure that the security of  the nation is maintained. ”  Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  22  4. Goal: Secure Cyberspace  i. Establish regulation and voluntary self- commitment for guaranteeing cyber security  The current scenario analysis of cyber   security in Malta indicates areas of regulation and  policy particularly within the local regulated industry  sectors. Focus appears to be mainly on policy  frameworks covering the licensing approaches which  seek to mitigate risk.  Whilst legislation may help, Maltese regulatory  authorities may also need to address further emerging  technology such as cloud computing applicability,  through regulation within their respective sectors.   The  formulation of regulation pertaining to cyber  security would need to take into consideration, among  others, the latest EU data protection legislation29 as  well as of legal requirements pertaining to network  and information security, where applicable.   Regulation within sectors may also include  conformance to internationally recognised security  standards or industry led cyber security related  standards or practices, with the aim of bolstering  cyber security as well as establishing centres of  excellence within the sectors themselves.   Such alignment may also call for particular  consideration, in terms of support, to organisations  having limited or constrained resources (including  human and financial). On the other hand, it is understood that legislation  and regulation cannot necessarily cover all aspects  of cyber security; particularly considering potential  financial and human resource constraints for robust  cyber security.   Voluntary self commitment is, thus, also key to cyber  security. The notion of the applicability of a European  security trust mark, applied also in a number of EU  states 31may encourage voluntary self commitment  and may therefore be one item to explore the  possibility of its use locally. Local national strategy  may already serve as a potential opportunity for  further consideration in fostering self commitment,  such as:  • e-Commerce Malta  which highlights  three pillars    as its basis:  i. Engendering trust in ecommerce  ii. Transforming micro-enterprises  iii. Taking Small to Medium sized Enterprises  and industry to the next level; which specifically   also refers to an audit-kit – through a Specialist  advisory service (Measure 2) and the European  trust-mark (Measure 9)  • Digital Malta which refers to the Forum for the    transformation of industries through ICT that    aims to raise awareness about how ICT can help    industries transform themselves and to discuss    items such as self-regulation.  Other potential opportunities which may be explored  include financial incentives, such as in the form of  grant schemes,  as a means to entice the applicability  of necessary cyber security related measures.  ii. Stimulate use of interoperable and secure  standards on the basis of good practice  Digital Malta, through Action 42 – Standards and  Good Practice, states Government’s intention to  collaborate with stakeholders to support and promote   “    Interoperability is one  means of broadening and  strenghtening collaboration,  establishing intelligence  and improving situational  awareness, all of which are  essential for effective cyber  security. ”  Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  23  National and EU cross-border interoperability, ICT  standards based on industry best practices and  Green ICT.  Interoperability is one means of broadening and  strenghtening collaboration, establishing intelligence  and improving situational awareness32, all of which  are essential for effective cyber security33. With  respect to the notion of nationally and EU recognised  interoperability, which also effectively promotes the  use of safe secure standards, Digital Malta states as  one of its objectives, Government’s commitment to  revise and revamp the current National Interoperability  Framework including related policies34.   The implementation of internationally recognised  information security standard35 controls within the  public sector36 and potentially within the private  sector  should contribute to cyber security on the  local scenario. The applicability of such controls may  serve as a good initial basis.   However consideration of industry led standards  and guidance that put in place a series of measures  specifically aimed to address cyber threats37 are also  to be encouraged for use. This could form an integral  part of what is proposed in Measure 4 (i).  In particular, special consideration needs to be given  by operators and users of emerging technologies. In  such areas, related standards and security controls,  may still be in the very early stages of maturity and  may thus pose cyber security vulnerability challenges  for interoperability which need to be carefully  assessed.  iii. Promote robust levels of cyber security in  online public services  Such measure may alleviate concerns expressed  within Euro barometer findings with respect to  Maltese accessing online services38. The applicability  of interoperable and secure standards, as referred  to in Measure 4 (ii), may potentially contribute for  the attainment of such measure.It also calls for an  emphasis to ensure security and privacy in the design   of ICT products and services for Government as well  as in other areas of application.  Additionally, the use of cloud computing services  within the public sector needs to be seen to in the  light of EU legal requirements pertaining to security of  network and information systems39 as well as those  pertaining to the Data Protection Regulation (EU)  2016/679 and other Directives.  iv. Consolidate support to the private sector on  cyber security  Measure 4 (i) outlines how cyber security can be  facilitated in the private sector. Apart from potential  public sector driven incentives, private sector  participation in awareness and advice programmes  as well as cyber related exercises to specific sectors  may additionally help.   For example, ways may potentially be sought with  business service providers (e.g. lawyers, insurers)  of how they can potentially develop services to  incentivise and help businesses manage and reduce  risks40.  “    A chain is only as  strong as its weakest link.  Unfortunately, within the  realm of cyber security,   weakest link could, more  often than not, be traced  to the human factor.  The behavioural and  educational aspect of cyber  security cannot thus be  discounted. ”   Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  24  5. Goal: Cyber security Awareness and  Education  i. Encourage cyber security education and training   A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Unfortunately, within the realm of cyber security,   weakest link could, more often than not, be traced to  the human factor. The behavioural and educational  aspect of cyber security cannot thus be discounted.  It is therefore  of tantamount importance to ensure  a rigorous and ongoing educational and training  exercise that targets both the current  workforce as  well as the younger student generation  This measure thus primarily entials:  • Further recognition of the need for cyber security     skills and competencies • Academic and training programmes designed to     consolidate cyber security expertise • The review of existing curricula that focusses     on cyber security along with ICT and media    competencies.    Action 60 - Building national capacity in specialist  skill sets - of Digital Malta states Government’s  commitment, through educational institutions  and industry to support the creation of specialist  educational pathways, addressing labour market  requirements and to develop the curriculum and  provide technical materials. Cyber security expertise  also needs to be seen within the context of such  initiative. Specialist cyber-security related education  and training is to be actively considered in areas such  as those related to cybercrime41.  Cyber security related training and certification  programmes are to be further encouraged, as an  opportunity to effectively increase security level42  of organisations and maintaining such increased  level of security in the long term. Prior and post  assessment of such programmes may serve as one  way of ensuring their effectiveness.   However, consideration should also be taken that  such programmes may not necessarily focus only   on traditional modes of education but also on  experimentation of innovative ways of their conduct43.  From a younger generation perspective, Action 2 -  Empowering the young through a safer Internet  - of Digital Malta states that “Digital Citizenship will  become part of the National Education Curriculum,  to equip children and youths with the abilities to  interact and use the Internet safely and intelligently.  Parents and carers will be involved together with  educators and youth workers. This action will  stimulate the production of creative online content,  empower the younger generation and help create a  safer environment. With the support of competent  authorities this measure will help combat cyber child  abuse and exploitation”.  Within the current cyber security scenario, there  appear to be related awareness campaigns, as well  as  curricular–related  plans and developments in  schools.   The imparting of cyber security awareness in schools  in particular calls for its sustainability in the long  term, also keeping in view of related European  Union direction to Member States with respect to  teaching online safety in schools44. It also calls for  consideration of a holistic perspective in the process,  such as through:   • A focus on basic cyber hygiene45  and protection    of personal data  • A sound understanding by students of the    concepts behind Information and    Communication technologies being used and    their potential vulnerabilities and risks, apart    from the opportunities that they offer46. This    includes the proper handling and use of the    technologies being applied for interaction  • Ensuring cyber related training for all teachers  • Ensuring effective engagement, participation    and support of all school management on cyber    security education and awareness  • Seeking further ways to enage parents/   guardians of students in learning on cyber    security related matters  Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  25  • Ensuring the necessary legal safeguards to    protect both the student as well as the teaching    profession on cyber related challenges such as    cyber bullying.  Curricular developments and academic programmes  aimed at establishing a cyber security focus47 is to be  further encouraged, seeking further creative ways of  instilling such education48 in the process.  ii. Explore possibility of establishing a Cyber  Centre of Excellence  The establishment of a cyber centre of excellence  may serve as:  • A form of implementation of Action 60 – Building    national capacity in specialist skill sets of Digital    Malta , refered to in the previous measure   • A training base for cyber security expertise.  • Having a maintained comprehensive list     of professionals certified under internationally    recognised certification programs in cyber    security49   • A source of promotion of related best practice    • A means of proposing legislative or regulatory    updates, based on relevant research or lessons    learnt   • A potential agent for future economic growth in    Malta within the cyber security domain  • A complementary mechanism to a collective    approach for sharing cyber security knowledge    and intelligence, proposed as Measure 3 (i).    The establishment could potentially be enabled  through:  • Agreement of overseas cooperation on related    matters    • Related EU supporting initiatives   • Inclusion of existing internationally certified local     expertise in cyber security.  iii. Ensure relevant education and training to  public sector staff and other stakeholders50   Training and education on cyber security is one key  priority within the public sector, especially given the  sector’s wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data,  compared to other sectors. In any office environment  it needs to be kept in view, that technology controls  are not sufficient to protect data from related cyber  security threats. The controls need to go hand in  hand with human resource, awareness and employee  guidance programs51.  The development of cyber security expertise within  the public sector is another key area that merits  particular attention. In the process, it also needs  to be ensured that a comprehensive list of public  sector professionals certified under internationally  recognised certification programs in cyber security is  established and maintained52. Furthermore, it needs  to be ensured that ICT personnel are trained so as to  enable them to recognise cyber incidents, to detect  anomalies in their ICT systems and to respond and to  report them accordingly.  iv. Foster application of research and development  on cyber security  Such measure aims to ensure cyber security as  among key research priorities. It effectively calls  for encouragement and support for research in any   “    It is highly recommended  that a concerted, ongoing  strategic approach is  undertaken, potentially  through a nationwide  Communications strategy  for cyber security; aimed  at addressing the various  strata of society, business  and public sector along with  their corresponding needs,  expectations, and potential  ICTs and concepts applied ”   Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  26  national and EU research projects and initiatives  on cyber security. Essentially, it entails participation  not only from Government but also from the private  sector and the academia.  v. A Strategic, target-oriented national awareness  and advice campaign  It is highly recommended that a concerted, ongoing  strategic approach is undertaken, potentially through  a nationwide Communications strategy for cyber  security53; aimed at addressing the various strata of  society, business and public sector along with their  corresponding needs, expectations, and potential  ICTs and concepts applied54.   Such an approach may ensure:  • Avoiding piecemeal, potentially one-off    approaches to awareness campaigns  • No duplication of effort  • Maximisation of cyber security related financial    and human resources  • Identification and engagement of all potential    sources of dissemination of the awareness    campaigns  • Imparting effective awareness and knowledge    on cyber security patterns and measures that is    commensurate to the specific target audience    and to the medium used55  • A measure of the extent of national awareness    and understanding of cyber security over time  • That cyber security is not simply a concern of    ICT professionals.  Ultimately, the key factors that need to be borne in  mind in the establishment of such campaign is:  • Finding the right way to raise awareness,    keeping in view of the target audience  • Ensuring motivation to learn and pay particular    attention to various signals of fake    communications on a day to day basis    (particularly to counter social engineering    threats)  • Ingraining a culture of cyber security awareness    on the potential misuse, vulnerabilities and risks    potentially arising from the ICTs and concepts    applied (particularly those emerging); whilst    embracing the opportunities arising from their    use  • Imparting the key message that it is ultimately    in everyone’s interest and responsibility  to take    the necessary relevant cyber security safeguards;    keeping in view of the inherent inter-   connectedness of individuals and organisations    alike in cyber-space.  Most measures highlighted within Goals 4 and 5 of  this strategy as well as any established national way of  sharing related knowledge, experience and insight as  referred to in Measure 3 (i)56  may potentially serve as  key sources for the establishment and maintenance  of such a concerted strategic campaign.  vi. Encourage ‘cyber hygiene’ and personal  responsibility  Ultimately, citizens are expected to apply at least  some form of basic ‘cyber hygiene’ in using ICT,  such as through careful disposition and use of  personal information on-line, installing software  updates and anti-virus software, using basic security  controls such as strong passwords and, as much as  possible,  seeking  to be more wary of any suspicious  activity related to their personal on-line accounts.  The national awareness campaign, as highlighted in  Measure 5 (v), should help in reaching this objective.   Furthermore, the possibility of a national responsible  disclosure policy framework that enables well- intentioned system users to safely inform  Government, businesses or institutions about  detected vulnerabilities in their ICT systems or  services may also be explored. The framework would  need to establish the right parameters and conditions  so as to ensure its effectiveness57.    Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  27  6. Goal: National and International  Cooperation  i. Effective cooperation and collaboration on     cyber security on a national, European and        global basis  On a national level, most of the measures highlighted  earlier essentially call for national cooperation and  coordination.   Malta is no island in cyberspace. Hence, cooperation  and collaboration on cyber security needs to be  sustained both locally as well as on a European and  on a global level. A co-ordinated approach, among all  local  key stakeholders in cyber security interacting  locally and overseas  needs to be ensured so as to  ensure synergy of national and international effort,  knowledge and expertise within the domain.   Thus, active consideration needs to be given to:   • Cyber related activities, such as those conducted    by the European Network and Information    Security Agency (ENISA), which may potentially    involve both local public as well as private sector    organisations   • EU legal requirements such as those pertaining    to network and information security58 which,    among others, calls for a body responsible for    coordinating NIS issues and for acting as a    single point of contact for cross-border    cooperation and communication at EU level,    within each Member State  • Activities such as those undertaken by the    Council of the European Union on cyber-   diplomacy59  which aim to foster increased global    cyber capacity building, as well as international    cooperation and judicial capacity on cybercrime  • Confidence Building Measures (CBMS) proposed    by the Permanent Council of the Organisation    for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)    which propose, among others, measures of    mutual communication, dialogue and    collaboration on the security and use of     Information and Communication Technologies     within and across OSCE participating states of    the related Permanent Council Decision60   • Any other cyber security related initiatives  on    a European Union and/or on a wider international    context.   Ultimately, it needs to be borne in mind that mutual  cooperation, openness and understanding is the  success to effective cyber security61.  “    Ultimately, it needs to be  borne in mind that mutual  cooperation, openness and  understanding is the success  to effective cyber security ”   Part Three The Strategy    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  28  10. CONCLUSION  10.1 The Cyber Security Strategy Model Revisited  As indicated in Figure 2, the National Cyber  Security Strategy, through its goals and subsequent  measures, shall be covering areas of governance,  legislation, regulation and voluntary commitment,  risk management and education and awareness – all  of which position cyber security on a sustainable,   long term path.

It is the beginning of a continuum,  starting with implementation that is in line with:   • Increased awareness and recognition on a    national scale of the importance to tackle cyber    security in a comprehensive and systemic    manner  • Related ICT, legislative, regulatory, social and    economic updates on a national scenario  • Rapid developments within the cyber threat    landcape.  The implementation of the Strategy  is expected  to involve multiple stakeholders within the public  and the private sector as well as cooperation and  coordination with civil society. It is expected to be  evaluated on a periodic basis, based upon the  progress registered from such implementation, along  with related directional developments on a national  and European Union front. The evaluation is expected  to lead to maintenance and updates of the Strategy,  leading to a subsequent new version, reflecting the  maturity undertaken in cyber security on a national  scale since its initial launch.

Refer to Note 1.  8. Ibid.  9. Taking into particular consideration of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. Reference is made to Note 1.  10. A top level national CSIRT that acts as the key technical/operational function. Among the responsibilities of such CSIRT are:  • Monitoring incidents at a national level  • Providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to relevant stakeholders about risks and  incidents  • Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness  • Establish cooperative relationships with the private sector  • Facilitate cooperation through use of common or standardised practices for incident and risk handling procedures  11. European Commission (2015), DSI Maturity Study, p.29  12. Which could take the form of (i) a centralised approach – whereby a national authority has in-house responsibilities with all    authorities reporting to it; OR (ii) a decentralised approach whereby roles and responsibilities are spread across a variety of actors    who coordinate together to share information and exchange on a voluntary basis OR (iii) a semi-centralised (hybrid) approach    whereby a central ministry coordinates implementation of the strategy with designated authorities having the necessary roles and    responsibilities over operators and other stakeholders  and who report to the central ministry on a periodic basis.  13. Reference is made to Note 1.      14. Refers to Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators  15. One of which specifically includes the Network and Information Security – NIS – Directive, referred to in Note 1.     16. Refers to CII operators, Critical Infrastructure (CI) operators, Digital service providers and other potential stakeholders  17. Potentially enabled by National cyber simulation exercises as referred to in Measure 3.1  18. Reference is particularly made to the NIS Directive, referred to in Note 1.   19. European Agenda on Security: Questions and Answers, Strasbourg, 28 April 2015 - European Commission-Fact Sheet.  20. European Commission, Countering hybrid threats: EU Response – Cybersecurity, Presentation, Brussels, 19th February 2016  21. One example of such an arrangement is the Cyber-security Information sharing Partnership, part of CERT-UK; www.cert.gov.uk    cisp/  22. Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Euroope (OSCE), Decision No. 102, OSCE Confidence Building Measures to reduce    the risks of conflict stemming from the use of ICTs, PCOEW6464, 10 March 2016, Confidence Buidling Measure No. 14. This CBM    refers to best practices of responses to common security challenges stemming from the use of ICTs.  23. Areas that could potentially be looked into may include risk assessment and apportioning security practices to risk levels,    information security planning, processes, roles and assesments of preparedness.   24. Reference is made in particular to Note 1.  25. Article 2(4) of the UN states that  “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the    territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United    Nation”. This Article prohibits any state from attacking another state however in Article 51 of the same charter states that “Nothing    in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self defence if an armed attack occurs against    a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and    security.”  26. Reference is made to ‘Developing a Joint EU diplomatic response against coercive cyber operations’, Council of the European    ENDNOTES    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  35  ENDNOTES   Union, Brussels , 24 February 2016  (Doc 5797/2/16)  27. Reference is made to ‘Report of the Expert-level consultation meeting with member states on countering hybrid threats held on 19    February 2016’ Permanent Representation of Malta to the European Union.  28. Refers to CII operators, CI operators, Digital Service providers and other potential stakeholders  29. The preparation for the GDPR calls for a  review and assessment of number of organisational, procedural, communication steps    that need to be undertaken to ensure conformance.   30. The latter aim may serve as good business opportunity, especially for export-oriented sectors, to strenghten their market share    overseas.  31. For example Austria and the UK  32. One of the action items of the EU Cyber Security Strategy specifically calls for work on further development of globally interoperable    standards and their promotion for their wider use by industry. Reference is made to EU Cyber Security Strategy: Roadmap    Development – Council of the EU, Brussels, 7/10/2015.  33. This may imply, amongst others, the improvement of interoperability of national and international systems. Reference is made to    measure 5 as part of law enforcement legislation and policy related implementation of the Information Management Strategy    (Working Party on Information Exchange and Data Protection – Council of the EU)   34. Public consultation preliminary results on information and communication technologies published by the European Commission in    early 2016, reveals cyber security as being one of the areas requiring common standards if completion of a single digital market is    to be achieved.    35. Such as ISO 27001   36. Reference is made to Measure 1.7   37. Such as the UK’s Cyber Essentials Scheme, http://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cyber-essentials-scheme.aspx#.VaYNvLlBut8   38. The overall confidence to use the Internet for online services (e.g. banking, public services) has decreased from 74% in 2012 to    73% to 2013 across the EU. A proportional increase is noted in 2014 in the level of concern expressed by EU respondents in    having access to online services, through the Internet, as a result of cyber attacks.  In Malta’s case, the findings indicate an increase    from 44% in 2013 to 61% in 2014. This could be potentially attributed to an increase in the proportion of the Maltese respondents,    from 7% in 2013 to 10% in 2014 who complain of related incidents.  39. Reference is particularly made to the NIS Directive, referred to in Note 1.  40. Potential areas that can be seen to also relate to cyber insurance, due diligence to third party with which businesses may seek    strategic relationships,etc  41. Including in roles such as those pertaing to law enforcement, prosecution services, the judiciary.  42. Including educating staff to understand what is harmful to an organisation and what can be done to prevent mistakes which may    lead to data breaches.    43. For example apart from use of visual methods, rewards, social engagement and direct feedback during everyday working life;    gamification may present one promising method. (Purcelli, op. cit, p.27). Other possiblities include cybercrime simulation    workshops as another complementary means to induce awareness on the various forms of cybercrime, who is the likely target,    what needs to be done to avoid falling a victim, and what action needs to be taken and to whom to refer to,  in case of fallling a    victim.  44. Reference is made to the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children - Communication from the Commission to the    European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Brussels    2.2.2013, COM (2012) 196 final.  45. Such as effective password management  46. The  increased focus on environmental concerns and measures within schools in recent years may serve as a potential model for a    heightened awareness on cyber security and safety concerns and measures amongst the younger generation, which  may in turn    expand further within their home environments.  47. With special reference to secondary and tertiary level education  48. Such as through special events, apart from teaching through games, particularly to the younger generation. Estonia for example    organises ‘Cyber olympics’ and specialised summer schools    49. A  measure  that is particularly required within the public sector as a domain having a wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data,    relative to other sectors   50. In particular, CII operators, CI operators, Digital Service providers and other potential stakeholders  51. Puricelli, op.cit. This may be complemented by related policies, best practices and processes (including those on proper data    handling) applied within the context itself.   52. So as to augment and enhance needed cyber security knowledge and expertise within the sector  53. A similar approach has been taken by the Netherlands and Austria    MALTA CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2016  36  54. For example, it may be appropriate to focus, among others, on cyber security related concerns and measures that may be taken    in the applicability of cloud computing or mobile computing within office environments.   55. For example social media, TV, radio, etc  56. Apart from regular Euro barometer surveys dealing with cyber security which provide a significant insight on cyber security    experiences and concerns on a domestic level.  57. Such policy is currently mainly applied by a number of organisations – European and  worldwide, and also by some EU member    states such as the Netherlands. Such framework could be enabled through self-regulation, promotion and encouragement by    government as well as the proper framework to ensure responsible vulnerability disclosure.  58. Reference is made to the Network and Information Security - NIS - Directive   59. Reference is made to the Council Conclusions on Cyber Diplomacy (2015) and to the Global Conference on Cyberspace (2015)   60. Permanent Council Decision No. 1039 (26 April 2012) , whereby OSCE participating States, “decided to step up individual and    collective efforts to address security of and in the use of ICTs in a comprehensive and cross-dimensional manner in accordance    with OSCE commitments and cooperation with relevant international organisations...”. This led to the adoption of a number    of Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) through Permanent Council Decision 1106 on December 3, 2013, followed by additional,    complementary CBMs adopted through Permanent Council Decision No. 1202 on March 10, 2016.  61. It needs to be seen within a ‘win-win’ perspective including in those areas where business related competition plays a key role.  ENDNOTES",

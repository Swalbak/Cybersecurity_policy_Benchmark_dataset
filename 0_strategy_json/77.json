It is a result of analysis of current and future challenges and threats to the increasingly vigorous digital transformation of the Polish economy and public administration. The strategy defines the areas of activities supporting the imple- mentation of the main objective, which is to increase the level of resilience to cyber threats and to strengthen data protection through the development of the National Cybersecurity System, which consists of professional staff, threat-conscious users, safe and effective processes along with modern and security-checked information technologies. The adoption of the Act on the national cybersecurity system in 2018 created the legal and organisational basis for building, for the first time in history, a comprehensive cybersecurity system in Poland. This system will be continuously developed, as clearly indicated in one of the specific objectives set out in the Strategy. Moreover, the priorities of the Polish government in the area of information security were indicated. These include raising public awareness on cyber threats, supporting initiatives aimed at cre- ating innovative solutions and tools, strengthening cooperation with the private sector and developing digital services using new generations of mobile networks and large-scale data collection and analysis systems. A high level of cybersecurity can be achieved through the wide application of best practices, implementation of new legislative and organisational solutions, as well as through international operational cooperation and information sharing. The strategy is also a starting point for the development of a detailed Action Plan, which will include specific projects with key performance indicators and identification of financing sources. The Act, the Strategy and the future Action Plan are a set of tools for public administration. The tools that have one common goal - to ensure safe, undisturbed access to the opportunities resul- ting from the digital transformation, serving the rapid develop- ment of the economy and raising citizens’ living standards.

Funding 31 6 7 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND Fast and unhindered access to information which is used in the management, production, services and the public sector has more and more impact on social and economic gro- wth. Dynamic progress of information systems serves the deve- lopment of the national economy, in particular communications, commerce, transport and financial services. Digital technologies that comprise cyberspace1 are used for shaping social relation- ships. Moreover, online services have become a tool for effecting on the behaviour of social groups, as well as exerting influence in the political sphere. Any significant disruption to the functioning of cyberspace, whether global or local, will have an impact on economic activi- ty, citizen’s sense of security and safety, the efficiency of public sector institutions, production and service processes, and as a result on national security in general. Protection of information systems and information processed therein is a challenge for all entities of the national cybersecu- rity system, i.e. businesses providing services using information systems, public authorities, institutions responsible for the na- tional security, and specialised entities dealing with cybersecu- rity at the operational level. It is even more important as Poland is closely connected with other countries through international cooperation within organisations such as the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Security and Coopera- tion in Europe (OSCE). This cooperation plays an important role in responding to the increasing number of incidents caused by illegal activities in cyberspace that are leading to tangi- ble and reputational damages which are growing by the year. Criminal activities are being taken by individuals, organised crime groups, as well as, groups sponsored by governmental institutions and armed forces of countries which conduct offen- sive actions focused specifically on cyberespionage and gathe- ring intelligence on other states’ defence capabilities. 1. Introduction – rationale for actions to increase cybersecurity 1 Cyberspace is the space for processing and exchanging information formed by ICT systems defined in Article 3(3) of the Act of 17 February 2005 on the computerisa- tion of activities of entities performing public tasks (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, items 700, 730, 848 and 1590), including relations between them and relationships with the users – in accordance with Article 2(1b) of the Act of 29 August 2002 on the martial law and competences of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and the rules of his subordination to the constitutional authorities of the Republic of Poland (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2017, item 1932). 8 9 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 2. Strategic context of cyberse- curity in the Republic of Poland The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 is a continuation and extension of actions taken by the government administration to increase the level of cyber- security in the Republic of Poland. As part of actions taken to date, the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland, item 1560)2 entered into force and the government beforehand also adopted the following documents: • in 2013, the Policy for the Protection of Cyberspace of the Republic of Poland, • in 2017, the National Framework of Cybersecurity Policy of the Republic of Poland for 2017–2022. The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 supersedes the National Fra- mework of Cybersecurity of the Republic of Poland for 2017–2022 adopted under Resolution no. 52/2017 of the Council of Ministers of 27 April 2017 regarding the National Framework of Cyber- security of the Republic of Poland 2017–2022. The purpose of this document is to define strategic objectives and relevant political and regulatory measures to achieve a high level of cybersecurity, principally a resilience to cyber threats of infor- mation systems used by operators of essential services , critical infrastructure operators, digital service providers and the public administration, as well as to increase information protection in the information systems by means of standardised safeguards. The achievement of the strategic objectives shall also contribute to increasing the national security, improving the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities in detecting and combating cybercrime, events of a hybrid nature (including events of a terrorist nature) and cyberespionage. The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 is aligned with ongoing ope- rations related to ICT systems used by critical infrastructure operators. It also takes into account the need to enable the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland - in domestic, alliance and co- alition contexts - to conduct military operations in the event of cyber threat which requires defen- sive operations. By implementing the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024, the govern- ment will fully guarantee the right to privacy and hold the position that free and open Internet is an important element of the functioning of a modern society. 2 The Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system implements Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concer- ning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (Official Journal of the EU L 194, 19.07.2016, p. 1). 3 Applies to operators of essential services referred to in Article 5 of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system. 4 Applies to digital service providers referred to in Article 17 of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system. 3. Scope of the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 The Strategy takes into account, in particular5: 1. cybersecurity objectives and priorities; 2. entities involved in the implementation and deployment of the Strategy; 3. measures used to achieve the objectives of the Strategy; 4. specification of means for readiness, response and restoration, including principles of public-private cooperation; 5. risk assessment approach; 6. activities related to educational, information and training programmes regarding cybersecurity; 7. activities related to research and development plans regarding cybersecurity. Furthermore, the Strategy takes into account international cooperation regarding cybersecurity. Introduced by way of a resolution of the Council of Ministers, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 directly affects entities of the government administration and, indirectly, after the adoption of applicable general law on the initiative of the Council of Ministers, other public authorities, businesses and citizens. 5Article 69(2) of the Act 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system. 10 11 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 4. Vision, main goal, specific objectives 4.1 Vision The efficient and safe operation of information systems and means of electronic communication are resulted in the successful growth of the Republic of Po- land, the increasing t effectiveness of the economy and performance of institutions and entities, including also its social activity and everyday functioning of individual members of the society. Therefore, as part of actions planned in the Cybersecurity Strategy by the year 2024, the government shall systematically enhance and develop the national cybersecurity system. The said actions include systemic organisational, operational, technological and legal measures as well as shaping social attitudes and conducting research and development projects to ensure achievement of high cybersecurity standards of software, hardware and digital services. The government shall take these actions by building confidence between the private sector and the public administration while respecting the rights and freedoms of the citizens. 4.2 Main goal Increasing the level of resilience to cyber threats6 and protection of information in the public, military and private sectors, as well as promoting knowledge and good practices to enable the citizens to better protect information. 6 ”Cyber threat” means any potential circumstance, event or action that could damage, disrupt or otherwise adversely impact network and information systems, the users of such systems and other persons – in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Official Journal of the EU, L 151, 07.06.2019, p. 15). 4.3 Specific objectives Specific objective 1. Development of the national cybersecurity system. Specific objective 2. Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and priva- te sector, and achieving the capacity to effecti- vely prevent and respond to incidents. Specific objective 3. Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology. Specific objective 4. Building public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity. Specific objective 5. Building strong international position of the Republic of Poland in the area of cybersecurity. 12 13 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 5. Specific objective 1 – Development of the national cybersecurity system 5.1 Implementation and evaluation of the functio- ning of the provisions re- garding the national cyber- security system The development of the national cy- bersecurity system is based on full implementation and evaluation of the functioning of provisions establishing the system, by reference to other regula- tions, in particular the Act of 26 April 2007 on crisis management (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, item 1398), the Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection of classified information (Jour- nal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, item 742) and the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland. The evaluation may entail the necessity to introduce respective amendments of pro- visions which remove barriers to effective information sharing and responding to incidents in a coordinated and unhinde- red manner. Amendments to regulations regarding the functioning of the national cybersecurity system shall arise also from practical func- tioning of Directive (EU) No. 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measu- res for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (Official Journal of the EU, L 194, 19.07.2016, p. 1), hereinafter referred to as „the NIS Directive”, at the European level. Experience arising from application of regulations in this respect shall also be a premise to request amending the provi- sions of the NIS Directive itself at the EU level in order to improve its effectiveness. Among areas requiring such amendments shall be further specification of responsi- bilities of digital services providers, speci- fically ones that provide cloud computing services which will be increasingly used as a data processing model for essential services. The responsibility for drafting amendments to regu- lations in the area of cybersecurity within their re- spective remits shall rest on competent ministers as defined in the Act of 4 September 1997 on divisions of the government administration (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, items 945, 1248 and 1696) and competent authorities in accordance with the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cyberse- curity system. As part of the legislative work, the minister com- petent for digitalisation, in cooperation with other ministries and competent authorities responsible for supervision of ICT systems in respective sectors, shall review sectoral and specific regulations which address the subject in question, as well as regula- tions which might affect other areas, for example personal data protection or critical infrastructure in the context of the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Programme. It shall also be necessary to undertake legislative work to regulate the area of development, acquisition and operation of speciali- sed dual-use tools for the purpose of defensive and offensive operations in cyberspace. The implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy shall involve regulating the issues of operational co- operation, including proper coordination of actions and information sharing between authorities re- sponsible for the national security, counter-terrorist efforts as well as internal security and public order. Due to rapid pace of changes occurring in area of cybersecurity, it will be necessary to continuously monitor the phenomena taking place there and initiate possible amendments in the law. Proposed directions and plans regarding counteracting cyber threats shall be reviewed by the Advisory Commit- tee for Cybersecurity under the Council of Ministers. It is a consultative and advisory body of the Coun- cil of Ministries in cybersecurity matters. Among its remits is also evaluation of operations of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV as well as sectoral cybersecurity teams and competent authorities for cybersecurity. 14 15 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 5.2 Enhancing the efficiency of the functioning of the national cybersecurity system The efficiency of the national cybersecurity system shall be enhanced by means of launching by 1 January 2021, by the minister competent for digitalisation, an ICT system supporting: 1. cooperation of entities of the national cybersecurity system; 2. generation and transfer of recommendations of activities increasing the level of cybersecurity; 3. incident reporting and handling; 4. risk assessment at the national level; 5. cyber threat warnings. Competent authorities responsible for supervision of ICT systems in sectors where essential and digital services are provided shall take actions to support the operators and providers in ensuring the security of their services. To this end, the competent authorities shall have a right to issue orga- nisational and technical recommendations and provide tools and knowledge regar- ding the best sectoral and cross-sectoral practices which increase cybersecurity. Development of the national cybersecurity system also entails the further increasing of capacity of institutions dealing with cyber- security at the operational level, including the three CSIRTs at the national level and cooperating with them sectoral cyberse- curity teams as well as information sharing and analysis centres. It is necessary to set up systemic solutions to share information and e knowledge about vulnerabilities, threats and incidents between all stakeholders. Within the framework of cooperation of go- vernment administration and local administra- tion, the government shall recommend and act for local administration units in the area of increasing their competences in designing cybersecurity enhancing processes, specifical- ly the selection, deployment and maintenance of technical assets that increase cybersecurity, including the utilise of state-of- the-art and secure cloud computing models, development of secure applications and utilise of secure mobile systems. Efficiency of the functioning of the national cybersecurity system shall also be increased by introducing standardisation of security solutions, including introduction of minimum security requirements for ICT networks and systems operated by the public administra- tion. The standardisation and cybersecurity requirements, developed and used by the public administration as part of the National Cybersecurity Standards, should also become a determinant of good practices for the priva- te sector and citizens. Sectoral and national exercises, initiated by the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, shall verify the efficiency of the functioning of the national cyberse- curity system. Moreover, the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland to conduct defensive operations in cyberspace will be increased through participation in national and international cybersecurity exercises. 5.3 Development of an information sharing system for the pur- pose national security management In order to increase the efficiency of management of national security, actions shall be taken to ensure information sharing and consultation of responses both at the strategic and operational level, in particular between the civilian and military spheres. It is necessary to set up an information sharing system for the public administration that would be resilient to cyber threats and based on state-of-the-art information sharing technologies taking into account the need for high mobility. The system shall be used in various states of exception and states of national defence readiness. 5.4 Enhancing cybersecurity of essential and digital services and critical infrastructure Information technologies (IT) used by operators of essential services, digital service providers, critical infrastructure operators (including telecommunications operators) are a critical element in 16 17 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND ensuring citizens security and continuity of operation of the state. Moreover, security of the most important sectors of the economy, specifically the energy sector, depends on ensuring undisturbed operation of industrial operational technologies (OT). This is why the government shall take ensuring of IT and OT cybersecurity as a priority. This has already been reflected in analyses regar- ding specification of security requirements that must be met by telecommunications operators, specifically when building the 5G network which will become the backbone for the functioning of the state in the area of mobile telecommunications. It is assumed that some legal amendments must be taken in this area in order to enable an appropriate control of ensuring cybersecurity. Furthermore, bearing in mind that the sole responsibility for en- suring security of services relies primarily on providers, the go- vernment shall take supporting actions to increase capacity and competences in cybersecurity of operators of essential services, critical infrastructure operators and digital service providers. These actions, for ensuring its adequacy, shall take into account their different specifics and their different cybersecurity maturity. In ad- dition, the government shall support all these entities in respon- ding to significant, critical and substantial incidents, especially in the event of cross-sectoral incidents. Firstly, consistent actions shall be taken to develop criteria of identification of critical infrastructure operators and operators of essential services, taking into account the need for including them into the crisis management system. This process shall be carried out in cooperation with all sectors. Based on mechanisms provi- ded for by a law, minimum cybersecurity requirements shall be recommended with a particular focusing on business continuity management. Digital service providers shall be covered by a similar regime. Ho- wever, the government is fully aware of the international nature of these entities and of the need to ensure such a regulations that support the development of a digital market in Poland. Therefore, actions in this area shall be conducted at the European level, par- ticularly within the NIS Cooperation Group, and within the frame- work of transatlantic cooperation with British and American insti- tutions which stir improvement of cybersecurity standards among digital service providers. 5.5 Development and implementation of a risk assessment methodology at the national level A joint static and dynamic risk assessment methodology that take into account the specificity of individual sectors, critical infrastruc- ture operators, operators of essential services and digital service providers, shall be introduced for the purpose of cybersecurity management at the national level. This shall ensure comparability of assessment, also regarding risk levels, in particular for the purpose of the national security risk reports, developed in accordance with the crisis management regulations. Risk assessment shall become a continuous process that will enable depicting the risk level in near real time. The methodology and tools enabling static and dynamic risk assessment in ICT sys- tems are being developed as part of the National Cybersecurity Platform project fun- ded by the National Centre for Research and Development – the completion of work is scheduled by the end of 2020. 5.6 Increasing capacity to counteract cybercrime, inclu- ding cyberespionage and incidents of a terrorist nature With regard to increasing the capacity to counteract cybercrime, including cybere- spionage and events of a hybrid nature (including events of a terrorist nature), it is important to provide support to operators of essential services, digital service provi- ders and critical infrastructure operators so that they can detect and combat incidents at any stage. To this end, cooperation and coordination of actions of law enforcement agencies is required irrespective of the motives of the perpetrators, and appropriate preservation of digital evidence is particularly important. Increasing the effectiveness of procedural and operational activities requires esta- blishing and broadening the interaction of law enfo rcement agencies with other entities that may have knowledge which is helpful to determine the substance of an offence or identify the perpetrator. This includes cooperation with national and inter- national private sector entities, in particular in the telecommunications, banking and insurance sectors. It is also necessary to ensure continuous information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities, both at the national and international level. Given the nature of cyberspace, combating cybercrime requires cross-border coope- ration of law enforcement agencies and CERT/CSIRT units. The time factor is critical in procedural actions and operational investigation related to offences committed in cyberspace. This means that efficient and reliable information sharing channels between law en- forcement agencies of different countries are required. Given the dynamic nature of cyberspace offences and the related need to take pro- cedural and operational actions, it is necessary to introduce regulations that enable processing and transfer of electronic procedural documents. Rapidly changing methods of crime require development of research in the field of combating cybercrime, the results of which will provide support to law enforcement agencies. The results of this research will be used in the work of law enforcement and judicial authorities, and will provide material to develop preventive measures. Aware- ness campaigns shall be enrolled to inform the public about cybercrime threats and methods to prevent or mitigate them. Operators of essential services, providers of digital and Internet access services as well as NGOs and public entities shall play an important role in this type of activity. 7 The methodology and tools enabling static and dynamic risk assessment in ICT systems are being developed as part of the research project titled „The National Cybersecurity Platform”, carried out by the Research and Academic Computer Network (NASK) and funded by the National Centre for Research and Development as part of the CyberSecIdent Programme – Cybersecurity and e-Identity. 18 19 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 6. Specific objective 2 – Increasing the level of resi- lience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents 6.1 Development and implementation of National Cybersecurity Standards and disseminate of good practices and re- commendations Based on the expertise of technical committees of the Polish Committee for Standardisation, research centres, academia and research institutes as well as public and private entities concerned, new standards shall be developed or the existing norms and standards shall be translated into specific recom- mendations regarding their implementation. In order to increase the resilience to cyber threats of informa- tion systems used by the public administration it is necessary to develop National Cybersecurity Standards as a set of orga- nisational and technical requirements regarding, in particular, the security of: • applications; • mobile devices; • workstations; • servers and networks; • cloud computing models. In order to ensure secure and cost-effective processing in- frastructure of the public administration’s IT systems, which will soon start using new forms of processing and storage of information, including cloud computing, it will be necessary to develop recommendations and disseminate good practices which increase the resilience to potential cyber threats. Execution of public tasks, in particular, ones connected with cybersecurity, shall be supported by application of Polish Standards based on the European and international standards. References to standards should also be widely used over the entire life cycle of the ICT systems. It is also important to sup- port execution of recommendations issued by market regula- tors. 6.2 Supply chain security Ensuring cybersecurity requires application of organisational and technical protections over the entire life cycle of the ICT systems. These actions comprise the so-called secure supply chain and include designing, developing, deploying, operating and disposing g. The term supply chain means a system which consists of subsystems of production, distribution, transport, storage and recycling of ICT systems components, as well as their installation, launch, ongoing maintenance, servicing and repairs. 20 21 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND An important element of ensuring a quality assurance in the supply chain is the evaluation and certification of products (software, hardware and services in parti- cular). The priority in this regard shall be to establish, and subsequently maintain and develop, a national s cybersecurity evaluation and certification scheme based on operations of accredited conformity as- sessment bodies, which shall enable the Republic of Poland to achieve full and internationally recognised status of an Authorizing Member country in providing cybersecurity solutions. The Republic of Poland shall actively participate in the work on establishing European cybersecurity certification schemes in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certi- fication and repealing Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act). Actions at the national level shall include, in particular, designation of the national cybersecurity certification authority which shall issue European cybersecurity certificates, supervise national conformity assessment bodies which assess compliance of products, servi- ces and processes with the requirements set forth in the European cybersecurity certification schemes and cooperate with the national accreditation body – the Polish Centre for Accreditation in order to monitor and supervise activities of accredited national con- formity assessment bodies which assess compliance with respect to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council. These actions shall result in achieving, at the natio- nal level, the ability to support Polish manufacturers which, when holding European cybersecurity certifica- tes, will be able to compete more efficiently on the of the European Union’s Digital Single Market. 8 Bug-bounty – search for software vulnerabilities conducted by people not associated with the software developer, usually with the general consent of the developer. 6.3 Security tests and audits Periodic audits are among measures that enable assessment of the effectiveness of the currently implemented information security management systems and the adequacy of the safeguards introduced. Audit methodologies should take into account applicable standards, good practices and specificity of respective sec- tors. The aim of such an approach is to achieve comparability of audit outcomes. Periodic tests (including penetration testing), which provide for a real assessment of the system’s resilience to threats, are another security assessment measure. Outcomes of these tests are the basis for verification of the safeguards deployed. In order to utilise the public capacity in the area of cybersecurity, the so-called bug-bounty8 testing shall be disseminated. 22 23 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 7. Specific objective 3 – Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology 7.1 Development of industrial and technological resources for the purposes of cybersecurity The government aims to invest in develop- ment of industrial and technological resour- ces for the purpose of cybersecurity by creating the conditions needed for the development of businesses, in particular SMEs and start-ups, as well as research and development institutes which are dealing with a development of new solutions in the area if cybersecurity. The prio- rities include increased capabilities in the area of designing and producing software, hardware and services used in all branches of the Polish industry to improve its competitiveness. The acquisition of new technologies for de- velopment of domestic ventures shall also be realised through participation in international initiatives that emphasise innovation, and thro- ugh bilateral cooperation and within internatio- nal organisations, including the European Cy- bersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre planned by the European Commission and the EU’s Member States. Moreover, the government shall strive to ac- tively disseminate knowledge and trainings among Polish entrepreneurs and to implement cybersecurity technologies enabling full use of the capabilities of other state-of-the-art digital technologies, including AI-based autonomous systems, in production and service provision processes. Actions shall be taken to stir the increase of cybersecurity competences of research and higher education institutions. By means of legal instruments, the government shall stir higher education institutions to provide teaching helpful in attracting cybersecurity specialist, including as part of first and secon- d-cycle studies, doctoral schools and post- -graduate programmes. In order to even the chances of Polish entre- preneurs on the global market, the govern- ment shall support development of digital competences of Polish businesses and ensure assistance in applying for funding of innovati- ve solutions as well as consultancy regarding access to new markets and assistance in esta- blishing cooperation with other businesses. 7.2 Focus on developing of public-private cooperation Ensuring security in cyberspace requires joint efforts of the private sector, the public sector and the citizens. The government shall con- tinue to establish an effective public-private partnership system based on trust and shared responsibility for cybersecurity. 9 Among examples of actions aimed at developing the Polish industry and its competitiveness in the digital transformation era is the „Industry 4.0” programme run by the minister competent for economy. As part of this programme, Digital Innovation Hubs will be selected by way of a competitive process which will provide standardised support to entrepreneurs in digital transformation, including in the area of cybersecurity. At the same time, public administration shall improve its capacity in initia- ting and running cybersecurity projects. The government shall also acti- vely participate in the existing and emerging forms of European public- -private cooperation, thus promoting Polish business internationally. In implementing a new vision of the country’s development and suppor- ting the innovation of the Polish economy, it will be important to set up a system of support for research and development projects in the area of cybersecurity conducted in cooperation with the academia and busines- ses. 7.3 Stimulating research and development in the area of cybersecurity In view of the dynamically growing IT market, especially in view of the shi- ft to IPv6 communication protocol, and in connection with development of the Internet of Things, Smart Cities, Industry 4.0 as well as Cloud Com- puting, broadband mobile communication network (5G and next genera- tions) and Big Data, it is necessary to intensify research, development and manufacturing activities in the area of cybersecurity. To this end, research programmes10 aimed at development and implementation of new me- thods of protection against cyber threats shall be continued in coopera- tion with the National Centre for Research and Development. In the face of the dynamical development of technologies related to inter alia the Internet of Things, special attention should be paid to the need to ensure product, service and process security as early as at the design stage (Security by Design)11 as well as data protection and privacy (Privacy by Design)12.The government shall disseminate and support the security- -by-design approach. In addition, research programmes shall be developed in cooperation with the scientific and academic community in order to, in particular: • assess the effectiveness of protections and resilience to cyber threats; • assess the effectiveness of responding to incidents; • develop methods of detecting and analysis new types of cybercrime, cyberterrorism and cyberespionage; • study methods of attacks (including attacks of a hybrid nature) and measures to counteract these attacks and mitigate their effects; • protect democratic processes against disruption by cyber threats. 10 The Ministry of Digital affairs will continue to cooperate with the National Centre for Research and Development in inter alia the CyberSecIdent – Cybersecurity and e-Identity Programme. 11 Security by design – an approach to the product or system development which consists in considering security and integration of security features from the point of conception.

Based on Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) - Official Journal of the EU, L 119, 04.05.2016, pp 1). 24 25 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND The research and development activities shall be carried out also in the area of international cooperation within the EU and the NATO. Important tasks for ensuring cybersecurity are perfor- med by non-governmental organisations, which are very efficient organisers of educational activities for the society and providers of analyses and opinions for the public administration. It is also possible to acquire experts with unique skills through analytical centres for the purposes of solving complex cybersecurity issues. 7.4 Gaining the capacity to perform a full spectrum of military operations in cyberspace The Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, as the fun- damental element of the state defence system, should be involved in activities in cyberspace at the same level as in the air, on the ground and at sea, in peacetime, during war and in crisis situations alike. Therefore, the ability to conduct a full spectrum of military operations in cyberspace must include the identification of threats, the protection and defence of ICT systems, and comba- ting cyber threats. Activities in cyberspace represent an integral part of planned operations to be conducted by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland both on their own and in co-operation within alliances and coalitions. The structure of the Armed Force of the Republic of Poland will be improved by establishing and strengthening of formations tasked with conducting tasks in cyberspace, which have capabilities to identify, prevent and combat cyber threats. Readiness to military and non-military interoperability in cyberspace at the national and inter- national level within alliances, coalitions and accords will be developed. Qualifications of the personnel conduc- ting military operations in cyberspace will be constantly improved by means of training courses. At the same time, threats will be identified on an on-going basis and the situation will be assessed – also in terms of com- pliance with international law – which will provide for selecting appropriate methods and tools to protect and defend own resources and eliminate sources of threats to ICT networks and systems, both stationary and mo- bile. Bearing in mind the rapid pace of development of technologies that make up the cyberspace environment, the Ministry of National Defence will strive to develop or acquire an innovative methods and tools to ensure operational effectiveness in this domain. 8. Specific objective 4 – Building public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity 8.1 Increasing competence of the staff of entities relevant to ensuring cybersecurity of the Republic of Poland Competences of the staff of entities re- levant to ensuring cybersecurity of the Republic of Poland shall be increased through establishing and introducing of such a model of the academic education and professional development which will ensure appropriate qualifications of employees. To this end, mo- del academic programmes shall be developed for a dedicated field of cybersecurity. Within the framework of the broadly under- stood expert education, in order to more effectively counteract growing cybercrime, the system of training for all employees of entities relevant to ensuring cybersecurity and for representatives of law enforcement agencies and the judiciary shall be enhanced by putting in place a dedicated educational programme including both theoretical and practical trainings based on real examples of threats. In order to retain highly qualified employees in public administration, alongside the use of other instruments supporting their activity, actions shall be taken to bring their salaries closer to the level they could obtain when working in the private sector. At the same time, the government shall de- velop and implement a systemic support for increasing competences of employees of the local government administration units in the area of cybersecurity. The managerial staff of local government administration units shall dynamically define responsibilities and authorisations of persons who play important roles in cybersecurity management and appropriately communicate these decisions to all stakeholders. 26 27 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 8.2 Creating conditions for the safe use of cyberspace by citizens Cybersecurity education should be available as early as possible in the process of accessing digital services by children and youth – preferably even before they enter the digital world,. In practice, it is often required at the stage of early childhood education. Having regard to the issue of safe use of cyberspace, it is assumed that teachers shall receive support in execution their respective teaching programme, specifically in updating their teaching programmes through various activities conducted in accordance with the current knowledge regarding safe use of modern technologies. In addition, actions shall be taken to support continuous professional development of teachers in the area of modern technologies and cybersecurity, taking into account diagnosed needs of a given school or establishment. Higher education institutions shall be encouraged to develop interdisciplinary specialisations covering inter alia information security management, assessment and evaluation of ICT system safeguards, protection of personal data, protection of intellectual property on the Internet as well as issues related to the development of new technologies and the related challenges. 8.3 Developing public awareness towards the safe use of cyberspace In cooperation with NGOs, academia and private sector, the public administration shall continue sys- temic actions to raise public awareness of the cyber threats. Educational actions shall be taken regarding the rights and freedoms in the digital environment and the rights of cyberattack victims and individu- als who suffered losses as a result of on-line privacy breaches. Public campaigns aimed at various target groups, including children, parents and elders, shall also be continued. In the face of increasingly numerous threats aimed at exerting specific influence on the society, and having regard to consequences of intentional use of social engineering tools to carry out manipulative actions, such as disinformation campaigns and inspirational or disintegration actions, it is required to take sys- temic measures to develop public awareness in the context of verifying authenticity of information and responding to attempts to distort in. As regards de- fence against manipulative actions, which may be an element of a hybrid nature operations, it is important to build capabilities among the society to identify actions aimed at affecting awareness or converting or disintegrating specific communities. 9. Specific objective 5 – Building strong international position of the Republic of Po- land in the area of cybersecurity 9.1 Active international cooperation at the strategic and political level In the face of the widespread globalisation processes and the related interdependence between countries, international coopera- tion is crucial for achieving security of global cyberspace. While carrying out these tasks at the Europe- an level, the Republic of Poland shall intensify its efforts to ensure the security of the EU’s Digital Single Market - the driving force be- hind economic growth and innovation. Mo- reover, it is important to strive to take greater account of the aspects of cybersecurity in the work on development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. Poland’s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is an important pillar of the country’s security, as well as the security of entire Euro-Atlantic area. Ever more inten- sive attacks of a hybrid nature make it essen- tial to invest in deterrence and defence capa- bilities, including increasing of the resilience and ability to respond quickly and effectively to cyberattacks. Through cooperation within the United Nations system, the Republic of Poland shall strive to continue the debate on an effecti- ve system of governance of the world wide web and issues related to the legal aspects of cyberattacks in order to develop coherent solutions that ensure the reliability of interna- tional information sharing on the Internet. In the legal and international context, it is crucial for individual countries to strive to achieve the widest consensus possible regarding the manner in which international law applies to cyberspace activities. The Republic of Poland – in cooperation with like-minded partners – shall promote the position that internatio- nal law, now in force, most importantly the United Nations Charter, applies to cyberspa- ce. The Republic of Poland acknowledges its commitment to the voluntary principles of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace developed by the UN Group of Governmen- tal Experts, and calls for application of the entire international law to state activities in cyberspace and implementation of confiden- ce building measures to mitigate the risk of conflicts arising from cyber threats. The Republic of Poland shall actively participate in strengthening security and confidence buil- ding measures within the existing internatio- nal fora, including the OSCE. The government shall also join the efforts to effectively combat cybercrime internationally. Particular importance is attached to coope- ration with the countries of the region, inclu- ding strengthening of cooperation within the Visegrad Group and Three Seas Initiative. Implementation of the Polish foreign policy can also include signing bilateral and mul- tilateral international agreements or legally non-binding understandings regarding co- 28 29 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND operation in the area of cybersecurity with countries of developed technological capacity. Strengthening of international position of the Republic of Poland will only be pos- sible through internal close collaboration between Polish institutions and agencies responsible for ensuring cybersecurity, especially between the Ministry of Digital Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is solely responsible for the coordi- nation of the foreign policy of the Repu- blic of Poland. Achieving a strong international position of the Republic of Poland in the area of cybersecurity will not be possible without having the necessary domestic expertise. Staff resources supported by adequate funding shall be the basis for building the image of the Republic of Poland as a com- petent player at the international area. In this context, it is important for Polish experts to actively participate in discus- sions in regional and global fora and per- form a key roles in international organisa- tions, thus contributing to the successful execution of foreign policy in the area of cybersecurity. In order to acquire skills, develop knowledge and share best prac- tices, the Republic of Poland shall attach ever greater importance to international bilateral and multilateral cooperation in matters of education, training and exerci- se, as well as awareness building. In the area of international cooperation, the Republic of Poland will actively parti- cipate in exercises conducted by national organisations, EU and NATO as well as other international agencies. 9.2 Active international cooperation at the operational and technical level International cooperation at the opera- tional and technical level shall be carried out inter alia within the CSIRT Network at European Union level, in other fora for information sharing and analysis of the IT security situation of a given sector, through other international cooperation networks, like the FIRST or TF-CSIRT, information sharing platforms, like the MISP or n6, and within bilateral and multilateral cooperation. In this context, it shall be particularly important to de- velop common operational procedures within the EU and NATO, and the Vise- grad Group. Cooperation at this level will not only serve to effectively counteract cyber threats , but will also contribute to the share of experience between tech- nical staff in joint ventures. It shall also be an opportunity to promote Polish technological solutions and Polish expert staff. Development of international coope- ration is also possible through partici- pation of public institutions involved in ensuring cybersecurity in international fora for information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities. 30 31 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND 10.Managing the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland 11. Funding The Cybersecurity Strategy is adopted for a period of 5 years. The implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy is coordinated by the minister competent for digitalisation. The document is subject to review and evaluation two years after its adoption and in the fourth year of its term. The outcomes of the review are presented to the Council of Ministers. As a result of the review, the minister competent for digi- talisation shall draft a proposal of correc- tive actions or a draft document for the next five-year period. Where justified, the Cybersecurity Strategy may be updated at dates other than said above. Within six months of the adoption of the Cybersecurity Strategy, the Coordi- nator - in cooperation with members of the Council of Ministers, heads of central offices, Director of the Government Centre for Security and other authorities listed in the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system - shall develop an Action Plan for the Implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy and submit it to the Council of Ministers for approval. When developing the Action Plan, the above-mentioned authorities shall take into account in their activities the issues of cybersecurity in accordance with their sta- tutory remit. The Action Plan shall include, in particular: • name of a specific objective; • name of the task; • name of the action serving the accom- plishment of the task; • type of action – legislative, organi- sational, technological, educational, informational, promotional, other; • schedule – the start and end date of the initiative concerned; • authority or authorities – the leading authority and authorities cooperating in the execution of the task (if any); • expected impacts; • estimated cost. The Action Plan includes project-type ac- tions with the start and end date of execu- tion and deliverables. The Minister of National Defence may, in consultation with the Coordinator, develop a separate Action Plan which is subject to an approval by the President of the Council of Ministers. Elements of the Action Plan which contain classified infor- mation are subject to the provisions of the Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection of classified information (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland, item 742). The Minister of National Defence sends, for the purposes of information and coordi- nation, the accepted Action Plan to the minister competent for digitalisation and the Government Plenipotentiary for Cy- bersecurity. The Coordinator shall annually develop a progress report on the implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy for the previous year on the basis of information received from the entities involved in its execution. The reports shall be submitted to the Co- uncil of Ministers by 30 September. If a separate Action Plan is developed, the Minister of National Defence submits a report on the execution of that Action Plan to the Council of Ministers via the Coordinator. Entities carrying out public tasks are required to include expenditures on cybersecurity in their finan- cial plans in accordance with the relevant regulations. These expenditures have additionally included outlays on expansion of the national cybersecurity system and expenditures incurred on the execution of other pro- jects as part of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy. The detailed size and structure of costs of individual projects shall be determined in the process of initiation of specific projects. Estimation of the funding costs for the of the Cybersecurity Strategy shall take place within the framework of the Action Plan. Funding sources for the execution of measures laid down in the document shall be financial plans of au- thorities involved in the implementation of the Cyber- security Strategy as well as funds from the National Centre for Research and Development and from the European Union13, as far as possible. 13 EU programmes providing for funding of cybersecurity-related projects include, in particular: Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF Telcom) – both conducted as part of the EU multiannual financial framework 2014–2021. Other two large programmes are scheduled for launch within the next EU financial perspective (2021–2028) - they are Digital Europe and Horizon Europe. 32 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND",

It is a result of analysis of current and  future challenges and threats to the increasingly vigorous digital  transformation of the Polish economy and public administration.  The strategy defines the areas of activities supporting the imple- mentation of the main objective, which is to increase the level  of resilience to cyber threats and to strengthen data protection  through the development of the National Cybersecurity System,  which consists of professional staff, threat-conscious users, safe  and effective processes along with modern and security-checked  information technologies.  The adoption of the Act on the national cybersecurity system in  2018 created the legal and organisational basis for building, for  the first time in history, a comprehensive cybersecurity system  in Poland. This system will be continuously developed, as clearly  indicated in one of the specific objectives set out in the Strategy.  Moreover, the priorities of the Polish government in the area of  information security were indicated. These include raising public  awareness on cyber threats, supporting initiatives aimed at cre- ating innovative solutions and tools, strengthening cooperation  with the private sector and developing digital services using new  generations of mobile networks and large-scale data collection  and analysis systems.    A high level of cybersecurity can be achieved through the wide  application of best practices, implementation of new legislative  and organisational solutions, as well as through international  operational cooperation and information sharing.  The strategy is also a starting point for the development of a  detailed Action Plan, which will include specific projects with key  performance indicators and identification of financing sources.  The Act, the Strategy and the future Action Plan are a set of tools  for public administration. The tools that have one common goal  - to ensure safe, undisturbed access to the opportunities resul- ting from the digital transformation, serving the rapid develop- ment of the economy and raising citizens’ living standards.

Dynamic progress of information systems serves the deve- lopment of the national economy, in particular communications,  commerce, transport and financial services. Digital technologies  that comprise cyberspace1 are used for shaping social relation- ships. Moreover, online services have become a tool for  effecting on the behaviour of social groups, as well as exerting  influence in the political sphere.  Any significant disruption to the functioning of cyberspace,  whether global or local, will have an impact on economic activi- ty, citizen’s sense of security and safety, the efficiency of public  sector institutions, production and service processes,   and as a result on national security in general.  Protection of information systems and information processed  therein is a challenge for all entities of the national cybersecu- rity system, i.e. businesses providing services using information  systems, public authorities, institutions responsible for the na- tional security, and specialised entities dealing with cybersecu- rity at the operational level. It is even more important as Poland  is closely connected with other countries through international  cooperation within organisations such as the European Union  (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the United  Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Security and Coopera- tion in Europe (OSCE). This cooperation plays an important role  in responding to the increasing number of incidents caused   by illegal activities in cyberspace that are leading to tangi- ble and reputational damages which are growing by the year.  Criminal activities are being taken by individuals, organised  crime groups, as well as, groups sponsored by governmental  institutions and armed forces of countries which conduct offen- sive actions focused specifically on cyberespionage and gathe- ring intelligence on other states’ defence capabilities.  1. Introduction – rationale for  actions to increase cybersecurity  1 Cyberspace is the space for processing and exchanging information formed by ICT systems defined in Article 3(3) of the Act of 17 February 2005 on the computerisa- tion of activities of entities performing public tasks (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, items 700, 730, 848 and 1590), including relations between them  and relationships with the users – in accordance with Article 2(1b) of the Act of 29 August 2002 on the martial law and competences of the Supreme Commander of the  Armed Forces and the rules of his subordination to the constitutional authorities of the Republic of Poland (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2017, item 1932).    8 9  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  2. Strategic context of cyberse- curity in the Republic of Poland  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 is a continuation and  extension of actions taken by the government administration to increase the level of cyber-  security in the Republic of Poland. As part of actions taken to date, the Act of 5 July 2018 on the  national cybersecurity system (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland, item 1560)2 entered into  force and the government beforehand also adopted the following documents:  • in 2013, the Policy for the Protection of Cyberspace of the Republic of Poland, • in 2017, the National Framework of Cybersecurity Policy of the Republic of Poland for   2017–2022.  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 supersedes the National Fra- mework of Cybersecurity of the Republic of Poland for 2017–2022 adopted under Resolution no.  52/2017 of the Council of Ministers of 27 April 2017 regarding the National Framework of Cyber- security of the Republic of Poland 2017–2022.  The purpose of this document is to define strategic objectives and relevant political and regulatory  measures to achieve a high level of cybersecurity, principally a resilience to cyber threats of infor- mation systems used by operators of essential services , critical infrastructure operators, digital  service providers  and the public administration, as well as to increase information protection in  the information systems by means of standardised safeguards. The achievement of the strategic  objectives shall also contribute to increasing the national security, improving the effectiveness of  law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities in detecting and combating cybercrime, events  of a hybrid nature (including events of a terrorist nature) and cyberespionage.  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024 is aligned with ongoing ope- rations related to ICT systems used by critical infrastructure operators. It also takes into account  the need to enable the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland - in domestic, alliance and co- alition contexts - to conduct military operations in the event of cyber threat which requires defen- sive operations.  By implementing the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024, the govern- ment will fully guarantee the right to privacy and hold the position that free and open Internet is  an important element of the functioning of a modern society.  2 The Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system implements Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concer- ning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (Official Journal of the EU L 194, 19.07.2016, p. 1). 3 Applies to operators of essential services referred to in Article 5 of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system. 4 Applies to digital service providers referred to in Article 17 of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cybersecurity system.  3. Scope of the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the   Republic of Poland for 2019–2024  The Strategy takes into account, in particular5:  1. cybersecurity objectives and priorities; 2. entities involved in the implementation and deployment of the Strategy; 3. measures used to achieve the objectives of the Strategy; 4. specification of means for readiness, response and restoration, including principles    of public-private cooperation; 5. risk assessment approach; 6. activities related to educational, information and training programmes regarding    cybersecurity; 7. activities related to research and development plans regarding cybersecurity.   Furthermore, the Strategy takes into account international cooperation regarding cybersecurity.

Specific objective   1 – Development of the national  cybersecurity system  5.1 Implementation and  evaluation of the functio- ning of the provisions re- garding the national cyber- security system  The development of the national cy- bersecurity system is based on full   implementation and evaluation of the  functioning of provisions establishing  the system, by reference to other regula- tions, in particular the Act of 26 April 2007  on crisis management (Journal of Laws  of the Republic of Poland of 2019, item  1398), the Act of 5 August 2010 on the  protection of classified information (Jour- nal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of  2019, item 742) and the National Security  Strategy of the Republic of Poland. The  evaluation may entail the necessity to  introduce respective amendments of pro- visions which remove barriers to effective  information sharing and responding to  incidents in a coordinated and unhinde- red manner.  Amendments to regulations regarding the  functioning of the national cybersecurity  system shall arise also from practical func- tioning of Directive (EU) No. 2016/1148  of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measu- res for a high common level of security of  network and information systems across  the Union (Official Journal of the EU, L  194, 19.07.2016, p. 1), hereinafter referred  to as „the NIS Directive”, at the European  level. Experience arising from application   of regulations in this respect shall also be  a premise to request amending the provi- sions of the NIS Directive itself at the EU  level in order to improve its effectiveness.  Among areas requiring such amendments  shall be further specification of responsi- bilities of digital services providers, speci- fically ones that provide cloud computing  services which will be increasingly used  as a data processing model for essential  services.  The responsibility for drafting amendments to regu- lations in the area of cybersecurity within their re- spective remits shall rest on competent ministers as  defined in the Act of 4 September 1997 on divisions  of the government administration (Journal of Laws  of the Republic of Poland of 2019, items 945, 1248  and 1696) and competent authorities in accordance  with the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cyberse- curity system.  As part of the legislative work, the minister com- petent for digitalisation, in cooperation with other  ministries and competent authorities responsible  for supervision of ICT systems in respective sectors,  shall review sectoral and specific regulations which  address the subject in question, as well as regula- tions which might affect other areas, for example  personal data protection or critical infrastructure  in the context of the National Critical Infrastructure  Protection Programme. It shall also be necessary to  undertake legislative work to regulate the area of  development, acquisition and operation of speciali- sed dual-use tools for the purpose of defensive and  offensive operations in cyberspace.  The implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy  shall involve regulating the issues of operational co- operation, including proper coordination of actions  and information sharing between authorities re- sponsible for the national security, counter-terrorist  efforts as well as internal security and public order.  Due to rapid pace of changes occurring in area of  cybersecurity, it will be necessary to continuously  monitor the phenomena taking place there and  initiate possible amendments in the law. Proposed  directions and plans regarding counteracting cyber  threats shall be reviewed by the Advisory Commit- tee for Cybersecurity under the Council of Ministers.  It is a consultative and advisory body of the Coun- cil of Ministries in cybersecurity matters. Among  its remits is also evaluation of operations of CSIRT  MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV as well as sectoral  cybersecurity teams and competent authorities for  cybersecurity.     14 15  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  5.2 Enhancing the efficiency of the functioning of the national  cybersecurity system The efficiency of the national cybersecurity system shall be enhanced by means of launching by 1  January 2021, by the minister competent for digitalisation, an ICT system supporting:  1. cooperation of entities of the national cybersecurity system; 2. generation and transfer of recommendations of activities increasing the level of cybersecurity; 3. incident reporting and handling; 4. risk assessment at the national level; 5. cyber threat warnings.  Competent authorities responsible for  supervision of ICT systems in sectors where  essential and digital services are provided  shall take actions to support the operators  and providers in ensuring the security of  their services. To this end, the competent  authorities shall have a right to issue orga- nisational and technical recommendations  and provide tools and knowledge regar- ding the best sectoral and cross-sectoral  practices which increase cybersecurity. Development of the national cybersecurity  system also entails the further increasing of  capacity of institutions dealing with cyber- security at the operational level, including  the three CSIRTs at the national level and  cooperating with them sectoral cyberse- curity teams as well as information sharing   and analysis centres. It is necessary to set up  systemic solutions to share information and e  knowledge about vulnerabilities, threats and  incidents between all stakeholders.  Within the framework of cooperation of go- vernment administration and local administra- tion, the government shall recommend and  act for local administration units in the area  of increasing their competences in designing  cybersecurity enhancing processes, specifical- ly the selection, deployment and maintenance  of technical assets that increase cybersecurity,  including the utilise of state-of- the-art and  secure cloud computing models, development  of secure applications and utilise of secure  mobile systems.  Efficiency of the functioning of the national  cybersecurity system shall also be increased  by introducing standardisation of security  solutions, including introduction of minimum  security requirements for ICT networks and  systems operated by the public administra- tion. The standardisation and cybersecurity  requirements, developed and used by the  public administration as part of the National  Cybersecurity Standards, should also become  a determinant of good practices for the priva- te sector and citizens.      Sectoral and national exercises, initiated  by the Government Plenipotentiary for  Cybersecurity, shall verify the efficiency of  the functioning of the national cyberse- curity system. Moreover, the capabilities  of the Armed Forces of the Republic of  Poland to conduct defensive operations  in cyberspace will be increased through  participation in national and international  cybersecurity exercises.  5.3 Development of an information sharing system for the pur- pose national security management In order to increase the efficiency of management of national security, actions shall be taken to  ensure information sharing and consultation of responses both at the strategic and operational  level, in particular between the civilian and military spheres. It is necessary to set up an information  sharing system for the public administration that would be resilient to cyber threats and based on  state-of-the-art information sharing technologies taking into account the need for high mobility.  The system shall be used in various states of exception and states of national defence readiness.  5.4 Enhancing cybersecurity of essential and digital services and  critical infrastructure  Information technologies (IT) used by operators of essential services, digital service providers,  critical infrastructure operators (including telecommunications operators) are a critical element in     16 17  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  ensuring citizens security and continuity of operation of the state.  Moreover, security of the most important sectors of the economy,  specifically the energy sector, depends on ensuring undisturbed  operation of industrial operational technologies (OT). This is why  the government shall take ensuring of IT and OT cybersecurity  as a priority. This has already been reflected in analyses regar- ding specification of security requirements that must be met by  telecommunications operators, specifically when building the 5G  network which will become the backbone for the functioning of  the state in the area of mobile telecommunications. It is assumed  that some legal amendments must be taken in this area in order  to enable an appropriate control of ensuring cybersecurity.  Furthermore, bearing in mind that the sole responsibility for en- suring security of services relies primarily on providers, the go- vernment shall take supporting actions to increase capacity and  competences in cybersecurity of operators of essential services,  critical infrastructure operators and digital service providers. These  actions, for ensuring its adequacy, shall take into account their  different specifics and their different cybersecurity maturity. In ad- dition, the government shall support all these entities in respon- ding to significant, critical and substantial incidents, especially in  the event of cross-sectoral incidents.  Firstly, consistent actions shall be taken to develop criteria of  identification of critical infrastructure operators and operators of  essential services, taking into account the need for including them  into the crisis management system. This process shall be carried  out in cooperation with all sectors. Based on mechanisms provi- ded for by a law, minimum cybersecurity requirements shall be  recommended with a particular focusing on business continuity  management.  Digital service providers shall be covered by a similar regime. Ho- wever, the government is fully aware of the international nature  of these entities and of the need to ensure such a regulations that  support the development of a digital market in Poland. Therefore,  actions in this area shall be conducted at the European level, par- ticularly within the NIS Cooperation Group, and within the frame- work of transatlantic cooperation with British and American insti- tutions which stir improvement of cybersecurity standards among  digital service providers.  5.5 Development and implementation   of a risk assessment methodology at the  national level A joint static and dynamic risk assessment methodology that take  into account the specificity of individual sectors, critical infrastruc- ture operators, operators of essential services and digital service  providers, shall be introduced for the purpose of cybersecurity  management at the national level. This shall ensure comparability   of assessment, also regarding risk levels, in particular for the purpose of the national  security risk reports, developed in accordance with the crisis management regulations.  Risk assessment shall become a continuous process that will enable depicting the risk  level in near real time.  The methodology and tools enabling static and dynamic risk assessment in ICT sys- tems are being developed as part of the National Cybersecurity Platform project fun- ded by the National Centre for Research and Development – the completion of work  is scheduled by the end of 2020.  5.6 Increasing capacity to counteract cybercrime, inclu- ding cyberespionage and incidents of a terrorist nature With regard to increasing the capacity to counteract cybercrime, including cybere- spionage and events of a hybrid nature (including events of a terrorist nature), it is  important to provide support to operators of essential services, digital service provi- ders and critical infrastructure operators so that they can detect and combat incidents  at any stage. To this end, cooperation and coordination of actions of law enforcement  agencies is required irrespective of the motives of the perpetrators, and appropriate  preservation of digital evidence is particularly important.  Increasing the effectiveness of procedural and operational activities requires esta- blishing and broadening the interaction of law enfo rcement agencies with other  entities that may have knowledge which is helpful to determine the substance of an  offence or identify the perpetrator. This includes cooperation with national and inter- national private sector entities, in particular in the telecommunications, banking and  insurance sectors. It is also necessary to ensure continuous information sharing on  threats and vulnerabilities, both at the national and international level.  Given the nature of cyberspace, combating cybercrime requires cross-border coope- ration of law enforcement agencies and CERT/CSIRT units. The time factor is critical  in procedural actions and operational investigation related to offences committed in  cyberspace.  This means that efficient and reliable information sharing channels between law en- forcement agencies of different countries are required.  Given the dynamic nature of cyberspace offences and the related need to take pro- cedural and operational actions, it is necessary to introduce regulations that enable  processing and transfer of electronic procedural documents.  Rapidly changing methods of crime require development of research in the field of  combating cybercrime, the results of which will provide support to law enforcement  agencies. The results of this research will be used in the work of law enforcement and  judicial authorities, and will provide material to develop preventive measures. Aware- ness campaigns shall be enrolled to inform the public about cybercrime threats and  methods to prevent or mitigate them. Operators of essential services, providers of  digital and Internet access services as well as NGOs and public entities shall play an  important role in this type of activity.  7 The methodology and tools enabling static and dynamic risk assessment in ICT systems are being developed as part of the research project titled „The  National Cybersecurity Platform”, carried out by the Research and Academic Computer Network (NASK) and funded by the National Centre for Research  and Development as part of the CyberSecIdent Programme – Cybersecurity and e-Identity.    18 19  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  6. Specific objective   2 – Increasing the level of resi- lience of information systems  of the public administration and  private sector, and achieving the  capacity to effectively prevent  and respond to incidents  6.1 Development and implementation  of National Cybersecurity Standards and  disseminate of good practices and re- commendations  Based on the expertise of technical committees of the Polish  Committee for Standardisation, research centres, academia   and research institutes as well as public and private entities  concerned, new standards shall be developed or the existing  norms and standards shall be translated into specific recom- mendations regarding their implementation.  In order to increase the resilience to cyber threats of informa- tion systems used by the public administration it is necessary  to develop National Cybersecurity Standards as a set of orga- nisational and technical requirements regarding, in particular,  the security of:  • applications; • mobile devices; • workstations; • servers and networks; • cloud computing models.  In order to ensure secure and cost-effective processing in- frastructure of the public administration’s IT systems, which  will soon start using new forms of processing and storage of  information, including cloud computing, it will be necessary  to develop recommendations and disseminate good practices  which increase the resilience to potential cyber threats. Execution of public tasks, in particular, ones connected with  cybersecurity, shall be supported by application of Polish  Standards based on the European and international standards.  References to standards should also be widely used over the  entire life cycle of the ICT systems. It is also important to sup- port execution of recommendations issued by market regula- tors.  6.2 Supply chain security Ensuring cybersecurity requires application of organisational  and technical protections over the entire life cycle of the ICT  systems. These actions comprise the so-called secure supply  chain and include designing, developing, deploying, operating  and disposing g. The term supply chain means a system which  consists of subsystems of production, distribution, transport,  storage and recycling of ICT systems components, as well as  their installation, launch, ongoing maintenance, servicing and  repairs.    20 21  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  An important element of ensuring a quality assurance  in the supply chain is the evaluation and certification  of products (software, hardware and services in parti- cular). The priority in this regard shall be to establish,  and subsequently maintain and develop, a national  s cybersecurity evaluation and certification scheme  based on operations of accredited conformity as- sessment bodies, which shall enable the Republic of  Poland to achieve full and internationally recognised  status of an Authorizing Member country in providing  cybersecurity solutions.  The Republic of Poland shall actively participate in  the work on establishing European cybersecurity  certification schemes in accordance with Regulation  (EU) No. 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of  the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information  and communications technology cybersecurity certi- fication and repealing Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013  (Cybersecurity Act).  Actions at the national level shall include, in particular,  designation of the national cybersecurity certification  authority which shall issue European cybersecurity  certificates, supervise national conformity assessment  bodies which assess compliance of products, servi- ces and processes with the requirements set forth in  the European cybersecurity certification schemes and  cooperate with the national accreditation body – the  Polish Centre for Accreditation in order to monitor  and supervise activities of accredited national con- formity assessment bodies which assess compliance  with respect to the requirements of Regulation (EU)  No. 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the  Council.  These actions shall result in achieving, at the natio- nal level, the ability to support Polish manufacturers  which, when holding European cybersecurity certifica- tes, will be able to compete more efficiently on the of  the European Union’s Digital Single Market.  8 Bug-bounty – search for software vulnerabilities conducted by people not associated with the software developer, usually with the general consent of the developer.  6.3 Security tests and audits Periodic audits are among measures that enable assessment of the effectiveness  of the currently implemented information security management systems and the  adequacy of the safeguards introduced. Audit methodologies should take into  account applicable standards, good practices and specificity of respective sec- tors. The aim of such an approach is to achieve comparability of audit outcomes.   Periodic tests (including penetration testing), which provide for a real assessment  of the system’s resilience to threats, are another security assessment measure.  Outcomes of these tests are the basis for verification of the safeguards deployed.  In order to utilise the public capacity in the area of cybersecurity, the so-called  bug-bounty8 testing shall be disseminated.      22 23  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  7. Specific objective   3 – Increasing the national   capacity in the area   of cybersecurity technology  7.1 Development of industrial  and technological resources for  the purposes of cybersecurity  The government aims to invest in develop- ment of industrial and technological resour-  ces for the purpose of cybersecurity by creating  the conditions needed for the development of  businesses, in particular SMEs and start-ups,  as well as research and development institutes  which are dealing with a development of new  solutions in the area if cybersecurity. The prio- rities include increased capabilities in the area  of designing and producing software, hardware  and services used in all branches of the Polish  industry to improve its competitiveness.   The acquisition of new technologies for de- velopment of domestic ventures shall also be  realised through participation in international  initiatives that emphasise innovation, and thro- ugh bilateral cooperation and within internatio- nal organisations, including the European Cy- bersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research  Competence Centre planned by the European  Commission and the EU’s Member States. Moreover, the government shall strive to ac- tively disseminate knowledge and trainings  among Polish entrepreneurs and to implement  cybersecurity technologies enabling full use of  the capabilities of other state-of-the-art digital  technologies, including AI-based autonomous  systems, in production and service provision  processes.  Actions shall be taken to stir the increase  of cybersecurity competences of research  and higher education institutions. By means  of legal instruments, the government shall  stir higher education institutions to provide  teaching helpful in attracting cybersecurity  specialist, including as part of first and secon- d-cycle studies, doctoral schools and post- -graduate programmes.  In order to even the chances of Polish entre- preneurs on the global market, the govern- ment shall support development of digital  competences of Polish businesses and ensure  assistance in applying for funding of innovati- ve solutions as well as consultancy regarding  access to new markets and assistance in esta- blishing cooperation with other businesses.  7.2 Focus on developing of  public-private cooperation Ensuring security in cyberspace requires joint  efforts of the private sector, the public sector  and the citizens. The government shall con- tinue to establish an effective public-private  partnership system based on trust and shared  responsibility for cybersecurity.  9 Among examples of actions aimed at developing the Polish industry and its competitiveness in the digital transformation era is the „Industry 4.0” programme run by the  minister competent for economy. As part of this programme, Digital Innovation Hubs will be selected by way of a competitive process which will provide standardised  support to entrepreneurs in digital transformation, including in the area of cybersecurity.  At the same time, public administration shall improve its capacity in initia- ting and running cybersecurity projects. The government shall also acti- vely participate in the existing and emerging forms of European public- -private cooperation, thus promoting Polish business internationally.  In implementing a new vision of the country’s development and suppor- ting the innovation of the Polish economy, it will be important to set up  a system of support for research and development projects in the area of  cybersecurity conducted in cooperation with the academia and busines- ses.  7.3 Stimulating research and development in  the area of cybersecurity In view of the dynamically growing IT market, especially in view of the shi- ft to IPv6 communication protocol, and in connection with development  of the Internet of Things, Smart Cities, Industry 4.0 as well as Cloud Com- puting, broadband mobile communication network (5G and next genera- tions) and Big Data, it is necessary to intensify research, development and  manufacturing activities in the area of cybersecurity. To this end, research  programmes10 aimed at development and implementation of new me- thods of protection against cyber threats shall be continued in coopera- tion with the National Centre for Research and Development.  In the face of the dynamical development of technologies related to inter  alia the Internet of Things, special attention should be paid to the need  to ensure product, service and process security as early as at the design  stage (Security by Design)11 as well as data protection and privacy (Privacy  by Design)12.The government shall disseminate and support the security- -by-design approach.  In addition, research programmes shall be developed in cooperation with  the scientific and academic community in order to, in particular:  • assess the effectiveness of protections and resilience to cyber threats; • assess the effectiveness of responding to incidents; • develop methods of detecting and analysis new types of cybercrime,   cyberterrorism and cyberespionage; • study methods of attacks (including attacks of a hybrid nature) and   measures to counteract these attacks and mitigate their effects; • protect democratic processes against disruption by cyber threats.  10  The Ministry of Digital affairs will continue to cooperate with the National Centre for Research and Development in inter alia the CyberSecIdent – Cybersecurity  and e-Identity Programme. 11 Security by design – an approach to the product or system development which consists in considering security and integration of security features from the point  of conception. Commission Communication „A European Security Research and Innovation Agenda – Commission’s initial position on ESRIF’S key findings and  recommendations”/*COM(2009)691 final/. 12 Privacy by design – an approach to data and privacy protection involving appropriate technical and organisational measures, which are designed to implement  data-protection principles taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as  the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing. Based on Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) - Official Journal of the EU, L 119, 04.05.2016, pp 1).    24 25  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  The research and development activities shall be carried  out also in the area of international cooperation within  the EU and the NATO.  Important tasks for ensuring cybersecurity are perfor- med by non-governmental organisations, which are  very efficient organisers of educational activities for  the society and providers of analyses and opinions for  the public administration. It is also possible to acquire  experts with unique skills through analytical centres for  the purposes of solving complex cybersecurity issues.  7.4 Gaining the capacity to perform  a full spectrum of military operations  in cyberspace The Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, as the fun- damental element of the state defence system, should  be involved in activities in cyberspace at the same level  as in the air, on the ground and at sea, in peacetime,  during war and in crisis situations alike. Therefore, the  ability to conduct a full spectrum of military operations  in cyberspace must include the identification of threats,  the protection and defence of ICT systems, and comba- ting cyber threats.  Activities in cyberspace represent an integral part of  planned operations to be conducted by the Armed  Forces of the Republic of Poland both on their own  and in co-operation within alliances and coalitions. The  structure of the Armed Force of the Republic of Poland  will be improved by establishing and strengthening of  formations tasked with conducting tasks in cyberspace,  which have capabilities to identify, prevent and combat  cyber threats. Readiness to military and non-military  interoperability in cyberspace at the national and inter- national level within alliances, coalitions and accords will  be developed. Qualifications of the personnel conduc- ting military operations in cyberspace will be constantly  improved by means of training courses. At the same  time, threats will be identified on an on-going basis and  the situation will be assessed – also in terms of com- pliance with international law – which will provide for  selecting appropriate methods and tools to protect and  defend own resources and eliminate sources of threats  to ICT networks and systems, both stationary and mo- bile. Bearing in mind the rapid pace of development of  technologies that make up the cyberspace environment,  the Ministry of National Defence will strive to develop  or acquire an innovative methods and tools to ensure  operational effectiveness in this domain.  8. Specific objective  4 – Building public awareness  and competences in the area of  cybersecurity  8.1 Increasing competence of the staff of entities relevant  to ensuring cybersecurity of the Republic of Poland   Competences of the staff of entities re- levant to ensuring cybersecurity of the   Republic of Poland shall be increased through  establishing and introducing of such a model  of the academic education and professional  development which will ensure appropriate  qualifications of employees. To this end, mo- del academic programmes shall be developed  for a dedicated field of cybersecurity.   Within the framework of the broadly under- stood expert education, in order to more  effectively counteract growing cybercrime,  the system of training for all employees of  entities relevant to ensuring cybersecurity  and for representatives of law enforcement  agencies and the judiciary shall be enhanced  by putting in place a dedicated educational  programme including both theoretical and  practical trainings based on real examples of  threats.  In order to retain highly qualified employees  in public administration, alongside the use of  other instruments supporting their activity,  actions shall be taken to bring their salaries  closer to the level they could obtain when  working in the private sector.  At the same time, the government shall de- velop and implement a systemic support for  increasing competences of employees of the  local government administration units in the  area of cybersecurity.  The managerial staff of local government  administration units shall dynamically define  responsibilities and authorisations of persons  who play important roles in cybersecurity  management and appropriately communicate  these decisions to all stakeholders.    26 27  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  8.2 Creating conditions for the safe use of cyberspace by citizens  Cybersecurity education should be available as early as possible in the process of accessing digital  services by children and youth – preferably even before they enter the digital world,. In practice,  it is often required at the stage of early childhood education. Having regard to the issue of safe  use of cyberspace, it is assumed that teachers shall receive support in execution their respective  teaching programme, specifically in updating their teaching programmes through various activities  conducted in accordance with the current knowledge regarding safe use of modern technologies.  In addition, actions shall be taken to support continuous professional development of teachers  in the area of modern technologies and cybersecurity, taking into account diagnosed needs of a  given school or establishment.  Higher education institutions shall be encouraged to develop interdisciplinary specialisations  covering inter alia information security management, assessment and evaluation of ICT system  safeguards, protection of personal data, protection of intellectual property on the Internet as well  as issues related to the development of new technologies and the related challenges.  8.3 Developing public awareness towards  the safe use of cyberspace  In cooperation with NGOs, academia and private  sector, the public administration shall continue sys- temic actions to raise public awareness of the cyber  threats. Educational actions shall be taken regarding  the rights and freedoms in the digital environment  and the rights of cyberattack victims and individu- als who suffered losses as a result of on-line privacy  breaches. Public campaigns aimed at various target  groups, including children, parents and elders, shall  also be continued.  In the face of increasingly numerous threats aimed at  exerting specific influence on the society, and having  regard to consequences of intentional use of social  engineering tools to carry out manipulative actions,  such as disinformation campaigns and inspirational  or disintegration actions, it is required to take sys- temic measures to develop public awareness in the  context of verifying authenticity of information and  responding to attempts to distort in. As regards de- fence against manipulative actions, which may be an  element of a hybrid nature operations, it is important  to build capabilities among the society to identify  actions aimed at affecting awareness or converting  or disintegrating specific communities.    9. Specific objective  5 – Building strong international  position of the Republic of Po- land in the area of cybersecurity  9.1 Active international cooperation at the strategic  and political level  In the face of the widespread globalisation  processes and the related interdependence   between countries, international coopera- tion is crucial for achieving security of global  cyberspace.  While carrying out these tasks at the Europe- an level, the Republic of Poland shall intensify  its efforts to ensure the security of the EU’s  Digital Single Market - the driving force be- hind economic growth and innovation. Mo- reover, it is important to strive to take greater  account of the aspects of cybersecurity in  the work on development of the Common  Foreign and Security Policy of the European  Union.  Poland’s membership in the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation is an important pillar of  the country’s security, as well as the security  of entire Euro-Atlantic area. Ever more inten- sive attacks of a hybrid nature make it essen- tial to invest in deterrence and defence capa- bilities, including increasing of the resilience  and ability to respond quickly and effectively  to cyberattacks.  Through cooperation within the United  Nations system, the Republic of Poland shall  strive to continue the debate on an effecti- ve system of governance of the world wide  web and issues related to the legal aspects  of cyberattacks in order to develop coherent  solutions that ensure the reliability of interna-  tional information sharing on the Internet. In  the legal and international context, it is crucial  for individual countries to strive to achieve  the widest consensus possible regarding the  manner in which international law applies to  cyberspace activities. The Republic of Poland  – in cooperation with like-minded partners  – shall promote the position that internatio- nal law, now in force, most importantly the  United Nations Charter, applies to cyberspa- ce. The Republic of Poland acknowledges its  commitment to the voluntary principles of  responsible state behaviour in cyberspace  developed by the UN Group of Governmen- tal Experts, and calls for application of the  entire international law to state activities in  cyberspace and implementation of confiden- ce building measures to mitigate the risk  of conflicts arising from cyber threats. The  Republic of Poland shall actively participate in  strengthening security and confidence buil- ding measures within the existing internatio- nal fora, including the OSCE. The government  shall also join the efforts to effectively combat  cybercrime internationally.  Particular importance is attached to coope- ration with the countries of the region, inclu- ding strengthening of cooperation within the  Visegrad Group and Three Seas Initiative. Implementation of the Polish foreign policy  can also include signing bilateral and mul- tilateral international agreements or legally  non-binding understandings regarding co-    28 29  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  operation in the area of cybersecurity  with countries of developed technological  capacity.  Strengthening of international position of  the Republic of Poland will only be pos- sible through internal close collaboration  between Polish institutions and agencies  responsible for ensuring cybersecurity,  especially between the Ministry of Digital  Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  which is solely responsible for the coordi- nation of the foreign policy of the Repu- blic of Poland.  Achieving a strong international position  of the Republic of Poland in the area of  cybersecurity will not be possible without  having the necessary domestic expertise.  Staff resources supported by adequate  funding shall be the basis for building the  image of the Republic of Poland as a com- petent player at the international area.  In this context, it is important for Polish  experts to actively participate in discus- sions in regional and global fora and per- form a key roles in international organisa- tions, thus contributing to the successful  execution of foreign policy in the area of  cybersecurity. In order to acquire skills,  develop knowledge and share best prac- tices, the Republic of Poland shall attach  ever greater importance to international  bilateral and multilateral cooperation in  matters of education, training and exerci- se, as well as awareness building.  In the area of international cooperation,  the Republic of Poland will actively parti- cipate in exercises conducted by national  organisations, EU and NATO as well as  other international agencies.  9.2 Active international cooperation at the operational  and technical level  International cooperation at the opera- tional and technical level shall be carried  out inter alia within the CSIRT Network  at European Union level, in other fora  for information sharing and analysis of  the IT security situation of a given sector,  through other international cooperation  networks, like the FIRST or TF-CSIRT,  information sharing platforms, like the  MISP or n6, and within bilateral and  multilateral cooperation. In this context,  it shall be particularly important to de- velop common operational procedures  within the EU and NATO, and the Vise- grad Group. Cooperation at this level will  not only serve to effectively counteract  cyber threats , but will also contribute to  the share of experience between tech- nical staff in joint ventures. It shall also  be an opportunity to promote Polish  technological solutions and Polish expert  staff.  Development of international coope- ration is also possible through partici- pation of public institutions involved in  ensuring cybersecurity in international  fora for information sharing on threats  and vulnerabilities.    30 31  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND  10.Managing the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the Republic of Poland  11. Funding  The Cybersecurity Strategy is adopted  for a period of 5 years.  The implementation of the Cybersecurity  Strategy is coordinated by the minister  competent for digitalisation.  The document is subject to review and  evaluation two years after its adoption  and in the fourth year of its term. The  outcomes of the review are presented to  the Council of Ministers. As a result of the  review, the minister competent for digi- talisation shall draft a proposal of correc- tive actions or a draft document for the  next five-year period. Where justified, the  Cybersecurity Strategy may be updated at  dates other than said above.  Within six months of the adoption of  the Cybersecurity Strategy, the Coordi- nator - in cooperation with members of  the Council of Ministers, heads of central  offices, Director of the Government Centre  for Security and other authorities listed  in the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national  cybersecurity system - shall develop an  Action Plan for the Implementation of  the Cybersecurity Strategy and submit it  to the Council of Ministers for approval.  When developing the Action Plan, the  above-mentioned authorities shall take  into account in their activities the issues of  cybersecurity in accordance with their sta- tutory remit. The Action Plan shall include,  in particular:  • name of a specific objective; • name of the task; • name of the action serving the accom-  plishment of the task; • type of action – legislative, organi-  sational, technological, educational,  informational, promotional, other;  • schedule – the start and end date of  the initiative concerned;  • authority or authorities – the leading  authority and authorities cooperating  in the execution of the task (if any);  • expected impacts; • estimated cost.  The Action Plan includes project-type ac- tions with the start and end date of execu- tion and deliverables.  The Minister of National Defence may,  in consultation with the Coordinator,  develop a separate Action Plan which is  subject to an approval by the President of  the Council of Ministers. Elements of the  Action Plan which contain classified infor- mation are subject to the provisions of the  Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection  of classified information (Journal of Laws  of the Republic of Poland, item 742). The  Minister of National Defence sends, for  the purposes of information and coordi- nation, the accepted Action Plan to the  minister competent for digitalisation and  the Government Plenipotentiary for Cy- bersecurity.  The Coordinator shall annually develop a  progress report on the implementation of  the Cybersecurity Strategy for the previous  year on the basis of information received  from the entities involved in its execution.  The reports shall be submitted to the Co- uncil of Ministers by 30 September.  If a separate Action Plan is developed,  the Minister of National Defence submits  a report on the execution of that Action  Plan to the Council of Ministers via the  Coordinator.   Entities carrying out public tasks are required to  include expenditures on cybersecurity in their finan-  cial plans in accordance with the relevant regulations.  These expenditures have additionally included outlays  on expansion of the national cybersecurity system and  expenditures incurred on the execution of other pro- jects as part of the Action Plan for the Implementation  of the Cybersecurity Strategy.  The detailed size and structure of costs of individual  projects shall be determined in the process of initiation  of specific projects. Estimation of the funding costs  for the of the Cybersecurity Strategy shall take place  within the framework of the Action Plan.  Funding sources for the execution of measures laid  down in the document shall be financial plans of au- thorities involved in the implementation of the Cyber- security Strategy as well as funds from the National  Centre for Research and Development and from the  European Union13, as far as possible.  13 EU programmes providing for funding of cybersecurity-related projects include, in particular: Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF Telcom) – both  conducted as part of the EU multiannual financial framework 2014–2021. Other two large programmes are scheduled for launch within the next EU financial perspective  (2021–2028) - they are Digital Europe and Horizon Europe.    32  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND",

The world is now a different place. Digital technology has transformed how we live, work, and play. Smart homes and devices are becoming mainstream; retail stalls are pitching their wares over livestreaming apps; we PayNow each other instead of using cash. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these trends further. Digital technology is central to our COVID-19 response. Technology enables us to trace contacts effectively and efficiently, monitor patients’ health remotely, and ensure compliance with stay-at-home notices. Many solutions were developed locally to help us emerge stronger from the pandemic. Singapore must continue to exploit digital technology fully to grow and develop. At the same time, we must be vigilant about the risks. The more we digitalise, the more exposed we become to the growing threats in cyberspace. The same technologies that improve our lives can be misused to disrupt our lives, sow mistrust, and deepen social divisions. Cyberattacks can also do physical damage to business operations and essential infrastructure, and pose real-world threats to lives and livelihoods. Digitalisation and cybersecurity are thus two sides of the same coin. As we push for digitalisation, we must also raise our cybersecurity levels to protect ourselves from new technological exploits and malicious actors. This updated Cybersecurity Strategy charts the next stage in Singapore’s journey to becoming a more cyber-resilient nation. We will actively defend our cyberspace, simplify cybersecurity for end-users, and promote the development of international cyber norms and standards. As the cyber environment is evolving rapidly, implementing this strategy will demand much of our people. That is why we are investing heavily to upskill practising professionals and to support individuals keen on pursuing a cybersecurity career. If we can do all this well, we can confidently unleash our full digital potential. As the world rides the digitalisation wave, let us work together towards a trusted and resilient cyberspace so that everyone can benefit from the opportunities in a digitally connected world.

Singapore launched our first Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy in 2016 (‘Strategy 2016’), which helped lay the foundations of our cybersecurity efforts today. As our strategic and technological environment has changed significantly over the past five years, we have reviewed and refreshed our cybersecurity strategy to address new and emerging cyber-threats. With a robust cybersecurity workforce and a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem as key enablers, the Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 (‘Strategy 2021’) lays out our plans to strengthen the security and resilience of our digital infrastructure and enable a safer cyberspace to support our digital way of life. It also articulates how Singapore could play an outsized role in the digital domain despite being a small country, to support an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace.

Singapore takes cyber threats seriously. Our cybersecurity journey started with the first Infocomm Security Masterplan in 2005 and the formation of the Singapore Infocomm Technology Security Authority (SITSA) in 2009. In 2015, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) was set up as the central agency to oversee and coordinate all aspects of cybersecurity for the nation. CSA published the first Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy in 2016, which had sought to: (i) Build a resilient infrastructure; (ii) Create a safer cyberspace; (iii) Develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem; and (iv) Strengthen international partnerships.

INTRODUCTION SINGAPORE’S CYBER OPERATING LANDSCAPE 7 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 8 Key Shifts in our Cyber Operating Environment Looking ahead, there are several emerging technologies that may disrupt current approaches towards cybersecurity. For example, edge computing, enabled by 5G, cloud computing, and ubiquitous access to digital devices, will fundamentally change our network environment. This requires a mindset shift, as we move away from perimeter defence towards a zero-trust cybersecurity model. Quantum technologies will also disrupt the cryptographic methods underpinning cybersecurity today. On the flip side, technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing also present us with new ways to secure our digital assets. We are entering an age where the digital and physical realms converge. Cyber disruptions can spill over to the physical domain with real-world consequences. In 2021 alone, we have seen the disruption of hospitals, oil pipelines, and manufacturing facilities in various countries because of cyberattacks. Growing cyber-physical risks are not limited to the industry; these risks are also creeping into our everyday lives with the proliferation of smart devices and internet-enabled products in our homes. We must therefore ensure our CIIs and other important systems are well protected and resilient. Existing policy and legislative frameworks must also be fit-for-purpose to address these risks. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation; businesses and individuals are increasingly dependent on the smooth running of digital infrastructure and services. This has vastly expanded the attack surface for Singapore and Singaporeans, exposing more vulnerabilities to be exploited. Cyber threat actors take advantage of this to launch cyberattacks. Cyberattacks are not only growing in volume; they are also growing in sophistication. We will work with businesses and individuals so that they are equipped to mitigate and manage cybersecurity risks, so that they can digitalise safely and securely. Digital technologies are increasingly perceived as a key determinant in the distribution of power in the international system. The digital domain has thus become a new arena for geopolitical contestation. States are in a race to develop first-mover advantages over key digital technologies. Technical standards-setting bodies are increasingly receiving political attention. Singapore must remain steadfast in our commitment to an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace and actively work towards this vision, in order to navigate these geopolitical tensions. Disruptive Technologies Growing Cyber-Physical Risks Ubiquitous Digital Connectivity Increased Geopolitical Tensions in Cyberspace INTRODUCTION Singapore’s Cyber Operating Landscape The digital domain is one that is rapidly evolving. In the past five years, Singapore has observed four key shifts in our cyber operating environment: 9 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 10 SI N G AP O RE ’S A PP RO AC H SINGAPORE’S APPROACH O BJ EC TI VE S OBJECTIVES Regulation will continue to be a key lever. In Strategy 2021, we will explore expanding the Government’s regulatory remit under the Cybersecurity Act to include entities and systems beyond CIIs. However, a purely regulatory approach could engender a compliance mindset, which is not desirable in a fast- evolving environment. Enterprises and organisations should instead adopt a risk management mindset. Strategy 2021 will therefore also seek to nudge enterprises and organisations to invest in cybersecurity to thrive in a digital world. The Government will take the lead to secure the digital infrastructure that powers our digital economy, and support the development of a healthy digital environment. Recognising that cybersecurity can seem daunting to many, the Government will also seek to make it easier for everyone to secure their devices and use secure applications. Enterprises, organisations, and individuals must play their part too. Enterprises and organisations should include cybersecurity as part of their risk management framework and strengthen their cybersecurity posture. Individuals should practise good cyber hygiene and stay vigilant against cyber threats. Singapore will advance the development and implementation of voluntary, non- binding norms, which sit alongside international law. We will also advocate the development and adoption of technical and interoperable standards. Eventually, this will allow us to work towards a rules-based multilateral order with agreed principles for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. We will also step up operational cooperation with our international partners to combat cross-border cyber threats. Singapore will also support capacity-building programmes to help raise the global and regional levels of cybersecurity. Foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace To develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem, the Government will galvanise the cybersecurity industry and academia to develop advanced capabilities, build world-class products and services, and grow our cybersecurity market. The Government will invest in cybersecurity research and innovation. We will also establish entrepreneurship programmes, which stakeholders can leverage to develop Made-in- Singapore solutions. Build a cybersecurity ecosystem underpinned by research and innovation for our security and economic needs The Government will work closely with our schools to educate students in cybersecurity and nurture budding cybersecurity enthusiasts. The Government will also partner the industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to develop skills and competency frameworks toward structured career paths for cybersecurity professionals. In line with the national SkillsFuture movement, the Government will also encourage individuals interested in cybersecurity to further their skills through programmes offered by industry and training institutes. Develop and sustain a strong cybersecurity workforce to meet our security and economic needs Compared to Strategy 2016, Strategy 2021 takes a more proactive stance to address threats, broadens our scope of protection, and seeks to develop deeper partnerships with industry and other organisations to adapt to the changes in our cyber operating environment. Strategy 2021 also places greater emphasis on workforce and ecosystem development as key enablers of our cybersecurity. How are we adapting to a changing cyber landscape?

The Government will take the lead in rolling out initiatives to keep Singapore’s cyberspace safe. However, this Strategy is not just a government blueprint; it is a call to action for all stakeholders to leverage resources and opportunities outlined in this Strategy to play their part and contribute to the nation’s cybersecurity. The Government will play the role of team captain, guiding and empowering enterprises, organisations, and individuals to collectively work towards a safe and secure cyberspace. INTRODUCTION Singapore’s Cyber Operating Landscape 13 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 14 With increasing digitalisation, CIIs that were previously isolated from the Internet are now increasingly linked to other digital systems, exposing them to cyber vulnerabilities and threats. At the same time, threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and are honing their craft to exploit any vulnerability they can find to disrupt our digital way of life. The Government is committed to the security and resilience of our CIIs, even as we push for more digitalisation. Beyond CIIs, the Government will also seek to raise the cybersecurity posture of other digital systems and infrastructure that could impact Singaporeans’ lives and livelihoods. Strengthen the security and resilience of our digital infrastructure We rely on Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) for the provision of essential services, such as telecommunications, energy, healthcare, and banking. CHAPTER 1 BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE GOAL 15 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 16 The Government will work closely with CII owners, the cybersecurity industry and key digital infrastructure owners to enable a coordinated approach to national cybersecurity. We will also ensure that government systems providing key services for our citizens are secure and resilient. The Government will also look beyond CIIs and work towards safeguarding other entities and systems that provide important services that support our digital economy and way of life. Enable a coordinated approach to national cybersecurity with CIIs at its core To ensure our essential services are well-protected from cybersecurity threats, we will evolve our policy approach to defend against sophisticated threat actors. We must also continue to strengthen capabilities to protect, detect, respond, and recover from malicious cyber activities. We will also ensure that cyber-physical risks are well managed. The Government will implement a layered and coordinated approach to national cyber defence. CII owners will be encouraged to adopt a zero-trust cybersecurity posture for critical systems. For other services and infrastructure whose disruption could have significant knock-on effects on the nation, a risk-based approach will be adopted to strengthen the cybersecurity of these systems. For example, CSA is developing a CII Supply Chain Programme to provide recommendations for all stakeholders to manage cybersecurity risks in the supply chain. In addition, we also seek to change mindsets, such that cybersecurity will be viewed as an enterprise risk management issue, as opposed to a compliance issue. Evolve our policy approach to defend against sophisticated threat actors Cybersecurity is enabled by strong capabilities. The Government will strengthen our technical capabilities to detect and analyse malicious cyber activities to better defend against such threats. This includes the development of a Cyber Fusion Platform that will allow the Government to conduct investigation with enhanced speed and efficiency. To strengthen our response and recovery, the Government will also implement initiatives such as the new National Cyber Security Command Centre. We will also work with CII owners and other organisations to address the various people, process, and technology challenges in cybersecurity. Strengthen capabilities to protect, detect, respond, and recover from malicious cyber activities CHAPTER 1 Build Resilient Infrastructure In Strategy 2016, the Government focused on strengthening the cyber resilience of our CIIs. The Cybersecurity Act was passed in 2018 and serves as the legislative framework to safeguard our CIIs. While we continue to strengthen these areas, Strategy 2021 also seeks to: WHAT’S NEW? Leverage synergies across the nation This includes strengthening our technical capabilities and enhancing coordination across the Government in order to act with greater effectiveness, speed, and agility. Broaden our scope of protection beyond CIIs We want to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of other key entities whose compromise or disruption have significant knock-on effects to the wider economy and society. Address growing cyber-physical risks As the physical and digital worlds continue to converge, we want to ensure our policy and legislative frameworks remain fit-for-purpose to manage cyber-physical risks. 17 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 18 CIIs are digital systems that support the delivery of essential services. Today, CIIs have been identified from 11 critical sectors — Aviation, Banking & Finance, Energy, Government, Healthcare, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Media, Security & Emergency Services, and Water. To ensure that our essential services are not disrupted by cyber threats, the Government has put in place a three-tier framework to strengthen the cyber resilience of CIIs. • CSA, as the independent national authority on cybersecurity, monitors and regulates the CII sectors. At the same time, CSA actively supports sector leads and CII owners to improve their situational awareness and build up their capabilities. • Each CII sector has a sector lead, who works closely with CSA. They are the natural regulators of the CII owners and have a good grasp of the unique operating and business environment — and risks — of their respective sectors. They are best placed to provide guidance on the appropriate balance point of cybersecurity, usability, and cost. • At the organisational level, CII owners are responsible for managing their cybersecurity risks and are the first line defenders and responders. Critical Information Infrastructures in Singapore The effects of cyberattacks are no longer contained in the digital domain. They are spilling into the physical realm, as evidenced by ransomware attacks on the Colonial Pipeline Company in the US and healthcare services in Ireland and New Zealand. Our policy and legislative frameworks must evolve and adapt to mitigate cyber-physical risks. This includes reviewing the Cybersecurity Act, as well as introducing policy initiatives such as the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan and OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework. Ensure policy and legislative frameworks remain fit-for-purpose to address growing cyber-physical risks Ensure government systems are secure and resilient To enable public service digitalisation, the Government will ensure that all government systems — including both CIIs and non-CII systems — are resilient, protected, and trusted by its users. Today, all government systems comply with tailored cybersecurity policies that are reviewed periodically. We will also modernise the cybersecurity architecture of government systems to stay ahead of technological developments. Cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also about people and organisational processes. We will therefore also raise the level of cybersecurity competency across Government. We hope that the Government’s risk-based approach towards cybersecurity can serve as a guide for other organisations and enterprises looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. Instructional Manual 8 (IM8) is the management tool used in Government to safeguard government ICT & Smart Systems (ICT&SS) assets. The IM8 Policy on Security establishes tailored security hygiene practices for government systems, based on a system’s classification and criticality. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) supports the implementation of IM8 security controls by providing consultancy services and deploying Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) across Government. The Government also conducts regular penetration testing on government systems as part of the IM8 audit, identifying vulnerabilities to be addressed before potential exploitation. The Government is implementing the Government Trust-based Architecture (GTbA) that translates zero-trust principles to the Government context, thereby strengthening the security of applications and systems. To complement the GTbA, the Government will operationalise the Government Cybersecurity Operations Centre (GCSOC) that can provide real-time monitoring, increase Government’s situational awareness, and allow a more rapid and accurate incident response. Review cyber policies and enforce a tiered set of requirements in Government Modernise the cybersecurity architecture in Government CHAPTER 1 Build Resilient Infrastructure 19 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 20 The Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) is a programme that invites established cybersecurity researchers to conduct targeted assessments on critical government systems with a bounty reward for critical vulnerabilities discovered. On the other hand, the Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP) is a crowdsourcing platform for the public to identify and report vulnerabilities in government internet- facing mobile and web-based applications. Through this platform, SNDGG encourages responsible reporting of any suspected vulnerability while strengthening the sense of collective ownership over the cybersecurity of government systems. Building on the success of the GBBP and VDP, SNDGG launched the new Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) in 2021. Together, the three crowdsourced vulnerability discovery programmes supplement Govtech’s suite of initiatives to safeguard Government systems. The Government Bug Bounty Programme and Vulnerability Disclosure Programme Vulnerability Rewards Programme (VRP) Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP) Safeguard important entities and systems beyond CIIs With increasing reliance on digital infrastructure and services, the Government must look beyond CIIs to support the cybersecurity of other entities, especially if their disruption will have significant knock-on effects to the rest of Singapore. We will also address the risks of new digital operating models, so that Singaporeans can confidently unlock the benefits of new technologies with peace of mind. While cyber regulations around the world are largely focused on preventing the disruption of essential services, there are some systems and entities that do not deliver essential services but can nevertheless have a significant impact on Singapore if disrupted or compromised. In this regard, we must likewise raise their cybersecurity posture to protect that our digital economy and way of life. The Government will study the wider digital landscape and ensure that these significant systems and entities are adequately protected against malicious cyber threats. Digital technologies will always evolve, and we must be ready to adapt to the new operating models that emerge as a result. For example, cloud services are increasingly important for the provision of digital services supporting key business functions and operations. The Government will study the public policy implications of emerging digital operating models and seek to address the risks as appropriate. Raise cybersecurity posture of important systems and entities beyond CIIs Address cybersecurity risks arising from new digital operating models CHAPTER 1 Build Resilient Infrastructure As we become more reliant on digital systems, the Government must ensure that public officers are well equipped with the skills and knowledge to keep themselves cyber safe. The Government will also develop a Cybersecurity Functional Competency Framework to provide clear development milestones for government cybersecurity specialists. In addition, SNDGG has launched the GovTech Digital Academy that will provide customised cybersecurity training programmes for ICT&SS professionals in Government. Raise the level of cybersecurity competency across Government 21 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 22 Create a cleaner and healthier digital environment Digitalisation has changed the way we live, work, and play. Cybersecurity is a key enabler for Singaporeans to digitalise confidently and safely. Our goal is to create a healthy digital environment. Just as how good physical hygiene goes a long way to keep us healthy, a cleaner digital environment and good cyber hygiene practices will help keep us safe in the digital world. In 2020, the Government launched the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan, which articulated our approach to creating a clean and healthy digital environment. The Masterplan remains relevant to Strategy 2021. Scan to read the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan CHAPTER 2 ENABLE A SAFER CYBERSPACE GOAL 23 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 24 Everyone has a role to play in enabling a safer cyberspace. The Government will champion the effort but enterprises, individuals and the wider community must also come on board. Together, we can work towards securing the digital infrastructure, devices, and applications that powers our digital economy; safeguarding our cyberspace activities; and empowering our cyber-savvy population for a healthy digital way of life. Strategy 2016 had sought to raise awareness and encourage adoption of good cyber hygiene. Despite the high level of awareness of the need for cybersecurity, adoption of cyber safe practices amongst enterprises and individuals remains low. As articulated in the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan, the Government seeks to raise the general level of cybersecurity in Singapore by: Offering cybersecurity to the masses The Government will protect our national Internet infrastructure such that enterprises and individuals in Singapore are protected from most online threats ever reaching them. Simplifying cybersecurity for end-users The Government will make the adoption of cybersecurity solutions easy and convenient. The Government will also work with the industry to develop innovative cybersecurity solutions for end-users to plug and play. Secure digital infrastructure, devices, and applications that power our digital economy Apart from securing key digital infrastructure as mentioned in Chapter 1, we can protect Singapore and Singaporeans by minimising vulnerabilities in our Internet architecture. However, not all threats can be detected or prevented at the national level. We will also empower individuals to secure their devices and work with enterprises to strengthen the security of their applications. The Government can provide an additional layer of protection to all Singaporeans by securing our national Internet infrastructure. For example, the Government is working with the Internet Service Providers to implement the Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) protocol across local Internet domains. This augments the security of the Internet, thereby preventing cyber threats from ever reaching end-users. Vulnerabilities are commonly found in devices and endpoints. Due to the competitive ICT market, many manufacturers often prioritise features, usability, or cost over the security of the device. The Government is encouraging businesses to invest in the security of their products. For example, we launched the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme in 2020, which allows consumers to easily assess the level of security of a smart device. Protect Singapore’s Internet infrastructure Secure user devices and endpoints CHAPTER 2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace Applications are the interface between the user and cyberspace. Malicious actors can leverage vulnerabilities in applications to access users’ sensitive information. To incentivise Software-as- a-Service (SaaS) platforms to develop more secure applications, we will be looking into initiatives such as labelling schemes for SaaS products. We will also strengthen our partnership with the private sector, which manages most digital applications, to ensure that their products are secure. Safeguard enterprise applications WHAT’S NEW? 25 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 26 Safeguard our cyberspace activities A cyber breach is a matter of when, not if. We must therefore be able to quickly detect and remediate such breaches. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Government will strengthen capabilities to protect, detect, respond, and recover from malicious cyber activities. We will also enable enterprises to protect themselves against cyber threats and support them to put in place baseline standards of data protection. The Government will support enterprises by making cybersecurity resources available — from free self-help tools to cost-effective solutions provided in partnership with the cybersecurity industry. For example, as we become more reliant on mobile devices for work and leisure, cyber criminals will also increasingly target these devices. The Government will work with the industry to develop a mobile endpoint solution for citizens to secure their mobile phone from threats, while upholding personal privacy. Enable enterprises to protect themselves against cyber threats The Government will enhance our offering of tools and self-help platforms for enterprises to strengthen data protection. The Government will also work with the industry to provide data protection services such as Data Protection- as-a-Service for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This will provide SMEs with limited resources the support they need to meet data protection requirements. Support organisations to put in place baseline standard of data protection The Government is committed to supporting our enterprises to use data responsibly to derive business value. The Better Data Driven Business (BDDB) programme provides free tools and guidance to help enterprises better safeguard their customers’ personal data while using data effectively to remain competitive. The BDDB aims to support SMEs that are new to data analysis, as well as SMEs looking to leverage data for more complex use cases. The BDDB will also be a one-stop shop for guidance on data protection practices, as well as professional data protection services for enterprises. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) have also been guiding industry in developing and deploying trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Past initiatives include the Model AI Governance Framework, the Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations (ISAGO), Using data and artificial intelligence responsibly CHAPTER 2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace Model AI Governance Testing Framework Better Data Driven Business and two volumes of Compendium of Use Cases. IMDA and PDPC have also developed a draft AI governance testing framework and are working with like- minded partners to make this a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is envisioned that this MVP will support industry in meeting the specifications of key AI governance frameworks, such as those from European Union, the OECD, and Singapore. CHAPTER 2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace 27 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 28 The Government also raises awareness amongst the more vulnerable groups of the population. The SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme that was launched by CSA, SPF, and IMDA in 2021 aims to reach 50,000 seniors over two years. The programme will cover topics such as cyber threats, online scams, and cyber tips in four languages through webinars, publications and face-to- face engagements. The Government also reaches out to students through programmes such as the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) Cybercrime Prevention Programme and the SG Cyber Safe Students Programme. Private sector stakeholders play an important role. To tackle cybercrime, the SPF established the Alliance of Public Private Cybercrime Stakeholders (APPACT) in 2017. APPACT has since grown to a 59-member strong alliance across nine industries, including banks, e-commerce, and social media platforms. The SPF conducts regular outreach and discussions with APPACT partners to chart new ways to tackle cybercrime. With APPACT members’ efforts and vigilance in preventing and detecting cybercrime, there have been numerous success stories arising from the close partnerships forged via this public-private industry platform. Empower our cyber-savvy population for a healthy digital way of life A lack of awareness or lax attitudes towards cybersecurity among end-users can be the Achilles’ heel of even the most secure systems. To empower our population to take charge of their online safety, we will raise awareness and change attitudes on cybersecurity and promote adoption of good cyber practices. The Government will roll out national cybersecurity awareness campaigns to drive greater awareness and encourage adoption of good cyber hygiene practices. The Government will also organise targeted outreach for specific segments of the population such as students, working adults, and seniors. We will do this in collaboration with the private sector to expand our reach. In addition to raising awareness, the Government will support and encourage individuals and enterprises to protect themselves online. For example, CSA’s Go Safe Online portal provides actionable advice and tips for the public and enterprises. CSA will also launch a voluntary SG Cyber Safe Trustmark and cyber hygiene mark for enterprises. The marks will allow enterprises to have a clear picture of their cybersecurity level, and reassure their customers that their systems are secure. Raise awareness and change attitudes on cybersecurity Promote adoption of good cyber practices The Government undertakes regular campaigns to raise awareness on cybersecurity and combat cybercrime. For example, CSA launched the “Better Cyber Safe than Sorry” campaign in June 2021 to promote and encourage the adoption of good cyber hygiene practices. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) also organises a nationwide anti-scam public education campaign annually. Working together to strengthen our collective cyber resilience CSA’s “Better Cyber Safe than Sorry” Campaign The NPCC Cybercrime Prevention Programme (photo taken before COVID-19) 29 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 30 Cybersecurity can be a competitive advantage. Businesses are digitalising faster than ever; cybersecurity will be key to securing the trust of consumers, especially given the increasing frequency of cyber breaches. CSA is introducing a voluntary SG Cyber Safe Trustmark, which will serve as a mark of distinction to recognise companies with good cybersecurity measures. This will allow customers to make an informed choice on the companies to engage, based on their cybersecurity posture. SG Cyber Safe Trustmark and cyber hygiene mark CHAPTER 2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace For smaller enterprises that may not have dedicated IT or cybersecurity expertise, CSA is developing a separate cyber hygiene mark. This cyber hygiene mark is designed to be practical and implementable, focusing on basic cyber hygiene, so that businesses are better protected from common cyberattacks. Both the Trustmark and cyber hygiene mark are being developed in consultation with industry practitioners. 31 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 32 ENHANCE INTERNATIONAL CYBER COOPERATION We have seen significant cyberattacks spill over country lines, from the SolarWinds breach, to the Kaseya Virtual System Administrator (VSA) attack. A resilient infrastructure and a safer cyberspace support our domestic resilience against cyber threats. However, we also need to engage and collaborate with our international partners to work towards the longer-term objective of a rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace, and develop mechanisms and policies to raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity. Foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace CHAPTER 3 GOAL Cyber threats are international and cross-border. 33 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 34 The implementation of Strategy 2016 saw Singapore step up our participation in international cyber policy discussions. We have strengthened collaboration with our Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) counterparts to improve the collective cybersecurity of the region and forged strong bilateral cybersecurity partnerships with other international partners. As cybersecurity gains traction in global conversations, Singapore will raise our level of participation in international cyber policy discussions further by: To foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace, Singapore will advance the development and implementation of cyber rules, norms, principles, and standards. We will also strengthen the global cybersecurity posture and contribute to international efforts to combat cross-border cyber threats and cybercrime. CHAPTER 3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation Raising the global baseline level of cybersecurity We want to support the global effort to raise the capacities of States to protect themselves against cyber threats. We also want to encourage the development and implementation of cybersecurity standards such that a minimum level of cybersecurity exists in the ICT products and services we use. Advocating a rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace and an interoperable ICT environment As a small State, Singapore firmly supports the establishment of a rules-based multilateral order. Developing and implementing voluntary and non-binding norms are important steps toward this objective. We must help develop and abide by rules that all States agree to follow, which in turn guide responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. WHAT’S NEW? 35 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 36 Advance the development and implementation of voluntary, non-binding norms, which sit alongside international law The United Nations (UN) is an important platform that offers all countries an opportunity to engage in and develop rules, norms, principles, and standards. Singapore has participated actively in international discussions at the UN, such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts. At these platforms, Singapore has affirmed that international law, in particular the Charter of the UN, applies to cyberspace, and underscored the centrality of States’ adherence to the cyber normative and stability framework. Going forward, Singapore will actively seek to contribute and move these discussions forward. For example, Singapore will be chairing the Open-Ended Working Group on Security of and in the Use of ICTs (2021–2025). In 2018, ASEAN became the first regional organisation to subscribe in-principle to the 11 voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As part of ASEAN’s next steps, Singapore is working with partners such as the UN Office of Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) and Malaysia to develop a regional action plan to implement these norms. Under the UN-Singapore Cyber Programme, we will also work with our ASEAN and global partners to develop a Norms Implementation Checklist – akin to a set of actions that countries could take to implement these norms. Advance international cyber norms discussions and the understanding of the application of international law in cyberspace Work with partners to implement cyber norms Strategy 2021 seeks to build on the progress made by the international community. We will advance the development of cyber norms and affirm the applicability of international law in cyberspace. We will also work with partners to implement these cyber norms. Recognising the need to forge deeper public-private partnerships, Singapore has facilitated multi-stakeholder dialogues on cybersecurity through hosting the annual Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) since 2016. SICW brings together international and regional policy makers, industry partners, and academia to discuss cross-cutting cybersecurity issues. Singapore also hosts the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC), chaired by Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity, on the side lines of SICW. The AMCC serves as a non- formal platform that brings together the ASEAN Secretary General and ASEAN Ministers of Telecommunications and/or Cybersecurity to discuss cybersecurity issues affecting our region and beyond.

As global discussions on cybersecurity expand beyond traditional cybersecurity topics into emerging technologies and digital security, there is a need for capacity building to support nations in responding to the changing cyber threat landscape. Singapore will work closely with our ASEAN Dialogue Partners, industry and academic partners. Support capacity building for a secure and stable cyberspace Singapore recognises that standards and certifications are important tools to help raise the cybersecurity baseline of products and services in the market. Singapore is committed to the development and adoption of technical and interoperable cybersecurity standards internationally. We will build on existing efforts such as the Common Criteria, an international standard that allows for mutual recognition of secure IT products. Singapore is also working towards the mutual recognition of local schemes like CSA’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme to improve the security of consumer IoT products globally. Promote the development and adoption of objective technical cybersecurity standards Apart from the development and implementation of cyber norms, it is important that States work together to raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity. To this end, Singapore will support capacity-building initiatives and promote the development of technical and interoperable cybersecurity standards for products and services. The ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (ASCCE) was launched in 2019 as part of the ASEAN Cyber Capacity Programme to support a coordinated build-up of cyber policy, operational, and technical capacities amongst senior ASEAN officials. The campus officially opened in October 2021. With a funding commitment of S$30 million, the ASCCE engages top cybersecurity experts and trainers to design and deliver cybersecurity capacity-building programmes, in collaboration with ASEAN Member States (AMS), ASEAN Dialogue Partners, international partners, and the UNODA. The ASCCE has three principal functions. First, it conducts research and provides training on cybersecurity strategy, legislation, and implementation of international cyber norms. Second, the ASCCE provides training for Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), focusing on technical skills and information sharing. Third, in partnership with Temasek Polytechnic, ASCCE provides participants with hands-on practicals through virtual cyber defence training and exercises. While the COVID-19 pandemic halted in- person capacity-building initiatives, the ASCCE has adapted our programmes ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence for delivery on digital platforms. In 2020, the ASCCE trained over 300 AMS officials through seven virtual capacity- building programmes. Looking ahead, the ASCCE will continue to be responsive to the region’s capacity building needs, providing programming in line with the changing digital landscape to equip officials with the capacities to strengthen cybersecurity in ASEAN and beyond. The ASCCE campus CHAPTER 3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation 39 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 40 Contribute to international efforts to combat cross-border cyber threats Even as we work towards a rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace and raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity, cyberattacks will inevitably happen from time to time. Examples such as the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server breach demonstrate that cyber threats are not confined within geographical boundaries. Bilateral and multilateral operational cooperation are thus key to share timely information and respond to these incidents swiftly. Building on existing partnerships and bilateral agreements, Singapore will enhance our engagements with key international partners through regular dialogues to facilitate the sharing of operational and technical information. Beyond operational cooperation, Singapore is also looking to exchange best practices in cyber policy, ecosystem, and workforce development with our counterparts, and coordinate our capacity-building efforts to strengthen global cybersecurity. Maintain robust bilateral cybersecurity ties with key countries Singapore will strengthen multilateral cooperation with our regional and international partners. Today, Singapore participates actively in various international CERT networks and work closely with CERT counterparts to investigate cyber incidents and mitigate cyber threats. We also work closely with INTERPOL as well as private sector partners to combat cross-border cybercrime. Regionally, Singapore conducts the annual ASEAN Cyber Incident Drill (ACID) and is part of the ASEAN Information Exchange Mechanism. Singapore will build on these efforts and work more closely with our partners to collectively combat cross-border cyber threats. Strengthen multilateral cooperation to tackle cross-border cyber challenges ASEAN CERT and ASEAN Information Exchange Mechanism The ASEAN CERT will be a mechanism to tighten coordination and enhance collaboration as listed in the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy 2017–2020. With Singapore as the lead, ASEAN is currently studying the implementation of the ASEAN CERT. In addition, the first ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting in January 2021 approved the establishment of an ASEAN CERT Information Exchange Mechanism. This initiative will further support the ASEAN CERT- CERT cooperation to bolster the effectiveness of regional incident response capabilities. It will also facilitate future exchanges amongst all CERTs in ASEAN and coordinate CERT capacity-building programmes in the region through the ASCCE. CHAPTER 3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation 41 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 42 A vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem lays the foundation for protecting Singapore from cyber threats in the longer term. It also strengthens Singapore’s position as a trusted global business hub and provides economic opportunities for Singaporeans and Singapore-based companies. For Singapore to be a global leader in cybersecurity, the Government, industry, and academia will have to work closely together. We hope to grow and nurture an ecosystem of cybersecurity companies, innovators, and researchers, who can build and develop advanced cybersecurity capabilities and best-in-class products and services of high economic value. DEVELOP A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM Build a cybersecurity ecosystem underpinned by research and innovation for our security and economic needs CHAPTER 4 GOAL 43 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 44 Strategy 2016 was successful in laying the foundations for a local cybersecurity ecosystem of companies. We have catalysed the development of several Made-in- Singapore solutions and supported individuals and start-ups in establishing and scaling up their businesses. In Strategy 2021, we will take further steps to: The cybersecurity industry and academia are key stakeholders in this national effort. The Government will work closely with them to develop advanced capabilities, encourage industry innovation to build world-class products and services, and support the growth of the cybersecurity market. Position Singapore as a trusted tech hub We want to establish ourselves as an internationally recognised and trusted Testing, Inspection, and Certification (TIC) hub. Having strong security evaluation and testing capabilities will help bolster the SG Digital Economy brand. Leverage research and innovation as a competitive advantage We want to be at the forefront of cybersecurity research and development (R&D) to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological landscape and leverage new technologies to stay ahead of malicious cyber actors. Develop advanced capabilities for economic growth and national security The Government will continue to work with researchers and end-users to shape the direction of cybersecurity R&D, such that research conducted can be directly applied to solve real-world challenges. We will also be working closely with industry to translate research findings into commercial products to meet our security and economic objectives. We will seek to include end- users early in the R&D process, and grow the number of collaborations between academia and the cybersecurity industry to create more pathways for research translation. The National Cybersecurity R&D Programme (NCRP) will be a key vehicle for the implementation of these policies. To ensure the availability of cutting-edge capabilities amidst rapid technology change, the Government will actively facilitate the translation of research findings into commercial products, while supporting the development of our local R&D ecosystem. We will also invest in and build deep cybersecurity capabilities for our national security needs, both within Government and with industry partners. Translate research into innovative and economically viable products To support our national cybersecurity needs, the Government will be investing more in the development of deep cybersecurity capabilities. The Government also recognises that such investment can benefit the local cybersecurity industry’s capability development. The Government will therefore catalyse deep capability build-up in the local cybersecurity industry, especially in areas that are of strategic value to Singapore’s cyber defence, by working with selected industry partners. This is augmented by ongoing efforts to attract top international companies with deep cybersecurity capabilities to set up engineering or R&D facilities in Singapore. Build up deep cybersecurity capabilities in Institutes of Higher Learning, the Government, and industry partners CHAPTER 4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem WHAT’S NEW? 45 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 46 We hope to foster innovation that pushes the boundaries of cybersecurity products and services. We will achieve this by supporting industry innovation with targeted government initiatives. We will also support the growth of cyber entrepreneurs and start-ups in Singapore. Looking beyond our shores, we aspire for our enterprises to develop cybersecurity products that are recognised internationally. Apart from supporting established cybersecurity firms, it is also important to encourage budding cyber entrepreneurs and start-ups. The Innovation Cybersecurity Ecosystem at Block 71 (ICE71) is one such initiative. ICE71 programmes provide support for innovators and startups at all growth stages. This includes community outreach and entrepreneurship programmes to engage the cybersecurity ecosystem community and promote collaboration between stakeholders. We will build on our programmes to encourage entrepreneurship, including developing the next phase of ICE71. Support growth of cyber start-ups To enhance the recognition of local security products in the global marketplace, we need to ensure that these products meet the relevant international standards. Singapore has implemented the Singapore Common Criteria Scheme which evaluates and certifies IT products against the international Common Criteria standard. We have also established the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for consumer smart devices. We will expand these schemes and make it easier for companies to submit their products for security evaluation and testing. Building on these achievements, we seek to develop a thriving local TIC ecosystem that is internationally recognised. Develop cybersecurity products that are recognised internationally The National Integrated Centre for Evaluation (NICE) is a one-stop facility for security evaluation and testing of products. It will also be a platform for the local community to develop their skills in this domain. NICE seeks to achieve the following objectives: • To seed a community of practice for product evaluation and certification in Singapore, NICE will improve access to advanced equipment required for security evaluation at the highest assurance level. • To support the growth of the local cybersecurity TIC industry, NICE will provide opportunities for cybersecurity practitioners to research and train on advanced security evaluation techniques. • To build up local product evaluation expertise, NICE will support training courses and internships for students and professionals to learn more about security evaluation methodologies and certification processes. National Integrated Centre for Evaluation CHAPTER 4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem CSA’s Cybersecurity Certification Guide Given the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape, cybersecurity firms need to constantly innovate and invest in new solutions to stay ahead of the curve. The Government will strengthen support for industry-led innovation in cybersecurity. For example, the Cybersecurity Industry Call for Innovation encourages companies to innovate and address pressing cybersecurity challenges by matching them with key local users, such as CII owners, who may have specific operational needs. This initiative also helps provide opportunities for local companies to tap into Singapore’s growing cybersecurity market and drive demand in our local cybersecurity industry. Support industry innovation Innovate to build world-class products and services 47 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 48 Grow our cybersecurity market We seek to grow the market for Made-in-Singapore cybersecurity products and services. We will do so by supporting user adoption to drive demand for cybersecurity solutions. We will also encourage Singapore-based companies to internationalise and export their products and services. Supporting user adoption helps build a steady demand for cybersecurity solutions. The Government will encourage user adoption by making cybersecurity solutions more accessible. Today, SMEs are already eligible for subsidised pre- approved cybersecurity solutions under the SMEs Go Digital programme. For larger enterprises and organisations with specific cybersecurity needs, the Government will play a facilitative role to match supply with demand for more sophisticated solutions, given that end-users may not always be familiar with the wide range of cybersecurity solutions in the market. Encourage adoption of cybersecurity solutions Local companies should not limit themselves to the Singapore market and look to expand into new markets to capture the growing global and regional demand for cybersecurity products and services. The Government is looking to support promising local cybersecurity companies to expand overseas and export Made-in-Singapore solutions. For instance, the Government will curate, organise, and support these cyber companies in profiling their solutions internationally. Internationalise our cybersecurity companies CHAPTER 4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem 49 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 50 The successful execution of our cybersecurity strategy ultimately hinges on our people and talent. The breadth and depth of cybersecurity responsibilities for the Government, enterprises, and organisations will continue to grow. Amidst an ever-evolving technological landscape, we will need to groom new talent and upskill existing professionals to achieve the objectives discussed in the earlier chapters. It is therefore critical for Singapore to strengthen the cybersecurity talent pipeline. We can do so by leveraging our strong education system to grow a skilled cybersecurity workforce. This will enhance Singapore’s competitive advantage, especially amidst a global shortage of cybersecurity professionals. SKILLS SKILLS GROW A ROBUST CYBER TALENT PIPELINE Develop and sustain a strong cybersecurity workforce to meet our security and economic needs CHAPTER 5 GOAL CHAPTER 5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline 51 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 52 Strategy 2016 had sought to ensure an adequate and well-trained cybersecurity workforce in light of growing demand for cybersecurity manpower. We have made good progress. Based on the 2020 Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) Survey on Infocomm Media Manpower, there were more than 10,700 cybersecurity professionals in Singapore in 2020, up from around 6,000 cybersecurity professionals in 2018. In Strategy 2021, we will take further steps to: Industry partners, IHLs, and professional associations are key partners to achieve these goals. Building on Singapore’s strong education system, the Government will work with all stakeholders to support youths, women, and mid-career professionals to pursue a cybersecurity career. To ensure that our cybersecurity workforce is well equipped with the requisite skills and knowledge, we will create an upskilling culture and foster a dynamic sector with strong professional communities. 010001111001001 01001000010101 001010111000101 00101000010100 JOIN OUR CAUSE IN PROTECTING SINGAPORE WHAT’S NEW? Move upstream to engage talent We want to reach out to the young to develop their interest and cyber skills, and encourage more youths to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Strengthen our cyber workforce We want to make sure that cybersecurity professionals have access to training resources and opportunities to keep pace with the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. CHAPTER 5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline 53 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 54 Support youths, women, and mid-career professionals to pursue a cybersecurity career We seek to attract promising youths to the cybersecurity industry to build a pipeline of local talents for the longer-term. The Government will work closely with schools and other partners to engage youths through cybersecurity bootcamps, competitions, learning journeys, and career mentoring. In addition, the Government will equip school teachers and career counsellors with knowledge of the cybersecurity sector to guide students in their career choices under the SG Cyber Educators initiative. Selected male youth with aptitude and interest for cybersecurity can also serve their National Service under the Cyber Work-Learn scheme. This will further enhance the talent pipeline with continued skills development and hands-on experience. Interest and enable youths to pursue cyber as a career The growth of a capable and competent workforce is sustained by attractive career prospects and a respected professional status. We will build on existing initiatives to attract more talented individuals to the cybersecurity profession. We will also nurture young Singaporeans’ interest in cybersecurity and engage under-represented groups in the cybersecurity profession. SG Cyber Youth is a national programme that guides youths in their cybersecurity journey, with support from the academia, community, and industry. A key initiative is the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme that introduces pre-tertiary students to the fundamentals of cybersecurity and cultivates their interest in a cybersecurity career. The Cybersecurity Career Mentoring Programme (CCMP) also provides career guidance and support from industry mentors. Other initiatives include the Student Volunteer & Recognition Programme (SVRP) and Cybersecurity Learning Journeys. Through the various programmes, we will identify a pool of local youths with exceptional cybersecurity talent, who will be groomed under the SG Cyber Olympians programme through cyber sparring sessions, deeper training, and international competitions. SG Cyber Youth Apart from youths, the Government is also looking to attract more women and mid-career professionals from adjacent fields to join the cybersecurity industry. We will work closely with industry and international partners to encourage girls to take up cybersecurity education programmes and inspire women to take on cybersecurity roles. We will also encourage mid-career professionals to join the cybersecurity sector by leveraging professional conversion programmes such as the Cyber Security Associates and Technologists programme. Attract diverse talent Women remain under-represented in the cybersecurity profession. In partnership with industry and the local cybersecurity community, CSA launched SG Cyber Women, a targeted initiative to encourage more women to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Past programmes that have been organised as part of SG Cyber Women include the Capture- The-Flag for Girls competition, Ladies in Cyber mentorship programme and technical workshops. In 2020, CSA also launched the SG Cyber Women X Series, a series of virtual events in celebration of International Women in Cyber Day. Women of all ages can participate in these events to find out more about cybersecurity or deepen their skills to further their career. Women in Cyber event at SICW 2020 SG Cyber Women Join the mailing list: SG Cyber Youth SG Cyber Women CHAPTER 5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline 55 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 56 The Government will facilitate and guide our professionals by developing good career pathways and skills training frameworks. For example, the Government launched the Skills Framework for ICT and the OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework, which are tools that enterprises can leverage to enhance career pathways for cybersecurity professionals in their organisation. We will also improve access to training and networking opportunities for cybersecurity professionals. Today, professionals can already tap on training grants to upgrade their skills or join programmes such as the SG Cyber Leaders programme to network with current and future cybersecurity leaders. Enhance career pathways and facilitate development of deep skills The Government will develop good career pathways for cybersecurity professionals in the public sector. For example, CSA developed the Cyber Security Development Programme to train a common pool of cybersecurity experts for the public sector. Upon completion of the Programme, participants can choose to pursue a career within the public service or enter the private sector. CSA also set up the CSA Academy, which provides cybersecurity professionals in the Government and CII sectors with niche courses not readily available in the training market. Raise, train, and sustain cybersecurity professionals in the public sector A highly-skilled workforce is crucial to grow the cybersecurity industry, which will be a key sector in Singapore’s economy and digital future. Apart from attracting new talent to the profession, the Government will partner the industry and IHLs to enhance career pathways and facilitate the development of deep skills. The Government will also raise, train, and sustain cybersecurity professionals in the public sector. Foster a dynamic sector with strong professional communities The cybersecurity industry, professional bodies, and academia are key stakeholders in Singapore’s journey to grow a strong cyber workforce. Our industry and community partners often organise community events, workshops, conferences, and programmes that help strengthen the talent pipeline and develop our professionals. The Government will support and recognise these community efforts. For example, CSA supports the Cybersecurity Awards, an annual event that recognises enterprises and individuals who have made significant contributions to the local cybersecurity ecosystem. Moving forward, the Government will strengthen engagement with other professional bodies such as those for engineers and software developers, to encourage them to build secure-by- design products and services. Support our cybersecurity community and recognise excellence We have observed a marked improvement in the standing of cybersecurity professionals and the emergence of a strong common identity. To build stronger communities of practice and foster trust within the profession, the Government will work closely with industry associations to further recognise the achievements and contributions of our cybersecurity community. Receiving Cybersecurity Awards Marina Bay Sands TRAINING Create an upskilling culture for a globally competitive workforce 57 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 58 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 serves as a blueprint for Singapore and Singaporeans to secure our Smart Nation, amidst an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape and emerging digital technologies. Cybersecurity is our collective responsibility. With everyone doing their part, we can create an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable digital environment, and reap the opportunities that digitalisation has to offer.

The world is now   a different place. Digital technology has   transformed how we live, work, and play. Smart   homes and devices are becoming mainstream;   retail stalls are pitching their wares over   livestreaming apps; we PayNow each other   instead of using cash. The COVID-19 pandemic   has accelerated these trends further.  Digital technology is central to our COVID-19   response. Technology enables us to trace   contacts effectively and efficiently, monitor   patients’ health remotely, and ensure   compliance with stay-at-home notices. Many   solutions were developed locally to help us   emerge stronger from the pandemic.   Singapore must continue to exploit digital   technology fully to grow and develop. At   the same time, we must be vigilant about   the risks. The more we digitalise, the more   exposed we become to the growing threats   in cyberspace. The same technologies that   improve our lives can be misused to disrupt   our lives, sow mistrust, and deepen social   divisions. Cyberattacks can also do physical   damage to business operations and essential   infrastructure, and pose real-world threats to   lives and livelihoods.   Digitalisation and cybersecurity are thus    two sides of the same coin. As we push for   digitalisation, we must also raise our cybersecurity   levels to protect ourselves from new technological   exploits and malicious actors.   This updated Cybersecurity Strategy charts the   next stage in Singapore’s journey to becoming   a more cyber-resilient nation. We will actively   defend our cyberspace, simplify cybersecurity   for end-users, and promote the development   of international cyber norms and standards.   As the cyber environment is evolving rapidly,   implementing this strategy will demand much of   our people. That is why we are investing heavily   to upskill practising professionals and to support   individuals keen on pursuing a cybersecurity   career. If we can do all this well, we can   confidently unleash our full digital potential.  As the world rides the digitalisation wave, let us   work together towards a trusted and resilient   cyberspace so that everyone can benefit from   the opportunities in a digitally connected world.

Singapore takes cyber threats seriously. Our cybersecurity journey  started with the first Infocomm Security Masterplan in 2005 and  the formation of the Singapore Infocomm Technology Security  Authority (SITSA) in 2009. In 2015, the Cyber Security Agency of  Singapore (CSA) was set up as the central agency to oversee and  coordinate all aspects of cybersecurity for the nation.     CSA published the first Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy in 2016,  which had sought to: (i) Build a resilient infrastructure;   (ii) Create a safer cyberspace;   (iii) Develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem; and   (iv) Strengthen international partnerships.

INTRODUCTION  SINGAPORE’S  CYBER OPERATING   LANDSCAPE    7 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 8  Key Shifts in our   Cyber Operating Environment  Looking ahead, there are several emerging  technologies that may disrupt current  approaches towards cybersecurity.  For example, edge computing, enabled by  5G, cloud computing, and ubiquitous access  to digital devices, will fundamentally change  our network environment. This requires  a mindset shift, as we move away from  perimeter defence towards a zero-trust  cybersecurity model. Quantum technologies  will also disrupt the cryptographic methods  underpinning cybersecurity today.   On the flip side, technologies such as  artificial intelligence and quantum  computing also present us with new ways  to secure our digital assets.   We are entering an age where the digital and  physical realms converge. Cyber disruptions  can spill over to the physical domain with  real-world consequences. In 2021 alone, we  have seen the disruption of hospitals, oil  pipelines, and manufacturing facilities in  various countries because of cyberattacks.   Growing cyber-physical risks are not limited  to the industry; these risks are also creeping  into our everyday lives with the proliferation  of smart devices and internet-enabled  products in our homes.   We must therefore ensure our CIIs and  other important systems are well protected  and resilient. Existing policy and legislative  frameworks must also be fit-for-purpose to  address these risks.   The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated  digitalisation; businesses and individuals  are increasingly dependent on the smooth  running of digital infrastructure and services.  This has vastly expanded the attack surface  for Singapore and Singaporeans, exposing  more vulnerabilities to be exploited.   Cyber threat actors take advantage of this to  launch cyberattacks. Cyberattacks are not  only growing in volume; they are also growing  in sophistication.   We will work with businesses and individuals  so that they are equipped to mitigate and  manage cybersecurity risks, so that they can  digitalise safely and securely.  Digital technologies are increasingly  perceived as a key determinant in the  distribution of power in the international  system. The digital domain has thus become  a new arena for geopolitical contestation.  States are in a race to develop first-mover  advantages over key digital technologies.  Technical standards-setting bodies are  increasingly receiving political attention.   Singapore must remain steadfast in our  commitment to an open, secure, stable,  accessible, peaceful, and interoperable  cyberspace and actively work towards  this vision, in order to navigate these  geopolitical tensions.   Disruptive Technologies Growing Cyber-Physical Risks Ubiquitous Digital Connectivity Increased Geopolitical  Tensions in Cyberspace  INTRODUCTION Singapore’s Cyber Operating Landscape  The digital domain is one that is rapidly evolving. In the past five years,  Singapore has observed four key shifts in our cyber operating environment:    9 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 10  SI N  G AP  O RE  ’S  A  PP RO  AC H  SINGAPORE’S APPROACH  O BJ  EC TI  VE S  OBJECTIVES  Regulation will continue to be a key lever.  In Strategy 2021, we will explore expanding  the Government’s regulatory remit under  the Cybersecurity Act to include entities  and systems beyond CIIs.   However, a purely regulatory approach  could engender a compliance mindset,  which is not desirable in a fast- evolving environment. Enterprises and  organisations should instead adopt a  risk management mindset. Strategy  2021 will therefore also seek to nudge  enterprises and organisations to invest in  cybersecurity to thrive in a digital world.   The Government will take the lead  to secure the digital infrastructure  that powers our digital economy, and  support the development of a healthy  digital environment. Recognising that  cybersecurity can seem daunting to many,  the Government will also seek to make it  easier for everyone to secure their devices  and use secure applications.  Enterprises, organisations, and individuals  must play their part too. Enterprises and  organisations should include cybersecurity  as part of their risk management  framework and strengthen their  cybersecurity posture. Individuals should  practise good cyber hygiene and stay  vigilant against cyber threats.  Singapore will advance the development  and implementation of voluntary, non- binding norms, which sit alongside  international law. We will also advocate the  development and adoption of technical and  interoperable standards. Eventually, this  will allow us to work towards a rules-based  multilateral order with agreed principles for  responsible State behaviour in cyberspace.   We will also step up operational cooperation  with our international partners to combat  cross-border cyber threats. Singapore will  also support capacity-building programmes  to help raise the global and regional levels  of cybersecurity.   Foster an open, secure, stable, accessible,  peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace  To develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem, the Government will galvanise the cybersecurity industry  and academia to develop advanced capabilities, build world-class products and services, and grow our  cybersecurity market. The Government will invest in cybersecurity research and innovation. We will  also establish entrepreneurship programmes, which stakeholders can leverage to develop Made-in- Singapore solutions.  Build a cybersecurity ecosystem  underpinned by research and innovation   for our security and economic needs  The Government will work closely with our schools to educate students in cybersecurity and nurture  budding cybersecurity enthusiasts. The Government will also partner the industry and Institutes of  Higher Learning (IHLs) to develop skills and competency frameworks toward structured career paths  for cybersecurity professionals.   In line with the national SkillsFuture movement, the Government will also encourage individuals interested  in cybersecurity to further their skills through programmes offered by industry and training institutes.  Develop and sustain a strong   cybersecurity workforce to meet   our security and economic needs  Compared to Strategy 2016,  Strategy 2021 takes a more  proactive stance to address  threats, broadens our scope of  protection, and seeks to develop  deeper partnerships with  industry and other organisations  to adapt to the changes in our  cyber operating environment.  Strategy 2021 also places greater  emphasis on workforce and  ecosystem development as key  enablers of our cybersecurity.   How are we  adapting to a  changing cyber  landscape?

The Government will take the  lead in rolling out initiatives to keep Singapore’s cyberspace safe. However, this Strategy is not  just a government blueprint; it is a call to action for all stakeholders to leverage resources and  opportunities outlined in this Strategy to play their part and contribute to the nation’s cybersecurity.  The Government will play the role of team captain, guiding and empowering enterprises,  organisations, and individuals to collectively work towards a safe and secure cyberspace.   INTRODUCTION Singapore’s Cyber Operating Landscape    13 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 14  With increasing digitalisation, CIIs that were previously isolated  from the Internet are now increasingly linked to other digital  systems, exposing them to cyber vulnerabilities and threats. At  the same time, threat actors are becoming more sophisticated  and are honing their craft to exploit any vulnerability they can find  to disrupt our digital way of life.  The Government is committed to the security and resilience of  our CIIs, even as we push for more digitalisation. Beyond CIIs,  the Government will also seek to raise the cybersecurity posture  of other digital systems and infrastructure that could impact  Singaporeans’ lives and livelihoods.   Strengthen the security  and resilience of our digital  infrastructure  We rely on Critical Information Infrastructures  (CIIs) for the provision of essential services,   such as telecommunications, energy, healthcare,  and banking.   CHAPTER 1  BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE  GOAL    15 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 16  The Government will work closely with CII owners, the cybersecurity industry  and key digital infrastructure owners to enable a coordinated approach to  national cybersecurity. We will also ensure that government systems providing  key services for our citizens are secure and resilient. The Government will also  look beyond CIIs and work towards safeguarding other entities and systems that  provide important services that support our digital economy and way of life.  Enable a coordinated approach  to national cybersecurity with  CIIs at its core  To ensure our essential services are well-protected  from cybersecurity threats, we will evolve our  policy approach to defend against sophisticated  threat actors. We must also continue to strengthen  capabilities to protect, detect, respond, and recover  from malicious cyber activities. We will also ensure  that cyber-physical risks are well managed.   The Government will implement a layered  and coordinated approach to national cyber  defence. CII owners will be encouraged to  adopt a zero-trust cybersecurity posture  for critical systems. For other services and  infrastructure whose disruption could have  significant knock-on effects on the nation,  a risk-based approach will be adopted  to strengthen the cybersecurity of these  systems. For example, CSA is developing  a CII Supply Chain Programme to provide  recommendations for all stakeholders to  manage cybersecurity risks in the supply  chain. In addition, we also seek to change  mindsets, such that cybersecurity will be  viewed as an enterprise risk management  issue, as opposed to a compliance issue.   Evolve our policy approach to  defend against sophisticated  threat actors   Cybersecurity is enabled by strong  capabilities. The Government will strengthen  our technical capabilities to detect and  analyse malicious cyber activities to better  defend against such threats. This includes  the development of a Cyber Fusion Platform  that will allow the Government to conduct  investigation with enhanced speed and  efficiency. To strengthen our response and  recovery, the Government will also implement  initiatives such as the new National Cyber  Security Command Centre. We will also work  with CII owners and other organisations to  address the various people, process, and  technology challenges in cybersecurity.  Strengthen capabilities to protect,  detect, respond, and recover from  malicious cyber activities  CHAPTER  1 Build Resilient Infrastructure  In Strategy 2016, the Government focused on strengthening the cyber resilience  of our CIIs. The Cybersecurity Act was passed in 2018 and serves as the legislative  framework to safeguard our CIIs.   While we continue to strengthen these areas, Strategy 2021 also seeks to:  WHAT’S NEW?  Leverage synergies across the nation  This includes strengthening our technical capabilities and  enhancing coordination across the Government in order to  act with greater effectiveness, speed, and agility.  Broaden our scope of protection beyond CIIs  We want to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of other  key entities whose compromise or disruption have significant  knock-on effects to the wider economy and society.  Address growing cyber-physical risks  As the physical and digital worlds continue to converge, we  want to ensure our policy and legislative frameworks remain  fit-for-purpose to manage cyber-physical risks.    17 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 18  CIIs are digital systems that support the delivery of essential  services. Today, CIIs have been identified from 11 critical  sectors — Aviation, Banking & Finance, Energy, Government,  Healthcare, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Media,  Security & Emergency Services, and Water.  To ensure that our essential services are not disrupted by  cyber threats, the Government has put in place a three-tier  framework to strengthen the cyber resilience of CIIs.  • CSA, as the independent national authority on  cybersecurity, monitors and regulates the CII sectors.  At the same time, CSA actively supports sector leads  and CII owners to improve their situational awareness  and build up their capabilities.    • Each CII sector has a sector lead, who works closely  with CSA. They are the natural regulators of the  CII owners and have a good grasp of the unique  operating and business environment — and risks —  of their respective sectors. They are best placed to  provide guidance on the appropriate balance point of  cybersecurity, usability, and cost.    • At the organisational level, CII owners are responsible  for managing their cybersecurity risks and are the first  line defenders and responders.   Critical Information  Infrastructures in Singapore  The effects of cyberattacks are  no longer contained in the digital  domain. They are spilling into  the physical realm, as evidenced  by ransomware attacks on the  Colonial Pipeline Company in  the US and healthcare services  in Ireland and New Zealand.  Our policy and legislative  frameworks must evolve and  adapt to mitigate cyber-physical  risks. This includes reviewing  the Cybersecurity Act, as well  as introducing policy initiatives  such as the OT Cybersecurity  Masterplan and OT Cybersecurity  Competency Framework.   Ensure policy and  legislative frameworks  remain fit-for-purpose  to address growing  cyber-physical risks  Ensure government systems  are secure and resilient  To enable public service digitalisation, the Government will ensure that all  government systems — including both CIIs and non-CII systems — are resilient,  protected, and trusted by its users. Today, all government systems comply with  tailored cybersecurity policies that are reviewed periodically. We will also modernise  the cybersecurity architecture of government systems to stay ahead of technological  developments. Cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also about people  and organisational processes. We will therefore also raise the level of cybersecurity  competency across Government. We hope that the Government’s risk-based  approach towards cybersecurity can serve as a guide for other organisations and  enterprises looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.  Instructional Manual 8 (IM8) is the management  tool used in Government to safeguard  government ICT & Smart Systems (ICT&SS)  assets. The IM8 Policy on Security establishes  tailored security hygiene practices for  government systems, based on a system’s  classification and criticality. The Smart Nation  and Digital Government Group (SNDGG)  supports the implementation of IM8 security  controls by providing consultancy services and  deploying Chief Information Security Officers  (CISOs) across Government. The Government  also conducts regular penetration testing on  government systems as part of the IM8 audit,  identifying vulnerabilities to be addressed  before potential exploitation.   The Government is implementing the  Government Trust-based Architecture  (GTbA) that translates zero-trust  principles to the Government context,  thereby strengthening the security of  applications and systems.     To complement the GTbA, the Government  will operationalise the Government  Cybersecurity Operations Centre (GCSOC)  that can provide real-time monitoring,  increase Government’s situational  awareness, and allow a more rapid and  accurate incident response.  Review cyber policies and  enforce a tiered set of  requirements in Government  Modernise the  cybersecurity architecture  in Government  CHAPTER  1 Build Resilient Infrastructure    19 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 20  The Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) is  a programme that invites established cybersecurity  researchers to conduct targeted assessments on  critical government systems with a bounty reward  for critical vulnerabilities discovered. On the other  hand, the Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP)  is a crowdsourcing platform for the public to identify  and report vulnerabilities in government internet- facing mobile and web-based applications. Through  this platform, SNDGG encourages responsible  reporting of any suspected vulnerability while  strengthening the sense of collective ownership over  the cybersecurity of government systems.   Building on the success of the GBBP and VDP, SNDGG  launched the new Vulnerability Rewards Program  (VRP) in 2021. Together, the three crowdsourced  vulnerability discovery programmes supplement  Govtech’s suite of initiatives to safeguard  Government systems.   The Government Bug Bounty  Programme and Vulnerability  Disclosure Programme   Vulnerability Rewards   Programme (VRP)  Vulnerability Disclosure  Programme (VDP)  Safeguard important  entities and systems  beyond CIIs  With increasing reliance on digital infrastructure and services, the Government must  look beyond CIIs to support the cybersecurity of other entities, especially if their  disruption will have significant knock-on effects to the rest of Singapore. We will  also address the risks of new digital operating models, so that Singaporeans can  confidently unlock the benefits of new technologies with peace of mind.  While cyber regulations around the world are  largely focused on preventing the disruption  of essential services, there are some  systems and entities that do not deliver  essential services but can nevertheless  have a significant impact on Singapore if  disrupted or compromised. In this regard,  we must likewise raise their cybersecurity  posture to protect that our digital economy  and way of life. The Government will study  the wider digital landscape and ensure that  these significant systems and entities are  adequately protected against malicious  cyber threats.  Digital technologies will always evolve,  and we must be ready to adapt to the  new operating models that emerge as  a result. For example, cloud services  are increasingly important for the  provision of digital services supporting  key business functions and operations.  The Government will study the public  policy implications of emerging digital  operating models and seek to address  the risks as appropriate.   Raise cybersecurity posture  of important systems and  entities beyond CIIs  Address cybersecurity  risks arising from new  digital operating models  CHAPTER  1 Build Resilient Infrastructure  As we become more reliant on  digital systems, the Government  must ensure that public officers  are well equipped with the  skills and knowledge to keep  themselves cyber safe. The  Government will also develop  a Cybersecurity Functional  Competency Framework to  provide clear development  milestones for government  cybersecurity specialists.  In addition, SNDGG has  launched the GovTech Digital  Academy that will provide  customised cybersecurity  training programmes for ICT&SS  professionals in Government.  Raise the level  of cybersecurity  competency across  Government    21 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 22  Create a cleaner and healthier  digital environment  Digitalisation has changed the way we   live, work, and play. Cybersecurity is a   key enabler for Singaporeans to digitalise  confidently and safely.  Our goal is to create a healthy digital environment. Just as how good  physical hygiene goes a long way to keep us healthy, a cleaner digital  environment and good cyber hygiene practices will help keep us  safe in the digital world. In 2020, the Government launched the Safer  Cyberspace Masterplan, which articulated our approach to creating  a clean and healthy digital environment. The Masterplan remains  relevant to Strategy 2021.   Scan to read the   Safer Cyberspace Masterplan  CHAPTER 2  ENABLE A   SAFER CYBERSPACE  GOAL    23 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 24  Everyone has a role to play in enabling a safer cyberspace. The Government  will champion the effort but enterprises, individuals and the wider community  must also come on board. Together, we can work towards securing the digital  infrastructure, devices, and applications that powers our digital economy;  safeguarding our cyberspace activities; and empowering our cyber-savvy  population for a healthy digital way of life.  Strategy 2016 had sought to raise awareness and encourage adoption of good  cyber hygiene. Despite the high level of awareness of the need for cybersecurity,  adoption of cyber safe practices amongst enterprises and individuals remains low.   As articulated in the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan, the Government seeks to raise  the general level of cybersecurity in Singapore by:  Offering cybersecurity to the masses  The Government will protect our national  Internet infrastructure such that enterprises and  individuals in Singapore are protected from most  online threats ever reaching them.   Simplifying cybersecurity for end-users  The Government will make the adoption of  cybersecurity solutions easy and convenient.  The Government will also work with the industry  to develop innovative cybersecurity solutions  for end-users to plug and play.  Secure digital infrastructure, devices, and  applications that power our digital economy  Apart from securing key digital infrastructure as mentioned in Chapter 1, we can  protect Singapore and Singaporeans by minimising vulnerabilities in our Internet  architecture. However, not all threats can be detected or prevented at the national  level. We will also empower individuals to secure their devices and work with  enterprises to strengthen the security of their applications.   The Government can  provide an additional  layer of protection to all  Singaporeans by securing  our national Internet  infrastructure. For example,  the Government is working  with the Internet Service  Providers to implement  the Domain Name System  Security Extension  (DNSSEC) protocol across  local Internet domains. This  augments the security of the  Internet, thereby preventing  cyber threats from ever  reaching end-users.  Vulnerabilities are  commonly found in devices  and endpoints. Due to the  competitive ICT market,  many manufacturers  often prioritise features,  usability, or cost over the  security of the device. The  Government is encouraging  businesses to invest in the  security of their products.  For example, we launched  the Cybersecurity Labelling  Scheme in 2020, which  allows consumers to easily  assess the level of security  of a smart device.   Protect   Singapore’s   Internet  infrastructure  Secure user  devices and  endpoints  CHAPTER  2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace  Applications are the interface  between the user and  cyberspace. Malicious actors  can leverage vulnerabilities  in applications to access  users’ sensitive information.  To incentivise Software-as- a-Service (SaaS) platforms  to develop more secure  applications, we will be  looking into initiatives such  as labelling schemes for  SaaS products. We will also  strengthen our partnership  with the private sector,  which manages most digital  applications, to ensure that  their products are secure.   Safeguard  enterprise  applications  WHAT’S NEW?    25 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 26  Safeguard our cyberspace activities  A cyber breach is a matter of when, not if. We must therefore be able to quickly  detect and remediate such breaches. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Government will  strengthen capabilities to protect, detect, respond, and recover from malicious cyber  activities. We will also enable enterprises to protect themselves against cyber threats  and support them to put in place baseline standards of data protection.  The Government will support enterprises by  making cybersecurity resources available  — from free self-help tools to cost-effective  solutions provided in partnership with the  cybersecurity industry. For example, as we  become more reliant on mobile devices  for work and leisure, cyber criminals will  also increasingly target these devices. The  Government will work with the industry  to develop a mobile endpoint solution for  citizens to secure their mobile phone from  threats, while upholding personal privacy.   Enable enterprises to protect  themselves against cyber threats  The Government will enhance our offering of  tools and self-help platforms for enterprises to  strengthen data protection. The Government  will also work with the industry to provide data  protection services such as Data Protection- as-a-Service for Small and Medium Enterprises  (SMEs). This will provide SMEs with limited  resources the support they need to meet data  protection requirements.   Support organisations to put in place  baseline standard of data protection  The Government is committed to  supporting our enterprises to use data  responsibly to derive business value.  The Better Data Driven Business (BDDB)  programme provides free tools and  guidance to help enterprises better  safeguard their customers’ personal  data while using data effectively to  remain competitive. The BDDB aims  to support SMEs that are new to data  analysis, as well as SMEs looking to  leverage data for more complex use  cases. The BDDB will also be a one-stop  shop for guidance on data protection  practices, as well as professional data  protection services for enterprises.   The Infocomm Media Development  Authority (IMDA) and the Personal  Data Protection Commission (PDPC)  have also been guiding industry in  developing and deploying trustworthy  artificial intelligence (AI) systems.  Past initiatives include the Model  AI Governance Framework, the  Implementation and Self-Assessment  Guide for Organisations (ISAGO),   Using data and artificial intelligence responsibly   CHAPTER  2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace  Model AI Governance  Testing Framework  Better Data Driven Business  and two volumes of Compendium of  Use Cases. IMDA and PDPC have also  developed a draft AI governance testing  framework and are working with like- minded partners to make this a Minimum  Viable Product (MVP). It is envisioned that  this MVP will support industry in meeting  the specifications of key AI governance  frameworks, such as those from European  Union, the OECD, and Singapore.    CHAPTER  2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace  27 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 28  The Government also raises awareness  amongst the more vulnerable groups  of the population. The SG Cyber Safe  Seniors Programme that was launched  by CSA, SPF, and IMDA in 2021 aims to  reach 50,000 seniors over two years.  The programme will cover topics such  as cyber threats, online scams, and  cyber tips in four languages through  webinars, publications and face-to- face engagements. The Government  also reaches out to students through  programmes such as the National  Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) Cybercrime  Prevention Programme and the   SG Cyber Safe Students Programme.  Private sector stakeholders play an  important role. To tackle cybercrime,  the SPF established the Alliance of  Public Private Cybercrime Stakeholders  (APPACT) in 2017. APPACT has since  grown to a 59-member strong alliance  across nine industries, including  banks, e-commerce, and social media  platforms. The SPF conducts regular  outreach and discussions with APPACT  partners to chart new ways to tackle  cybercrime. With APPACT members’  efforts and vigilance in preventing and  detecting cybercrime, there have been  numerous success stories arising from  the close partnerships forged via this  public-private industry platform.  Empower our cyber-savvy population  for a healthy digital way of life  A lack of awareness or lax attitudes towards cybersecurity among end-users can  be the Achilles’ heel of even the most secure systems. To empower our population  to take charge of their online safety, we will raise awareness and change attitudes  on cybersecurity and promote adoption of good cyber practices.  The Government will roll out national  cybersecurity awareness campaigns to  drive greater awareness and encourage  adoption of good cyber hygiene practices.  The Government will also organise targeted  outreach for specific segments of the  population such as students, working adults,  and seniors. We will do this in collaboration  with the private sector to expand our reach.   In addition to raising awareness, the  Government will support and encourage  individuals and enterprises to protect  themselves online. For example,  CSA’s Go Safe Online portal provides  actionable advice and tips for the public  and enterprises. CSA will also launch a  voluntary SG Cyber Safe Trustmark and  cyber hygiene mark for enterprises. The  marks will allow enterprises to have a  clear picture of their cybersecurity level,  and reassure their customers that their  systems are secure.   Raise awareness and change  attitudes on cybersecurity  Promote adoption of  good cyber practices  The Government undertakes regular  campaigns to raise awareness on  cybersecurity and combat cybercrime.  For example, CSA launched the “Better  Cyber Safe than Sorry” campaign in  June 2021 to promote and encourage the  adoption of good cyber hygiene practices.  The Singapore Police Force (SPF) also  organises a nationwide anti-scam public  education campaign annually.   Working together to strengthen our collective  cyber resilience  CSA’s “Better Cyber Safe than Sorry” Campaign  The NPCC Cybercrime Prevention Programme  (photo taken before COVID-19)    29 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 30  Cybersecurity can be a competitive  advantage. Businesses are digitalising  faster than ever; cybersecurity will be  key to securing the trust of consumers,  especially given the increasing  frequency of cyber breaches.   CSA is introducing a voluntary SG  Cyber Safe Trustmark, which will   serve as a mark of distinction to  recognise companies with good  cybersecurity measures. This will  allow customers to make an informed  choice on the companies to engage,  based on their cybersecurity posture.  SG Cyber Safe Trustmark and cyber hygiene mark  CHAPTER  2 Enable a Safer Cyberspace  For smaller enterprises that  may not have dedicated IT or  cybersecurity expertise, CSA  is developing a separate cyber  hygiene mark. This cyber hygiene  mark is designed to be practical  and implementable, focusing  on basic cyber hygiene, so that  businesses are better protected  from common cyberattacks.   Both the Trustmark and  cyber hygiene mark are being  developed in consultation with  industry practitioners.    31 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 32  ENHANCE  INTERNATIONAL   CYBER COOPERATION  We have seen significant cyberattacks spill over country lines,  from the SolarWinds breach, to the Kaseya Virtual System  Administrator (VSA) attack.   A resilient infrastructure and a safer cyberspace support our  domestic resilience against cyber threats. However, we also need  to engage and collaborate with our international partners to work  towards the longer-term objective of a rules-based multilateral  order in cyberspace, and develop mechanisms and policies to  raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity.   Foster an open, secure, stable,  accessible, peaceful, and  interoperable cyberspace  CHAPTER 3  GOAL  Cyber threats are international and cross-border.    33 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 34  The implementation of Strategy 2016 saw Singapore step up our participation  in international cyber policy discussions. We have strengthened collaboration  with our Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) counterparts to  improve the collective cybersecurity of the region and forged strong bilateral  cybersecurity partnerships with other international partners.  As cybersecurity gains traction in global conversations, Singapore will raise  our level of participation in international cyber policy discussions further by:  To foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable  cyberspace, Singapore will advance the development and implementation  of cyber rules, norms, principles, and standards. We will also strengthen  the global cybersecurity posture and contribute to international efforts  to combat cross-border cyber threats and cybercrime.  CHAPTER  3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation  Raising the global baseline level of cybersecurity  We want to support the global effort to raise the capacities  of States to protect themselves against cyber threats. We  also want to encourage the development and implementation  of cybersecurity standards such that a minimum level of  cybersecurity exists in the ICT products and services we use.   Advocating a rules-based multilateral order in  cyberspace and an interoperable ICT environment  As a small State, Singapore firmly supports the establishment of a  rules-based multilateral order. Developing and implementing voluntary  and non-binding norms are important steps toward this objective.   We must help develop and abide by rules that all States agree to  follow, which in turn guide responsible State behaviour in cyberspace.   WHAT’S NEW?    35 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 36  Advance the development  and implementation of  voluntary, non-binding  norms, which sit alongside  international law  The United Nations (UN) is an important platform  that offers all countries an opportunity to engage  in and develop rules, norms, principles, and  standards. Singapore has participated actively  in international discussions at the UN, such as  the UN Group of Governmental Experts. At these  platforms, Singapore has affirmed that international  law, in particular the Charter of the UN, applies  to cyberspace, and underscored the centrality  of States’ adherence to the cyber normative and  stability framework. Going forward, Singapore  will actively seek to contribute and move these  discussions forward. For example, Singapore will be  chairing the Open-Ended Working Group on Security  of and in the Use of ICTs (2021–2025).   In 2018, ASEAN became the first regional  organisation to subscribe in-principle  to the 11 voluntary, non-binding norms  of responsible State behaviour in  cyberspace. As part of ASEAN’s next  steps, Singapore is working with partners  such as the UN Office of Disarmament  Affairs (UNODA) and Malaysia to develop  a regional action plan to implement these  norms. Under the UN-Singapore Cyber  Programme, we will also work with our  ASEAN and global partners to develop a  Norms Implementation Checklist – akin to  a set of actions that countries could take  to implement these norms.   Advance international cyber norms  discussions and the understanding  of the application of international  law in cyberspace  Work with partners to  implement cyber norms  Strategy 2021 seeks to build on the progress made by the international community.  We will advance the development of cyber norms and affirm the applicability of  international law in cyberspace. We will also work with partners to implement  these cyber norms.   Recognising the need to forge deeper public-private partnerships,  Singapore has facilitated multi-stakeholder dialogues on cybersecurity  through hosting the annual Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW)  since 2016. SICW brings together international and regional policy makers,  industry partners, and academia to discuss cross-cutting cybersecurity  issues. Singapore also hosts the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on  Cybersecurity (AMCC), chaired by Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of  Cybersecurity, on the side lines of SICW. The AMCC serves as a non- formal platform that brings together the ASEAN Secretary General and  ASEAN Ministers of Telecommunications and/or Cybersecurity to discuss  cybersecurity issues affecting our region and beyond.

As  global discussions on cybersecurity expand  beyond traditional cybersecurity topics  into emerging technologies and digital  security, there is a need for capacity building  to support nations in responding to the  changing cyber threat landscape. Singapore  will work closely with our ASEAN Dialogue  Partners, industry and academic partners.   Support capacity building for a  secure and stable cyberspace  Singapore recognises that standards and  certifications are important tools to help raise  the cybersecurity baseline of products and  services in the market. Singapore is committed  to the development and adoption of technical  and interoperable cybersecurity standards  internationally. We will build on existing efforts  such as the Common Criteria, an international  standard that allows for mutual recognition of  secure IT products. Singapore is also working  towards the mutual recognition of local  schemes like CSA’s Cybersecurity Labelling  Scheme to improve the security of consumer  IoT products globally.   Promote the development and  adoption of objective technical  cybersecurity standards   Apart from the development and implementation of cyber norms, it is important that  States work together to raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity. To this end,  Singapore will support capacity-building initiatives and promote the development   of technical and interoperable cybersecurity standards for products and services.  The ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity  Centre of Excellence (ASCCE) was  launched in 2019 as part of the ASEAN  Cyber Capacity Programme to support  a coordinated build-up of cyber policy,  operational, and technical capacities  amongst senior ASEAN officials. The  campus officially opened in October 2021.  With a funding commitment of S$30  million, the ASCCE engages top  cybersecurity experts and trainers  to design and deliver cybersecurity  capacity-building programmes, in  collaboration with ASEAN Member  States (AMS), ASEAN Dialogue Partners,  international partners, and the UNODA.  The ASCCE has three principal functions.  First, it conducts research and provides  training on cybersecurity strategy,  legislation, and implementation of  international cyber norms. Second, the  ASCCE provides training for Computer  Emergency Response Teams (CERTs),  focusing on technical skills and  information sharing. Third, in partnership  with Temasek Polytechnic, ASCCE  provides participants with hands-on  practicals through virtual cyber defence  training and exercises.  While the COVID-19 pandemic halted in- person capacity-building initiatives, the  ASCCE has adapted our programmes   ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence   for delivery on digital platforms. In  2020, the ASCCE trained over 300 AMS  officials through seven virtual capacity- building programmes.   Looking ahead, the ASCCE will continue  to be responsive to the region’s capacity  building needs, providing programming in  line with the changing digital landscape  to equip officials with the capacities to  strengthen cybersecurity in ASEAN   and beyond.   The ASCCE campus  CHAPTER  3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation    39 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 40  Contribute to international efforts to combat  cross-border cyber threats  Even as we work towards a rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace and  raise the global baseline level of cybersecurity, cyberattacks will inevitably  happen from time to time. Examples such as the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server  breach demonstrate that cyber threats are not confined within geographical  boundaries. Bilateral and multilateral operational cooperation are thus key   to share timely information and respond to these incidents swiftly.   Building on existing partnerships and  bilateral agreements, Singapore will  enhance our engagements with key  international partners through regular  dialogues to facilitate the sharing of  operational and technical information.  Beyond operational cooperation,  Singapore is also looking to exchange  best practices in cyber policy, ecosystem,  and workforce development with our  counterparts, and coordinate our  capacity-building efforts to strengthen  global cybersecurity.  Maintain robust bilateral  cybersecurity ties with  key countries   Singapore will strengthen multilateral  cooperation with our regional and international  partners. Today, Singapore participates  actively in various international CERT networks  and work closely with CERT counterparts  to investigate cyber incidents and mitigate  cyber threats. We also work closely with  INTERPOL as well as private sector partners to  combat cross-border cybercrime. Regionally,  Singapore conducts the annual ASEAN Cyber  Incident Drill (ACID) and is part of the ASEAN  Information Exchange Mechanism. Singapore  will build on these efforts and work more  closely with our partners to collectively combat  cross-border cyber threats.   Strengthen multilateral  cooperation to tackle   cross-border cyber challenges  ASEAN CERT and ASEAN Information   Exchange Mechanism   The ASEAN CERT will be a mechanism  to tighten coordination and enhance  collaboration as listed in the ASEAN  Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy  2017–2020. With Singapore as the  lead, ASEAN is currently studying the  implementation of the ASEAN CERT.   In addition, the first ASEAN Digital  Ministers’ Meeting in January 2021  approved the establishment of an   ASEAN CERT Information Exchange  Mechanism. This initiative will  further support the ASEAN CERT- CERT cooperation to bolster the  effectiveness of regional incident  response capabilities. It will also  facilitate future exchanges amongst  all CERTs in ASEAN and coordinate  CERT capacity-building programmes  in the region through the ASCCE.   CHAPTER  3 Enhance International Cyber Cooperation    41 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 42  A vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem lays the  foundation for protecting Singapore from cyber  threats in the longer term. It also strengthens  Singapore’s position as a trusted global business  hub and provides economic opportunities for  Singaporeans and Singapore-based companies.  For Singapore to be a global leader in cybersecurity, the Government,  industry, and academia will have to work closely together. We hope  to grow and nurture an ecosystem of cybersecurity companies,  innovators, and researchers, who can build and develop advanced  cybersecurity capabilities and best-in-class products and services  of high economic value.  DEVELOP A VIBRANT  CYBERSECURITY   ECOSYSTEM  Build a cybersecurity ecosystem  underpinned by research and  innovation for our security and  economic needs  CHAPTER 4  GOAL    43 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 44  Strategy 2016 was successful in laying the foundations for a local cybersecurity  ecosystem of companies. We have catalysed the development of several Made-in- Singapore solutions and supported individuals and start-ups in establishing and  scaling up their businesses.   In Strategy 2021, we will take further steps to:  The cybersecurity industry and academia are key stakeholders in this national  effort. The Government will work closely with them to develop advanced  capabilities, encourage industry innovation to build world-class products   and services, and support the growth of the cybersecurity market.   Position Singapore as a trusted  tech hub  We want to establish ourselves as an internationally  recognised and trusted Testing, Inspection, and  Certification (TIC) hub. Having strong security  evaluation and testing capabilities will help bolster  the SG Digital Economy brand.  Leverage research and innovation  as a competitive advantage  We want to be at the forefront of cybersecurity  research and development (R&D) to keep  pace with the rapidly evolving technological  landscape and leverage new technologies to  stay ahead of malicious cyber actors.  Develop advanced  capabilities for  economic growth  and national security  The Government will continue to work  with researchers and end-users to shape  the direction of cybersecurity R&D, such  that research conducted can be directly  applied to solve real-world challenges. We  will also be working closely with industry to  translate research findings into commercial  products to meet our security and economic  objectives. We will seek to include end- users early in the R&D process, and grow  the number of collaborations between  academia and the cybersecurity industry  to create more pathways for research  translation. The National Cybersecurity R&D  Programme (NCRP) will be a key vehicle for  the implementation of these policies.   To ensure the availability of cutting-edge capabilities amidst rapid technology  change, the Government will actively facilitate the translation of research findings  into commercial products, while supporting the development of our local R&D  ecosystem. We will also invest in and build deep cybersecurity capabilities for our  national security needs, both within Government and with industry partners.  Translate research into  innovative and economically  viable products  To support our national cybersecurity needs,  the Government will be investing more in  the development of deep cybersecurity  capabilities. The Government also  recognises that such investment can benefit  the local cybersecurity industry’s capability  development. The Government will therefore  catalyse deep capability build-up in the local  cybersecurity industry, especially in areas  that are of strategic value to Singapore’s  cyber defence, by working with selected  industry partners. This is augmented by  ongoing efforts to attract top international  companies with deep cybersecurity  capabilities to set up engineering or R&D  facilities in Singapore.  Build up deep cybersecurity  capabilities in Institutes of  Higher Learning, the Government,  and industry partners  CHAPTER  4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem  WHAT’S NEW?    45 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 46  We hope to foster innovation that pushes the boundaries of cybersecurity products  and services. We will achieve this by supporting industry innovation with targeted  government initiatives. We will also support the growth of cyber entrepreneurs and  start-ups in Singapore. Looking beyond our shores, we aspire for our enterprises   to develop cybersecurity products that are recognised internationally.  Apart from supporting established  cybersecurity firms, it is also important to  encourage budding cyber entrepreneurs  and start-ups. The Innovation Cybersecurity  Ecosystem at Block 71 (ICE71) is one such  initiative. ICE71 programmes provide support  for innovators and startups at all growth  stages. This includes community outreach  and entrepreneurship programmes to engage  the cybersecurity ecosystem community and  promote collaboration between stakeholders.  We will build on our programmes to encourage  entrepreneurship, including developing the  next phase of ICE71.   Support growth of   cyber start-ups   To enhance the recognition of local  security products in the global  marketplace, we need to ensure that  these products meet the relevant  international standards. Singapore has  implemented the Singapore Common  Criteria Scheme which evaluates  and certifies IT products against  the international Common Criteria  standard. We have also established the  Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for  consumer smart devices. We will expand  these schemes and make it easier for  companies to submit their products for  security evaluation and testing. Building  on these achievements, we seek to  develop a thriving local TIC ecosystem  that is internationally recognised.  Develop cybersecurity  products that are  recognised internationally  The National Integrated Centre for Evaluation  (NICE) is a one-stop facility for security  evaluation and testing of products. It will also be  a platform for the local community to develop  their skills in this domain.   NICE seeks to achieve the following objectives:  • To seed a community of practice for  product evaluation and certification in  Singapore, NICE will improve access to  advanced equipment required for security  evaluation at the highest assurance level.    • To support the growth of the local  cybersecurity TIC industry, NICE will  provide opportunities for cybersecurity  practitioners to research and train on  advanced security evaluation techniques.   • To build up local product evaluation  expertise, NICE will support training  courses and internships for students  and professionals to learn more about  security evaluation methodologies and  certification processes.   National Integrated  Centre for Evaluation  CHAPTER  4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem  CSA’s Cybersecurity  Certification Guide  Given the rapidly evolving cyber threat  landscape, cybersecurity firms need to  constantly innovate and invest in new  solutions to stay ahead of the curve. The  Government will strengthen support for  industry-led innovation in cybersecurity.  For example, the Cybersecurity Industry  Call for Innovation encourages companies  to innovate and address pressing  cybersecurity challenges by matching  them with key local users, such as CII  owners, who may have specific operational  needs. This initiative also helps provide  opportunities for local companies to tap  into Singapore’s growing cybersecurity  market and drive demand in our local  cybersecurity industry.   Support industry innovation  Innovate to build world-class  products and services     47 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 48  Grow our cybersecurity market  We seek to grow the market for Made-in-Singapore cybersecurity products  and services. We will do so by supporting user adoption to drive demand for  cybersecurity solutions. We will also encourage Singapore-based companies to  internationalise and export their products and services.  Supporting user adoption helps build  a steady demand for cybersecurity  solutions. The Government will encourage  user adoption by making cybersecurity  solutions more accessible. Today, SMEs  are already eligible for subsidised pre- approved cybersecurity solutions under  the SMEs Go Digital programme. For larger  enterprises and organisations with specific  cybersecurity needs, the Government will  play a facilitative role to match supply with  demand for more sophisticated solutions,  given that end-users may not always be  familiar with the wide range of cybersecurity  solutions in the market.   Encourage adoption of  cybersecurity solutions   Local companies should not limit themselves  to the Singapore market and look to expand  into new markets to capture the growing  global and regional demand for cybersecurity  products and services. The Government  is looking to support promising local  cybersecurity companies to expand overseas  and export Made-in-Singapore solutions.  For instance, the Government will curate,  organise, and support these cyber companies  in profiling their solutions internationally.   Internationalise our  cybersecurity companies  CHAPTER  4 Develop a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem    49 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 50  The successful execution of our  cybersecurity strategy ultimately hinges  on our people and talent.   The breadth and depth of cybersecurity responsibilities  for the Government, enterprises, and organisations will  continue to grow. Amidst an ever-evolving technological  landscape, we will need to groom new talent and upskill  existing professionals to achieve the objectives discussed  in the earlier chapters.   It is therefore critical for Singapore to strengthen  the cybersecurity talent pipeline. We can do so by  leveraging our strong education system to grow a skilled  cybersecurity workforce. This will enhance Singapore’s  competitive advantage, especially amidst a global  shortage of cybersecurity professionals.   SKILLS SKILLS  GROW A ROBUST  CYBER TALENT   PIPELINE Develop and sustain a strong  cybersecurity workforce to meet  our security and economic needs  CHAPTER 5  GOAL    CHAPTER  5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline  51 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 52  Strategy 2016 had sought to ensure an adequate and well-trained cybersecurity  workforce in light of growing demand for cybersecurity manpower. We have made  good progress. Based on the 2020 Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)  Survey on Infocomm Media Manpower, there were more than 10,700 cybersecurity  professionals in Singapore in 2020, up from around 6,000 cybersecurity  professionals in 2018.  In Strategy 2021, we will take further steps to:   Industry partners, IHLs, and professional associations are key partners to achieve  these goals. Building on Singapore’s strong education system, the Government will  work with all stakeholders to support youths, women, and mid-career professionals  to pursue a cybersecurity career. To ensure that our cybersecurity workforce is well  equipped with the requisite skills and knowledge, we will create an upskilling culture  and foster a dynamic sector with strong professional communities.  010001111001001 01001000010101 001010111000101 00101000010100  JOIN OUR CAUSE IN  PROTECTING SINGAPORE  WHAT’S NEW?  Move upstream to engage talent  We want to reach out to the young to develop their  interest and cyber skills, and encourage more youths to  pursue a career in cybersecurity.   Strengthen our cyber workforce  We want to make sure that cybersecurity professionals  have access to training resources and opportunities to  keep pace with the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.     CHAPTER  5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline  53 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 54  Support youths,  women, and mid-career  professionals to pursue  a cybersecurity career   We seek to attract promising youths to the  cybersecurity industry to build a pipeline of local  talents for the longer-term. The Government will  work closely with schools and other partners to  engage youths through cybersecurity bootcamps,  competitions, learning journeys, and career  mentoring. In addition, the Government will equip  school teachers and career counsellors with  knowledge of the cybersecurity sector to guide  students in their career choices under the SG  Cyber Educators initiative. Selected male youth  with aptitude and interest for cybersecurity can  also serve their National Service under the Cyber  Work-Learn scheme. This will further enhance the  talent pipeline with continued skills development  and hands-on experience.  Interest and enable youths  to pursue cyber as a career   The growth of a capable and competent workforce   is sustained by attractive career prospects and   a respected professional status. We will build   on existing initiatives to attract more talented   individuals to the cybersecurity profession.    We will also nurture young Singaporeans’ interest   in cybersecurity and engage under-represented   groups in the cybersecurity profession.   SG Cyber Youth is a national  programme that guides youths in their  cybersecurity journey, with support  from the academia, community,  and industry. A key initiative is the  Youth Cyber Exploration Programme  that introduces pre-tertiary  students to the fundamentals of  cybersecurity and cultivates their  interest in a cybersecurity career.  The Cybersecurity Career Mentoring  Programme (CCMP) also provides  career guidance and support from  industry mentors. Other initiatives  include the Student Volunteer &  Recognition Programme (SVRP) and  Cybersecurity Learning Journeys.  Through the various programmes, we  will identify a pool of local youths with  exceptional cybersecurity talent, who  will be groomed under the SG Cyber  Olympians programme through cyber  sparring sessions, deeper training,  and international competitions.  SG Cyber Youth   Apart from youths, the Government  is also looking to attract  more women and mid-career  professionals from adjacent fields to  join the cybersecurity industry. We  will work closely with industry and  international partners to encourage  girls to take up cybersecurity  education programmes and inspire  women to take on cybersecurity  roles. We will also encourage  mid-career professionals to  join the cybersecurity sector  by leveraging professional  conversion programmes such as  the Cyber Security Associates and  Technologists programme.   Attract diverse talent   Women remain under-represented in the  cybersecurity profession. In partnership  with industry and the local cybersecurity  community, CSA launched SG Cyber Women, a  targeted initiative to encourage more women to  pursue a career in cybersecurity.   Past programmes that have been organised as  part of SG Cyber Women include the Capture- The-Flag for Girls competition, Ladies in  Cyber mentorship programme and technical  workshops. In 2020, CSA also launched the SG  Cyber Women X Series, a series of virtual events  in celebration of International Women in Cyber  Day. Women of all ages can participate in these  events to find out more about cybersecurity or  deepen their skills to further their career.   Women in Cyber event at SICW 2020  SG Cyber Women   Join the mailing list:   SG Cyber Youth  SG Cyber Women    CHAPTER  5 Grow a Robust Cyber Talent Pipeline  55 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 56  The Government will facilitate and guide our  professionals by developing good career pathways  and skills training frameworks. For example, the  Government launched the Skills Framework for ICT  and the OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework,  which are tools that enterprises can leverage  to enhance career pathways for cybersecurity  professionals in their organisation. We will also  improve access to training and networking  opportunities for cybersecurity professionals. Today,  professionals can already tap on training grants to  upgrade their skills or join programmes such as the  SG Cyber Leaders programme to network with current  and future cybersecurity leaders.  Enhance career pathways  and facilitate development  of deep skills  The Government will develop good career  pathways for cybersecurity professionals  in the public sector. For example, CSA  developed the Cyber Security Development  Programme to train a common pool of  cybersecurity experts for the public sector.  Upon completion of the Programme,  participants can choose to pursue a career  within the public service or enter the private  sector. CSA also set up the CSA Academy,  which provides cybersecurity professionals  in the Government and CII sectors with  niche courses not readily available in the  training market.   Raise, train, and sustain  cybersecurity professionals  in the public sector  A highly-skilled workforce is crucial to grow the cybersecurity industry, which will be a  key sector in Singapore’s economy and digital future. Apart from attracting new talent  to the profession, the Government will partner the industry and IHLs to enhance career  pathways and facilitate the development of deep skills. The Government will also raise,  train, and sustain cybersecurity professionals in the public sector.  Foster a dynamic sector with   strong professional communities  The cybersecurity industry,  professional bodies, and academia  are key stakeholders in Singapore’s  journey to grow a strong cyber  workforce. Our industry and community  partners often organise community  events, workshops, conferences, and  programmes that help strengthen  the talent pipeline and develop  our professionals. The Government  will support and recognise these  community efforts. For example, CSA  supports the Cybersecurity Awards,  an annual event that recognises  enterprises and individuals who have  made significant contributions to  the local cybersecurity ecosystem.  Moving forward, the Government will  strengthen engagement with other  professional bodies such as those for  engineers and software developers,  to encourage them to build secure-by- design products and services.  Support our cybersecurity  community and recognise  excellence  We have observed a marked improvement in  the standing of cybersecurity professionals  and the emergence of a strong common  identity. To build stronger communities of  practice and foster trust within the profession,  the Government will work closely with  industry associations to further recognise  the achievements and contributions of our  cybersecurity community.   Receiving Cybersecurity Awards  Marina Bay Sands  TRAINING  Create an upskilling culture for a globally  competitive workforce    57 The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 58  The Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 serves as  a blueprint for Singapore and Singaporeans to secure  our Smart Nation, amidst an ever-evolving cyber  threat landscape and emerging digital technologies.  Cybersecurity is our collective responsibility. With  everyone doing their part, we can create an open,  secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable  digital environment, and reap the opportunities that  digitalisation has to offer.

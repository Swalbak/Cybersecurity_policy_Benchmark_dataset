Indeed, as Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) continue to evolve rapidly, and are increasingly integrated in national and global economies, and so is the increasing dependency on ICTs in the way individuals, institutions and nations function. The Kingdom of Eswatini is fully cognisant of the fact that the extensive integration of ICTs in its society, especially within its public sector, is essential to its on-going efforts to develop the prosperity and welfare of its citizens and the country in general. That is why the Kingdom of Eswatini is actively undertaking several initiatives to promote the adoption and usage of ICTs in all facets of its society and economy. Examples of these initiatives include the on-going implementation of the National E-Government Strategy. The on-going development of a National Broadband Strategy for Eswatini, and the review of its National Information and Infrastructure and Communication Policy (Implementation Plan 2012 - 2016) just to mention a few. As Eswatini embarks on transforming its economy and society by integrating ICTs across its economy and society, it is imperative that it takes into account the effects of such a transformation, which include among others, the need for security and integrity of data, systems, networks, digital infrastructure and cyberspace by businesses, public institutions, individuals, critical service providers, etc. This National Cybersecurity Strategy of Eswatini 2020 - 2025 (SZ NCS 2025) describes a coherent national approach for protecting Eswatini’s data, systems and networks from cyber threats. This strategy will provide guidance to all relevant stakeholders on their specific roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity by setting the national Vision and Strategic Objectives with respect to cybersecurity in Eswatini. This strategy outlines essential elements necessary for ensuring a good cybersecurity posture of Eswatini and these include:  The current context of cybersecurity of Eswatini including current and emerging cyber threats relevant to Eswatini  Eswatini’s national cybersecurity vision and the Strategic Goals that will support the attainment of that vision  Principles that will underpin the implementation of this strategy  Roles and responsibilities of identified relevant stakeholders  The manner in which this strategy will be implemented Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 4  How progress in implementing this strategy and achieving its objectives would be evaluated.  The Kingdom of Eswatini’s Vision for Cybersecurity is: “A safe, secure and resilient Cyberspace in Eswatini” The Kingdom of Eswatini will embark on achieving the following 5 Strategic Goals to attain its National Vision:  Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national critical information infrastructure and other related ICT systems  Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen the cybersecurity governance, policy, regulatory and legislative frameworks of Eswatini  Strategic Goal 3: Build Eswatini’s capacity and expertise in cybersecurity  Strategic Goal 4: Foster a safe and secure information society for Eswatini  Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen cooperation, collaboration and partnerships on cybersecurity This strategy provides the right framework for the Kingdom of Eswatini to effectively integrate secure ICTs across all segments of its society and economy. This will transform and enhance Eswatini’s future wellness and prosperity. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 5 1 INTRODUCTION As the Kingdom of Eswatini embarks on transforming its economy and society by integrating ICTs across its economy and society, it is imperative that it takes into account the effects of such a transformation which includes among others, the need for security and integrity of data, systems, networks, digital infrastructure and cyberspace by businesses, public institutions, individuals, critical service providers, etc. Indeed, with national and global trends and events demonstrating that all nations, including the Kingdom of Eswatini, continue to face increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber threat actors as well as a constantly evolving cyber threat landscape, it is crucial that The Kingdom of Eswatini takes effective measures to ensure Eswatini’s cyberspace is secure. This strategy describes the approach of the Kingdom of Eswatini in responding to both current and emerging cyber threats, and how the Kingdom of Eswatini intends to defend its interests in cyberspace. This strategy considers and builds on several national priorities of Eswatini, which are defined in a number of relevant policies, legal and regulatory instruments for Eswatini. In addition, the strategy goes further and describes a comprehensive approach for protecting Eswatini’s data, information systems and networks, which is based on a multi- stakeholder approach in ensuring this objective is achieved. The success of such an approach requires continuous resource investment by all stakeholders in enhancing their capabilities and skills base in protecting their systems and data from current cyber threats, and outpacing the continuously evolving and emerging cyber threats. 1.1 Scope of Strategy This strategy describes a coherent and national approach for protecting Eswatini’s data, information systems and network infrastructure from cyber threats. This strategy provides guidelines to all relevant stakeholders on their expected roles and responsibilities in achieving the national Vision and Strategic Objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy for Eswatini. This strategy also targets all sectors of the country’s economy and society including individuals, private and public sector organisations, academia, civil society organisations, etc. and sets out recommended actions to be undertaken across key focus areas identified stakeholders in the Kingdom of Eswatini. This strategy will also underpin all international engagements undertaken by the Kingdom within the context of ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace. The successful implementation of this strategy by the Kingdom of Eswatini, will go a long way to support the full attainment of the benefits of digitisation of Eswatini, and supports the prosperity and wellness of all its citizens. In order to clearly outline the cybersecurity posture of Eswatini, the following core elements will be considered: - Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 6  The current status of cybersecurity in Eswatini, including both current and emerging cyber threats facing the country;  The national cybersecurity strategy vision and the strategic goals, which will support the achievement of the vision;  Principles that will underpin the implementation of this Strategy;  Roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders;  The implementation and monitoring of this strategy. 1.2 Strategy Context The Kingdom of Eswatini is currently experiencing significant changes in its ICT sector. This is evident with the establishment of an independent telecommunications regulator— Eswatini Communications Commission (ESCCOM) in 2013; the on-going liberalisation of the sector with the issuance of a licence to a third national mobile operator in 2016; and the pending unbundling of EPTC’s telecommunications infrastructure and services as an operator. These efforts have started to have an impact on the ICT sector for Eswatini, resulting in improvements in the access and quality of ICT services through 3G and 4G mobile broadband services, which were recently introduced in Eswatini. With a population of about 1.15 million people, a mobile penetration rate of over 98%, with nearly 849,121 mobile broadband users and about 24,572 fixed broadband users; the scale of ICT adoption and the resulting impacts are increasingly noticeable across the Kingdom of Eswatini. This is a key motivation for the Kingdom of Eswatini to continue to leverage its legal and regulatory framework to promote the growth of ICTs and digitisation of its society and economy in a secure environment. The current global trends show that the increasing digitisation of Eswatini will result in increased dependency of Eswatini’s economy and society on ICT. Increased dependency on ICT also in turn provides opportunities for cyber threat actors to attempt to attack or illegally access and damage data, information systems and networks in Eswatini. Given that the Cyberspace is borderless, criminals continue to increase their capacities and activities to attack countries across the world, including Eswatini. In the following sub-section, the strategy provides an overview of some of the known vulnerabilities and threats facing Eswatini today. 1.2.1 Threats 1.2.1.1 Cybercriminals Cybercrime continues to be a pervasive threat to nations across the world, including Eswatini. Cybercriminals continue to target economic prosperity of individuals, institutions and nations, Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 7 since majority of these cybercrimes are financially motivated and incur minimal risk of being caught or identified. There exist two types of cybercrimes namely crimes that can only be executed through the use of ICT devices where the devices are both the target of the crime and the tool for executing the crime (cyber dependent crimes); and traditional crimes whose reach and scale and expanded by the use of ICTs such as computers, computer networks (cyber enabled crimes). An example of cyber dependent crimes includes the deployment of ransomware for launching a specific attack (such as financial gain), whilst an example of cyber enabled crimes include cyber enabled fraud using computers. Similar to other nations across the world, cybercriminals that commit cybercrimes within Eswatini’s jurisdiction might either be based in Eswatini itself, or across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, or another part of the world. The Royal Eswatini Police Service has in recent years, been reporting and detecting cybercrime activities, including identifying the perpetrators. However, like other law enforcement forces across the world, the Royal Eswatini Police Service continues to face difficulties in conducting investigations, collecting electronic evidence and prosecuting cybercrimes. These challenges are exacerbated by the sophistication of the cyber-attacks and cross-border nature of the crimes committed. Today, cyber criminals continue to use increasingly sophisticated techniques to commit cybercrimes, and prefer jurisdictions where there is limited investigation and/or reciprocate prosecutorial capabilities. The Royal Eswatini Police Service is currently enhancing its capacity to investigate cybercrimes, and collaboration with other law enforcement agencies from the SADC region and Interpol to pursue and prosecute cyber criminals. Eswatini will continue to face cyber threats perpetuated by cybercriminals in the foreseeable future. The Wannacry ransomware attack of May 2017 was a global cyber-attack launched by cyber criminals which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data on these systems and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin crypto currency. That is an example of the sort of attack cybercriminals are capable of executing, and demonstrates how cybercriminals are employing sophisticated techniques like ransomware and threats of distributed denial of service (DDoS) for extortion. In addition to these threats from organised cybercrime gangs, there are on-going threats resulting from common and less sophisticated cybercrimes, which target small organisations or individuals. These cybercrimes are consistent with global trends of increasing numbers of cyber criminals targeting individuals and businesses for financial pay-outs. These include crimes such as ATM fraud, identity theft, etc. Eswatini has drafted the Computer and Cyber Crime Bill, which addresses substantive and procedural provisions on cybercrime, and is awaiting enactment by Parliament before coming into law. Apart from this Bill, no legislation currently exists which specifically addresses cybercrime in Eswatini. 1.2.1.2 Hactivism Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 8 Hactivism threat actors or hactivist groups tend to attack their targets to promote a political or social agenda. Their motivations are usually either politically or socially motivated. Hacktivist attacks are disruptive in nature and consist of DDoS and website defacements though a few hactivist attacks have inflicted great and sometimes lasting damage to their targets. Eswatini has experienced a number of hactivist related website defacements or DDoS attacks in the past years. 1.2.1.3 Insiders Organisations across the world including those in Eswatini continue to grapple with the cyber threat posed by insiders commonly called insider threat. Employees with access to critical systems and data belonging to their organisations pose a significant threat to these same organisations. They damage the reputation and to a certain extend the financial position of these organisations deliberately. For instance they could leverage their knowledge to launch or facilitate an attack to disrupt critical functions of their organisation, or steal sensitive data from their organisations. Other than these deliberate acts, insiders could also unintentionally cause harm to their organisations. This could be by downloading unsafe content to company computers, clicking on phishing emails, plugging infected USBs to a computer, etc. These insiders could also be targeted by social engineering techniques of cyber criminals and inadvertently execute actions that negatively impact their organisations and benefit cyber criminals. 1.2.1.4 Cyber Terrorism Eswatini is fully aware of global trends on cyber terrorism, which includes the use of Internet and especially social networks to radicalise individuals and recruit members into these terrorist groups. These recruits form terrorist cells that eventually execute cyber-attacks against selected target countries. With the rapid increase in digitisation of developing countries such as Eswatini, there is increasing likelihood that highly technically skilled terrorist groups or lone actors will always emerge with a capability of causing devastating cyber-attacks against target nations. It’s therefore imperative that Eswatini prepares adequately for such scenarios by developing a comprehensive National Cybersecurity Strategy that takes such threats into account. 1.2.1.5 States and state-sponsored threats An emerging threat as observed in the decade is cyber-attacks targeting sovereign nations by either other nations or through state sponsored actors. These nations or state sponsored actors generally seek to unlawfully access either critical information systems, networks or data from targeted states to gain either political, technological, or economic advantages over the targeted nations. Eswatini can potentially become a target of suck an attack, and therefore needs to establish steps to mitigate these threats. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 9 1.2.2 Vulnerabilities Considering the on-going liberalisation of the ICT sector in Eswatini, and the on-going efforts by Eswatini to increase access and use of ICTs across the nation, it is evident that the Internet will become increasingly integrated in the day-to-day activities of individuals and institutions in Eswatini. Considering the global forecasts1, which predicts that “Internet of Things” will proliferate rapidly across the world, which implies there will be continuous emergence of vulnerabilities that potentially can be exploited by cyber criminals to cause devastating attacks. Eswatini needs to put in place measures, good practices and procedures across all segments of its economy and society in order to address the current and emerging vulnerabilities mainly in networks, systems and software. This need cannot be overstated, especially given the recent high profile attack observed worldwide, such as the Wannacry ransomware, which affected services several government and private sector organisations worldwide. Within the context that most successful cyber-attacks result from the successful exploitation of known vulnerabilities that are easily mitigated, the country is obliged to undertake the necessary action to encourage individuals and institutions in Eswatini to invest and take adequate measures to mitigate and manage these vulnerabilities. These measures and the investments need to focus on key areas including technology; individuals and governance. Another vulnerability threat facing Eswatini relates to the use of unlicensed software and unpatched information systems by either individuals or private/public organisations in Eswatini. Cyber threat actors tend to exploit the vulnerabilities that are inherent in any unlicensed software or unpatched information system. One of the main challenges facing Eswatini today relate to the gaps in skills, knowledge and capabilities required to comprehensively address the cybersecurity needs of the private and public sector of Eswatini. More critical is managing the current risks and threats facing both sectors. A part from IT staff, most senior to board level management of key institutions in Eswatini have a limited understanding of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats facing their institutions. It is worth noting that both the Financial Sector and ICT Sector organisations have an understanding for the need for cybersecurity, and have prioritised having cybersecurity awareness programmes and instilling a cybersecurity mindset to staff, especially with respect to good practice in mitigating cyber threats. In general, however, there is no coordinated framework for raising awareness on Cybersecurity across Eswatini. As result the general public in Eswatini tend to have limited and insufficient knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity. 1.3 Cybersecurity Capacity Review In September 2017, Eswatini with assistance from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) conducted a cybersecurity 1 Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecasts And Market Estimates, 2016 - 2016/#368ddbb9292d Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 10 capacity review for the country. The review was based on a Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM) developed by CTO’s and ITU’s implementing partner University of Oxford’s Oxford Martin School. The model was used to examine the cybersecurity capacity maturity based on five key dimensions—Policy & Strategy; Culture & Society; Education, Training & Skills; Legal & Regulatory Frameworks; and Standards, Organisations, & Technologies. Using this model enabled stakeholders in Eswatini to determine the current cybersecurity status and posture for Eswatini, and highlighted a range of challenges and opportunities that Eswatini needs to seek or address in this strategy. 1.3.1 Summary of the Key Findings of the Assessment as of September, 2017 i) Although Eswatini has started considering cyber security as a priority issue in its ICT policy implementation, there is no overarching national cyber security programme for the nation. ii) Eswatini does not have a formal framework or approach for monitoring cyber threats; and detecting, preventing and mitigating cyber-attacks within the country. iii) Eswatini has not formally identified Critical National Infrastructures (CNI) and categorised their respective Critical Information Infrastructures (CII). There is no formal collaboration framework between CII operators or owners and the Public Sector. In addition, there is no national risk management framework and contingency plans against cyber-attacks to ensure resiliency of CIIs. iv) Eswatini does not have adequate and effective legislation, policies and regulations on cyber security, which are required to address both current and future cyber security threats. A number of draft Bills addressing various cybersecurity issues are still being considered but haven’t been formally enacted. v) There is inadequate training capacity and lack of specialised expertise in Cybersecurity both public and private sectors in Eswatini. vi) In general, there is limited awareness of cybersecurity and how to mitigate cyber-attacks and this is exacerbated lack of a cybersecurity mind-set and culture across all segments of society in Eswatini. 1.4 National Cybersecurity Strategy Alignment with National Agenda This strategy is aligned with the objectives and aspirations of the national agenda of Eswatini  National Development Strategy (Vision 2022) of the Kingdom of Eswatini which is aimed at creating by 2022 a nation which “will be in the top 10% of the medium human development group of countries founded on sustainable economic development, social justice and political stability” by focusing on addressing the quality of life in the country. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 11 The critical dimensions of the quality of life as targeted in Eswatini Vision 2022 include poverty eradication, employment creation, gender equity, social integration and environmental protection.  His Majesty’s Government Programme of Action 2013 – 2018 which outlines the steps that the Government will take, through best service delivery, to improve the prosperity of Swazis for the period of 2013 – 2018.  National Information and Communication Infrastructure (NICI) Implementation Plan which is aligned to the NICI Policy Vision “To harness ICT infrastructure and ICT solutions that enhance the building of a truly Twenty-First Century Kingdom of Eswatini with sustainable socio-economic development, accelerated poverty reduction, equal opportunities for all regardless of gender and physical ability” and ICT sector goals for the following Priority Areas: Human Resource capacity, Infrastructure Development, Education, Strategic ICT Leadership, Financial Services Sector, ICT Industry, Legal/Regulatory Frameworks, Environmental Management, and Media.  The e-Government Strategy for Eswatini: 2013 to 2017, which sets out the framework for e-government and m-government in Eswatini, and outlines both “e” (electronic) and “m” (mobile) government initiatives.  The SADC Integration Agenda which focuses on: “Promotion of sustainable and equitable socio-economic growth, Promotion of common political values and the Promotion, consolidation and maintenance of democracy, peace and security” and the vision to achieve a 'Digital SADC' by 2027 This Strategy will support the attainment of the desired outcomes of the abovementioned Strategy and Policy instruments by ensuring that Eswatini fully leverages its cyberspace to support and enhance prosperity and wellness of its citizens across all segments of its economy and society. Eswatini is in the process of establishing a number of regulatory and legislative instruments, which will provide direction and guidelines on a number of key cybersecurity related issues. Although there is currently no legislation specifically addressing cybersecurity, the current framework for cybersecurity, which provides some direction and governance on secure e- commerce, e-transactions and cryptology services are catered for by: o Electronic Records (Evidence) Act 2014, which gives legal effect to: admission and authentication of electronic records; evidence of electronic records; Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 12 including secure electronic records; and admissibility of electronic signature and integrity of electronic record o Cryptography Regulations (published in the latter half of 2016)  Electronic transactions is provided for by: o Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill  Data protection and online privacy is provided for by: o Data Protection Bill, which is still awaiting enactment by parliament  Cybercrime is provided for by: o Computer Crime and Cyber Crime Bill, which is still awaiting enactment by parliament Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 13 2 STRATEGY APPROACH The National Vision for cybersecurity together with the core elements of Eswatini’s approach for managing the numerous cyber threats are outlined in this section. 2.1 Vision Statement Eswatini’s Vision for Cybersecurity is: “A safe, secure and resilient Cyberspace in Eswatini” 2.2 Strategic Goals Eswatini aims to achieve the above National Vision through the following five key Strategic Goals:  Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national critical information infrastructure and other related ICT services  Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen the cybersecurity governance, policy, regulatory and legislative frameworks of Eswatini  Strategic Goal 3: Build Eswatini’s capacity and expertise in cybersecurity  Strategic Goal 4: Foster a safe and secure information society for Eswatini  Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen cooperation, collaboration and partnerships on cybersecurity 2.3 Guiding Principles The execution of this strategy will be underpinned by the following principles: 1. The Rule of Law: This Strategy will be implemented in accordance with the laws recognized in Eswatini and enshrined in Eswatini Constitution (2005), which protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens. This Strategy will also be implemented in accordance with international instruments, which Eswatini has ascended to such as the Articles 16, 17(e) and 34(c) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 2. Shared Responsibility: Eswatini recognises that all stakeholders have their individual roles and responsibilities in protecting Eswatini’s cyberspace. This strategy will ensure that all stakeholders in Eswatini meet their responsibilities in protecting and enhancing resilience and availability of all the CIIs in Eswatini. This strategy will also Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 14 provide a platform for all stakeholders to collaborate and cooperate with each other in order to have an equitable shared responsibility. 3. Risk-based approach: The Kingdom of Eswatini fully appreciates that it is nearly impossible to ensure complete cyber security across the nation, and that is why, this Strategy will ensure that individuals and institutions in Eswatini employ a risk based approach in prioritising and executing cyber related activities, as well as assessing and managing cyber threats. 4. Universal Access to Internet and Cyberspace: This Strategy will ensure that all individuals and organisations within Eswatini have full access to the Internet, and are able to fully leverage a secure cyberspace to improve their prosperity and wellness. 5. ICT as a key enabler: Eswatini recognises that digitisation of nations tends to translate into improvement in social-economic prosperity and wellbeing of its citizens. In order to achieve this, Eswatini has embarked on embracing ICTs as a key enabler for social and economic development. This strategy will support this transformation by ensuring that cybersecurity becomes an integral consideration of all strategies, programmes and capabilities deployed by Eswatini to enable digital transformation. 6. Proactive action: Eswatini will proactively develop the requisite measures and tools to detect and manage the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape. It will also encourage individuals and organisations in Eswatini to proactively defend their information systems, data and networks. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 15 3 ACHIEVING STRATEGIC GOALS The following section outlines the Specific Objectives and Strategies that need to be achieved and executed respectively, to enable the attainment of Eswatini’s national Vision on Cybersecurity by 2025. These Strategies will be executed in a manner that is consistent with the principles described above. As Eswatini embarks on digitally transforming its economy and society, more and more processes and services across Eswatini are increasingly becoming reliant on ICT systems and networks, and data that is generated or accessed by these systems. This dependency implies that any successful attack on some of these systems can severely impact the socio-economic wellbeing of the citizens of Eswatini. This will result in the lack of services supported by the Critical Information Infrastructure, which enables delivery of essential services across the nation like electricity, healthcare, transport etc., as well as information systems that support the well-functioning of the Eswatini society like e-government services and financial services. Eswatini acknowledges that the digital transformation of its economy and society should include, as a priority, the protection of CII and other ICT related services. The relevant MDAs in government will work with all relevant organisations to protect and enhance the resilience of CIIs including e-Government and other related ICT services, especially as most of these systems are owned and operated by the private sector. Eswatini will ensure that all relevant stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting CII and ICT services. 3.1.1 Specific Objective 1.1: Protect the critical information infrastructure and other ICT related services Both public and private sector organisations, particularly their senior directors and board level management, that own and manages most CIIs as well as other ICT related services, must fully understand their systems, networks and data. These organisations will be expected to identify their critical information systems, regularly monitor these systems to detect and manage vulnerabilities and threats. Eswatini will provide oversight and intervene where necessary to ensure that these organisations develop the necessary capabilities to be resilient from attacks. This is in addition to managing cyber threats, risks, and vulnerabilities across all CIIs and relevant ICT services in Eswatini. There is a need to foster a thorough 3.1 Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national critical information infrastructure and other related ICT services Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 16 understanding of the vulnerabilities and threats facing CIIs and ICT services across Eswatini, and ensure that effective measures are implemented, which will improve the cybersecurity of these CIIs and ICT services. Actions: 3.1.1.1 Establish a National Critical Information Infrastructure Register. 3.1.1.2 Develop a national CII Governance Framework, which describes CII protection procedures, processes, guidelines, good practices to be adhered to by CII Operators and owners. 3.1.1.3 Establish a National Risk and Vulnerability Register and Regulations, to ensure continuous vulnerability monitoring and disclosure as well as risk assessment and management across all CIIs. 3.1.1.4 Develop and continually review CII minimum security standards and procedures to be complied with, including security audits, equipment specifications, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Access Control Mechanisms, etc. 3.1.1.5 Conduct continuous monitoring of, and regular testing of CII and Information Systems to detect vulnerabilities, illicit access, errors, etc. Expected Outcomes: In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve the following outcomes: 3.1.1.6 The Government of Eswatini together with CIIs and ICT services owners across Eswatini will keep abreast of, and fully understand the vulnerabilities, risks and levels of cyber security across CII and Information Systems in Eswatini. 3.1.1.7 Eswatini will ensure there is resilience and availability of CIIs and ICT services across Eswatini, following the establishment and implementation of appropriate CII protection measures. 3.1.1.8 CII and Information Systems operators have an improved capacity to manage cyber threats and incidents. 3.1.2 Specific Objective 1.2: Manage cyber threats facing Eswatini Consistent with global trends, which indicate that the number and severity of cyber incidents affecting individuals and organisations across nations, including Eswatini, will grow, coupled Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 17 with the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. Eswatini appreciates that it will need to enhance the managing of cyber threats. It will also have to increasingly provide support to organisations across all sectors on how to manage these threats. This will involve, inter alia, contributing to the detection and mitigation of cyber threats, as well as the gathering and dissemination of information about current and emerging cyber threats nationwide. This will also require Eswatini to work closely with the private sector and other partners such as regional SADC countries to ensure an effective, efficient and coordinated cyber incident response framework across the region. Actions: 3.1.2.1 Define, publish and continuously review the minimum incident register requirements to enable dependable incident analysis against a rapidly evolving cyber landscape. 3.1.2.2 Continuously identify, monitor and analyse risks and cyber threats in order to provide a real-time picture of the threats and risks facing Eswatini. 3.1.2.3 Develop and continuously update a national cyber incident register for Eswatini. 3.1.2.4 Continuously analyse cyber incidents within Eswatini and the SADC region to develop and execute measures to resolve incidents and manage cyber threats. 3.1.2.5 Develop and implement national procedures for risk management and data protection. 3.1.2.6 Develop and continuously update cyber incident scenarios and cyber contingency plans that clearly define crisis management procedures including the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders during cyber incidents and emergencies, and which can be used during cyber exercises. 3.1.2.7 Undertake regular cyber drills and exercises to test national crisis management measures, and leverage lessons learned to improve crisis management measures and the national response to cyber incidents. Desired Outcomes: In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve the following outcomes: 3.1.2.8 With its comprehensive understanding of cyber threats, Eswatini will establish and implement a national and synchronized cyber incident management approach. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 18 3.1.2.9 Eswatini will establish a centralised incident reporting and response functionality within the National Cybersecurity Agency and as result cyber incidents are regularly and consistently reported to Eswatini’s National Cybersecurity Agency. 3.1.2.10 Through its National Cybersecurity Agency, Eswatini will be able to effectively and efficiently manage cyber incidents nationwide. Given the cross border nature of cyber threats and the potential for causing significant damage, if successful, it is imperative that Eswatini implements robust cybersecurity governance structures; have relevant policies, regulations and legislation. These will provide all relevant stakeholders, particularly private and public institutions with a wide set of tools to ensure effective cybersecurity governance and management across Eswatini. This will require establishment of clearly defined processes, functions, policies, responsibilities and roles, to ensure effective disruption of cyber criminal activities targeting Eswatini, as well as the effective management of potential cyber threats.

Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 33 4 IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT 4.1 Roles and Responsibilities It is imperative that a collective understanding and recognition of the shared responsibility of all stakeholders in protecting the CIIs and ICT services in Eswatini is at the core of the management and implementation of this Strategy. Hence the delineation of roles and responsibilities of key stakeholder groups in Eswatini is described as follows: The Government of Eswatini is responsible for ensuring the protection of the national cyberspace and citizens of Eswatini. Consequently, within the context of this Strategy, the Government will be responsible for managing the cyber threats targeting the critical information infrastructure and national security of Eswatini. Bearing in mind that the Government of Eswatini holds national data and provides e-government services to citizens and organisations, it is crucial that the Government of Eswatini puts in place robust and appropriate measures to protect the systems, networks and information it possesses and manages. While some CII are owned and operated by the private sector, the Government of Eswatini is still responsible for ensuring that all CII in Eswatini are resilient and able to support the continuous supply of essential services in Eswatini. This will require the Government to ensure all CII service providers comply with minimum security standards for CII. Another key responsibility of the Government of Eswatini includes the provision of information and advises to individuals and citizens thereby enabling them to adopt and implement the appropriate measures for protecting themselves. One crucial role and responsibility of the Government relates to the fostering an enabling environment for cybersecurity, where Eswatini’s education and training system produces a sustainable pool of cyber expertise which will in turn drive an innovative and vibrant cyber sector in Eswatini. In effect, the Government of Eswatini is responsible for ensuring the successful implementation of this Strategy and the attainment of the Expected Outcomes for the nation vis-à-vis cybersecurity. Eswatini will establish a National Cybersecurity Agency to lead the implementation of this Strategy. Consequently the National Cybersecurity Agency will coordinate, plan and implement cybersecurity initiatives across Eswatini. The National Cybersecurity Agency through its dedicated National CERT/CSIRT Unit will lead the cyber incident response and management activities of Eswatini at the national level. The Agency will also oversee the protection of CII in Eswatini, and provide advice and support to organisations across the nation. One key role and responsibility of the Agency will be the assurance of adoption and compliance of nationally established guidelines, standards, good practices, and security requirements necessary for the protection of the systems, networks, and data. In effect, the Agency will serve as the national source for cyber security expertise and direction nationwide. Eswatini will constitute the National Cybersecurity Council and the Cybersecurity Working Groups with representatives from the public and private sector organisations, to provide strategic advice to Government. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 34 Organisations based in Eswatini own and manage systems, networks and information in their day-to-day operations and provision of services. As a result, organisations are responsible for securing the systems, networks and information they own or manage, whilst ensuring the secure and continuous supply of services that are underpinned by these systems, networks and information. Consequently, organisations in Eswatini need to deploy appropriate investments and measures, and develop the right capacities to ensure the security and resilience of their systems, networks and information. Owners and operators of Critical Information Infrastructure and Information Systems in Eswatini are responsible for ensuring the protection and resilience of their systems, networks and data, and will be required to execute all appropriate measures to ensure this protection and resilience. They will also need to make investments and roll-out measures that ensure their compliance with nationally defined cyber security guidelines, security requirements, standards, processes, procedures, frameworks, etc. Royal Eswatini Police Service and the Judiciary in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders (national or international) will expand their efforts to disrupt, investigate and prosecute cyber criminal activity conducted in, or targeting Eswatini. The Royal Eswatini Police Service will work with the National Cybersecurity Agency to support the national cyber incident and cyber emergency responses. The Umbutfo Eswatini Defence Force is responsible for ensuring the defence of Eswatini against cyber threats to the sovereignty and national security. This will require the Defence Force to manage threats directly under military jurisdiction including cyber warfare, cyber terrorism, etc. The Defence Force will be responsible for managing operations at the Cyber Defence Command Centre and for securing systems, networks, and data of the Defence Force. The Eswatini Defence Force will work with the National Cybersecurity Agency to support the national cyber incident and cyber emergency responses. Civil Societies based in Eswatini will work with other relevant stakeholders in Eswatini to ensure the accountability and transparency of public and private sector organisations. They will also play a key role in building awareness of cybersecurity issues and trends nationwide and across all segment of the Eswatini society. Furthermore, they will facilitate, ensure and enhance engagement and dialogue among all stakeholders All Individuals based in Eswatini will be responsible for adopting and implementing all appropriate measures to protect themselves online, and secure the systems, networks and data they own/or manage in their private and professional lives. It is critical individuals do this as they are potentially weak links in the cyber security of the nation, and could be an effective line of defence against cyber threats targeting Eswatini’s collective data, networks and systems. Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025 35 4.2 Approach for Monitoring and Evaluation Taking into consideration the continually evolving cyber threat landscape, and to enable the successful implementation of this strategy, Eswatini will establish a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan which will enable it monitor progress and impacts of the recommended objectives and milestones in the Strategy.

Indeed, as Information and Communication   Technologies (ICTs) continue to evolve rapidly, and are increasingly integrated in national and   global economies, and so is the increasing dependency on ICTs in the way individuals,   institutions and nations function. The Kingdom of Eswatini is fully cognisant of the fact that   the extensive integration of ICTs in its society, especially within its public sector, is essential   to its on-going efforts to develop the prosperity and welfare of its citizens and the country in   general. That is why the Kingdom of Eswatini is actively undertaking several initiatives to   promote the adoption and usage of ICTs in all facets of its society and economy. Examples of   these initiatives include the on-going implementation of the National E-Government Strategy.   The  on-going development of a National Broadband Strategy for Eswatini, and the review of   its National Information and Infrastructure and Communication Policy (Implementation Plan   2012 - 2016) just to mention a few.   As Eswatini embarks on transforming its economy and society by integrating ICTs across its   economy and society, it is imperative that it takes into account the effects of such a   transformation, which include among others, the need for security and integrity of data,   systems, networks, digital infrastructure and cyberspace by businesses, public institutions,   individuals, critical service providers, etc.   This National Cybersecurity Strategy of Eswatini 2020 - 2025 (SZ NCS 2025) describes a   coherent national approach for protecting Eswatini’s data, systems and networks from cyber   threats. This strategy will provide guidance to all relevant stakeholders on their specific roles   and responsibilities for cybersecurity by setting the national Vision and Strategic Objectives   with respect to cybersecurity in Eswatini.   This strategy outlines essential elements necessary for ensuring a good cybersecurity posture   of Eswatini and these include:    The current context of cybersecurity of Eswatini including current and emerging cyber   threats relevant to Eswatini       Eswatini’s national cybersecurity vision and the Strategic Goals that will support the   attainment of that vision       Principles that will underpin the implementation of this strategy       Roles and responsibilities of identified relevant stakeholders       The manner in which this strategy will be implemented        Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           4       How progress in implementing this strategy and achieving its objectives would be   evaluated.       The Kingdom of Eswatini’s Vision for Cybersecurity is:      “A safe, secure and resilient Cyberspace in Eswatini”      The Kingdom of Eswatini will embark on achieving the following 5 Strategic Goals to attain its   National Vision:    Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national critical information   infrastructure and other related ICT systems        Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen the cybersecurity governance, policy, regulatory and   legislative frameworks of Eswatini       Strategic Goal 3: Build Eswatini’s capacity and expertise in cybersecurity       Strategic Goal 4: Foster a safe and secure information society for Eswatini       Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen cooperation, collaboration and partnerships on   cybersecurity   This strategy provides the right framework for the Kingdom of Eswatini to effectively integrate   secure ICTs across all segments of its society and economy.  This will transform and enhance   Eswatini’s future wellness and prosperity.         Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           5      1 INTRODUCTION   As the Kingdom of Eswatini embarks on transforming its economy and society by integrating   ICTs across its economy and society, it is imperative that it takes into account the effects of   such a transformation which includes among others, the need for security and integrity of   data, systems, networks, digital infrastructure and cyberspace by businesses, public   institutions, individuals, critical service providers, etc. Indeed, with national and global trends   and events demonstrating that all nations, including the Kingdom of Eswatini, continue to face   increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber threat actors as well as a constantly evolving cyber   threat landscape, it is crucial that The Kingdom of Eswatini takes effective measures to ensure   Eswatini’s cyberspace is secure.    This strategy describes the approach of the Kingdom of Eswatini in responding to both current   and emerging cyber threats, and how the Kingdom of Eswatini intends to defend its interests   in cyberspace. This strategy considers and builds on several national priorities of Eswatini,   which are defined in a number of relevant policies, legal and regulatory instruments for   Eswatini. In addition, the strategy goes further and describes a comprehensive approach for   protecting Eswatini’s data, information systems and networks, which is based on a multi-  stakeholder approach in ensuring this objective is achieved.  The success of such an approach   requires continuous resource investment by all stakeholders in enhancing their capabilities   and skills base in protecting their systems and data from current cyber threats, and outpacing   the continuously evolving and emerging cyber threats.    1.1 Scope of Strategy   This strategy describes a coherent and national approach for protecting Eswatini’s data,   information systems and network infrastructure from cyber threats. This strategy provides   guidelines to all relevant stakeholders on their expected roles and responsibilities in achieving   the national Vision and Strategic Objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy for   Eswatini.   This strategy also targets all sectors of the country’s economy and society including   individuals, private and public sector organisations, academia, civil society organisations, etc.   and sets out recommended actions to be undertaken across key focus areas identified   stakeholders in the Kingdom of Eswatini. This strategy will also underpin all international   engagements undertaken by the Kingdom within the context of ensuring a safe and secure   cyberspace.    The successful implementation of this strategy by the Kingdom of Eswatini, will go a long way   to support the full attainment of the benefits of digitisation of Eswatini, and supports the   prosperity and wellness of all its citizens.    In order to clearly outline the cybersecurity posture of Eswatini, the following core elements   will be considered: -     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           6       The current status of cybersecurity in Eswatini, including both current and emerging   cyber threats facing the country;       The national cybersecurity strategy vision and the strategic goals, which will support   the achievement of the vision;       Principles that will underpin the implementation of this Strategy;       Roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders;       The implementation and monitoring of this strategy.      1.2 Strategy Context   The Kingdom of Eswatini is currently experiencing significant changes in its ICT sector.  This   is evident with the establishment of an independent telecommunications regulator— Eswatini   Communications Commission (ESCCOM) in 2013; the on-going liberalisation of the sector with   the issuance of a licence to a third national mobile operator in 2016; and the pending   unbundling of EPTC’s telecommunications infrastructure and services as an operator. These   efforts have started to have an impact on the ICT sector for Eswatini, resulting in   improvements in the access and quality of ICT services through 3G and 4G mobile broadband   services, which were recently introduced in Eswatini.    With a population of about 1.15 million people, a mobile penetration rate of over 98%, with   nearly 849,121 mobile broadband users and about 24,572 fixed broadband users; the scale   of ICT adoption and the resulting impacts are increasingly noticeable across the Kingdom of   Eswatini. This is a key motivation for the Kingdom of Eswatini to continue to leverage its legal   and regulatory framework to promote the growth of ICTs and digitisation of its society and   economy in a secure environment. The current global trends show that the increasing   digitisation of Eswatini will result in increased dependency of Eswatini’s economy and society   on ICT.  Increased dependency on ICT also in turn provides opportunities for cyber threat   actors to attempt to attack or illegally access and damage data, information systems and   networks in Eswatini. Given that the Cyberspace is borderless, criminals continue to increase   their capacities and activities to attack countries across the world, including Eswatini.   In the following sub-section, the strategy provides an overview of some of the known   vulnerabilities and threats facing Eswatini today.    1.2.1 Threats      1.2.1.1 Cybercriminals   Cybercrime continues to be a pervasive threat to nations across the world, including Eswatini.    Cybercriminals continue to target economic prosperity of individuals, institutions and nations,     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           7      since majority of these cybercrimes are financially motivated and incur minimal risk of being   caught or identified.  There exist two types of cybercrimes namely crimes that can only be   executed through the use of ICT devices where the devices are both the target of the crime   and the tool for executing the crime (cyber dependent crimes); and traditional crimes whose   reach and scale and expanded by the use of ICTs such as computers, computer networks   (cyber enabled crimes).   An example of cyber dependent crimes includes the deployment of   ransomware for launching a specific attack (such as financial gain), whilst an example of cyber   enabled crimes include cyber enabled fraud using computers.      Similar to other nations across the world, cybercriminals that commit cybercrimes within   Eswatini’s jurisdiction might either be based in Eswatini itself, or across the Southern African   Development Community (SADC) region, or another part of the world. The Royal Eswatini   Police Service has in recent years, been reporting and detecting cybercrime activities, including   identifying the perpetrators. However, like other law enforcement forces across the world, the   Royal Eswatini Police Service continues to face difficulties in conducting investigations,   collecting electronic evidence and prosecuting cybercrimes. These challenges are exacerbated   by the sophistication of the cyber-attacks and cross-border nature of the crimes committed.    Today, cyber criminals continue to use increasingly sophisticated techniques to commit   cybercrimes, and prefer jurisdictions where there is limited investigation and/or reciprocate   prosecutorial capabilities.       The Royal Eswatini Police Service is currently enhancing its capacity to investigate   cybercrimes, and collaboration with other law enforcement agencies from the SADC region   and Interpol to pursue and prosecute cyber criminals.  Eswatini will continue to face cyber   threats perpetuated by cybercriminals in the foreseeable future.  The Wannacry ransomware   attack of May 2017 was a global cyber-attack launched by cyber criminals which targeted   computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data on these   systems and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin crypto currency. That is an example of   the sort of attack cybercriminals are capable of executing, and demonstrates how   cybercriminals are employing sophisticated techniques like ransomware and threats of   distributed denial of service (DDoS) for extortion. In addition to these threats from organised   cybercrime gangs, there are on-going threats resulting from common and less sophisticated   cybercrimes, which target small organisations or individuals. These cybercrimes are consistent   with global trends of increasing numbers of cyber criminals targeting individuals and   businesses for financial pay-outs.  These include crimes such as ATM fraud, identity theft, etc.        Eswatini has drafted the Computer and Cyber Crime Bill, which addresses substantive and   procedural provisions on cybercrime, and is awaiting enactment by Parliament before coming   into law. Apart from this Bill, no legislation currently exists which specifically addresses   cybercrime in Eswatini.       1.2.1.2 Hactivism     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           8      Hactivism threat actors or hactivist groups tend to attack their targets to promote a political   or social agenda.  Their motivations are usually either politically or socially motivated.    Hacktivist attacks are disruptive in nature and consist of DDoS and website defacements   though a few hactivist attacks have inflicted great and sometimes lasting damage to their   targets. Eswatini has experienced a number of hactivist related website defacements or DDoS   attacks in the past years.    1.2.1.3 Insiders   Organisations across the world including those in Eswatini continue to grapple with the cyber   threat posed by insiders commonly called insider threat. Employees with access to critical   systems and data belonging to their organisations pose a significant threat to these same   organisations.  They damage the reputation and to a certain extend the financial position of   these organisations deliberately. For instance they could leverage their knowledge to launch   or facilitate an attack to disrupt critical functions of their organisation, or steal sensitive data   from their organisations. Other than these deliberate acts, insiders could also unintentionally   cause harm to their organisations. This could be by downloading unsafe content to company   computers, clicking on phishing emails, plugging infected USBs to a computer, etc. These   insiders could also be targeted by social engineering techniques of cyber criminals and   inadvertently execute actions that negatively impact their organisations and benefit cyber   criminals.    1.2.1.4 Cyber Terrorism   Eswatini is fully aware of global trends on cyber terrorism, which includes the use of Internet   and especially social networks to radicalise individuals and recruit members into these terrorist   groups.  These recruits form terrorist cells that eventually execute cyber-attacks against   selected target countries.   With the rapid increase in digitisation of developing countries such as Eswatini, there is   increasing likelihood that highly technically skilled terrorist groups or lone actors will always   emerge with a capability of causing devastating cyber-attacks against target nations.  It’s   therefore imperative that Eswatini prepares adequately for such scenarios by developing a   comprehensive National Cybersecurity Strategy that takes such threats into account.     1.2.1.5 States and state-sponsored threats    An emerging threat as observed in the decade is cyber-attacks targeting sovereign nations by   either other nations or through state sponsored actors. These nations or state sponsored   actors generally seek to unlawfully access either critical information systems, networks or data   from targeted states to gain either political, technological, or economic advantages over the   targeted nations. Eswatini can potentially become a target of suck an attack, and therefore   needs to establish steps to mitigate these threats.          Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           9      1.2.2 Vulnerabilities   Considering the on-going liberalisation of the ICT sector in Eswatini, and the on-going efforts   by Eswatini to increase access and use of ICTs across the nation, it is evident that the Internet   will become increasingly integrated in the day-to-day activities of individuals and institutions   in Eswatini. Considering the global forecasts1, which predicts that “Internet of Things” will   proliferate rapidly across the world, which implies there will be continuous emergence of   vulnerabilities that potentially can be exploited by cyber criminals to cause devastating attacks.    Eswatini needs to put in place measures, good practices and procedures across all segments   of its economy and society in order to address the current and emerging vulnerabilities mainly   in networks, systems and software. This need cannot be overstated, especially given the   recent high profile attack observed worldwide, such as the Wannacry ransomware, which   affected services several government and private sector organisations worldwide. Within the   context that most successful cyber-attacks result from the successful exploitation of known   vulnerabilities that are easily mitigated, the country is obliged to undertake the necessary   action to encourage individuals and institutions in Eswatini to invest and take adequate   measures to mitigate and manage these vulnerabilities. These measures and the investments   need to focus on key areas including technology; individuals and governance.    Another vulnerability threat facing Eswatini relates to the use of unlicensed software and   unpatched information systems by either individuals or private/public organisations in   Eswatini. Cyber threat actors tend to exploit the vulnerabilities that are inherent in any   unlicensed software or unpatched information system. One of the main challenges facing   Eswatini today relate to the gaps in skills, knowledge and capabilities required to   comprehensively address the cybersecurity needs of the private and public sector of Eswatini.    More critical is managing the current risks and threats facing both sectors. A part from IT   staff, most senior to board level management of key institutions in Eswatini have a limited   understanding of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats facing their institutions.  It is worth   noting that both the Financial Sector and ICT Sector organisations have an understanding for   the need for cybersecurity, and have prioritised having cybersecurity awareness programmes   and instilling a cybersecurity mindset to staff, especially with respect to good practice in   mitigating cyber threats.  In general, however, there is no coordinated framework for raising   awareness on Cybersecurity across Eswatini.  As result the general public in Eswatini tend to   have limited and insufficient knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity.    1.3 Cybersecurity Capacity Review       In September 2017, Eswatini with assistance from the International Telecommunication Union   (ITU) and Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) conducted a cybersecurity                                                               1 Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecasts And Market Estimates, 2016 -   https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/11/27/roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-market-estimates- 2016/#368ddbb9292d    https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/11/27/roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2016/#368ddbb9292d https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/11/27/roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2016/#368ddbb9292d   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           10      capacity review for the country. The review was based on a Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity   Model (CMM) developed by CTO’s and ITU’s implementing partner University of Oxford’s   Oxford Martin School. The model was used to examine the cybersecurity capacity maturity   based on five key dimensions—Policy & Strategy; Culture & Society; Education, Training &   Skills; Legal & Regulatory Frameworks; and Standards, Organisations, & Technologies. Using   this model enabled stakeholders in Eswatini to determine the current cybersecurity status and   posture for Eswatini, and highlighted a range of challenges and opportunities that Eswatini   needs to seek or address in this strategy.         1.3.1  Summary of the Key Findings of the Assessment as of September,   2017   i) Although Eswatini has started considering cyber security as a priority issue in its ICT policy   implementation, there is no overarching national cyber security programme for the nation.    ii) Eswatini does not have a formal framework or approach for monitoring cyber threats; and   detecting, preventing and mitigating cyber-attacks within the country.   iii) Eswatini has not formally identified Critical National Infrastructures (CNI) and categorised   their respective Critical Information Infrastructures (CII).  There is no formal collaboration   framework between CII operators or owners and the Public Sector. In addition, there is   no national risk management framework and contingency plans against cyber-attacks to   ensure resiliency of CIIs.   iv) Eswatini does not have adequate and effective legislation, policies and regulations on   cyber security, which are required to address both current and future cyber security   threats. A number of draft Bills addressing various cybersecurity issues are still being   considered but haven’t been formally enacted.   v) There is inadequate training capacity and lack of specialised expertise in Cybersecurity   both public and private sectors in Eswatini.    vi) In general, there is limited awareness of cybersecurity and how to mitigate cyber-attacks   and this is exacerbated lack of a cybersecurity mind-set and culture across all segments   of society in Eswatini.       1.4 National Cybersecurity Strategy Alignment with National Agenda   This strategy is aligned with the objectives and aspirations of the national agenda of Eswatini     National Development Strategy (Vision 2022) of the Kingdom of Eswatini which is   aimed at creating by 2022 a nation which “will be in the top 10% of the medium human   development group of countries founded on sustainable economic development, social   justice and political stability” by focusing on addressing the quality of life in the country.

Eswatini is in the process of establishing a number of regulatory and legislative instruments,   which will provide direction and guidelines on a number of key cybersecurity related issues.    Although there is currently no legislation specifically addressing cybersecurity, the current   framework for cybersecurity, which provides some direction and governance on secure e-  commerce, e-transactions and cryptology services are catered for by:       o Electronic Records (Evidence) Act 2014, which gives legal effect to: admission   and authentication of electronic records; evidence of electronic records;     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           12      including secure electronic records; and admissibility of electronic signature   and integrity of electronic record      o Cryptography Regulations (published in the latter half of 2016)       Electronic transactions is provided for by:   o Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill       Data protection and online privacy is provided for by:    o Data Protection Bill, which is still awaiting enactment by parliament       Cybercrime is provided for by:   o Computer Crime and Cyber Crime Bill, which is still awaiting enactment by   parliament                                                  Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           13      2 STRATEGY APPROACH   The National Vision for cybersecurity together with the core elements of Eswatini’s approach   for managing the numerous cyber threats are outlined in this section.    2.1 Vision Statement   Eswatini’s Vision for Cybersecurity is:   “A safe, secure and resilient Cyberspace in Eswatini”   2.2 Strategic Goals   Eswatini aims to achieve the above National Vision through the following five key Strategic   Goals:    Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national critical information   infrastructure and other related ICT services       Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen the cybersecurity governance, policy, regulatory and   legislative frameworks of Eswatini       Strategic Goal 3: Build Eswatini’s capacity and expertise in cybersecurity       Strategic Goal 4: Foster a safe and secure information society for Eswatini       Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen cooperation, collaboration and partnerships on   cybersecurity      2.3 Guiding Principles   The execution of this strategy will be underpinned by the following principles:    1. The Rule of Law: This Strategy will be implemented in accordance with the laws   recognized in Eswatini and enshrined in Eswatini Constitution (2005), which protects   the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens. This Strategy will also be   implemented in accordance with international instruments, which Eswatini has   ascended to such as the Articles 16, 17(e) and 34(c) of the UN Convention on the   Rights of the Child.    2. Shared Responsibility: Eswatini recognises that all stakeholders have their   individual roles and responsibilities in protecting Eswatini’s cyberspace. This strategy   will ensure that all stakeholders in Eswatini meet their responsibilities in protecting and   enhancing resilience and availability of all the CIIs in Eswatini. This strategy will also     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           14      provide a platform for all stakeholders to collaborate and cooperate with each other in   order to have an equitable shared responsibility.    3. Risk-based approach: The Kingdom of Eswatini fully appreciates that it is nearly   impossible to ensure complete cyber security across the nation, and that is why, this   Strategy will ensure that individuals and institutions in Eswatini employ a risk based   approach in prioritising and executing cyber related activities, as well as assessing and   managing cyber threats.   4. Universal Access to Internet and Cyberspace: This Strategy will ensure that all   individuals and organisations within Eswatini have full access to the Internet, and are   able to fully leverage a secure cyberspace to improve their prosperity and wellness.    5. ICT as a key enabler: Eswatini recognises that digitisation of nations tends to   translate into improvement in social-economic prosperity and wellbeing of its citizens.   In order to achieve this, Eswatini has embarked on embracing ICTs as a key enabler   for social and economic development. This strategy will support this transformation by   ensuring that cybersecurity becomes an integral consideration of all strategies,   programmes and capabilities deployed by Eswatini to enable digital transformation.     6. Proactive action: Eswatini will proactively develop the requisite measures and tools   to detect and manage the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape. It will also   encourage individuals and organisations in Eswatini to proactively defend their   information systems, data and networks.               Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           15      3 ACHIEVING STRATEGIC GOALS   The following section outlines the Specific Objectives and Strategies that need to be achieved   and executed respectively, to enable the attainment of Eswatini’s national Vision on   Cybersecurity by 2025.  These Strategies will be executed in a manner that is consistent with   the principles described above.      As Eswatini embarks on digitally transforming its economy and society, more and more   processes and services across Eswatini are increasingly becoming reliant on ICT systems and   networks, and data that is generated or accessed by these systems. This dependency implies   that any successful attack on some of these systems can severely impact the socio-economic   wellbeing of the citizens of Eswatini. This will result in the lack of services supported by the   Critical Information Infrastructure, which enables delivery of essential services across the   nation like electricity, healthcare, transport etc., as well as information systems that support   the well-functioning of the Eswatini society like e-government services and financial services.       Eswatini acknowledges that the digital transformation of its economy and society should   include, as a priority, the protection of CII and other ICT related services. The relevant MDAs   in government will work with all relevant organisations to protect and enhance the resilience   of CIIs including e-Government and other related ICT services, especially as most of these   systems are owned and operated by the private sector. Eswatini will ensure that all relevant   stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting CII and ICT services.       3.1.1 Specific Objective 1.1: Protect the critical information infrastructure and   other ICT related services      Both public and private sector organisations, particularly their senior directors and board level   management, that own and manages most CIIs as well as other ICT related services, must   fully understand their systems, networks and data. These organisations will be expected to   identify their critical information systems, regularly monitor these systems to detect and   manage vulnerabilities and threats.  Eswatini will provide oversight and intervene where   necessary to ensure that these organisations develop the necessary capabilities to be resilient   from attacks.  This is in addition to managing cyber threats, risks, and vulnerabilities across   all CIIs and relevant ICT services in Eswatini. There is a need to foster a thorough   3.1 Strategic Goal 1: Enhance the security and resilience of national   critical information infrastructure and other related ICT services     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           16      understanding of the vulnerabilities and threats facing CIIs and ICT services across Eswatini,   and ensure that effective measures are implemented, which will improve the cybersecurity of   these CIIs and ICT services.       Actions:   3.1.1.1 Establish a National Critical Information Infrastructure Register.      3.1.1.2 Develop a national CII Governance Framework, which describes CII protection   procedures, processes, guidelines, good practices to be adhered to by CII Operators   and owners.      3.1.1.3 Establish a National Risk and Vulnerability Register and Regulations, to ensure   continuous vulnerability monitoring and disclosure as well as risk assessment and   management across all CIIs.      3.1.1.4 Develop and continually review CII minimum security standards and procedures to   be complied with, including security audits, equipment specifications, Standard   Operating Procedures (SOPs), Access Control Mechanisms, etc.      3.1.1.5 Conduct continuous monitoring of, and regular testing of CII and Information   Systems to detect vulnerabilities, illicit access, errors, etc.      Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:   3.1.1.6 The Government of Eswatini together with CIIs and ICT services owners across   Eswatini will keep abreast of, and fully understand the vulnerabilities, risks and levels   of cyber security across CII and Information Systems in Eswatini.      3.1.1.7 Eswatini will ensure there is resilience and availability of CIIs and ICT services across   Eswatini, following the establishment and implementation of appropriate CII   protection measures.      3.1.1.8 CII and Information Systems operators have an improved capacity to manage cyber   threats and incidents.          3.1.2 Specific Objective 1.2: Manage cyber threats facing Eswatini       Consistent with global trends, which indicate that the number and severity of cyber incidents   affecting individuals and organisations across nations, including Eswatini, will grow, coupled     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           17      with the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape.  Eswatini appreciates that it will need to   enhance the managing of cyber threats. It will also have to increasingly provide support to   organisations across all sectors on how to manage these threats. This will involve, inter alia,   contributing to the detection and mitigation of cyber threats, as well as the gathering and   dissemination of information about current and emerging cyber threats nationwide.  This will   also require Eswatini to work closely with the private sector and other partners such as   regional SADC countries to ensure an effective, efficient and coordinated cyber incident   response framework across the region.       Actions:   3.1.2.1 Define, publish and continuously review the minimum incident register requirements   to enable dependable incident analysis against a rapidly evolving cyber landscape.      3.1.2.2 Continuously identify, monitor and analyse risks and cyber threats in order to provide   a real-time picture of the threats and risks facing Eswatini.      3.1.2.3 Develop and continuously update a national cyber incident register for Eswatini.      3.1.2.4 Continuously analyse cyber incidents within Eswatini and the SADC region to develop   and execute measures to resolve incidents and manage cyber threats.      3.1.2.5 Develop and implement national procedures for risk management and data   protection.      3.1.2.6 Develop and continuously update cyber incident scenarios and cyber contingency   plans that clearly define crisis management procedures including the roles and   responsibilities of all stakeholders during cyber incidents and emergencies, and which   can be used during cyber exercises.      3.1.2.7 Undertake regular cyber drills and exercises to test national crisis management   measures, and leverage lessons learned to improve crisis management measures and   the national response to cyber incidents.      Desired Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve the   following outcomes:      3.1.2.8 With its comprehensive understanding of cyber threats, Eswatini will establish and   implement a national and synchronized cyber incident management approach.        Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           18      3.1.2.9 Eswatini will establish a centralised incident reporting and response functionality   within the National Cybersecurity Agency and as result cyber incidents are regularly   and consistently reported to Eswatini’s National Cybersecurity Agency.      3.1.2.10 Through its National Cybersecurity Agency, Eswatini will be able to effectively and   efficiently manage cyber incidents nationwide.           Given the cross border nature of cyber threats and the potential for causing significant   damage, if successful, it is imperative that Eswatini implements robust cybersecurity   governance structures; have relevant policies, regulations and legislation.  These will provide   all relevant stakeholders, particularly private and public institutions with a wide set of tools to   ensure effective cybersecurity governance and management across Eswatini.  This will require   establishment of clearly defined processes, functions, policies, responsibilities and roles, to   ensure effective disruption of cyber criminal activities targeting Eswatini, as well as the   effective management of potential cyber threats. These frameworks should also enable the   country to fully benefit from the opportunities provided by cyberspace and the on-going digital   transformation.    3.2.1 Specific Objective 2.1: Establish a cybersecurity institutional framework to   ensure the effective management of cybersecurity across Eswatini   With increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and prevalence of cyber threats, it is   paramount that Eswatini sets up a comprehensive cybersecurity institutional framework for   the kingdom. This institutional framework will promote and facilitate effective and rapid   coordination of cybersecurity activities in a coordinated manner. The framework will also   enable Eswatini to provide effective governance and leadership on cybersecurity and related   issues. This will also ensure that stakeholders avoid duplication of efforts and inconsistencies   when discharging their respective responsibilities. In addition, such a framework will ensure   that Eswatini has the ability to respond to cyber threats, and protect CIIs and ICT services in   the country.   National Cybersecurity Agency - In order to have a coherent and comprehensive   institutional framework, some of its functions will include: - coordination of the implementation   of this strategy and related initiatives; coordination of national cyber incident detection,   prevention and response; periodic review and updating of this Strategy. Eswatini aspires to   establish a National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA), with legitimate mandate, legal authority,   relevant skills/expertise, and capabilities required to lead on cybersecurity related issues and   its implementation in Eswatini. The NCA will be housed and function under the   3.2 Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen the cybersecurity governance,   policy, regulatory and legislative frameworks of Eswatini ICT   services     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           19      Communications regulator, ESCCOM, and work along with law enforcement agencies and   national security, other relevant institutions in coordination with the Ministry of ICT.   National Cybersecurity Council – this is an executive level body that will be made up of   Ministry of ICT, ESCCOM, Police, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Defence,   Financial Services Sector, Operators, Academia, Civil Society. This is an advisory body under   the office of the Prime Minister. This body will oversee the overall cybersecurity posture of the   country and it will meet at least two times a year and advise Government. The chairman will   be appointed by the Prime Minister and the National Cybersecurity Agency will serve as the   secretariat. In the absence of the NCA, Director Communications serves as the secretariat.      Cybersecurity Working Groups – These are working groups formed from technical people   to work under the guidance of the Ministry of ICT. They may consist of personnel from   institutions such as CII operators, ISPs, academic institutions, prosecutors, police,   government, etc, who deal with issues of cybersecurity on a daily basis one way or another.   These are the Awareness and Capacity Building Aspects Group; the Policy, Legal and   Regulatory Aspects Group; the Technical Aspects Group; the National Security Aspects Group   and the Institutional and Governance Aspects Group. They work under the guidance of the   Director of Communications. Such groups are flexible and may be reconstituted as the   environment demands.   Actions:   3.2.1.1 Create and operationalize the National Cybersecurity Agency of Eswatini with the   mandate for developing, implementing and coordinating cybersecurity initiatives in   Eswatini, and provide leadership on the implementation of this strategy   3.2.1.2 Create the Cybersecurity Working Groups to help in the implementation of the   strategy.   3.2.1.3 Create the national CERT/CSIRT as a department within the National Cybersecurity   Agency with clear functions and responsibilities including incident response.      3.2.1.4 Establish a National Cybersecurity Training & Research Unit within the Innovation   Park at RSTP and other institutions.      3.2.1.5 Create the National Cybersecurity Council.      3.2.1.6 Establish a National Cyber Defence Command Centre for Eswatini.      3.2.1.7 Strengthen the role and mandate of law enforcement and security agencies to   enhance their capacity in various areas including digital forensics, digital evidence   and other computer enabled methods to disrupt malicious cyber activities.     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           20      3.2.1.8 Develop a cyber defence strategy, which describes the national approach for   addressing cyber threats to the national security of Eswatini.        Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.2.1.9 Eswatini will establish a centralised and robust governance framework that has at its   core, a coherent and national approach for developing, implementing and   coordinating initiatives relating to cybersecurity in Eswatini.      3.2.2 Specific Objective 2.2: Establish and articulate the national position on   cybersecurity   It is critical that Eswatini establishes and articulates its national position on cybersecurity   issues to ensure coherent and seamless interactions of public and private organisations within   Eswatini.  In articulating its national position on cybersecurity, Eswatini aims to ensure it is   innovative and creative, outward and forward looking (i.e. considers factors within and beyond   Eswatini).      Desired Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve the   following outcome:      3.2.2.1 Eswatini will have a clear and coherent position on cybersecurity that is understood   by all stakeholders and will drive the national focus in ensuring a safe, secure and   resilient Cyberspace for Eswatini.      3.2.3 Specific Objective 2.3: Establish a comprehensive legal and regulatory   framework for cybersecurity      The on-going efforts by Eswatini to leverage ICTs as an enabler for socio-economic   development, and the benefits from improved prosperity and wellness resulting from digitising   its society and economy, will increasingly face Cyber threats perpetrated through sophisticated   cybercrimes. In addition, and considering that the global cyber threat landscape and cyber   trends are rapidly and continuously changing, Eswatini will need to establish, and continuously   review cybersecurity legal and regulatory frameworks that are aligned and relevant to current   and emerging cyber trends. These frameworks will provide all relevant stakeholders, such as   the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, with the appropriate technology and tools to   enable them to carry out their mandate effectively.      Eswatini will prioritise the enactment and enforcement of all relevant cybersecurity laws that   are currently pending, including: - the Computer Crime and Cybercrime Act, the Data     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           21      Protection Act and other appropriate instruments to strengthen provisions addressing various   cybersecurity issues. These provisions or instruments also need to be aligned to both regional   (with SADC) and international norms (including the Budapest convention), criminalise   malicious cyber activities in Eswatini, and improve the investigation and prosecution of   cybercrimes. It is important that the established cybersecurity legal and regulatory framework   for Eswatini is suitably applicable and technology neutral.  This will enable Eswatini to tackle   emerging cyber threats effectively whilst still allowing innovation and growth of the ICT sector.        Actions:   3.2.3.1 Expedite the enactment of pending legislation relating to Cybersecurity.      3.2.3.2 Undertake a gap analysis of Eswatini’s Legal and Regulatory Framework in order to   identify gaps related to cybersecurity.  Once identified, establishing appropriate   instruments to address these gaps as well as enhance Eswatini’s legal and regulatory   framework on cybersecurity and cybercrime.      3.2.3.3 Subscribe to relevant regional and international instruments relating to cybersecurity   and cybercrime.      3.2.3.4 Review and improve legal provisions on procedural powers for investigations of   cybercrime and evidentiary requirements to enhance the fight against cybercrime.      Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.2.3.5 Establish an updated and forward-looking legal and regulatory framework, which   addresses on-going developments and trends in relation to cybersecurity, and   includes relevant international standards that will enhance Eswatini’s capability to   combat cybercrime activities targeting or committed in Eswatini.      3.2.3.6 Have a comprehensive and robust legal and regulatory framework, which provides   Eswatini’s law enforcement and judiciary with the appropriate tools and technologies   to execute their mandate with respect to cybersecurity and cybercrime.         3.2.4 Specific Objective 2.4: Establish cybersecurity standards, guidelines,   technical and operational frameworks      Eswatini will ensure that various instruments including cybersecurity standards, guidelines,   technical and operational frameworks are developed, published and deployed nationwide.   These frameworks will ensure that both public and private organisations including individuals     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           22      nationwide understand their responsibilities in securing their data, information systems and   networks, based on good cybersecurity practices and measures. Eswatini will ensure that   these standards, guidelines, technical and operational frameworks are tailored to national   specifications that will enhance the cybersecurity posture for Eswatini, especially with respect   to the CIIs and ICT services.        Actions:   3.2.4.1 Develop and promote the adoption of a National Cybersecurity Standards Framework   across CIIs and ICT services in Eswatini.      3.2.4.2 Promote the awareness and implementation of a National Cybersecurity Standards   Framework across the private sector, especially the Small and Medium Enterprises   (SME) sector which contributes significantly to Eswatini’s economy.      Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.2.4.3 Establish comprehensive and appropriate cybersecurity standards, guidelines,   operational frameworks, processes, procedures applicable to Eswatini, and as a   result, secure CIIs and ICT services based on well-defined national cybersecurity   standards.             Eswatini requires a skilled and talented human resource pool to in order to drive the digital   transformation of Eswatini in a manner that ensures the resilience and availability of CIIs and   ICT services, and fosters confidence and trust in cyberspace across the nation. This is a key   motivation of this strategy, which seeks to ensure a rapid development of qualified and   talented cybersecurity professionals nationwide by addressing the existing challenges limiting   the development of cybersecurity capacity and expertise in Eswatini.  Some of these   challenges include:    - lack of funding and support for cybersecurity capacity building especially in the public   sector,    - shortage of locally based cybersecurity trainers,    - lack of career and training pathways,    - insufficient cybersecurity training and education programmes,    3.3 Strategic Goal 3: Build Eswatini’s capacity and expertise in   cybersecurity services     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           23      - limited focus on cybersecurity in the national curricula.       Eswatini will promote collaboration and cooperation among all relevant stakeholders in the   development and execution of various measures aimed at tackling these existing barriers. A   number of stakeholders have been identified including:    - relevant government ministries, departments and agencies;    - schools, universities, private sector organisations, academia, and    - civil society among others.      3.3.1 Specific Objective 3.1: Develop a nationwide and sustainable pool of highly   skilled cybersecurity professionals      Eswatini will embark on addressing the current lack of cybersecurity skills and expertise   nationwide, by establishing a national approach for developing skills and expertise on   cybersecurity across Eswatini. This approach will consist of a number of measures aimed at   transforming cybersecurity education and training across Eswatini, and will be underpinned   by the recognition of the collective role and responsibility of multiple stakeholders such as the   government, education sector, both private and public sector, civil society, and the academia   in addressing the skill shortage.

Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           27            Eswatini will work closely with all relevant stakeholders to strengthen their understanding and   awareness of cyber threats facing them, and in the process effect positive changes towards   Cybersecurity good practices. There is inconsistency across various sectors in adopting and   executing appropriate steps in protecting their data, information systems and networks in   Eswatini. While both the Telecommunications and Financial sector in Eswatini have internal   cybersecurity awareness programmes and taken various measures to protect their   infrastructures, a significant number of organisations and individuals in Eswatini are yet to   adopt good practices in enhancing Cybersecurity. Eswatini will roll out a number of measures   and initiatives to change the behaviours of individuals and organisations across Eswatini such   that they become cybersecurity conscious, adopt and implement appropriate good practice   measures to protect themselves online and against cyber threats, thereby creating a secure   and safe information society in Eswatini.            3.4.1 Specific Objective 4.1:  Establish a cybersecurity mind-set and culture in   Eswatini      Eswatini will roll out a number of measures, which will create a cybersecurity mind-set and   culture across the nation. These measures will be based on a nationwide study to assess the   reasons preventing individuals and organisations in Eswatini from adopting a cybersecurity   mindset and culture. These measures will also include tailored awareness raising campaigns   targeting specific groups of individuals and organisations. Eswatini will use a wide range of   channels to rollout these awareness programmes including social-centres, billboards,   communities, media, etc.  In addition, Eswatini will work with a range of stakeholders including   relevant entities in Eswatini that regularly engage with citizens like known civil society   organisations and relevant government agencies. Eswatini will also seek to understand the   financial impacts of managing cyber threats and risks, particularly within the Eswatini context   and disseminate this information widely.         Actions:      3.4.1.1 Conduct a national study to assess levels of Cybersecurity awareness across Eswatini.    Then develop and roll-out tailored national awareness programmes targeting all   groups of users, especially those who are vulnerable and at risk such as children,   women, seniors citizens and other vulnerable groups      3.4 Strategic Goal 4: Foster a safe and secure information society   for Eswatini     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           28      3.4.1.2 Publicise cybersecurity good practices nationwide to instil a cybersecurity culture   across Eswatini.       3.4.1.3 Conduct mandatory cybersecurity training of high-ranking government officials,   legislators, private sector board members and management.      Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.4.1.4 Cybersecurity good practices are widely established both in private and public sectors   across Eswatini, resulting in continuous reduction in the number of serious and high-  impact cyber-attacks in Eswatini.       3.4.1.5 Organisations and individuals in Eswatini, especially high ranking government   officials, legislators, private sector board members and management, understand the   need for cybersecurity, responsibilities, liabilities, together with the measures for   protecting their organisations establishment of a cybersecurity culture in Eswatini.       3.4.2 Specific Objective 4.2:  Create a secure environment for e-government   services in Eswatini      Eswatini is committed to rollout e-government services across all segments of its economy   and society. This will require embedding minimum levels of cyber security for e-government   and e-commerce services, which will in effect build trust and confidence in e-government   services among all users. The Kingdom of Eswatini will embark on addressing the risks that   face e-government and e-commerce services including risks relating to confidentiality of data   of users and organisations. This will involve setting out measures: that ensure the integrity of   data to provide assurances that data has not been illicitly tampered, or illicitly accessed by   unauthorised parties, just to list a few. The Kingdom of Eswatini will accelerate the rollout of   IPv6, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and minimum security baselines in the design and   execution of e-government services.        Actions:      3.4.2.1 Deploy PKI across the nation especially in e-government services so as to leverage   the security features of PKI relating to confidentiality, authentication and data   integrity.      3.4.2.2 Encourage the transition from IPV4 to IPV6 protocol to leverage the IPV6 security   features relating to confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of information data.

Expected Outcome:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.4.2.4 Eswatini’s e-government services are underpinned by cybersecurity requirements,   baselines and functionality, and as a result are trusted and used with confidence by   organisations and individuals in Eswatini.        3.4.3 Specific Objective 4.3: Build trust in the use of e-government services       To spur widespread adoption and utilisation of e-government services nationwide, Eswatini   will have to build trust among individuals and organisations. This will require the provision of   easily understandable information to users on the security features of these services.   Consequently, users will make informed choices and decisions about utilising e-government   services and eventually build up trust and confidence in these services. Eswatini will prioritise   the provision of information on the built-in security features of e-government services used   across the nation. Eswatini will also seek to understand security-related concerns of individuals   and organisations in relation to e-government services and deploy measures to address these   concerns. The National Cybersecurity Agency will be designated to collect and analyse   information on various security concerns expressed across Eswatini, analyse whether current   security features address these concerns, and develop appropriate features where necessary.   This information, analysis and measures will be disseminated across the nation in a format   and language that is easily understandable. Eswatini will foster effective communication   between all relevant stakeholders to demonstrate how secure e-government services are,   thereby building trust and enabling citizens to make informed choices and decisions based on   the extent of in-built security of these services.       Actions:   3.4.3.1 Establish Points of Contact within the National Cybersecurity Agency who will   interface with individuals and organisations across Eswatini to collect information on   their security concerns with e-government services, and analyse how these concerns   have been addressed or resolved.      3.4.3.2 Publicise widely and regularly across Eswatini how e-government services have been   secured to build trust in the use of e-government services and Eswatini’s cyberspace   in general.       Expected Outcomes:  In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           30      3.4.3.3 Robust and secure e-Government services deployed across Eswatini. Deploy security   measures to address comprehensively concerns expressed by users of e-government   services and disseminate widely information gathered on how these concerns have   been addressed.                         Taking into account the borderless nature of cyberspace, Eswatini fully understands that it is   crucial for it to collaborate with international stakeholders to ensure a safe and secure   cyberspace. Eswatini will build on existing cooperation and collaboration frameworks to take   part in cybersecurity activities and debates taking place beyond Eswatini. These opportunities   will enable Eswatini to address cyber issues, and create a secure and open cyberspace to   enhance the prosperity of the citizens of Eswatini. This participation should result in a marked   decrease in the cyber risks, threats and malicious activities, especially originating beyond   Eswatini’s borders.        3.5.1 Specific Objective 5.1: Promote collaboration and information sharing on   cybersecurity      Eswatini considers information sharing and collaboration as a key pillar for addressing   cybersecurity related challenges.  Eswatini will establish a framework that ensures rapid   information sharing between stakeholders, particularly between the government and private   sector to ensure that all stakeholders are informed regularly and timely on particular cyber   threats or attacks.  Eswatini envisages that its national CERT/CSIRT unit will serve as a centre   of information sharing activities across Eswatini, and will ensure that wide dissemination and   awareness of information on vulnerabilities, incidents and mitigation efforts across the   Eswatini. In addition, this also fosters a trusted and collaborative learning environment where   stakeholders develop a deeper understanding of emerging cyber threats, risks and mitigation   techniques, and benefit from effective information sharing and collaboration.     Actions:   3.5 Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen cooperation, collaboration and   partnerships on cybersecurity     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           31      3.5.1.1 Establish a network of sectorial cybersecurity focal points together with an   information sharing framework to enhance collaboration and mutual exchange of   information on Cybersecurity locally and internationally       3.5.1.2 Mandate the National Cybersecurity Agency as the national body for overseeing   information sharing and collaboration on cyber security.      3.5.1.3 Create national fora to promote a national information sharing on cybersecurity        Expected Outcomes: In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.5.1.4 Eswatini has more effective information sharing on cybersecurity issues both locally   and internationally, which in effect translate to more effective management of cyber   threats nationally.         3.5.2 Specific Objective 5.2: Establish partnerships to promote collaboration and   cooperation in addressing cybersecurity issues locally and internationally      Considering the rapidly changing cyber threat landscape, and the cross border nature of   cyberspace, Eswatini appreciates that stakeholders, whether national or international, benefit   from working together to tackle cybersecurity issues locally and internationally, especially in   leveraging the unique but often times complementary strengths of both sectors.  For instance,   within Eswatini, the private sector largely own and operate the critical information   infrastructure of Eswatini, and as such has already developed specific skills and capacity in   addressing cyber threats. While, the public sector notably, law enforcement agencies, are   better positioned to investigate and prosecute cyber-criminal activity or liaise with other   international agencies or nations to access and act upon intelligence on cyber-criminal activity.   The Kingdom will embark on facilitating the establishment of partnerships:    - To enable the identification or detection of criminal behaviour or   behaviours of concern;    - To facilitate the adoption of, and adherence to established good   practices of cybersecurity;    - To enable nationwide responses to cyber threats; and   - To ensure that emerging cybersecurity developments and implications   to the nation are fully understood by all stakeholders, notably the   government.      Actions:   3.5.2.1 Develop an International Collaboration Strategy that outlines how international   collaboration on cybersecurity and cybercrime is managed and funded     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           32         3.5.2.2 Enhance partnerships with local partners, other states and international stakeholders   to collaboratively address cyber security and combat cybercrimes      Expected Outcomes: In executing these strategic objectives, Eswatini expects to achieve   the following outcomes:      3.5.2.3 Effective collaboration with all relevant stakeholders on cybersecurity issues, and   active participation in international cybersecurity activities, resulting in improved   management of cyber threats and disruption of cyber criminal activity targeting   and/or originating from Eswatini.                 Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           33      4 IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT    4.1 Roles and Responsibilities    It is imperative that a collective understanding and recognition of the shared responsibility of   all stakeholders in protecting the CIIs and ICT services in Eswatini is at the core of the   management and implementation of this Strategy. Hence the delineation of roles and   responsibilities of key stakeholder groups in Eswatini is described as follows:    The Government of Eswatini is responsible for ensuring the protection of the national   cyberspace and citizens of Eswatini. Consequently, within the context of this Strategy, the   Government will be responsible for managing the cyber threats targeting the critical   information infrastructure and national security of Eswatini. Bearing in mind that the   Government of Eswatini holds national data and provides e-government services to citizens   and organisations, it is crucial that the Government of Eswatini puts in place robust and   appropriate measures to protect the systems, networks and information it possesses and   manages. While some CII are owned and operated by the private sector, the Government of   Eswatini is still responsible for ensuring that all CII in Eswatini are resilient and able to support   the continuous supply of essential services in Eswatini. This will require the Government to   ensure all CII service providers comply with minimum security standards for CII.  Another key   responsibility of the Government of Eswatini includes the provision of information and advises   to individuals and citizens thereby enabling them to adopt and implement the appropriate   measures for protecting themselves. One crucial role and responsibility of the Government   relates to the fostering an enabling environment for cybersecurity, where Eswatini’s education   and training system produces a sustainable pool of cyber expertise which will in turn drive an   innovative and vibrant cyber sector in Eswatini. In effect, the Government of Eswatini is   responsible for ensuring the successful implementation of this Strategy and the attainment of   the Expected Outcomes for the nation vis-à-vis cybersecurity.    Eswatini will establish a National Cybersecurity Agency to lead the implementation of this   Strategy. Consequently the National Cybersecurity Agency will coordinate, plan and implement   cybersecurity initiatives across Eswatini. The National Cybersecurity Agency through its   dedicated National CERT/CSIRT Unit will lead the cyber incident response and   management activities of Eswatini at the national level. The Agency will also oversee the   protection of CII in Eswatini, and provide advice and support to organisations across the   nation. One key role and responsibility of the Agency will be the assurance of adoption and   compliance of nationally established guidelines, standards, good practices, and security   requirements necessary for the protection of the systems, networks, and data. In effect, the   Agency will serve as the national source for cyber security expertise and direction nationwide.      Eswatini will constitute the National Cybersecurity Council and the Cybersecurity   Working Groups with representatives from the public and private sector organisations, to   provide strategic advice to Government.      Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           34         Organisations based in Eswatini own and manage systems, networks and information in   their day-to-day operations and provision of services. As a result, organisations are responsible   for securing the systems, networks and information they own or manage, whilst ensuring the   secure and continuous supply of services that are underpinned by these systems, networks   and information.  Consequently, organisations in Eswatini need to deploy appropriate   investments and measures, and develop the right capacities to ensure the security and   resilience of their systems, networks and information.   Owners and operators of Critical Information Infrastructure and Information Systems   in Eswatini are responsible for ensuring the protection and resilience of their systems,   networks and data, and will be required to execute all appropriate measures to ensure this   protection and resilience. They will also need to make investments and roll-out measures that   ensure their compliance with nationally defined cyber security guidelines, security   requirements, standards, processes, procedures, frameworks, etc.     Royal Eswatini Police Service and the Judiciary in collaboration with other relevant   stakeholders (national or international) will expand their efforts to disrupt, investigate and   prosecute cyber criminal activity conducted in, or targeting Eswatini. The Royal Eswatini Police   Service will work with the National Cybersecurity Agency to support the national cyber incident   and cyber emergency responses.   The Umbutfo Eswatini Defence Force is responsible for ensuring the defence of Eswatini   against cyber threats to the sovereignty and national security. This will require the Defence   Force to manage threats directly under military jurisdiction including cyber warfare, cyber   terrorism, etc.  The Defence Force will be responsible for managing operations at the Cyber   Defence Command Centre and for securing systems, networks, and data of the Defence Force.   The Eswatini Defence Force will work with the National Cybersecurity Agency to support the   national cyber incident and cyber emergency responses.   Civil Societies based in Eswatini will work with other relevant stakeholders in Eswatini to   ensure the accountability and transparency of public and private sector organisations. They   will also play a key role in building awareness of cybersecurity issues and trends nationwide   and across all segment of the Eswatini society. Furthermore, they will facilitate, ensure and   enhance engagement and dialogue among all stakeholders   All Individuals based in Eswatini will be responsible for adopting and implementing all   appropriate measures to protect themselves online, and secure the systems, networks and   data they own/or manage in their private and professional lives. It is critical individuals do this   as they are potentially weak links in the cyber security of the nation, and could be an effective   line of defence against cyber threats targeting Eswatini’s collective data, networks and   systems.      Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           35         4.2 Approach for Monitoring and Evaluation   Taking into consideration the continually evolving cyber threat landscape, and to enable the   successful implementation of this strategy, Eswatini will establish a Monitoring and Evaluation   Plan which will enable it monitor progress and impacts of the recommended objectives and   milestones in the Strategy. All monitoring and evaluation activities of Eswatini should enable   the achievement of the national Vision and Strategic Goals of this Strategy by assuring the   accurate reporting of progress, documentation of challenges faced, and the integration of   lessons learned in on-going implementation activities.       Eswatini is committed to undertake monitoring and evaluation of this strategy in a manner   that supports informed and effective planning and decision making. The Monitoring and   Evaluation (M&E) Plan will ensure that the strategy is consistent with the following approach:      4.2.1 The M&E Plan will be based on well-defined SMART Performance Targets for each   stakeholder group involved in, and responsible for implementing specific elements of   this strategy.     4.2.2 The Plan will be based on annual action plans which establish a common understanding   of the expected end results, outline the approach for achieving these end results and   identify the resources required to achieve these end results. These annual action plans   consider the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and Time Lines provided in the   Implementation Logical Framework      4.2.3 It will specify performance and progress related indicators, and will establish who is   responsible for collecting data on the indicators. The plan will also specify what   methods and tools will be used to collect the data, and how the data will be used. The   plan will be built on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), SMART Performance   Targets and Time Lines.      4.2.4 It will ensure the progress in achieving expected results and Expected Outcomes is   regularly monitored and reported on, with deviations promptly observed and reported   as well.       4.2.5 The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will ensure the periodic   assessment of the performance against defined targets. These   periodic reviews for determining progress in achieving Expected   Outcomes and long term impact of strategy will be undertaken as   follows    o Annual reviews   o Mid-term review at the start of year 3 of this strategy   o Long term review by end of the of year 4 of this strategy     Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025                   Eswatini National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2025           36         4.2.6 The Plan will ensure that wherever necessary, remedial measures   to keep implementation on track are adopted and implemented      Eswatini will develop and implement a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan based on the   proposed approach outlined above within 4 months of the launch of this strategy.    CONCLUSION   As Eswatini embarks on leveraging ICTs fully to digitally transform its economy and society,   it acknowledges the existence of current cyber threats and on-going emergence of cyber   threats amidst a global and rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. Eswatini has developed   this strategy, which clearly defines the national ambition, approach and commitment in   ensuring that all current and future cybersecurity challenges and cyber threats are managed   effectively and responsively.    Eswatini is dedicated to ensuring that the nation has the requisite capacity and capability to   keep up and protect itself from future and current cyber threats. With the successful   implementation of this strategy, Eswatini will transform itself into one of nations with a well-  established cybersecurity posture, where harmful cybersecurity activity targeting or conducted   in Eswatini is significantly disrupted and reduced, and individuals and organisations fully   leverage cyberspace to improve their socio-economic prosperity and well-being.

The Strategic Police Plan shall include a set of activities that, in accordance with the principles and standards of the Police Intelli- gence Model (POM, Article 34 of the Law on Police), shall efficiently direct the work of the Police in addressing the most serious security issues. The policing priorities have been identified by the Strategic Assessment of Public Security. In accordance with the place and role of the Police in society, while recognising the demands of citizens, the situation and trends of crime in the Republic of Serbia, Europe and the world, the Strategic Assessment of Public Security defines the priorities, and the Strategic Police Plan defines the activities that the General Police Directorate will undertake to effectively address the defined security priorities. The aim of the General Police Directorate’s Strategic Plan is to focus the police work on the most serious problems, in cooperation with other public authorities and social actors, to contribute to the rule of law, to provide every citizen of the Republic of Serbia with equal protection of security, and respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Serbia. 1. Operating standards and principles The activities envisaged by the Strategic Plan will be carried out in accordance with the Constitution, the Law on Police, other laws and by-laws, and the provisions of the Code of Police Ethics. In undertaking the activities, the Police will adhere to the established and achieved standards of the police profession, while taking into account generally accepted international standards of conduct related to the respect of the rights of citizens of the Republic of Serbia. In performing the planned activities, the Police will be guided by the principles of policing, in particular: legality, methodology, coor- dination and cooperation, persistence and thoroughness, professionalism, 3E (economy, efficiency and effectiveness) and the protection of information sources. StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 3 2. Basic elements of the Plan The Strategic Plan defines the activities, implementers of activities, period of implementation, output indicators and sources of veri- fication of achieved outputs for each of the defined priorities of policing. The Strategic Assessment of Public Security defines the policing priorities: Organised crime;• Combating the production and trafficking of drugs with focus on cannabis and synthetic drugs;• Fighting against corruption;• Fighting against the misuse of information and communication technology;• Combating terrorism and violent extremism leading to terrorism;• Improving the situation of public peace and order by combating violence, with special emphasis on violence at sports events, in • schools and public places; Improving the situation of traffic safety on state roads, including the sections of state roads passing through settlements;• Irregular migration and smuggling of people.• Activities are a system of interrelated actions aimed at: improving the regulatory framework and practice of policing; strengthening the institutional and professional capacities of the police; development of operational procedures of policing; improvement of preven- tion; and the promotion of cooperation at the national, regional and international levels. The activities defined by the plan represent the response necessary for addressing effectively the most serious security problems in the Republic of Serbia. Implementers of activities are organisational units responsible for the implementation of planned activities defined in the Strategic Plan. Period of implementation is the planned time frame for performing the activities. The time frame is defined annually and quarterly and represents the period of implementation of an activity, i.e. the time of beginning and completion. Output indicators are the indicators of activities, data suitable for assessing the success of the implemented activities. The sources of verification, the providers of information on the quality and quantity of output indicators for the planned activities have been defined for each priority for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the Strategic Police Plan. 3. Mechanism of the implementation of the Strategic Plan 4 StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 3.1. Responsibility for the implementation of the Strategic Plan The Strategic Management Group, headed by the Police Director, is responsible for the organisation and coordination of the activities envisaged under the Strategic Police Plan. The Strategic Management Group manages and directs the work; instructs the organisational units at the headquarters, in the City of Belgrade Police Directorate and in the regional police directorates in performing the activities envisaged in the Strategic Police Plan. The Strategic Management Group coordinates and ensures the implementation of activities, measures and actions jointly with other public authorities and international bodies as defined by the Plan and required for the efficient work on addressing the prioritised secu- rity issues. The Strategic Management Group creates necessary conditions for maintaining the professional and institutional capacity of the Police for undertaking measures and actions to improve the level of efficiency in taking measures and actions defined by the Plan. 3.2. Monitoring the implementation of the Strategic Plan The Strategic Management Group monitors the implementation of the activities included in the Strategic Plan at the meetings or- ganised on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary. The implementation of the Strategic Plan is monitored by the main coordinators in the organisational unit of the General Police Di- rectorate and the coordinators in the regional police directorates by using a developed instrument (form) for monthly reporting on the implementation of strategic and operational plans of the organisational units of the General Police Directorate. In case that the Strategic Management Group identifies problems in the implementation of the planned activities, it will request a report from the relevant organisational unit responsible for the implementation of particular activity to be considered at a specially or- ganised meeting with the aim of defining the ways for eliminating the identified problems and implement the planned activities. StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 5 II PLAN OF ACTIVITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The strategic policing priorities for the period 2017–2021 have been defined on the basis of applicable legal regulations, strategic documents of the Ministry and other ministries defining the Ministry as implementer of certain activities, expert and scientific sources and on the basis of the priorities defined in the Activity Programme of the Government of the Republic of Serbia, while taking fully into consideration the European Union’s strategic documents (Europol’s annual EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report – TE-SAT, Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment – SOCTA, Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment – IOCTA), including the priorities from the European Security Agenda 2015–2020. The strategic priorities are of equal importance to the General Police Directorate and to the Ministry of Interior, and they are given equal attention. 1. ORGANISED CRIME Organised crime1 is one of the major security threats and therefore it is necessary to take a strategic approach to combat it more ef- ficiently. In that context, the first national Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) is a document that shows the scope, situation, characteristics, the level of perpetrators’ organisation, the functioning of organised and criminal groups, and identifies key security threats in this area in the Republic of Serbia. The assessment findings and the given recommendations constitute an objective basis for the selection of priorities and the adoption of strategic and operational decisions with the aim of efficient organisation of work on countering the serious and organised crime. The Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) defines the following priorities: drugs;• people smuggling and irregular migration;• trafficking in human beings;• robberies;• motor vehicles;• weapons;• economic crime (smuggling and illicit trade in excisable goods and currency counterfeiting);• money laundering;• cybercrime. • 1 Summary of the classified version of the Strategic Police Plan for the period 2018 – 2021 6 StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 Activity Output indi- cator Source of verifica- tion Period of imple- menta- tion Needed resources Source of financing Implement- er of activ- ity 1.1 Implementing the Activity Plan from the National Seri- ous and Or- ganised Crime Threat Assess- ment (SOCTA) In the pe- riod 2016 - 2017, 40% of measures from SOCTA document are implemented. In the period 2018 - 2019, 60% of ac- tivities from SOCTA docu- ment are im- plemented.

In the first half of the year 2018, the Mid-Term Review of the Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assess- ment will be prepared to show changes and highlight new trends emerging after the first Assessment and to propose a possible revision of the existing priorities and the introduction of new ones. StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 7 2. COMBATING THE PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS WITH FOCUS ON CANNABIS AND SYN- THETIC DRUGS It is one of the most dominant and profitable forms of crime in Serbia.2 Serbia is a transit country for the trafficking of drugs, but also for the production of cannabis and certain types of synthetic drugs. Cannabis is becoming more and more available due to its increased production in natural and artificial environments and the fact that Serbia is on the Central Balkan route for the traffick- ing of cannabis. Due to a high demand in the market and high profits, it is expected that there will be an increase in the number of criminal groups and individuals involved in the production and trafficking of cannabis and therefore relevant for security activities. Considering the trend of intensive emergence of new psychoactive controlled substances in the countries of the European Union, an increased emergence of new synthetic drugs in the Republic of Serbia is expected.

FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION The aim of the fight against corruption3 is to implement the measures and activities for the prevention and combating of all forms of corruption, increase the number of detected crimes with the element of corruption, especially in the areas identified as strategic priorities - political activities, public finances, privatisation and public-private partnership, judiciary, police, spatial planning and construction, health care, education and sports and the media, reducing the impact of risk factors and the threats of terrorism and extremism and their manifestations while respecting democratic values, the rule of law and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms. In the Republic of Serbia, there is a developed awareness and political will to eliminate corruption as much as possible, which would contribute to a greater level of public confidence in public authorities and institutions.

FIGHTING AGAINST THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY The trend of rapid development of information and communication technology4 leads to a higher number of criminal offences involv- ing the misuse of ICT and which are related to the security of computer data, sexual abuse of minors and children for pornographic purposes on the internet, unauthorised use of copyright and other related rights, security threats, terrorism and violent extremism leading to terrorism and frauds. Criminals will continue to use the possibility of making it more difficult for the public authorities to detect crimes by using the internet services where they think they can hide easier their identity from the police. Outcome indicators Baseline 2018 2019 2020 2021 Increased detection of cyber- crimes In 2016, a total of 703 cybercrimes were detected in the terri- tory of the Republic of Serbia. 1% increase - de- tected a total of 710 cybercrimes 2% increase - de- tected a total of 724 cybercrimes 2% increase - de- tected a total of 738 cybercrimes 2% increase - detected a total of 752 cybercrimes Period of implemen- tation Needed resources Source of financing Implementer of activ- ity 2018 - 2021 Budget of the Republic of Serbia - re- assignment of employees, RSD 5,500,000 (EUR 45,750) – contri- bution Required equipment and training - to be determined Regular budget; Budget of the Republic of Serbia, UNICEF funds General Police Direc- torate 4 Summary of the classified version of the Strategic Police Plan for the period 2018 – 2021 10 StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 5. COMBATING TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM LEADING TO TERRORISM The goal of combating terrorism and violent extremism5 leading to terrorism is to reduce the impact of risk factors and the threats of terrorism and extremism and their manifestations. It will be implemented through a broad scope of measures, beginning with the fulfilment of strategic assumptions based on the Strategy for Preventing and Combating Terrorism for the period 2017-2021 together with the Action Plan. In the upcoming period, an internal Action Plan for the Preventing and Combating Terrorism will be drafted. It has been planned to improve the capacity of human resources and operational capacity (by employing new staff and delivering specialist training), and the material and technical capacity (in line with the proposal for enhancing the existing material and tech- nical capacity of the Service for Combating Terrorism and Extremism). As regards the improvement of operational procedures, the Single National Methodology for Post-Terrorist Attack Response is being drafted. Recognising the importance of early detection and prevention of radicalisation, participation in the projects of awareness raising and involvement of the local community and other institutions in these activities have been planned. Finally, one of the priorities is cooperation enhancement through participation in national, regional and international counter-terrorism initiatives.

IMPROVING THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC PEACE AND ORDER BY COMBATING VIOLENCE WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON VIOLENCE AT SPORTS EVENTS, IN SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC PLACES Maintaining a stability of public peace and order6 is based on the efficient functioning of the police, through everyday work, balanced spatial and temporal engagement in public places, protection of citizens and property, while respecting the security priorities and the needs of citizens and local communities. Security risks that could endanger a stability of public peace and order refer to the emergence and presence of physical and other forms of violence in public places, public gatherings, sports events and school areas. In this regard, we will intensify the activities aimed at preventing violence in public places, in particular at preventing the offences committed by persons under the influence of psychoactive substances and alcohol, and the activities of protecting pupils and school areas. Policing priority will be based on the development of community policing concept and the aspiration to engage other relevant partners and stakeholders in the implementation of security-related prevention; supporting broader social activities for the promotion of human and minority rights and strengthening tolerance; support in the process of police planning and decision-making primarily through the police intelligence model, as well as the full implementation of the Law on Private Security, so that in the coming period the private security sector could become a partner to the police in maintaining the security of citizens and property and maintain- ing a stability of public peace and order. Bearing all this in mind, we will insist on continuous training of police officers along with the constant improvement of material and technical equipment to strengthen the police capacity for efficient maintenance of public peace and order, while seeking to prevent and control the security risks and threats that may disturb public public peace and order to a smaller or larger extent, in cooperation with other social actors, citizens and community.

IMPROVING THE SITUATION OF TRAFFIC SAFETY ON STATE ROADS, INCLUDING THE SECTIONS OF STATE ROADS PASSING THROUGH SETTLEMENTS The consequences of endangering the safety of road traffic7 are significant human and material losses. We have a twofold impact in this field. On the one hand, the increased number of traffic participants on state roads, which can be expected in the future, increases the probability of traffic accidents, while on the other hand, the technological progress, modern road infrastructure and development of adequate legal framework (primarily through the transposition of EU regulations and acceptance of good practice) can have a fa- vourable impact on the situation of traffic safety on state roads. The improvement of the traffic safety situation will be influenced by the strengthening of human and material capacities and the introduction of new ways of traffic police work. It is difficult to achieve success using traditional methods of organisation, management and planning. A new approach based on strategic thinking is needed to increase the impact, reduce the risk, improve the use of resources and promote an active attitude towards the protection and improve- ment of organised traffic and towards reducing the rate of traffic accidents and other harmful consequences. The aim is to mitigate the consequences (reducing the number of deaths and serious bodily injuries) caused by non-compliance with traffic regulations, as well as to provide an effective and efficient protection of traffic safety, thus contributing to the overall system of security. Outcome indicators Baseline 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Reduced number of persons killed in traffic accidents on state roads in the Republic of Serbia Share of persons killed on state roads in the total number of persons killed in traffic accidents Up to 1.8% Up to 4.3% Up to 6.9% Up to 9.5% Up to 12.1% Reduced number of persons seriously injured in traffic accidents on state roads in the Republic of Serbia Share of persons seriously injured in traffic accidents on state roads in the total number of persons seriously injured in traffic ac- cidents Up to 1.4% Up to 2.8% Up to 4.1% Up to 5.5% Up to 6.9% 7 Summary of the classified version of the Strategic Police Plan for the period 2018 – 2021 14 StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 Period of implemen- tation Needed resources Source of financing Implementer of activity 2018 - 2021 Budget of the Republic of Serbia - capital project 3 PMV - interceptors = RSD 18,000,000, 5 devices for intercep- tors for determining violations = RSD 9,000,000 - RSD 18,000,000 20 motorcycles RSD 48,000,000 to RSD 60,000,000; Data storage server - interceptors = RSD 1,800,000 Regular budget, Budget of the Republic of Serbia - capi- tal project 2017–2019 - Modernisation of the fleet of the Ministry of Interior - project funds for 2018 - RSD 850,000,000 and 2019 - RSD 850,000,000 General Police Directorate StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN 2018 – 2021 15 8. IRREGULAR MIGRATION AND SMUGGLING OF PEOPLE These issues have been defined as priorities because they may have an extremely high impact on the national security.7 The number of irregular migrants has increased dramatically since 2015 and a large number of migrants, whose identity cannot be established, transit and/or stay in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The fact that they come from the countries where the activities of radical, religious and terrorist groups are pronounced adds to the security risk. The migration wave from Africa and Asia in 2015 and 2016 has led to a high demand for the services of people smugglers. Criminal groups and individuals quickly adjusted to the „market“ and redirected their activities to smuggling people in order to earn as much profits as possible. According to Europol, more than 90% of migrants who came to Europe had used people smuggling services. The intensity of further migratory pressure will depend on the orientation of public policies of the EU member states, but also of some other states and international organisations. Bearing all this in mind, we will insist on continuous training of police officers along with the continuous improvement of material and technical equipment and the adoption of legal regulations to strengthen the police capacity for the efficient suppression of irregular migration and smuggling of people, while seeking to prevent and control the accompanying security risks and threats in cooperation with other social actors, citizens and community.

The Strategic Police Plan shall include a set of activities that, in accordance with the principles and standards of the Police Intelli- gence Model (POM, Article 34 of the Law on Police), shall efficiently direct the work of the Police in addressing the most serious security  issues.   The policing priorities have been identified by the Strategic Assessment of Public Security. In accordance with the place and role of  the Police in society, while recognising the demands of citizens, the situation and trends of crime in the Republic of Serbia, Europe and  the world, the Strategic Assessment of Public Security defines the priorities, and the Strategic Police Plan defines the activities that the  General Police Directorate will undertake to effectively address the defined security priorities.  The aim of the General Police Directorate’s Strategic Plan is to focus the police work on the most serious problems, in cooperation  with other public authorities and social actors, to contribute to the rule of law, to provide every citizen of the Republic of Serbia with  equal protection of security, and respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Serbia.  1. Operating standards and principles  The activities envisaged by the Strategic Plan will be carried out in accordance with the Constitution, the Law on Police, other laws  and by-laws, and the provisions of the Code of Police Ethics.  In undertaking the activities, the Police will adhere to the established and achieved standards of the police profession, while taking into  account generally accepted international standards of conduct related to the respect of the rights of citizens of the Republic of Serbia.  In performing the planned activities, the Police will be guided by the principles of policing, in particular: legality, methodology, coor- dination and cooperation, persistence and thoroughness, professionalism, 3E (economy, efficiency and effectiveness) and the protection  of information sources.

Basic elements of the Plan  The Strategic Plan defines the activities, implementers of activities, period of implementation, output indicators and sources of veri- fication of achieved outputs for each of the defined priorities of policing.  The Strategic Assessment of Public Security defines the policing priorities:  Organised crime;•  Combating the production and trafficking of drugs with focus on cannabis and synthetic drugs;•  Fighting against corruption;•  Fighting against the misuse of information and communication technology;•  Combating terrorism and violent extremism leading to terrorism;•  Improving the situation of public peace and order by combating violence, with special emphasis on violence at sports events, in •  schools and public places; Improving the situation of traffic safety on state roads, including the sections of state roads passing through settlements;•  Irregular migration and smuggling of people.•   Activities are a system of interrelated actions aimed at: improving the regulatory framework and practice of policing; strengthening  the institutional and professional capacities of the police; development of operational procedures of policing; improvement of preven- tion; and the promotion of cooperation at the national, regional and international levels. The activities defined by the plan represent the  response necessary for addressing effectively the most serious security problems in the Republic of Serbia.  Implementers of activities are organisational units responsible for the implementation of planned activities defined in the Strategic  Plan.  Period of implementation is the planned time frame for performing the activities. The time frame is defined annually and quarterly  and represents the period of implementation of an activity, i.e. the time of beginning and completion.  Output indicators are the indicators of activities, data suitable for assessing the success of the implemented activities. The sources  of verification, the providers of information on the quality and quantity of output indicators for the planned activities have been defined  for each priority for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the Strategic Police Plan.   3. Mechanism of the implementation of the Strategic Plan    4  StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN  2018 – 2021  3.1. Responsibility for the implementation of the Strategic Plan  The Strategic Management Group, headed by the Police Director, is responsible for the organisation and coordination of the activities  envisaged under the Strategic Police Plan. The Strategic Management Group manages and directs the work; instructs the organisational  units at the headquarters, in the City of Belgrade Police Directorate and in the regional police directorates in performing the activities  envisaged in the Strategic Police Plan.   The Strategic Management Group coordinates and ensures the implementation of activities, measures and actions jointly with other  public authorities and international bodies as defined by the Plan and required for the efficient work on addressing the prioritised secu- rity issues.  The Strategic Management Group creates necessary conditions for maintaining the professional and institutional capacity of the Police  for undertaking measures and actions to improve the level of efficiency in taking measures and actions defined by the Plan.  3.2. Monitoring the implementation of the Strategic Plan  The Strategic Management Group monitors the implementation of the activities included in the Strategic Plan at the meetings or- ganised on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary.  The implementation of the Strategic Plan is monitored by the main coordinators in the organisational unit of the General Police Di- rectorate and the coordinators in the regional police directorates by using a developed instrument (form) for monthly reporting on the  implementation of strategic and operational plans of the organisational units of the General Police Directorate.   In case that the Strategic Management Group identifies problems in the implementation of the planned activities, it will request a  report from the relevant organisational unit responsible for the implementation of particular activity to be considered at a specially or- ganised meeting with the aim of defining the ways for eliminating the identified problems and implement the planned activities.    StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN  2018 – 2021  5  II PLAN OF ACTIVITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  The strategic policing priorities for the period 2017–2021 have been defined on the basis of applicable legal regulations, strategic  documents of the Ministry and other ministries defining the Ministry as implementer of certain activities, expert and scientific sources  and on the basis of the priorities defined in the Activity Programme of the Government of the Republic of Serbia, while taking fully into  consideration the European Union’s strategic documents (Europol’s annual EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report – TE-SAT, Serious  and Organised Crime Threat Assessment – SOCTA, Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment – IOCTA), including the priorities from  the European Security Agenda 2015–2020. The strategic priorities are of equal importance to the General Police Directorate and to the  Ministry of Interior, and they are given equal attention.  1. ORGANISED CRIME  Organised crime1 is one of the major security threats and therefore it is necessary to take a strategic approach to combat it more ef- ficiently. In that context, the first national Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) is a document that shows the scope,  situation, characteristics, the level of perpetrators’ organisation, the functioning of organised and criminal groups, and identifies key  security threats in this area in the Republic of Serbia. The assessment findings and the given recommendations constitute an objective  basis for the selection of priorities and the adoption of strategic and operational decisions with the aim of efficient organisation of work  on countering the serious and organised crime.  The Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) defines the following priorities:   drugs;•  people smuggling and irregular migration;•  trafficking in human beings;•  robberies;•  motor vehicles;•  weapons;•  economic crime (smuggling and illicit trade in excisable goods and currency counterfeiting);•  money laundering;•  cybercrime. •   1  Summary of the classified version of the Strategic Police Plan for the period 2018 – 2021     6  StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN  2018 – 2021  Activity Output indi-  cator  Source of  verifica-  tion  Period  of imple- menta-  tion  Needed resources Source of financing Implement- er of activ-  ity  1.1  Implementing  the Activity   Plan from the  National Seri-  ous and Or- ganised Crime  Threat Assess- ment (SOCTA)  In the pe- riod 2016   - 2017, 40%  of measures  from SOCTA   document are  implemented.

In the first half of the year 2018, the Mid-Term Review of the Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assess- ment will be prepared to show changes and highlight new trends emerging after the first Assessment and to propose a possible revision  of the existing priorities and the introduction of new ones.     StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN  2018 – 2021  7  2. COMBATING THE PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS WITH FOCUS ON CANNABIS AND SYN- THETIC DRUGS  It is one of the most dominant and profitable forms of crime in Serbia.2 Serbia is a transit country for the trafficking of drugs, but  also for the production of cannabis and certain types of synthetic drugs. Cannabis is becoming more and more available due to its  increased production in natural and artificial environments and the fact that Serbia is on the Central Balkan route for the traffick- ing of cannabis. Due to a high demand in the market and high profits, it is expected that there will be an increase in the number of  criminal groups and individuals involved in the production and trafficking of cannabis and therefore relevant for security activities.  Considering the trend of intensive emergence of new psychoactive controlled substances in the countries of the European Union, an  increased emergence of new synthetic drugs in the Republic of Serbia is expected.

FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION  The aim of the fight against corruption3 is to implement the measures and activities for the prevention and combating of all forms  of corruption, increase the number of detected crimes with the element of corruption, especially in the areas identified as strategic  priorities - political activities, public finances, privatisation and public-private partnership, judiciary, police, spatial planning and  construction, health care, education and sports and the media, reducing the impact of risk factors and the threats of terrorism and  extremism and their manifestations while respecting democratic values, the rule of law and protection of fundamental human rights  and freedoms. In the Republic of Serbia, there is a developed awareness and political will to eliminate corruption as much as possible,  which would contribute to a greater level of public confidence in public authorities and institutions.

FIGHTING AGAINST THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY  The trend of rapid development of information and communication technology4 leads to a higher number of criminal offences involv- ing the misuse of ICT and which are related to the security of computer data, sexual abuse of minors and children for pornographic  purposes on the internet, unauthorised use of copyright and other related rights, security threats, terrorism and violent extremism  leading to terrorism and frauds. Criminals will continue to use the possibility of making it more difficult for the public authorities to  detect crimes by using the internet services where they think they can hide easier their identity from the police.   Outcome indicators Baseline 2018 2019 2020 2021  Increased detection of cyber- crimes   In 2016, a total of  703 cybercrimes were  detected in the terri-  tory of the Republic of  Serbia.  1% increase - de- tected a total of   710 cybercrimes  2% increase - de- tected a total of 724   cybercrimes  2% increase - de- tected a total of 738   cybercrimes  2% increase  - detected a  total of 752  cybercrimes  Period of  implemen-  tation Needed resources Source of financing  Implementer of activ- ity  2018 - 2021  Budget of the Republic of Serbia - re- assignment of employees,  RSD 5,500,000 (EUR 45,750) – contri- bution  Required equipment and training - to  be determined  Regular budget; Budget of the Republic of Serbia, UNICEF   funds  General Police Direc- torate  4 Summary of the classified version of the Strategic Police Plan for the period 2018 – 2021    10  StRatEgIC POLICE PLaN  2018 – 2021  5. COMBATING TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM LEADING TO TERRORISM  The goal of combating terrorism and violent extremism5 leading to terrorism is to reduce the impact of risk factors and the threats  of terrorism and extremism and their manifestations. It will be implemented through a broad scope of measures, beginning with the  fulfilment of strategic assumptions based on the Strategy for Preventing and Combating Terrorism for the period 2017-2021 together  with the Action Plan. In the upcoming period, an internal Action Plan for the Preventing and Combating Terrorism will be drafted.  It has been planned to improve the capacity of human resources and operational capacity (by employing new staff and delivering  specialist training), and the material and technical capacity (in line with the proposal for enhancing the existing material and tech- nical capacity of the Service for Combating Terrorism and Extremism). As regards the improvement of operational procedures, the  Single National Methodology for Post-Terrorist Attack Response is being drafted. Recognising the importance of early detection and  prevention of radicalisation, participation in the projects of awareness raising and involvement of the local community and other  institutions in these activities have been planned. Finally, one of the priorities is cooperation enhancement through participation in  national, regional and international counter-terrorism initiatives.

IMPROVING THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC PEACE AND ORDER BY COMBATING VIOLENCE WITH SPECIAL  EMPHASIS ON VIOLENCE AT SPORTS EVENTS, IN SCHOOLS    AND PUBLIC PLACES  Maintaining a stability of public peace and order6 is based on the efficient functioning of the police, through everyday work, balanced  spatial and temporal engagement in public places, protection of citizens and property, while respecting the security priorities and the  needs of citizens and local communities. Security risks that could endanger a stability of public peace and order refer to the emergence  and presence of physical and other forms of violence in public places, public gatherings, sports events and school areas. In this regard, we will intensify the activities aimed at preventing violence in public places, in particular at preventing the offences  committed by persons under the influence of psychoactive substances and alcohol, and the activities of protecting pupils and school  areas. Policing priority will be based on the development of community policing concept and the aspiration to engage other relevant  partners and stakeholders in the implementation of security-related prevention; supporting broader social activities for the promotion  of human and minority rights and strengthening tolerance; support in the process of police planning and decision-making primarily  through the police intelligence model, as well as the full implementation of the Law on Private Security, so that in the coming period  the private security sector could become a partner to the police in maintaining the security of citizens and property and maintain- ing a stability of public peace and order. Bearing all this in mind, we will insist on continuous training of police officers along with  the constant improvement of material and technical equipment to strengthen the police capacity for efficient maintenance of public  peace and order, while seeking to prevent and control the security risks and threats that may disturb public public peace and order to  a smaller or larger extent, in cooperation with other social actors, citizens and community.

IMPROVING THE SITUATION OF TRAFFIC SAFETY ON STATE ROADS, INCLUDING THE SECTIONS OF  STATE ROADS PASSING THROUGH SETTLEMENTS  The consequences of endangering the safety of road traffic7 are significant human and material losses. We have a twofold impact in  this field. On the one hand, the increased number of traffic participants on state roads, which can be expected in the future, increases  the probability of traffic accidents, while on the other hand, the technological progress, modern road infrastructure and development  of adequate legal framework (primarily through the transposition of EU regulations and acceptance of good practice) can have a fa- vourable impact on the situation of traffic safety on state roads. The improvement of the traffic safety situation will be influenced by  the strengthening of human and material capacities and the introduction of new ways of traffic police work. It is difficult to achieve  success using traditional methods of organisation, management and planning. A new approach based on strategic thinking is needed to  increase the impact, reduce the risk, improve the use of resources and promote an active attitude towards the protection and improve- ment of organised traffic and towards reducing the rate of traffic accidents and other harmful consequences. The aim is to mitigate  the consequences (reducing the number of deaths and serious bodily injuries) caused by non-compliance with traffic regulations, as  well as to provide an effective and efficient protection of traffic safety, thus contributing to the overall system of security.

IRREGULAR MIGRATION AND SMUGGLING OF PEOPLE  These issues have been defined as priorities because they may have an extremely high impact on the national security.7 The number  of irregular migrants has increased dramatically since 2015 and a large number of migrants, whose identity cannot be established,  transit and/or stay in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The fact that they come from the countries where the activities of radical,  religious and terrorist groups are pronounced adds to the security risk. The migration wave from Africa and Asia in 2015 and 2016  has led to a high demand for the services of people smugglers. Criminal groups and individuals quickly adjusted to the „market“ and  redirected their activities to smuggling people in order to earn as much profits as possible. According to Europol, more than 90% of  migrants who came to Europe had used people smuggling services. The intensity of further migratory pressure will depend on the  orientation of public policies of the EU member states, but also of some other states and international organisations. Bearing all this  in mind, we will insist on continuous training of police officers along with the continuous improvement of material and technical  equipment and the adoption of legal regulations to strengthen the police capacity for the efficient suppression of irregular migration  and smuggling of people, while seeking to prevent and control the accompanying security risks and threats in cooperation with other  social actors, citizens and community.

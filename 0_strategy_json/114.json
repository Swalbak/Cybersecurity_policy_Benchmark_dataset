Digital transformation of Slovenia and its reference vision O verall digitalisation of our business and everyday living environment, sharp increases in big data, the so-called Internet of Things, where a growing number of devices that surround us communicate among themselves, as well as change business models, present us with huge daily challenges which cannot be understood otherwise than as a beginning of a new radical change of all business and social systems. In such an environment full of dynamic and fundamental changes in life and business, Slovenia can be presented as a success story, since it possesses some of the most important qualities essential for succeeding in the aforementioned conditions: its environment infrastructure is well organised, public services are efficient and stable, political situation focuses on development, there are a number of innovative individuals and businesses, the educational system is of high-quality, the research activity is diverse, and the non- governmental sector very active. As a right-sized country, Slovenia is in close contact with the international environment; therefore, collaboration with several international institutions has been strengthened. In recent time, Slovenia has unified its strengths into a common story, perfectly described by our slogan: “Slovenia, a green reference country in digital Europe.” This slogan underlines commitment towards the country’s identity, respect of the environment, and social and other values which guarantee a high quality of life: commitment not only towards the discovery, but mostly towards the implementation of new technologies in social systems makes Slovenia a reference country – a model for other countries. At the same time, Slovenia insists on international collaboration policy with full understanding of the completely altered digital environment which has an impact on all aspects of our lives. It has been stressed, in the basic understanding of digital transformation, that practically everything that happens in the “real world” carries some sort of a digital imprint. 4 The importance of everything that happens in a digital world is growing, as it influences our everyday lives and businesses. Understanding this presents digital transformation with utmost political importance, since we found that in the current socio-political arrangement “real systems” are being effectively handled. However, in managing the digital environment there are no comprehensive systemic solutions and Slovenia should gradually create them: • we systematically centralise the State’s key information infrastructure, which is the only way to effectively manage it; • the technology has been updated through the implementation of cloud computing, thus making solutions accessible to a practically unlimited range of users; • we are opening up public data, because we believe that data which do not impinge on the interests of an individual or a business entity should be considered as public good. This is increasingly called the “oil of the future”; • we are encouraging the reform of educational processes, so that they would be more oriented into understanding modern technologies. Functional competences bare importance, because through them, new technologies would be easily implemented and used; • we especially focus on the use of business analytics and big data which are essential in terms of understanding and smart management of complex social systems, as they can effectively prevent irrationalities, social distress, and disease. They also increase the management effectiveness of energy systems, public finances, economy, agriculture and many others. Concrete presentations of our solutions in these areas and distinct plans have been received extremely well and with great interest. Many are recognising our innovative views that include all relevant aspects of society and offer comprehensive real solutions of complex issues which all modern countries face. Based on numerous conformations, we are convinced that the activities, principles and results listed above can place Slovenia in a completely new position in the international arena and can effectively reflect the State’s characteristics with which we wish to gain a stronger position in the international community. Nevertheless, in domestic environment, these efforts are already delivering positive results in the effective integration of politics, economy, science and non-governmental sector in finding solutions for shared prosperity, inclusive growth, and increased productivity. „Slovenia, a green reference country in digital Europe“. Digital transformation of Slovenia 5 II. Strategic documents of the Republic of Slovenia on information society T he Government of the Republic of Slovenia has adopted the following strategic documents relating to the development of information society to 2020: • Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 - 2020 (SJU 2020) • Information Society Development Strategy to 2020 – DIGITAL SLOVENIA 2020 • Next-Generation Broadband Network Development Plan to 2020 • Cyber Security Strategy 6 III. Public administration development strategy 2015-2020 (SJU 2020) T he basic objectives of the Public Administration Development Strategy 2015-2020 (SJU 2020) focus on the quality and efficiency, as well as transparency and responsibility of public administration. We are aware that efficient and effective public administration is the backbone for the development of the economy and social prosperity. By achieving the objectives set by this Strategy, improvements of the business environment for the development of the economy and boost of competitiveness are already visible. Consequently, Slovenia’s international rankings are improving as well. Strategy’s objectives: • rational organisation of public administration, • program-oriented budget and reinforcement of internal control mechanisms for public finances, • effective management of human resources, • professional qualification of civil servants, • transparent and efficient public procurement, • regulated physical assets of the State, • better regulations and effective administrative procedures, • reinforcement of transparency and integrity, • establishing a quality system in public administration, • reformed inspections, • digitalisation of public administration. 7 IV. Information society development strategy to 2020 A ccording to the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI 2017 – Digital Economy and Society Index), the Republic of Slovenia ranks 17th in the European Union, although it is the fastest growing digital country together with Slovakia. This presents a considerable challenge for the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, as it aims to rank significantly higher in the future. In accordance with the adopted strategies, the Government will accelerate the development activities and collaboration, and in the next period reduce the development gap to the most developed countries. At the beginning of 2016, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted a long-term strategy on the development of information society, the objectives of which are targeted at a secure digital future. The detailed objectives of the strategy are: • raising general awareness of the importance of information and communications technologies (ICT) and the Internet for the development of society; • sustainable, systematic and targeted investment in the development of a digital society; • general digitalisation according to the “Digital by Default” principle; • competitive digital entrepreneurship and digital industry for digital growth; • intensive and innovative use of ICT and the Internet in all segments of society; • high speed access to open internet for all; • inclusive digital society; • secure cyberspace; • trust and confidence in cyberspace and the protection of human rights; • Slovenia – reference environment for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies. The vision of the strategy is for Slovenia to, by accelerated progress of the digital society, take advantage of the development opportunities of ICT and the Internet, thus becoming an advanced digital society and reference environment for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies on a systemic level. 8 Digital transformation of Slovenia At the same time, high level protection of personal data and communication privacy in a digital society of ubiquitous internet would be ensured. This would create trust and confidence in digitalisation and cyberspace. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia, therefore, favours investments in the digitalisation of entrepreneurship, innovative data-driven economy, and the development and use of the Internet, smart communities, cities and homes. Within these limits, it favours research and technology development of “the Internet of things”, cloud computing, Big Data and mobile technologies. Because the Government of the Republic of Slovenia wishes to enable equal integration into the single European digital market for Slovenian stakeholders, it innovatively uses ICT and the Internet in all developmental areas. In the future, it will invest in education for the digital society. In order to digitalise the economy and society, to raise greater general awareness on the developmental importance of ICT and the Internet, to improve digital literacy, for the economically active to develop better e-skills, and to create a larger number of skilled ICT professionals, we connect all stakeholders of Slovenia’s digitalisation, not only the industry, but non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders as well. For this reason, the Slovenian Digital Coalition was established. Digital transformation of the industry or the digitalisation of production and work processes is a controlled and lengthy process that provides companies with essential competitive advantages in the future and co-shaping of the business environment of the future. State incentives will be aimed at promoting partnerships in the implementation of research, development, innovation and pilot projects as part of the smart specialisation strategies, where digital transformation is a priority. With the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of digital enterprise and digital industry for digital growth, these incentives will be aimed at new business models, introduction of e-commerce for SMEs, the establishment of an IT platform to support the forestry-wood chain, integration of digital content in free trade agreements and strengthening digital competencies in businesses. New-age collaborative platforms, driven by digital technology, are thoroughly disrupting the current economic model and redesigning the opinions of younger generations on material goods. Last November, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia formed a working group on collaborative economy which includes representatives from several ministries. The Government wishes to establish a comprehensive regulatory model which would promote and regulate the development of various forms of collaborative economy. 9 V. Next-generation broadband network development plan to 2020 I n a modern digital society, economic, as well as overall development is directly linked to the high- quality broadband infrastructure, which serves as the basis for the development and use of the Internet. By co-financing, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia will provide inhabitants of rural areas with access to modern communication infrastructure and very fast internet access. This will also create conditions for the preservation of the countryside and for continuous balanced development of this kind of infrastructure in all regions of Slovenia. In light of less developed broadband infrastructure in Slovenian countryside (according to DESI 2016), the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the “Next-Generation Broadband Network Development Plan to 2020”. The objective of the Plan is to ensure equal standing of rural, urban and suburban population in Slovenia in this area. The Plan establishes strategic guidelines for co- financing the construction of broadband infrastructure through public resources, especially in rural areas. The objective of the guidelines is, by 2020, to provide most households with broadband internet access with at least 100Mb/s. 10 VI. Cyber security strategy C yber Security Strategy sets up measures for the establishment of an integrated national system to ensure cyber security on a higher level. The Republic of Slovenia will provide an open, safe and secure cyberspace, which will serve as a basis for smooth functioning of the infrastructure relevant for the operation of state agencies and the economy, as well as the lives of all citizens. On the one hand, more rapid development of information and communication technologies in modern society is beneficial; but on the other hand, it affects the emergence of new and technologically more sophisticated cyber threats. There is a growing trend in using ICT for political, economic and military predominance. Cyber- attacks are also a major security threat in the contemporary world. This has helped to ensure that cyber security, some time ago, became an important integral part of the countries’ national security. By 2020 Slovenia will have set up an effective system for ensuring cyber security in preventing and addressing the consequences of security incidents. To achieve this objective a set of measures will have been taken in the following areas: • reinforcement and organisation of the regulatory framework of the national cyber security system; • citizen security in cyberspace; • cyber security in the economy; • ensuring the functioning of critical infrastructure in the sector for information and communication support; • ensuring cyber security in the field of public security and combating cybercrime; • ensuring safe functioning and availability of key information and communication systems in the event of major natural and other disasters. An essential objective of the strategy is the regulatory framework organisation at strategic level for ensuring cyber security. Therefore, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia assigned the role of the national authority for cyber security to the Government Office for the Protection of Classified Information. The authority will, at strategic level, coordinate activities and resources for ensuring development of cyber defence capabilities and reinforcement of national cyber security through international co-operation in the Republic of Slovenia. 11 VII. Digitalisation of public administration M odernisation of public administration is one of the priorities of the Government of Slovenia. ICT will play a key role in achieving all planned strategic objectives. Therefore, the Government has developed and intensified the execution of several projects with the intention of improving efficiency of public administration and creating a favourable environment for the development of the economy. PRESTIGIOUS INTERNATIONAL AWARDS FOR SLOVENIAN ICT PROJECTS In the past six years, the Republic of Slovenia has received numerous prestigious international awards for projects in the field of information and communication services: 1) In 2016, the Ministry of Public Administration received the Cisco CMS Certificate award for successful creation and provision of services of the State Computer Cloud as a quality standard in IT. 2) in 2015, the National Cloud Computing project received an award from the American company EMC for the most innovative IT project in Central Europe, which represents the best reference solution in the region; 3) the Multipurpose Interoperability Component for Electronic Data Acquisition Project – Implementation for e -Social Security received a United Nations Public Service award for the best project in Europe and North America in promoting comprehensive solutions for public administration in the information age; 4) in 2013, the Supervizor project received a United Nations Public Service Award for the best project in Europe and North America in preventing and fighting against corruption in public administration; 5) in 2012, the IT-supported Procedure for Drafting Legislation (ITDL) project received a United Nations Public Service Award for the best project in the field for improving participation in decision-making by using use of new technologies; 6) in 2009, the Slovenia Business Point project received a United Nations Public Service Award for improving the delivery of services in the public sector. 12 A. REORGANISATION OF IT IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION I n 2016 we successfully established and ensured the operation of a variety of new organisational, financial, personnel and technological solutions or processes at all levels of ICT. We have established: • a unified approach to management of ICT systems in public administration though staff and ICT infrastructure consolidation for 2016 and operation of the Council for the Development of IT in Public Administration and increased the level of trust (security); • new manner of joint planning of financial resources, which contributed to the optimisation of financial resources planning processes and consequently lowering of public procurement costs and equipment standardisation; • new way of carrying out joint public procurements, which resulted in the increase of positive effects of economies scale, equipment homogeneity, better control and more efficient use of hardware and software; • new manner of implementing the management support system with the Single Contact Centre which quickly and efficiently monitors business processes. The communication with users improved, the time of solving problems shortened. At the same time the system effectively supervises the implementation of user needs. VIII. Reference in specific projects 13 Digital transformation of Slovenia B. »ONCE-ONLY« PRINCIPLE SINGLE BUSINESS POINT, e-VEM, SLOVENIA BUSINESS POINT S lovenia has recognised the importance and benefits of the “Once-Only” principle, whereby the citizens, organisations and businesses provide their information only once. The Single Business Point project provides business entities with all the necessary information through the e-VEM Portal in a simple and transparent manner. In the context of this concept, the existing e-VEM Portal already efficiently functions as a business portal where companies and entrepreneurs can carry out electronic services when establishing a company, as well as several those most common and mandatory by law, which the business entity can carry out upon or after establishing a company. The process is swift, simple and free of charge. The circle of users is expanding, as in addition to business entities, some e-VEM services (applying for compulsory social insurance, registration of insurance against accidents at work and occupational diseases and registration of job vacancy) are being used by public administration institutions. The portal is designed as a user-friendly website, which - with over 140 physical VEM points across Slovenia - presents one of the best practices in business support. The e-VEM portal has 40.000 registered users and in 2016 over 862.000 applications were submitted using the portal. The Slovenia Business Point was established at the end of 2016. The portal is mainly intended for foreign entrepreneurs from the EU, which along with information on business-making, also provides cross- border electronic procedures. STOP THE BUREAUCRACY A single set of measures for providing an improved legislative and business environment on the STOP the Bureaucracy Portal offers users an overview of all measures and control for realising measures for a better business environment, and a review of the savings in municipalities in Slovenia. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is continuously verifying the progress of the implementation of measures, and keeps the data in the Single Database up to date. MOPED (Modular Framework for the Preparation of Electronic Documents) and SME Test W ith the aim of improving the process for adopting regulations and assessment of the implications of this regulation in different areas in the developmental stage, the application MOPED (Modular Framework for the Preparation of Electronic Documents) is already being prepared and will be in production in spring 2018. Under this application, all documents in the legislative procedure will be prepared, as its use will be mandatory for all departments/ministries. 14 Digital transformation of Slovenia STATE PORTAL eUPRAVA T he State portal eUprava offers Slovenian citizens, per the life events concept, 250 most frequently used electronic services, which are connected to more than 30 databases. 321 content is available in Slovenian language, 170 in Italian and Hungarian. There are 110 e-Applications and 368 forms (Word and PDF). Along with electronic submission of applications, the portal provides its users insight into the statues of the submitted application and their personal information stored in national data records. The portal is adapted to people with special needs and those who prefer mobile technology. Statistical data: 30.000 registered users, 30.300 applications submitted applications, 25.000 posts on the bulletin board, 15.000 publications of events C. »DIGITAL BY DEFAULT« PRINCIPLE ePUBLIC PROCUREMENT I t is one of the key projects of the “Digital by Default” principle. It enables greater transparency of public procurement procedures, and provides possibility for re-use and analysis of basic data. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is planning a full transmission to ePublic Procurement for all users in January 2018, which will result in EUR 20 million savings per year. The results of joint procurements are encouraging, especially in the health sector. For 2017, 10 such joint procurements are planned. With joint public procurements, the needs of the contractors are done via the e-Catalogue which facilitates and shortens the time needed for the preparation of a specific procurement. In February 2016, eAuctions and eReverse Auctions became obligatory for all state authorities. Because of these two services, significant cost efficiency has already been achieved (7% savings). The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is encouraging municipalities to use these two tools. The eCatalogue tool allows transparent procurement of goods and services under prior contract. By 2018, the catalogue is planned to be used for 10.000 different products/items. Among other things, through the Application SME Test the impact of regulations on the economy is being assessed (SME Test – Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Test) for each act being adopted by the ordinary or summary proceedings, except those adopted by urgent procedure. In the future, this application will be upgraded with RIA in other areas – citizens, environment… For the preparation of assessment of regulations on the economy – SME Test – more than 200 civil servants have been trained. 15 Digital transformation of Slovenia eHEALTH, ePRESCRIPTION, eREFERRAL, zVEM W ith the eHealth project, modern IT solutions are being introduced in the Slovenian healthcare system and the local information systems are being interconnected in a functional healthcare information system. As part of the e-Health project, the ePrescription has been active for 2 years. This year the zVEM portal for patients and the eReferral were launched. The ePrescription solution enables electronic business-making for patients, which in certain cases allows for prescribing medication at a distance. In dispensing and prescribing medication, doctors and pharmacists can use a tool which verifies interactions and contradictions of medications taken by a patient. Within the ePrescription, the doctor prepares an electronic prescription and signs it with his or her own digital certificate. Information of the prescription is stored in the ePrescription Central Repository which can be accessed by pharmacists during the visit of a patient. All communication takes place in a safe and secure manner. The ePrescription system allows the possibility of consultation between the pharmacist and doctor. In 2017, more than 85% medications were prescribed electronically. By introducing the eReferral, patients are able to electronically take an appointment with a healthcare provider. The process is also faster for those patients who do not wish to make an appointment electronically. For all first examinations and the majority of diagnostic tests, a new manner of making electronic appointments for patients is available through the zVEM portal. On this publicly available site, any user can review information on expected waiting times at different providers and their contact information and makes an appointment accordingly in three basic steps. In April 2017, in more than 75% cases the document was used in electronic form. The zVEM Portal provides patients with an overview of all prescribed and dispensed medications with the ePrescription, review of issued referrals and agreed appointments for health care services, the possibility of termination of an appointment for healthcare services, and at the same time also an overview of patient documents in the Central Repository of Patient Data, including a user’s own summary (almost 50% of the population of the Republic of Slovenia has in the Repository at least on clinical paper, and about 6% has a summary). Via the portal, the patient can submit an application to receive electronic notifications (reminders) prior to the expiry of his or her prescription and the approaching appointment with a specialist or hospital. ePENSION T he Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia provides the ePension (eZPIZ and BiZPIZ) portal for citizens and businesses. More than 35.000 users are registered with a qualified digital certificate, meaning they can digitally sign and submit claims and other digital documents, request electronic delivery of the digital documents, and access their personal insurance and payments information. e Invoicing has become obligatory since January 2015 and should be used when dealing with public authorities. This service fully ensures electronic procedures for received invoices. eINVOICING 16 Digital transformation of Slovenia eRECRUITMENT e Services ZRSZ (ESS – Employment Service of Slovenia) – Portal for employers is intended for employers who cooperate with the ESS. The employer can carry out some services electronically and saves him or herself a trip to the Employment Service. eServices ZRSZ (ESS – Employment Service of Slovenia) – portal PoiščiDelo.si is intended for all job seekers. Users receive notifications on current job vacancies, review job vacancies, present themselves to potential employers and communicate with them, create CVs, register in the Institute’s records, submit an application for compensation, order certificates from the Institute’s records, make an agreement with the Institute to collaborate via the portal. The e-Counselling portal is a tool for effective career planning and job search. eJUSTICE S lovenian e-Justice offers the following solutions: information systems for statistical monitoring of data in the operation of judicial authorities, videoconferencing system for carrying out remote hearings, digitalisation of international contracts, e- Notary, e-Endorsements, e-Liabilities, and e- Dispatch. eAGRICULTURE e RKG is an online application which allows the heads of agricultural holdings to inspect their data from the registry of agricultural holdings. The data is managed by Administrative Units and they include databases in the field of agriculture: register of agricultural holdings, register of graphic units of the use of land by the agricultural holding, register of common pastures, register of hops growers, olive growers, records of fruit growers in intense plantations, records of fruit growers in meadow orchards, and records of grape and wine growers. eTAXES T he eTaxes portal allows filling out filling out and submitting tax forms from the user’s computer at home or in the office. Physical entities can submit tax returns, and legal entities can submit forms for VAT and VIES. Users can also electronically register taxpayers from e-commerce and exchange their information with the tax authorities of other EU Member States and verify tax identification numbers of tax payers from other EU countries. 17 Digital transformation of Slovenia eCUSTOMS T he aim of eCustoms is to increase the efficiency of customs control to ensure the seamless flow of data. The Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia offers on the eCustoms portal the possibility for users to directly use certain applications free of charge: e-Export (the possibility of submitting export customs declaration, inspection of filled declarations, printing SIL, receiving conformation of exit of goods), TARIC3 (nomenclature, import/export, meursing, regulations, anti-damping/countervailing duty, calculation-control module, trends of tariff quotas SKP), ETROD (applying excise person, submitting electronic excise returns, review of field accounts), EMCS (submission of electronic excise documents, conformation of electronic excise documents), e- Enforcement (sending proposals for enforcement), access into hedging instruments. eMUNICIPALITY eMunicipality is the inter-municipal portal for modern business-making with the municipality, e- commerce with the municipality, such as submitting electronic applications, online payment of fees, decisions. D. SINGLE DIGITAL GATEWAY GOV.SI The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is developing a single digital gateway and a digital portal GOV.SI for citizens, foreigners, non- governmental organisations, business entities and public administrations. Gradually, more than 270 already existing sites and portals of public authorities will be included in the portal. The structure of the content will be based on life events of the user, or areas identical to the user’s needs. Single standards and criteria for performance on national webpages will be created. These will assess the meaningfulness of establishing each new public administration website as a separate entity. SINGLE CONTACT CENTRE The Single Contact Centre (EKC) of public administration is a service intended for all citizens and public administration employees. It is a direct two-way communication between users/cusomers and the State via the telephone and electronically (email, online forms). Through EKC, the public administration receives and solves problems of users, provides quality information on the organisation and operation of public authorities on administrative and other services, and offer technical support in using public administration electronic services. EKC also accepts their remarks and suggestions for improving operation to which it provides feedback. 18 Digital transformation of Slovenia The National Open Data Portal (OPSI) presents a single online point for publication of public sector data. The portal provides everyone/its users with the right to freely and easily reuse data published as “open data”, i.e. in machine-readable form and under an open license, which allows the creation of new analyses, applications, visualisations, and the like. In addition, OPSI also contains the catalogue of all records and databases of public authorities. According to the latest EU Report on open data maturity 2017, Slovenia ranks 7th and is among leaders—trendsetters that have implemented an advanced open data policy with extensive portal features and national coordination mechanism across domains. Statistical data: 353 published descriptions of databases, 36 public sector institutions is publishing data, from the establishment of the portal in December 2016 by the end of February 2017, there were 4.902 visits, 2.022 downloads and 1.667 unique downloads. E. TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN DATA PORTAL OPSI ERAR, STATIST The Erar online service provides public insight into transactions of public institutions, state-owned enterprises and municipalities. It also contains data on legal persons governed by private law, which facilitates transparency of the State and limits corruption risks. Statist – the new web-based application – is available to the general public; it provides an integrated and updated publication of contracts (procurement) since 2013. By accessing Statist (contracts) and Erar (realised contracts) the user gains comprehensive and transparent insight into the field of public procurement. PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY PORTAL The Public Sector Salary Portal provides the general public with insight and data analysis on masses of individual types and resources the budgetary users account for the salaries of public sector employees The portal draws information from the single system on public sector wages – ISPAP. eSPACE PORTAL This application enables free access to graphical and descriptive information on users’ properties that are kept in geodetic records. With the last update, the data on the cadastral income was added, the graphical presentation was refurbished and the generalized market values of real estates were published in the application Public Access. The application module for issuing statutory certificates from geodetic records was fully renovated in the application Access to the information on real estate for registered users and the application Public access to the property sales register was newly created. 19 Digital transformation of Slovenia F. INTEROPERABILITY NIO PORTAL T he National Interoperability Framework Portal – NIO is a website intended for the exchange of interoperable solutions and public sector assets. The purpose of the portal is to publish information on experiences and good practices and recommend the use of modern, user-friendly and interoperable public services, improve the systems’ and organisations’ interoperability and contribute to the efficiency and transparency of the public sector. The portal is used by all public sector institutions as well as business subjects, physical entities and other interested parties. CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS T he Ministry of Public Administration of the Republic of Slovenia provides common building blocks for the use in application solutions. One part refers to the trust services, and the other to electronic acquisition of data. 1. CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR TRUST SERVICES T he Central system for authentication of users SI -CAS verifies electronic identification in one place. The two larger systems already using this portal are the State portal eUprava and e-VEM portal. In the coming years, most public sector e- services will transition to this system, as it is important to clearly verify users’ identity. Other building blocks for provision of trust services are also being developed. The most important of which is the system for central server eSignature and the central system for eDelivery. 2. MULTIPURPOSE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ELECTRONIC DATA GATHERING M ultipurpose building blocks for electronic data gathering (Tray, IO-Module, Asynchronous Module, and Security Platform) and the SOVD building block for the exchange of big files are two examples of good practice. These building blocks were primarily developed for the needs of e-Social Security; however, they are being used as common building blocks in other information systems which require their functions. Building blocks are very stable, reliable and highly automated. In practice, for the use of e-Social Security, 10.000-30.000 financial situations from more than 50 sources in public administration and beyond (e.g. banks) are being acquired daily. Recently, the European Commission pointed out these building blocks as one of the ten good practices of the new generation of Open Government Services. 20 Digital transformation of Slovenia Today, numerous public institutions are already acquiring data with the help of building blocks (e.g. Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, State Prosecutor's Office, State Attorney's Office, Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food etc.). G. SLOVENIAN STATE CLOUD T he Slovenian State Cloud (DRO) establishes a computerised infrastructure for direct budget users and provides them with storage, development, business and other forms of services. This infrastructure provides services which deal with sensitive, personal and other data and information which the State does not wish to store outside its controlled environment. By 2020, two more services will be developed: the hybrid cloud and the innovative-development cloud. The Hybrid Cloud (HRO) will offer solutions to the public sector. A commercial provider will ensure this cloud; however, the data will not leave the country. As a rule, the users will have to pay to use the service (indirect budget users, municipalities, public institutes, agencies). Services or software used by public institutions can be put into use in the broader public sector. The Innovative-Development Cloud (IRO) will serve as a development platform for educational establishments and start-ups. IRO will be accessible to the recipients of state subsidies and aids (RRI), as well as small and medium sized start-ups which will have to keep records of their results (products) all in one place. Developers will be motivated and trained under the concept of “universal solutions”, which will be of use in the region and the EU. The model will be offered to the EU and in the region (roaming, platform). H. BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND BIG DATA T he use of business analytics, especially big data presents a new, simpler method of operation and data-driven decision-making at all levels – not only operational and tactical, but strategic as well. The DRO presents a platform for systemic and application solutions, where we, in 2016, successfully carried out the first pilot project for the e s t a b l i s h m e nt o f b u s i n es s an a l y t i c s “Chest” (Skrinja). Based on the results of the pilot project, we are preparing a project of establishing business analytics and data warehouses in public administration which will be available as a horizontal service to public administration authorities (mainly for joint applications). In addition to the DRO infrastructure which represents one of the prerequisite conditionality for the establishment of the Big Data processing platform, we are developing concepts of the so- called data map, data repository and data dictionary. With these concepts, we simplify the introduction of the business intelligence concept and Big Data processing concept in an innovative way. The concepts will be adapted for use in a wide range of sectorial areas. 21 Digital transformation of Slovenia »JOZEF STEFAN« INSTITUTE T he Institute carries out world-class research and development of technologies, such as nanotechnology, new materials, biotechnology, technology and production management, communication technology, computer technology and technology skills, environmental technology and reactor technology. A key project of the Institute is the Event registry portal where all world events (news), in both traditional and social media, are monitored in one place. Based on the received information, the portal establishes trends, predictions, what is happening in the world…. They are also active in the field of artificial intelligence – they collaborate with IMB – Watson. I. CONNECTED AUTOMATED DRIVING Slovenia supports connected automated driving (CAD) and has started with preparatory activities relating to cooperative systems. C-Roads Slovenia is a pilot project of introducing cooperative systems to transfer information in real time which is based on vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and infrastructure-to vehicle. These systems can significantly improve the efficiency of the transport system, the safety of all road users and comfort of mobility. In early October 2016 the C-Roads platform became operational. The platform integrates state institutions and road operators from 11 EU Member States. The platform coordinates activities for the implementation of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) in Europe. J. HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING H igh-performance computing is one of the strategic objectives of the Slovenian Digital Strategy 2020. Slovenia is continuing development of the national supercomputing cluster for research institutions – the Slovenian Initiative for the National Grid (SLONG) is being coordinated by Arnes. HPC can present an important competitive advantage in research and industrial areas for Slovenia. The knowledge in the field of HPC in Slovenia is united in a few knowledge centres (especially Arnes, Institute Jozef Stefan, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering). For the purposes of introducing data analytics, business intelligence, and Big Data tools, the Administration Academy has prepared a comprehensive training programme, which also encompasses a motivational seminar and more modularly flexible courses and workshops. 22 Digital transformation of Slovenia L. 5G MOBILE NETWORK T he Republic of Slovenia adopted an ambitious strategic plan for the development of its broadband infrastructure by 2020 (100 Mb/s for all) and is committed to its realization. Slovenia wishes to establish a pilot project 5G for the entire country. For faster development and implementation of 5G mobile networks, Slovenia proposes the creation of cross-border pilot projects which will accelerate the utilization of the development potential of this technology to meet the needs of advanced innovative solutions in different application areas. We need to create good conditions which will encourage companies producing equipment and mobile operators to invest in new generation mobile technologies and networks. In December 2017, the Memorandum of Understanding on cross—border cooperation in the development and testing of the 5G public protection and disaster relief pilot project was signed between the Republic of Slovenia and Hungary. T he adaptation to the requirements of the new reality of a digital society demand adequate ICT skills. That is why Slovenia encourages and pursues the objective of enhancing e-skills and knowledge in order to empower its citizens, so they can fully integrate in the digital environment and be innovative and creative in the use of ICT, and will participate in the process of changing and creating new knowledge, ideas, solutions and ways to use technology. The establishment of an inclusive digital society will facilitate and expedite the adjustment to the digitization of existing jobs and contribute to the development of new business models, work processes and jobs and thereby accelerate the integration of the so-called fourth industrial revolution. In September 2017, the UNESCO 2nd World Congress of Open Education Resources was held. K. DIGITAL SKILLS M. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY B lockchain or technology of data blocking is groundbreaking in many respects, in addition to exceptional aspects of high security and transparency, it provides services which are performed in just a few minutes which would in the past take a year or more. Until recently, this technology was used primarily in the financial sector or in the field of crypto-currencies. 23 Slovenian companies have achieved exceptional and disproportionate success in this field – for example, one of the largest online crypto-currency exchanges was set up by Slovenes. In recent years, successful Slovenian companies in the use of blockchain technology are already among the leading developers of digital investment platforms in the world. Last year, we achieved great success of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) platform which was developed by Slovenes. This platform enables young, potential internet start-ups to raise their core capital. Of course, further possibilities of using the platform are much greater than of those mentioned. On its own, it is an excellent basis for Slovenia to exploit its development potential and become the leading “blockchain start-up” destination in the world. The true potential of the technology is reflected by the recent arrival and exceptional success of the Ethereum platform which allows, in addition to financial transactions, smart contracts which will bring significant savings to companies and simplify the implementation of most of mandatory processes. Given the development activities abroad, it is clear that we will experience a large disruption in this field, for which we will have to be prepared, from the point of view of both users and creators of new solutions. Slovenian start-ups are also exceptionally active in this area from projects such as platforms for marketing of electrical energy and creation of other energy services to solutions in traditional industries (e.g. in the forest-wood chain in Slovenia), which enable the stakeholders to connect in these branches. As part of the stand of the Slovenian economy in the “green, creative, and smart”, Slovenia strives to become one of the leading countries in introducing blockchain technologies. Technologies online today enable only secure transfer of value, greater efficiency of services and can serve as a basis for the services of companies and the State, thereby contributing to greater competitiveness of the economy and welfare of the entire society.

Digital transformation of Slovenia   and    its reference vision   O verall digitalisation of our business and   everyday living environment, sharp increases in   big data, the so-called Internet of Things, where a   growing number of devices that surround us   communicate among themselves, as well as   change business models, present us with huge daily   challenges which cannot be understood otherwise   than as a beginning of a new radical change of all   business and social systems.   In such an environment full of dynamic and   fundamental changes in life and business, Slovenia   can be presented as a success story, since it   possesses some of the most important qualities   essential for succeeding in the aforementioned   conditions: its environment infrastructure is well   organised, public services are efficient and stable,   political situation focuses on development, there   are a number of innovative individuals and   businesses, the educational system is of high-quality,   the research activity is diverse, and the non-  governmental sector very active. As a right-sized   country, Slovenia is in close contact with the   international environment; therefore, collaboration    with several international institutions has been   strengthened.    In recent time, Slovenia has unified its strengths into   a common story, perfectly described by our slogan:   “Slovenia, a green reference country in digital   Europe.” This slogan underlines commitment   towards the country’s identity, respect of the   environment, and social and other values which   guarantee a high quality of life: commitment not   only towards the discovery, but mostly towards the   implementation of new technologies in social   systems makes Slovenia a reference country – a   model for other countries. At the same time,   Slovenia insists on international collaboration policy   with full understanding of the completely altered   digital environment which has an impact on all   aspects of our lives.    It has been stressed, in the basic understanding of   digital transformation, that practically everything   that happens in the “real world” carries some sort of   a digital imprint.      4   The importance of everything that happens in a   digital world is growing, as it influences our   everyday lives and businesses. Understanding this   presents digital transformation with utmost political   importance, since we found that in the current   socio-political arrangement “real systems” are   being effectively handled. However, in managing   the digital environment there are no   comprehensive systemic solutions and Slovenia   should gradually create them:   • we systematically centralise the State’s key   information infrastructure, which is the only way   to effectively manage it;    • the technology has been updated through the   implementation of cloud computing, thus   making solutions accessible to a practically   unlimited range of users;   • we are opening up public data, because we   believe that data which do not impinge on the   interests of an individual or a business entity   should be considered as public good. This is   increasingly called the “oil of the future”;   • we are encouraging the reform of educational   processes, so that they would be more oriented   into understanding modern technologies.   Functional competences bare importance,   because through them, new technologies   would be easily implemented and used;   • we especially focus on the use of business   analytics and big data which are essential in   terms of understanding and smart   management of complex social systems, as   they can effectively prevent irrationalities,   social distress, and disease. They also increase   the management effectiveness of energy   systems, public finances, economy, agriculture   and many others.   Concrete presentations of our solutions in these   areas and distinct plans have been received   extremely well and with great interest. Many are   recognising our innovative views that include all   relevant aspects of society and offer   comprehensive real solutions of complex issues   which all modern countries face.   Based on numerous conformations, we are   convinced that the activities, principles and results   listed above can place Slovenia in a completely   new position in the international arena and can   effectively reflect the State’s characteristics with   which we wish to gain a stronger position in the   international community. Nevertheless, in domestic   environment, these efforts are already delivering   positive results in the effective integration of   politics, economy, science and non-governmental   sector in finding solutions for shared prosperity,   inclusive growth, and increased productivity.   „Slovenia,    a green reference country    in digital Europe“.    Digital transformation of Slovenia     5   II. Strategic documents of    the Republic of Slovenia    on information society      T he Government of the Republic of Slovenia has   adopted the following strategic documents   relating to the development of information society to   2020:   • Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 -  2020 (SJU 2020)   • Information Society Development Strategy to 2020 –   DIGITAL SLOVENIA 2020   • Next-Generation Broadband Network Development   Plan to 2020   • Cyber Security Strategy     6   III. Public administration   development strategy    2015-2020 (SJU 2020)         T he basic objectives of the Public Administration   Development Strategy 2015-2020 (SJU 2020)   focus on the quality and efficiency, as well as   transparency and responsibility of public   administration. We are aware that efficient and   effective public administration is the backbone for   the development of the economy and social   prosperity. By achieving the objectives set by this   Strategy, improvements of the business environment   for the development of the economy and boost of   competitiveness are already visible. Consequently,   Slovenia’s international rankings are improving as   well.   Strategy’s objectives:      • rational organisation of public   administration,   • program-oriented budget and   reinforcement of internal control   mechanisms for public finances,   • effective management of human   resources,   • professional qualification of civil servants,   • transparent and efficient public   procurement,   • regulated physical assets of the State,   • better regulations and effective   administrative procedures,   • reinforcement of transparency and   integrity,   • establishing a quality system in public   administration,    • reformed inspections,   • digitalisation of public administration.      7   IV. Information society    development strategy    to 2020   A ccording to the Digital Economy and Society   Index (DESI 2017 – Digital Economy and Society   Index), the Republic of Slovenia ranks 17th in the   European Union, although it is the fastest growing   digital country together with Slovakia. This presents   a considerable challenge for the Government of   the Republic of Slovenia, as it aims to rank   significantly higher in the future. In accordance with   the adopted strategies, the Government will   accelerate the development activities and   collaboration, and in the next period reduce the   development gap to the most developed countries.   At the beginning of 2016, the Government of the   Republic of Slovenia adopted a long-term strategy   on the development of information society, the   objectives of which are targeted at a secure digital   future.    The detailed objectives of the strategy are:   • raising general awareness of the importance of   information and communications technologies   (ICT) and the Internet for the development of   society;   • sustainable, systematic and targeted investment   in the development of a digital society;   • general digitalisation according to the “Digital by   Default” principle;   • competitive digital entrepreneurship and digital   industry for digital growth;   • intensive and innovative use of ICT and the   Internet in all segments of society;   • high speed access to open internet  for  all;   • inclusive digital society;   • secure cyberspace;   • trust and confidence in cyberspace and the   protection of human rights;   • Slovenia – reference environment for the   deployment of innovative approaches in the use   of digital technologies.   The vision of the strategy is for Slovenia to, by   accelerated progress of the digital society, take   advantage of the development opportunities of ICT   and the Internet, thus becoming an advanced   digital society and reference environment for the   deployment of innovative approaches in the use of   digital technologies on a systemic level.         8   Digital transformation of Slovenia   At the same time, high level protection of personal   data and communication privacy in a digital   society of ubiquitous internet would be ensured.   This would create trust and confidence in   digitalisation and cyberspace.      The Government of the Republic of Slovenia,   therefore, favours investments in the digitalisation   of entrepreneurship, innovative data-driven   economy, and the development and use of the   Internet, smart communities, cities and homes.   Within these limits, it favours research and   technology development of “the Internet of   things”, cloud computing, Big Data and mobile   technologies. Because the Government of the   Republic of Slovenia wishes to enable equal   integration into the single European digital market   for Slovenian stakeholders, it innovatively uses ICT   and the Internet in all developmental areas. In the   future, it will invest in education for the digital   society.      In order to digitalise the economy and society, to   raise greater general awareness on the   developmental importance of ICT and the   Internet, to improve digital literacy, for the   economically active to develop better e-skills, and   to create a larger number of skilled ICT   professionals, we connect all stakeholders of   Slovenia’s digitalisation, not only the industry, but   non-governmental organisations and other   stakeholders as well. For this reason, the Slovenian   Digital Coalition was established.      Digital transformation of the industry or the   digitalisation of production and work processes is a   controlled and lengthy process that provides   companies with essential competitive advantages   in the future and co-shaping of the business   environment of the future. State incentives will be   aimed at promoting partnerships in the   implementation of research, development,   innovation and pilot projects as part of the smart   specialisation strategies, where digital   transformation is a priority. With the aim of   strengthening the competitiveness of digital   enterprise and digital industry for digital growth,   these incentives will be aimed at new business   models, introduction of e-commerce for SMEs, the   establishment of an IT platform to support the   forestry-wood chain, integration of digital content   in free trade agreements and strengthening digital   competencies in businesses.      New-age collaborative platforms, driven by digital   technology, are thoroughly disrupting the current   economic model and redesigning the opinions of   younger generations on material goods. Last   November, the Government of the Republic of   Slovenia formed a working group on collaborative   economy which includes representatives from   several ministries. The Government wishes to   establish a comprehensive regulatory model which   would promote and regulate the development of   various forms of collaborative economy.     9   V. Next-generation    broadband network    development plan    to 2020   I n a modern digital society, economic, as well as   overall development is directly linked to the high-  quality broadband infrastructure, which serves as   the basis for the development and use of the   Internet.   By co-financing, the Government of the Republic of   Slovenia will provide inhabitants of rural areas with   access to modern communication infrastructure   and very fast internet access. This will also create   conditions for the preservation of the countryside   and for continuous balanced development of this   kind of infrastructure in all regions of Slovenia.   In light of less developed broadband infrastructure   in Slovenian countryside (according to DESI 2016),   the Government of the Republic of Slovenia   adopted the “Next-Generation Broadband Network   Development Plan to 2020”. The objective of the   Plan is to ensure equal standing of rural, urban and   suburban population in Slovenia in this area.   The Plan establishes strategic guidelines for co-  financing the construction of broadband   infrastructure through public resources, especially in   rural areas. The objective of the guidelines is, by   2020, to provide most households with broadband   internet access with at least 100Mb/s.     10   VI. Cyber security    strategy   C yber Security Strategy sets up measures for the   establishment of an integrated national system   to ensure cyber security on a higher level. The   Republic of Slovenia will provide an open, safe and   secure cyberspace, which will serve as a basis for   smooth functioning of the infrastructure relevant for   the operation of state agencies and the economy,   as well as the lives of all citizens.   On the one hand, more rapid development of   information and communication technologies in   modern society is beneficial; but on the other hand,   it affects the emergence of new and   technologically more sophisticated cyber threats.   There is a growing trend in using ICT for political,   economic and military predominance. Cyber-  attacks are also a major security threat in the   contemporary world. This has helped to ensure that   cyber security, some time ago, became an   important integral part of the countries’ national   security.   By 2020 Slovenia will have set up an effective system   for ensuring cyber security in preventing and   addressing the consequences of security incidents.   To achieve this objective a set of measures will have   been taken in the following areas:   • reinforcement and organisation of the regulatory   framework of the national cyber security system;   • citizen security in cyberspace;   • cyber security in the economy;   • ensuring the functioning of critical infrastructure in   the sector for information and communication   support;    • ensuring cyber security in the field of public   security and combating cybercrime;   • ensuring safe functioning and availability of key   information and communication systems in the   event of major natural and other disasters.   An essential objective of the strategy is the   regulatory framework organisation at strategic level   for ensuring cyber security. Therefore, the   Government of the Republic of Slovenia assigned   the role of the national authority for cyber security to   the Government Office for the Protection of   Classified Information. The authority will, at strategic   level, coordinate activities and resources for   ensuring development of cyber defence capabilities   and reinforcement of national cyber security   through international co-operation in the Republic   of Slovenia.     11   VII. Digitalisation of    public    administration  M odernisation of public administration is one of   the priorities of the Government of Slovenia. ICT   will play a key role in achieving all planned strategic   objectives. Therefore, the Government has developed   and intensified the execution of several projects with   the intention of improving efficiency of public   administration and creating a favourable environment   for the development of the economy.   PRESTIGIOUS INTERNATIONAL AWARDS FOR SLOVENIAN ICT PROJECTS   In the past six years, the Republic of Slovenia has received numerous prestigious international awards for   projects in the field of information and communication services:   1) In 2016, the Ministry of Public Administration received the Cisco CMS Certificate award for successful   creation and provision of services of the State Computer Cloud as a quality standard in IT.   2) in 2015, the National Cloud Computing project received an award from the American company EMC for   the most innovative IT project in Central Europe, which represents the best reference solution in the region;   3) the Multipurpose Interoperability Component for Electronic Data Acquisition Project – Implementation for e  -Social Security received a United Nations Public Service award for the best project in Europe and North   America in promoting comprehensive solutions for public administration in the information age;    4) in 2013, the Supervizor project received a United Nations Public Service Award for the best project in   Europe and North America in preventing and fighting against corruption in public administration;   5) in 2012, the IT-supported Procedure for Drafting Legislation (ITDL) project received a United Nations Public   Service Award for the best project in the field for improving participation in decision-making by using use of   new technologies;    6) in 2009, the Slovenia Business Point project received a United Nations Public Service Award for improving   the delivery of services in the public sector.     12    A. REORGANISATION OF IT IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION   I n 2016 we successfully established and ensured   the operation of a variety of new organisational,   financial, personnel and technological solutions or   processes at all levels of ICT. We have established:   • a unified approach to management of ICT   systems in public administration though staff and   ICT infrastructure consolidation for 2016 and   operation of the Council for the Development of   IT in Public Administration and increased the   level of trust (security);   • new manner of joint planning of financial   resources, which contributed to the optimisation   of financial resources planning processes and   consequently lowering of public procurement   costs and equipment standardisation;   • new way of carrying out joint public   procurements, which resulted in the increase of   positive effects of economies scale, equipment   homogeneity, better control and more efficient   use of hardware and software;   • new manner of implementing the management   support system with the Single Contact Centre   which quickly and efficiently monitors business   processes. The communication with users   improved, the time of solving problems   shortened. At the same time the system   effectively supervises the implementation of user   needs.    VIII. Reference    in specific projects     13   Digital transformation of Slovenia   B. »ONCE-ONLY« PRINCIPLE   SINGLE BUSINESS POINT, e-VEM, SLOVENIA BUSINESS POINT   S lovenia has recognised the importance and   benefits of the “Once-Only” principle,   whereby the citizens, organisations and businesses   provide their information only once. The Single   Business Point project provides business entities with   all the necessary information through the e-VEM   Portal in a simple and transparent manner.    In the context of this concept, the existing e-VEM   Portal already efficiently functions as a business   portal where companies and entrepreneurs can   carry out electronic services when establishing a   company, as well as several those most common   and mandatory by law, which the business entity   can carry out upon or after establishing a   company. The process is swift, simple and free of   charge.    The circle of users is expanding, as in addition to   business entities, some e-VEM services (applying for   compulsory social insurance, registration of   insurance against accidents at work and   occupational diseases and registration of job   vacancy) are being used by public administration   institutions.    The portal is designed as a user-friendly website,   which - with over 140 physical VEM points across   Slovenia - presents one of the best practices in   business support. The e-VEM portal has 40.000   registered users and in 2016 over 862.000   applications were submitted using the portal.    The Slovenia Business Point was established at the   end of 2016. The portal is mainly intended for   foreign entrepreneurs from the EU, which along with   information on business-making, also provides cross-  border electronic procedures.   STOP THE BUREAUCRACY   A  single set of measures for providing an   improved legislative and business environment   on the STOP the Bureaucracy Portal offers users an   overview of all measures and control for realising   measures for a better business environment, and a   review of the savings in municipalities in Slovenia.   The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is   continuously verifying the progress of the   implementation of measures, and keeps the data   in the Single Database up to date.   MOPED (Modular Framework for the Preparation of Electronic Documents) and SME Test   W ith the aim of improving the process for   adopting regulations and assessment of the   implications of this regulation in different areas in   the developmental stage, the application MOPED   (Modular Framework for the Preparation of   Electronic Documents) is already being prepared   and will be in production in spring 2018. Under this   application, all documents in the legislative   procedure will be prepared, as its use will be   mandatory for all departments/ministries.     14     Digital transformation of Slovenia   STATE PORTAL eUPRAVA   T he State portal eUprava offers Slovenian   citizens, per the life events concept, 250 most   frequently used electronic services, which are   connected to more than 30 databases. 321   content is available in Slovenian language, 170 in   Italian and Hungarian. There are 110 e-Applications   and 368 forms (Word and PDF). Along with   electronic submission of applications, the portal   provides its users insight into the statues of the   submitted application and their personal   information stored in national data records. The   portal is adapted to people with special needs and   those who prefer mobile technology.   Statistical data: 30.000 registered users, 30.300   applications submitted applications, 25.000 posts   on the bulletin board, 15.000 publications of events   C. »DIGITAL BY DEFAULT« PRINCIPLE   ePUBLIC PROCUREMENT   I t is one of the key projects of the “Digital by   Default” principle. It enables greater   transparency of public procurement procedures,   and provides possibility for re-use and analysis of   basic data. The Government of the Republic of   Slovenia is planning a full transmission to ePublic   Procurement for all users in January 2018, which will   result in EUR 20 million savings per year.   The results of joint procurements are encouraging,   especially in the health sector. For 2017, 10 such   joint procurements are planned. With joint public   procurements, the needs of the contractors are   done via the e-Catalogue which facilitates and   shortens the time needed for the preparation of a   specific procurement.    In February 2016, eAuctions and eReverse Auctions   became obligatory for all state authorities. Because   of these two services, significant cost efficiency has   already been achieved (7% savings). The   Government of the Republic of Slovenia is   encouraging municipalities to use these two tools.    The eCatalogue tool allows transparent   procurement of goods and services under prior   contract. By 2018, the catalogue is planned to be   used for 10.000 different products/items.    Among other things, through the Application SME   Test the impact of regulations on the economy is   being assessed (SME Test – Small and Medium-Sized   Enterprises Test) for each act being adopted by the   ordinary or summary proceedings, except those   adopted by urgent procedure. In the future, this   application will be upgraded with RIA in other areas   – citizens, environment… For the preparation of   assessment of regulations on the economy – SME   Test – more than 200 civil servants have been   trained.        15   Digital transformation of Slovenia   eHEALTH, ePRESCRIPTION, eREFERRAL, zVEM   W ith the eHealth project, modern IT solutions   are being introduced in the Slovenian   healthcare system and the local information   systems are being interconnected in a functional   healthcare information system.   As part of the e-Health project, the ePrescription   has been active for 2 years. This year the zVEM   portal for patients and the eReferral were   launched.    The ePrescription solution enables electronic   business-making for patients, which in certain   cases allows for prescribing medication at a   distance. In dispensing and prescribing    medication, doctors and pharmacists can use a   tool which verifies interactions and contradictions   of medications taken by a patient. Within the   ePrescription, the doctor prepares an electronic   prescription and signs it with his or her own digital   certificate. Information of the prescription is stored   in the ePrescription Central Repository which can   be accessed by pharmacists during the visit of a   patient. All communication takes place in a safe   and secure manner. The ePrescription system   allows the possibility of consultation between the   pharmacist and doctor. In 2017, more than 85%   medications were prescribed electronically.   By introducing the eReferral, patients are able to   electronically take an appointment with a   healthcare provider. The process is also faster for   those patients who do not wish to make an   appointment electronically. For all first   examinations and the majority of diagnostic tests,   a new manner of making electronic appointments   for patients is available through the zVEM portal.   On this publicly available site, any user can review   information on expected waiting times at different   providers and their contact information and makes   an appointment accordingly in three basic steps.   In April 2017, in more than 75% cases the   document was used in electronic form.   The zVEM Portal provides patients with an overview   of all prescribed and dispensed medications with   the ePrescription, review of issued referrals and   agreed appointments for health care services, the   possibility of termination of an appointment for   healthcare services, and at the same time also an   overview of patient documents in the Central   Repository of Patient Data, including a user’s own   summary (almost 50% of the population of the   Republic of Slovenia has in the Repository at least   on clinical paper, and about 6% has a summary).   Via the portal, the patient can submit an   application to receive electronic notifications   (reminders) prior to the expiry of his or her   prescription and the approaching appointment   with a specialist or hospital.   ePENSION   T he Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of   Slovenia provides the ePension (eZPIZ and   BiZPIZ) portal for citizens and businesses. More than   35.000 users are registered with a qualified digital   certificate, meaning they can digitally sign and   submit claims and other digital documents,   request electronic delivery of the digital   documents, and access their personal insurance   and payments information.    e Invoicing has become obligatory since   January 2015 and should be used when   dealing with public authorities. This service fully   ensures electronic procedures for received invoices.   eINVOICING     16   Digital transformation of Slovenia   eRECRUITMENT    e Services ZRSZ (ESS – Employment Service of   Slovenia) – Portal for employers is intended for   employers who cooperate with the ESS. The   employer can carry out some services   electronically and saves him or herself a trip to the   Employment Service.   eServices ZRSZ (ESS – Employment Service of   Slovenia) – portal PoiščiDelo.si is intended for all job   seekers. Users receive notifications on current job   vacancies, review job vacancies, present   themselves to potential employers and   communicate with them, create CVs, register in the   Institute’s records, submit an application for   compensation, order certificates from the Institute’s   records, make an agreement with the Institute to   collaborate via the portal.   The e-Counselling portal is a tool for effective   career planning and job search.   eJUSTICE   S lovenian e-Justice offers the following solutions:   information systems for statistical monitoring of   data in the operation of judicial authorities,   videoconferencing system for carrying out remote   hearings, digitalisation of international contracts, e-  Notary, e-Endorsements, e-Liabilities, and e-  Dispatch.   eAGRICULTURE   e RKG is an online application which allows the   heads of agricultural holdings to inspect their   data from the registry of agricultural holdings. The   data is managed by Administrative Units and they   include databases in the field of agriculture:   register of agricultural holdings, register of graphic   units of the use of land by the agricultural holding,   register of common pastures, register of hops   growers, olive growers, records of fruit growers in   intense plantations, records of fruit growers in   meadow orchards, and records of grape and wine   growers.   eTAXES   T he eTaxes portal allows filling out filling out and   submitting tax forms from the user’s computer   at home or in the office. Physical entities can   submit tax returns, and legal entities can submit   forms for VAT and VIES. Users can also electronically   register taxpayers from e-commerce and   exchange their information with the tax authorities   of other EU Member States and verify tax   identification numbers of tax payers from other EU   countries.     17   Digital transformation of Slovenia   eCUSTOMS    T he aim of eCustoms is to increase the efficiency   of customs control to ensure the seamless flow   of data. The Financial Administration of the   Republic of Slovenia offers on the eCustoms portal   the possibility for users to directly use certain   applications free of charge: e-Export (the possibility   of submitting export customs declaration,   inspection of filled declarations, printing SIL,   receiving conformation of exit of goods), TARIC3   (nomenclature, import/export, meursing,   regulations, anti-damping/countervailing duty,   calculation-control module, trends of tariff quotas   SKP), ETROD (applying excise person, submitting   electronic excise returns, review of field accounts),   EMCS (submission of electronic excise documents,   conformation of electronic excise documents), e-  Enforcement (sending proposals for enforcement),   access into hedging instruments.   eMUNICIPALITY   eMunicipality is the inter-municipal portal for   modern business-making with the municipality, e-  commerce with the municipality, such as submitting   electronic applications, online payment of fees,   decisions.     D. SINGLE DIGITAL GATEWAY   GOV.SI   The Government of the Republic of Slovenia is   developing a single digital gateway and a digital   portal GOV.SI for citizens, foreigners, non-  governmental organisations, business entities and   public administrations. Gradually, more than 270   already existing sites and portals of public   authorities will be included in the portal.    The structure of the content will be based on life   events of the user, or areas identical to the user’s   needs. Single standards and criteria for   performance on national webpages will be   created. These will assess the meaningfulness of   establishing each new public administration   website as a separate entity.   SINGLE CONTACT CENTRE   The Single Contact Centre (EKC) of public   administration is a service intended for all citizens   and public administration employees. It is a direct   two-way communication between users/cusomers   and the State via the telephone and electronically   (email, online forms). Through EKC, the public   administration receives and solves problems of   users, provides quality information on the   organisation and operation of public authorities on   administrative and other services, and offer   technical support in using public administration   electronic services.    EKC also accepts their remarks and suggestions for   improving operation to which it provides feedback.      18      Digital transformation of Slovenia   The National Open Data Portal (OPSI) presents a   single online point for publication of public sector   data. The portal provides everyone/its users with   the right to freely and easily reuse data published   as “open data”, i.e. in machine-readable form and   under an open license, which allows the creation   of new analyses, applications, visualisations, and   the like. In addition, OPSI also contains the   catalogue of all records and databases of public   authorities. According to the latest EU Report on   open data maturity 2017, Slovenia ranks 7th and is   among leaders—trendsetters that have   implemented an advanced open data policy with   extensive portal features and national coordination   mechanism across domains.   Statistical data: 353 published descriptions of   databases, 36 public sector institutions is publishing   data, from the establishment of the portal in   December 2016 by the end of February 2017, there   were 4.902 visits, 2.022 downloads and 1.667 unique   downloads.      E. TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN DATA   PORTAL OPSI   ERAR, STATIST   The Erar online service provides public insight into   transactions of public institutions, state-owned   enterprises and municipalities. It also contains data   on legal persons governed by private law, which   facilitates transparency of the State and limits   corruption risks.   Statist – the new web-based application – is   available to the general public; it provides an   integrated and updated publication of contracts   (procurement) since 2013. By accessing Statist   (contracts) and Erar (realised contracts) the user   gains comprehensive and transparent insight into   the field of public procurement.    PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY PORTAL   The Public Sector Salary Portal provides the general   public with insight and data analysis on masses of   individual types and resources the budgetary users   account for the salaries of public sector employees   The portal draws information from the single system   on public sector wages – ISPAP.   eSPACE PORTAL    This application enables free access to graphical   and descriptive information on users’ properties that   are kept in geodetic records. With the last update,   the data on the cadastral income was added, the   graphical presentation was refurbished and the   generalized market values of real estates were   published in the application Public Access.    The application module for issuing statutory   certificates from geodetic records was fully   renovated in the application Access to the   information on real estate for registered users and   the application Public access to the property sales   register was newly created.      19   Digital transformation of Slovenia     F. INTEROPERABILITY   NIO PORTAL   T he National Interoperability Framework Portal –   NIO is a website intended for the exchange of   interoperable solutions and public sector assets.   The purpose of the portal is to publish information   on experiences and good practices and   recommend the use of modern, user-friendly and   interoperable public services, improve the systems’   and organisations’ interoperability and contribute   to the efficiency and transparency of the public   sector. The portal is used by all public sector   institutions as well as business subjects, physical   entities and other interested parties.   CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS   T he Ministry of Public Administration of the   Republic of Slovenia provides common building   blocks for the use in application solutions. One part   refers to the trust services, and the other to   electronic acquisition of data.   1. CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR TRUST SERVICES   T he Central system for authentication of users SI  -CAS verifies electronic identification in one   place. The two larger systems already using this   portal are the State portal eUprava and e-VEM   portal. In the coming years, most public sector e-  services will transition to this system, as it is   important to clearly verify users’ identity. Other   building blocks for provision of trust services are   also being developed. The most important of   which is the system for central server eSignature   and the central system for eDelivery.   2. MULTIPURPOSE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ELECTRONIC DATA GATHERING    M ultipurpose building blocks for electronic   data gathering (Tray, IO-Module,   Asynchronous Module, and Security Platform) and   the SOVD building block for the exchange of big   files are two examples of good practice.    These building blocks were primarily developed for   the needs of e-Social Security; however, they are   being used as common building blocks in other   information systems which require their functions.   Building blocks are very stable, reliable and highly   automated. In practice, for the use of e-Social   Security, 10.000-30.000 financial situations from   more than 50 sources in public administration and   beyond (e.g. banks) are being acquired daily.   Recently, the European Commission pointed out   these building blocks as one of the ten good   practices of the new generation of Open   Government Services.      20   Digital transformation of Slovenia   Today, numerous public institutions are already   acquiring data with the help of building blocks (e.g.   Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal   Opportunities, Ministry of Education, Science and   Sport, State Prosecutor's Office, State Attorney's   Office, Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of   Agriculture, Forestry and Food etc.).        G. SLOVENIAN STATE CLOUD   T he Slovenian State Cloud (DRO) establishes a   computerised infrastructure for direct budget   users and provides them with storage,   development, business and other forms of services.   This infrastructure provides services which deal with   sensitive, personal and other data and information   which the State does not wish to store outside its   controlled environment.   By 2020, two more services will be developed: the   hybrid cloud and the innovative-development   cloud.   The Hybrid Cloud (HRO) will offer solutions to the   public sector. A commercial provider will ensure this   cloud; however, the data will not leave the   country. As a rule, the users will have to pay to use   the service (indirect budget users, municipalities,   public institutes, agencies). Services or software   used by public institutions can be put into use in the   broader public sector.   The Innovative-Development Cloud (IRO) will serve   as a development platform for educational   establishments and start-ups. IRO will be accessible   to the recipients of state subsidies and aids (RRI), as   well as small and medium sized start-ups which will   have to keep records of their results (products) all in   one place. Developers will be motivated and   trained under the concept of “universal solutions”,   which will be of use in the region and the EU. The   model will be offered to the EU and in the region   (roaming, platform).     H. BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND BIG DATA   T he use of business analytics, especially big data   presents a new, simpler method of operation   and data-driven decision-making at all levels – not   only operational and tactical, but strategic as well.   The DRO presents a platform for systemic and   application solutions, where we, in 2016,   successfully carried out the first pilot project for the   e s t a b l i s h m e nt  o f  b u s i n es s  an a l y t i c s   “Chest” (Skrinja). Based on the results of the pilot   project, we are preparing a project of establishing   business analytics and data warehouses in public   administration which will be available as a   horizontal service to public administration   authorities (mainly for joint applications).   In addition to the DRO infrastructure which   represents one of the prerequisite conditionality for   the establishment of the Big Data processing   platform, we are developing concepts of the so-  called data map, data repository and data   dictionary. With these concepts, we simplify the   introduction of the business intelligence concept   and Big Data processing concept in an innovative   way. The concepts will be adapted for use in a   wide range of sectorial areas.         21   Digital transformation of Slovenia   »JOZEF STEFAN« INSTITUTE   T he Institute carries out world-class research and   development of technologies, such as   nanotechnology, new materials, biotechnology,   technology and production management,   communication technology, computer technology   and technology skills, environmental technology   and reactor technology.    A key project of the Institute is the Event registry   portal where all world events (news), in both   traditional and social media, are monitored in one   place. Based on the received information, the   portal establishes trends, predictions, what is   happening in the world…. They are also active in   the field of artificial intelligence – they collaborate   with IMB – Watson.      I. CONNECTED AUTOMATED DRIVING   Slovenia supports connected automated driving   (CAD) and has started with preparatory activities   relating to cooperative systems. C-Roads Slovenia is   a pilot project of introducing cooperative systems   to transfer information in real time which is based on   vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and   infrastructure-to vehicle. These systems can   significantly improve the efficiency of the transport   system, the safety of all road users and comfort of   mobility.       In early October 2016 the C-Roads platform   became operational. The platform integrates state   institutions and road operators from 11 EU Member   States. The platform coordinates activities for the   implementation of cooperative intelligent transport   systems (C-ITS) in Europe.     J. HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING   H igh-performance computing is one of the   strategic objectives of the Slovenian Digital   Strategy 2020. Slovenia is continuing development   of the national supercomputing cluster for research   institutions – the Slovenian Initiative for the National   Grid (SLONG) is being coordinated by Arnes.      HPC can present an important competitive   advantage in research and industrial areas for   Slovenia. The knowledge in the field of HPC in   Slovenia is united in a few knowledge centres   (especially Arnes, Institute Jozef Stefan, Faculty of   Computing and Information Technology, Faculty of   Electrical Engineering).   For the purposes of introducing data analytics,   business intelligence, and Big Data tools, the   Administration Academy has prepared a   comprehensive training programme, which also   encompasses a motivational seminar and more   modularly flexible courses and workshops.     22   Digital transformation of Slovenia     L. 5G MOBILE NETWORK   T he Republic of Slovenia adopted an ambitious   strategic plan for the development of its   broadband infrastructure by 2020 (100 Mb/s for all)   and is committed to its realization. Slovenia wishes   to establish a pilot project 5G for the entire country.      For faster development and implementation of 5G   mobile networks, Slovenia proposes the creation of   cross-border pilot projects which will accelerate   the utilization of the development potential of this   technology to meet the needs of advanced   innovative solutions in different application areas.   We need to create good conditions which will   encourage companies producing equipment and   mobile operators to invest in new generation   mobile technologies and networks. In December   2017, the Memorandum of Understanding on   cross—border cooperation in the development and   testing of the 5G public protection and disaster   relief pilot project was signed between the   Republic of Slovenia and Hungary.   T he adaptation to the requirements of the new   reality of a digital society demand adequate   ICT skills. That is why Slovenia encourages and   pursues the objective of enhancing e-skills and   knowledge in order to empower its citizens, so they   can fully integrate in the digital environment and   be innovative and creative in the use of ICT, and   will participate in the process of changing and   creating new knowledge, ideas, solutions and ways   to use technology.   The establishment of an inclusive digital society will   facilitate and expedite the adjustment to the   digitization of existing jobs and contribute to the   development of new business models, work   processes and jobs and thereby accelerate the   integration of the so-called fourth industrial   revolution.      In September 2017, the UNESCO 2nd World Congress   of Open Education Resources was held.     K. DIGITAL SKILLS     M. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY   B lockchain or technology of data blocking is   groundbreaking in many respects, in addition   to exceptional aspects of high security and   transparency, it provides services which are   performed in just a few minutes which would in the   past take a year or more. Until recently, this   technology was used primarily in the financial sector   or in the field of crypto-currencies.      23   Slovenian companies have achieved exceptional   and disproportionate success in this field – for   example, one of the largest online crypto-currency   exchanges was set up by Slovenes.       In recent years, successful Slovenian companies in   the use of blockchain technology are already   among the leading developers of digital investment   platforms in the world.       Last year, we achieved great success of the ICO   (Initial Coin Offering) platform which was   developed by Slovenes. This platform enables   young, potential internet start-ups to raise their core   capital. Of course, further possibilities of using the   platform are much greater than of those   mentioned. On its own, it is an excellent basis for   Slovenia to exploit its development potential and   become the leading “blockchain start-up”   destination in the world.          The true potential of the technology is reflected by   the recent arrival and exceptional success of the   Ethereum platform which allows, in addition to   financial transactions, smart contracts which will   bring significant savings to companies and simplify   the implementation of most of mandatory   processes. Given the development activities   abroad, it is clear that we will experience a large   disruption in this field, for which we will have to be   prepared, from the point of view of both users and   creators of new solutions. Slovenian start-ups are   also exceptionally active in this area from projects   such as platforms for marketing of electrical energy   and creation of other energy services to solutions in   traditional industries (e.g. in the forest-wood chain   in Slovenia), which enable the stakeholders to   connect in these branches.           As part of the stand of the Slovenian economy in   the “green, creative, and smart”, Slovenia strives to   become one of the leading countries in introducing   blockchain technologies. Technologies online   today enable only secure transfer of value, greater   efficiency of services and can serve as a basis for   the services of companies and the State, thereby   contributing to greater competitiveness of the   economy and welfare of the entire society.

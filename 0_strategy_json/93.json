The exercise revealed certain areas for improvement in operations and processes. CSA has launched the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan to create deeper awareness and understanding of the cybersecurity landscape; including the challenges faced by OT stakeholders from the public and private sectors. The Masterplan aims to consolidate and guide the development of OT cybersecurity initiatives to address key challenges, as well as mitigate the emerging threat vectors. Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility – the government has taken the lead but we will also need everyone to play their part. We hope the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan will catalyse the collective development of localised capabilities and competencies in OT cybersecurity. To do so, CSA will work closely with our partners in the cybersecurity ecosystem and the industry sectors that own OT systems, toward a resilient OT cyber environment so that our people can enjoy the benefits and conveniences which technology brings. FOREWORD David Koh Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore Operational Technology (OT) systems, especially Industrial Control Systems (ICS), are an increasingly attractive target for highly-sophisticated cyber actors around the world. From the 2010 Stuxnet incident, the Ukraine power grid attack in 2015 to the recent ransomware that affected Norwegian firm Norsk Hydro, successful cyber-attacks on ICS have resulted in disruption of key infrastructure and essential services, as well as hefty financial losses. As we push towards our Smart Nation vision, Singapore, as a hyper-connected commercial hub, will need robust defences to fend off these advanced attackers. The global trend of malicious attacks on OT systems shows no signs of abating. The threat is grave as OT forms the technological bedrock of our everyday lives and the economy, especially with the growing connectivity between Information Technology (IT) and OT systems. We rely on secure OT systems to regulate our traffic lights and rail networks, power our electricity grid and synchronise sensors monitoring our water supply, among other essential services. It is therefore vital for Critical Information Infrastructure owners and regulators of these sectors in Singapore to constantly review and improve the cybersecurity posture of their ICS to ensure that their systems are secure and resilient. At our recent nationwide cyber exercise codenamed Ex CyberStar, CSA, together with all 11 CII sectors, was tested OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Operational Technology (OT) is integral to our everyday lives. The traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic, the signalling systems that regulates train deployment, and the electricity grid that powers up our appliances, are all managed by OT systems. However, such systems are often not designed with adequate cybersecurity in mind, and with the changes in the OT cyber threat landscape, new measures must be taken to secure our OT systems against cyber-attacks. This OT Cybersecurity Masterplan, developed by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, aims to enhance the security and resilience of Singapore’s essential service sectors, improve cross-sector response to mitigate cyber threats in the OT environment, and strengthen partnerships with industry and stakeholders. The Masterplan applies to both Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) owners that operate OT systems, as well as other enterprises that face the same OT threats and similar vulnerabilities. These include manufacturing plants in the oil and gas sector, semiconductor factories, and pharmaceutical companies, among others. In addition, the Masterplan will be useful for members of the OT cybersecurity industry, including equipment manufacturers, system integrators and penetration testers. It will help them better understand OT cybersecurity challenges, so that they can develop products and technologies that can be used by operators to strengthen the security of their OT systems. To attain higher cybersecurity standards in the OT environment, the Masterplan focuses on enhancing the three main factors of People, Process, and Technology, through the following four key thrusts: • Enhance OT cybersecurity training to raise CII sectors’ preparedness through intermediate to advanced training courses offered by the CSA Academy and its training partners. • Set up an OT Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Analysis Centre to facilitate threat information sharing among OT stakeholders in both the public and private sectors, allowing them to tap on the experiences and expertise from thousands of global organisations and share actionable cyber intelligence. • Strengthen OT cybersecurity policies and processes, including prescribing measures in the OT Cybersecurity Code of Practice that provide cybersecurity controls and outcomes specific to OT systems. • Adopt innovative technologies for system resilience, via the National Cybersecurity Research and Development Programme, industry calls for innovation and putting in place sectoral Security Operations Centres. CSA will continue to work with our OT cybersecurity stakeholders, guided by the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan, to achieve a more resilient and secure OT environment to better serve Singapore. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20192 3 What is Operational Technology? Operational Technology (OT) refers to technologies involving interconnected devices and computers for the monitoring and control of physical processes. Today, OT is deployed in industrial sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, energy and water, among others. OT is integral to our everyday lives. For example, the traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic, the signalling systems that regulates train deployment, the sensors detecting the chemical content in our drinking water, and the electricity grid that powers up our appliances, are all managed by OT systems. These systems effectively and seamlessly drive our modern way of life today. INTRODUCTION OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20194 5 EVOLUTION OF OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE AGE OF DIGITALISATION Operational Technology has had a long evolutionary history. The control of industrial processes used to be managed by a complicated series of hard-wired relays, timers and sequencers, coupled with manual processes. OT systems arose out of a need to automate and digitalise these manual processes in order to enhance productivity and meet rising market demands for goods and services. OT systems were designed to have a long life span, with a focus on reliability and safety, rather than security. These systems ran on proprietary control protocols using specialised hardware and software, and were often isolated from business networks and the Internet. This allowed OT systems to be “secure by obscurity”, as they were typically not connected to and air-gapped from other systems. The possibility of a cyber-incident on OT systems was deemed to be remote due to the belief that their systems were completely isolated and air-gapped. In addition, OT systems were traditionally looked after by the engineering departments of companies, with little or no security considerations in mind. Rapid digitalisation has caused industrial processes to shift from systems based on proprietary computing and communications, to those based on open standard Information Technology (IT) computing platforms. This has led to the convergence of IT and OT, and created an industrial revolution of systems interconnectivity. Today, the extensive linkages among enterprise IT and OT networks, businesses, operators, vendors, and other third party systems have greatly increased the operational footprint of networks. OT systems are no longer air-gapped like before, and the cyber risk profiles of these systems have increased significantly. We need to ensure that cybersecurity measures to safeguard our OT systems evolve with the rise in cyber risks. The next section details the OT cyber threat landscape and how it affects Singapore. INTRODUCTION OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20196 7 OT CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE In the past, malicious cyber activities were limited to website defacement, data theft and cyber-fraud. Cyber criminals also relied on social engineering tactics – for example, through phishing emails that entice individuals to click on malicious links that will compromise their accounts or online credentials. A more worrying threat has developed with the increased connectivity between IT and OT systems. Adversaries are now able to compromise IT systems connected to the Internet, secure their footholds, and move to the OT systems to disrupt industrial processes. “As a community we have moved beyond the land of theoretical cyber-attacks on industrial operations to a world where these attacks are a reality for denying power, disrupting operations, and even specifically targeting human life as was the case in the TRISIS cyber- attack in 2017. The threat is worse than we realise but not as bad as we want to imagine. It is a worthy cause to invest in and prioritise OT cybersecurity and it is a winnable battle.” Robert M. Lee CEO and Founder, Dragos, Inc., American ICS cybersecurity company OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20198 9 Cyber-attacks against OT systems are increasing in number and having long- lasting and real impact OT CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW OF CYBER-ATTACKS AGAINST OT SYSTEMS The malicious actors carrying out these cyber-attacks adopt vastly different modus operandi from the run-of-the- mill hacktivists or cybercrime groups. They are often sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, which are a class of cyber- attackers, typically state-linked, who can compromise systems and remain undetected for an extended period of time. They aim to conduct cyber campaigns to steal information or disrupt operations. Furthermore, the proliferation of smart technologies and the increased digitalisation of industrial system environments introduce a wider attack surface for APT groups to conduct their cyber campaigns. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201910 11 “World-wide, attacks that aim service sabotage at critical infrastructure such as a petroleum plant, an electricity utility, a nuclear power plant, are real. NTT estimates OT cyber threats will spread from critical infrastructure industries to other industries such as manufacturing. Awareness among business executives is just emerging, and NTT believes top-down action taking is critically important.” Shinichi Yokohama Chief Information Security Officer, NTT Corporation, Japanese telecommunications company OT CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE HOW THESE GLOBAL OT CYBER TRENDS AFFECT SINGAPORE APT groups that carry out cyber- attacks are of grave concern globally. Singapore is not immune to this threat. As Singapore transforms itself into a Smart Nation – a hyper-connected country that deploys smart technologies to enhance the quality of life for every citizen – our livelihood and economy will increasingly depend upon and be impacted by the digital domain. The underlying OT infrastructure systems, including those in the energy, water and transport sectors, are vital to support our Digital Economy and deliver essential services to Singapore. We need vigilance in safeguarding these systems toward ensuring a robust and resilient Smart Nation. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201912 13 THE NEED FOR AN OT CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has developed the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan (‘Masterplan’), as part of its continuous efforts to enhance the security and resilience of Singapore’s essential service sectors, improve cross-sector response to mitigate cyber threats in the OT environment, and strengthen partnerships with industry and stakeholders. The Masterplan has the following objectives: • Create awareness on the challenges faced by the OT stakeholders and promulgate cybersecurity solutions developed through Public-Private Partnerships. • Align the efforts of multiple OT cybersecurity initiatives to address emerging cyber threats in the OT environment to better prevent, detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks. • Guide the development of key OT cybersecurity initiatives and build capabilities and competencies in securing the OT environment, in partnership with industry and stakeholders. The Masterplan is primarily relevant to the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) owners who operate OT systems. The Masterplan underscores the need for a cohesive cybersecurity effort within and across sectors, as well as lays out key initiatives that will help CII stakeholders augment the cybersecurity of their OT systems. Notwithstanding, the Masterplan also applies to other enterprises running OT systems, which face the same OT threats and possess the same vulnerabilities. These include manufacturing plants in the oil and gas sector, semiconductor factories, and “CII sectors delivering essential services are facing greater cyber threats today. There is a need to focus efforts on safeguarding CII sectors provisioning essential services. We hope that with the timely publication of the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan, it can drive efforts to address some of the people, process and technology challenges faced by CII sectors operating OT systems.” Lim Thian Chin Director, Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), Cyber Security Agency of Singapore WHO THE MASTERPLAN IS FOR pharmaceutical companies, among others. Enterprises can leverage the capacity building mechanisms in the Masterplan to strengthen overall cyber resilience in their businesses. In addition, the Masterplan will be useful for members of the OT cybersecurity industry, including equipment manufacturers, system integrators and penetration testers, to better understand OT cybersecurity challenges, and where feasible, develop products and technologies that can be used by owners or operators to strengthen the security of their OT systems. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201914 15 ICS include: The focus of this Masterplan is on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), as ICS makes up a majority of OT systems. ICS are industrial automation systems responsible for data acquisition, visualisation and control of industrial processes. They are deployed using different protocols configured to operate in various industries based on their specific operational needs. ICS communicate with field devices, such as electrical sensors and actuators that work together to monitor, control and achieve an industrial process objective. For example, Distributed Control Systems (DCS) are used in power stations to monitor and control turbine generators to generate electricity. DCSs are also used in water treatment plants to monitor and control the pumps and valves involved in the treatment of used water. • Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are typically geographically dispersed systems with long-range communications to monitor data and control industrial functions in remote locations. • DCS, which are process oriented, closed-loop control systems with multiple controllers and integrated applications typically used within a single location, such as a manufacturing plant. • Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which are singular controllers with discrete applications also functioning on closed- loop communication within a localised plant. FOCUS AREA: INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201916 17 CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS ICS have become increasingly attractive targets for cyber-attacks primarily because successful attacks in the ICS environment can have significant consequences in the physical world. A notable example of an attack on ICS is the 2017 Triton malware attack in Saudi Arabia, where a critical infrastructure’s Safety Instrumented System (SIS) was compromised by the malware, causing the safety controllers to enter ‘fail safe’ mode and shut down the industrial process. As a result, operations in nuclear, oil and gas plants were interrupted. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201918 19 Stakeholders globally are facing challenges in securing their systems. The challenges in the OT environment can be grouped under the trifecta of people, process and technology, originating from the Diamond Model by architect Harold Leavitt in 1965, and subsequently popularised in the info-security community by cryptographer Bruce Schneier. Trifecta of People, Process, and Technology SANS 2019 State of OT/ICS Cybersecurity Survey reported a general growth of ICS incidents in 2019 compared to 2017 – for example, there was a 200% increase in the number of organisations that reported between 6 to 10 ICS incidents within this time period. Among ICS components, SCADA and PLC were highlighted as having the highest impact to manufacturing and production processes. The survey also found that 62% of respondents considered people as the greatest risk for compromise to ICS, compared to 22% technology and 14% process. Organisations are encouraged to develop action plans on how their OT systems will operate with IT systems, as well as invest in external third-party cybersecurity assessments and establish a detailed inventory of assets. Number of Incidents in the Past 12 Months Risk Categories for Compromise Above infographics referenced from SANS 2019 State of OT/ICS Cybersecurity Survey CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201920 21 To protect against external threats, more needs to be done beyond strengthening the network. There is a need to shift from the traditional mind-set that OT systems are isolated or within a closed network, and hence safe from cyber-attacks. A platform of trust and communication to facilitate information sharing among sectors and businesses is necessary to share actionable insights with other stakeholders for situational awareness, and to detect and respond to cyber threats promptly. There is also a need to consider third-party and supply chain compromises, which are fast becoming a realistic avenue of compromise for an attacker to gain a foothold into OT systems. People are the key resource of any organisation. Engineers working on OT systems must be trained on cyber threats and its mitigating measures. There is often a disconnect between OT and IT engineers, as they have differing priorities. Firstly, ICS cybersecurity is typically managed by process (or OT) engineers – with little or no involvement from IT engineers – who are not prepared to share information openly due to market competitive pressures and information sensitivity. Secondly, process engineers prioritise the resumption of production, while IT engineers want to ensure that systems are fully secure before restarting production. These different priorities tend to impede operational response to cybersecurity incidents. Therefore, the process engineers should work with IT engineers to understand that cyber threats can happen in their environment, and to put in place a suite of process and IT cybersecurity controls to better defend against external threats. In order to effectively manage OT cybersecurity, the team of skilled defenders must comprise both engineers and IT analysts, covering the entire system cycle of cyber protection, threat detection, incident response and system recovery. This requires niche and targeted training for engineers and IT analysts to attain the necessary skillsets. There is therefore a compelling need to increase the numbers and skill levels of our OT cyber defenders. PEOPLE “Building a Smart Port will require us to progressively integrate and unify IT and OT systems in order to exploit the benefits of digitalisation. Inadvertently, this provides new opportunities for cyber-attackers given that OT systems tend to be more vulnerable as they have traditionally been designed to be separated from IT systems. Any successful attack on individual OT or integrated IT-OT systems can cause major disruptions to port operations. Therefore, the integration of IT and OT cybersecurity strategies is critical to address such risks. As the maritime sector regulator for cybersecurity, MPA will partner CSA closely in implementing the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan to ensure that Singapore remains a safe, efficient and sustainable global hub port.” David Foo Senior Director, Operations Technology, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201922 23 In order to bring people together in a coordinated manner and have a common understanding, organisations must have governing processes in the form of policies, standards, guidelines and procedures in place. At the top tier of formalised governance are policies, which provide a generalised overview of the organisation’s security needs and direction. This is followed by mandatory codes and standards for compliance, as well as recommended guidelines for best practice. Finally, all of the above are distilled into procedures for detailed steps on the exact actions necessary to implement a specific mechanism, control or solution. Only through such formal documentation can organisations produce a robust and reliable security infrastructure by reducing uncertainty and simplifying complexity. While there are established global OT cybersecurity standards and guidelines, what is lacking is a set of localised guidelines for OT stakeholders. Many attack vectors can make the jump from IT networks to OT systems, through the PROCESS “Shell has been on an ICS security journey for more than a decade. ICS security is one of the essential elements of ensuring asset integrity and preventing process safety incidents that could potentially result in harm to people or the environment. Safety is a deeply held value and we are committed to ‘Goal Zero’ - No Harm, No Leaks, because we care. Partnering with CSA, allows for a unified country and industry approach to cyber security. This is aimed at raising awareness of the importance of cyber security, strengthening existing controls, as well as continuing to drive development of new process and technology to manage the ever-evolving threat environment we operate in.” Michelle Knight GM, Industrial Control Systems, Shell, British-Dutch oil and gas company use of USB drivers for file transferring, an external contractor with an infected laptop performing maintenance, and even through a compromised software patch. Optimal ICS security can be achieved by strengthening the network, backed up with appropriate policies and procedures to prevent infiltration through these vectors. In addition, having prepared and practised response plans in case of an incident minimises damage to the assets. Furthermore, ICS service support is often via a single proprietary vendor. Protocols and software codes are not shared with customers; while maintenance hooks, backdoors and other vulnerabilities are unknown to users. As a result, patching is irregular and only limited to ad-hoc hot-fixes when vulnerabilities are discovered. This leaves ICS operators at the mercy of malicious actors, who discover the vulnerabilities before they are patched and carry out zero-day attacks to compromise the system. To aggravate matters, in some instances, remote assistance through Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection into the system is required. If access is not controlled and authenticated properly, or if the link is not broken after maintenance, this serves as a conduit for malicious actors to exploit for entry into the system. There is a need for system owners to work with vendors to conduct regular code reviews, enhance patch management, and closely monitor remote access, which are process measures that help to better safeguard the cybersecurity of ICS. In addition, as systems become increasingly interconnected, more protocols are likely to become open source. This will mark a shift from the old philosophy of “security through obscurity” towards community threat hunting and vulnerability reduction. CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201924 25 It is also vital that cybersecurity measures keep up with the rate of technology adoption. Legacy OT systems bring about unique cybersecurity challenges as these systems are often more prone to failure towards any modifications or changes (e.g. due to aging technologies) and they are usually run on obsolete software and hardware. There is also often a lack of basic cybersecurity controls, such as encryption and authentication, designed into legacy ICS systems. With legacy OT infrastructure, protecting these systems against cyber-attacks remains a challenge. This is made worse by the increasing demand for systems to be built at a faster pace, which often causes cybersecurity-by- design to be neglected. With more systems and devices being connected, it increases the attack surface creating an impetus to explore innovation cybersecurity solutions in the OT domains in order to better protect our systems and users. In the current age of continuous and rapid evolution, the technological landscape is ever- changing. This especially applies to many cybersecurity aspects where new threats are emerging TECHNOLOGY and new vulnerabilities are being discovered every day. Therefore, it is important that organisations stay abreast with technology developments and seek to have updated security measures that mitigate against the latest threats. Owners and operators should adopt a “defence-in-depth” approach by implementing multiple technical or logical controls, physical controls and administrative controls to protect their assets. This way, even if one layer is breached, malicious actors are not able to access the organisation’s “crown-jewels” easily. When designing defences, it is also important to note the inherent differences between IT and OT, which traditionally serves different purposes. IT environments are more dynamic and data centric while OT systems are more process centric and concerned with availability and safety. Therefore, designers of security systems must appreciate these priorities when building in cyber defences for ICS. CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201926 27 The OT Cybersecurity Masterplan outlines the key thrusts to uplift the cybersecurity posture of people, process and technology of OT stakeholders. Key thrusts include: KEY THRUST 1: OT Cybersecurity Training KEY THRUST 2: OT Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (OT-ISAC) KEY THRUST 3: Strengthening Policies and Processes KEY THRUST 4: Adopting Technologies for Cyber Resilience KEY THRUSTS OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201928 29 NSHC instructor explaining attack scenario with trainees. The CSA Academy was set up in September 2017 to raise the Government’s and CII sectors’ preparedness, response and resilience against cyber threats. It provides customised intermediate to advanced training courses in cybersecurity areas that are not readily available in the market. Courses offered by the CSA Academy cover different specialisations and technology platforms to address different threat actors and attack vectors, and offer realistic environments that trainees can relate to their day-to-day cybersecurity work. In 2018, FireEye became CSA’s first training partner and delivered courses on incident response and malware analysis to CSA and other Government officers. As part of the effort to build a more secure and resilient OT community, CSA Academy is rolling out OT cybersecurity courses to train between 70 to 100 OT cybersecurity professionals annually. The first OT cybersecurity course which focused on OT ethical hacking was launched in September 2019 in collaboration with NSHC Singapore, a security service company. The course equips participants with recent trends of different cyber-attacks on ICS facilities and OT cybersecurity ethical hacking skills, followed by measures to defend against these cyber-attacks. Due to the overwhelming demand, CSA Academy will be conducting another two runs in 2019. OT CYBERSECURITY TRAINING KEY THRUST 1 “A properly functioning water system makes everyday life in Singapore possible, and is a basis of our continued prosperity. The threat of cyber-attacks on the water system has to be one of most serious. In this respect, the expertise that CSA provides is crucial to safeguarding cybersecurity in the water sector. PUB is fully supportive of CSA’s effort in training and developing a cadre of cybersecurity practitioners to protect Singapore’s OT ecosystem.” Ng Joo Hee Chief Executive, Public Utilities Board, Singapore’s national water agency CSA Academy is also working with iTrust, a Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) R&D Centre, to launch an OT cybersecurity course. iTrust water and electrical testbeds and training skids will be used to provide a realistic training environment for OT cybersecurity incident response. The course will equip participants with best practices in securing OT systems via hands-on exercises and responding to realistic simulations of sophisticated cyber- attacks in the OT environment. In addition, the state-of-the-art testbeds and training skids from iTrust will facilitate research and training in the design of safe and secure OT systems.

OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201930 31 “Cybersecurity incidents continue to grow in volume, complexity and impact across all industries. Similar to safety sharing, we believe cybersecurity information sharing is a key component to improving our industry’s overall cybersecurity resilience. Industry partners can leverage this information and apply learnings across the business and the industrial control environment. Cybersecurity is such a broad and complex area that it takes effective collaboration across all business areas to stay ahead of threats.” Donnie W. Wilburn IT Risk Management Manager, ExxonMobil Global Services Company, American oil and gas company GRF APAC, a subsidiary of GRF, assists in the creation of member-driven information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) for Asia Pacific regions or industries in need of a cyber, physical and geopolitical sharing community. GRF also provides support that augments analysis, technology, and operational capabilities for a community and its constituent members. To enhance information sharing and permit timely responses against cyber threats, CSA collaborated with the Global Resilience Federation Asia Pacific (GRF APAC) and launched the OT Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (OT-ISAC) on 1st October 2019. The OT-ISAC will involve members from the Government, CII and OT industries, to drive knowledge exchanges and adoption of essential OT cybersecurity best practices and benchmarks. Through promoting conferences, workshops and meetings, OT cyber professionals can stay updated on fast-evolving threats and mitigation measures in the OT landscape. In addition, the OT-ISAC will offer insights from private cyber intelligence vendors on incidents that could directly impact the business operations of OT industries. The OT-ISAC will also tap on the experiences and expertise of more than 7,000 organisations operating across five continents, and share actionable cyber intelligence with OT cybersecurity stakeholders in Singapore. The key objectives of setting up the OT-ISAC are to: ❶ Create a platform of trust, to improve the willingness and confidence level for stakeholders to share knowledge, information and practices that could optimise cybersecurity outcomes. ❷ Tailor OT cyber information sharing for Singapore’s needs. With the establishment of the local ISAC, the usefulness and relevance of the shared information will be ensured. ❸ Build local OT cybersecurity analytics and response competencies. The setup and the experiences of operating an ISAC provides opportunities to recruit, grow and deepen cybersecurity competencies of OT cybersecurity analysts for the local ecosystem. ❹ Foster cross-border cooperation on OT cybersecurity. The setup of the OT-ISAC offers opportunities for the local OT industry to exchange information and partner regional countries to enhance collective cybersecurity.

The CCoP prescribes measures that owners of CII systems are required to implement, and mainly covers IT systems to date. CSA will augment the existing CCoP with a set of mandatory cybersecurity measures applicable to OT systems. This addendum is expected to be released in November 2019. These measures provide cybersecurity controls and outcomes specific to OT systems, and focus on network segmentation, patch management, detection and continuous monitoring. They reduce the probability of threat actors exploiting software vulnerabilities and securing their footholds in OT systems, while helping to equip OT system owners with the ability to mitigate emerging cyber threats more effectively. The measures included in the CCoP are modelled upon the ICS Cybersecurity Guidelines that CSA co-developed with the local ICS community, including OT CII owners. For businesses that own OT systems but which are not CII, these measures serve as best practices that they may wish to consider implementing.

DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE CYBERSECURITY SOLUTIONS To address the deficit in OT cybersecurity solutions, the Masterplan will push further for the development of innovative solutions within Singapore’s OT industry. To help end users improve their cybersecurity posture and develop innovative cybersecurity solutions, CSA introduced the Co-innovation and Development Proof of Concept (POC) scheme in 2018 to support cyber innovation via seed funding to promising proposals and solutions. The scheme grows Singapore’s cyber industry by: In September 2018, a pilot run of the industry call for innovation in collaboration with Ascendas-Singbridge, Energy Market Authority, PacificLight Power, Singapore LNG Corporation, Singapore Press Holdings and SMRT corporation attracted a total of 72 proposals, of which 8 proposals were successfully awarded funding. Projects funded include solutions leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to address OT cybersecurity challenges. Riding on the success of the pilot in 2018, the 2019 Cybersecurity Industry Call for Innovation will be launched at SICW 2019. “CSA’s Co-innovation and Development Proof of Concept (POC) Funding Scheme is another example of co-operation to leverage cybersecurity skills and technologies to develop innovative solutions that address key business priorities. Effective cybersecurity protection is only as strong as the weakest link. Schneider Electric believes in looking at cybersecurity across the operation and implementing solutions that consider the existing systems, as well as the potential value from future IIoT applications.” Nathalie Marcotte SVP, Cybersecurity and Industry Services, Schneider Electric, French energy management and automation company Mr David Koh (Chief Executive, CSA) second from left, interacting with the participants at Cybersecurity Innovation Day.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (R&D) The National Cybersecurity R&D (NCR) Programme aims to improve the trustworthiness of cyber infrastructure with an emphasis on security, resiliency and usability. The NCR was launched in 2013 and received strong funding support of over $190M. CSA has been working closely with the National Research Foundation (NRF) through the NCR Programme to develop advanced capabilities and cultivate innovative solutions to solve cybersecurity challenges faced by OT domains of which commercial solutions could not fully address. Through the NCR, collaborations have been forged among the research community, industry and end users to address cybersecurity challenges in OT domains, developing local cybersecurity capabilities in the process. The NCR Programme builds upon the research strengths developed in the local ecosystem, through the establishment of National Satellites of Excellence (NSoE). A NSoE on cyber-physical systems security has been set up at iTrust in SUTD. iTrust’s research focuses on the development of advanced tools and methodologies to enhance the security and safety of current and future cyber- physical systems in three testbeds: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT), Water Distribution System (WADI), and Electric Power and Intelligent Control (EPIC). In addition to supporting research, the testbeds are also used to validate commercial cyber intrusion detection systems and as training and exercise platforms for Government agencies, industry and students. Projects funded by the NCR Programme span the cybersecurity challenges of asset identification, protection and threat detection of OT systems to strengthen its resilience. Some projects have demonstrated potential to be deployed in live environments and are ready for commercialisation. In the water sector, researchers have developed a prototype software tool to generate an inventory of OT assets – inclusive of field instrumentations – to better identify unauthorised OT devices connected to the network. In the land transport sector, researchers have developed a SCADA packet inspection firewall, a secure configuration management system and secure wireless communications mechanisms for its OT systems. In the water and energy sectors, prototypes to detect anomalous activities and formulate mitigation responses for OT systems were developed, based on machine learning technology. Top Left: The Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) at SUTD is funded by the Ministry of Defence and NRF. It will serve as a key asset for researchers in Singapore and abroad who are studying the design of secure cyber- physical systems. “There is no perfect countermeasure in terms of cybersecurity protection, the cybersecurity managed service to monitor the ICS, to detect a malware or a malicious attack, to notify it to the customer and to take a quick action before having a serious incident is our key focus now.” Hiroshi Tanoguchi Head of Lifecycle Service Business Division, IA Systems & Service Business HQ, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Japanese industrial automation company KEY THRUST 4 OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201938 39 OT CYBERSECURITY DETECTION AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES A critical aspect of strengthening the OT cybersecurity posture in Singapore involves constant, robust monitoring of network activities within CII, and swift and decisive responses in the event anomalous activity is detected. This requires putting in place Security Operations Centres (SOCs) at the sectoral level to oversee, monitor and coordinate cybersecurity efforts between Government agencies and CII owners. “The power system is a complex and critical network. With digitalisation and the rising trend of cyber threats, the Energy Market Authority will need to work closely with CSA to strengthen the reliability and resilience of our systems.” Mr Ngiam Shih Chun Chief Executive, Energy Market Authority, Singapore’s energy industry regulator KEY THRUST 4 All CII sectors who operate OT systems are developing or have in place sectoral SOCs suited toward their respective operating environments, with three examples highlighted below: Since 2017, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has collaborated with CSA on two systems to strengthen the cybersecurity of the power sector. This included a Sectoral Detection & Early Warning System (SDEWS) to detect cyber-attacks. The SDEWS analyses and monitors security logs sent from the power sector’s CII for anomalous behaviour in the OT environment. Complementing this is the Cyber Threat Detection System (CTDS) that detects cyber anomalies in the OT network. These systems help EMA safeguard our power systems and ensure a reliable supply of electricity and gas for Singapore. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) operationalised and officially launched the Maritime Cybersecurity Operations Centre (MSOC) in May 2019. The MSOC conducts round-the-clock detection, monitoring, and correlation and analysis of data activities across all maritime CII. This has helped to strengthen the maritime cybersecurity posture in Singapore against potential IT and OT cyber- attacks. Besides possessing the capability to detect and analyse anomalous activities and cyber threats in the IT environment, the MSOC is also able to respond to cybersecurity incidents by employing and integrating advanced OT technology solutions. In addition, MPA is in the process of linking the MSOC and the Port Operations Control Centre (POCC) to respond to cyber- physical incidents in a more holistic and timely manner. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) is also leveraging the expertise and infrastructure offered by the cybersecurity industry, and has subscribed to Managed Security Services for its SOC operations. This allows PUB to monitor and analyse its cybersecurity posture, as well as provide the cyber situational awareness and anticipate cyber threats. As part of PUB’s capability development roadmap, it will also be harnessing new technologies to enhance cybersecurity resilience for the water sector. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201940 41 CONCLUSION This Masterplan will serve as a strategic blueprint to guide Singapore’s efforts to foster a resilient and secure cyber environment for our OT CII, while taking a balanced approach between security requirements, evolving digitalisation and ease of conducting business-as- usual activities. With cyber threats expected to become ever more sophisticated, it is vital for the Government, businesses and individuals to ensure that we have the right defences in place to protect our systems, detect and respond to breaches robustly in order to neutralise the threats expediently. Given the niche expertise in OT cybersecurity, Singapore needs to grow our pool of cybersecurity professionals through continuous training and information sharing to deepen their competencies. Through this, we can build a stronger and more resilient cyber defence against the evolving cyber threats. Our nation’s resilience against cyber threats will also attract opportunities offered by new digital technologies that appeal to investors as a strategic and secure location for their business.

The exercise  revealed certain areas for improvement in  operations and processes.  CSA has launched the OT Cybersecurity  Masterplan to create deeper awareness  and understanding of the cybersecurity  landscape; including the challenges faced  by OT stakeholders from the public and  private sectors. The Masterplan aims to  consolidate and guide the development  of OT cybersecurity initiatives to address  key challenges, as well as mitigate the  emerging threat vectors.   Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility –   the government has taken the lead but we  will also need everyone to play their part.  We hope the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan  will catalyse the collective development of  localised capabilities and competencies  in OT cybersecurity. To do so, CSA will  work closely with our partners in the  cybersecurity ecosystem and the industry  sectors that own OT systems, toward a  resilient OT cyber environment so that  our people can enjoy the benefits and  conveniences which technology brings.  FOREWORD  David Koh Commissioner of Cybersecurity and  Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore  Operational Technology (OT) systems,  especially Industrial Control Systems  (ICS), are an increasingly attractive target  for highly-sophisticated cyber actors  around the world. From the 2010 Stuxnet  incident, the Ukraine power grid attack  in 2015 to the recent ransomware that  affected Norwegian firm Norsk Hydro,  successful cyber-attacks on ICS have  resulted in disruption of key infrastructure  and essential services, as well as hefty  financial losses. As we push towards  our Smart Nation vision, Singapore, as  a hyper-connected commercial hub, will  need robust defences to fend off these  advanced attackers.   The global trend of malicious attacks on  OT systems shows no signs of abating.  The threat is grave as OT forms the  technological bedrock of our everyday  lives and the economy, especially with the  growing connectivity between Information  Technology (IT) and OT systems. We rely  on secure OT systems to regulate our  traffic lights and rail networks, power our  electricity grid and synchronise sensors  monitoring our water supply, among other  essential services.   It is therefore vital for Critical Information  Infrastructure owners and regulators of  these sectors in Singapore to constantly  review and improve the cybersecurity  posture of their ICS to ensure that their  systems are secure and resilient. At  our recent nationwide cyber exercise  codenamed Ex CyberStar, CSA, together  with all 11 CII sectors, was tested   OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019 1    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Operational Technology (OT) is integral  to our everyday lives. The traffic lights  controlling the flow of traffic, the signalling  systems that regulates train deployment,  and the electricity grid that powers up  our appliances, are all managed by OT  systems. However, such systems are often  not designed with adequate cybersecurity  in mind, and with the changes in the OT  cyber threat landscape, new measures  must be taken to secure our OT systems  against cyber-attacks.  This OT Cybersecurity Masterplan,  developed by the Cyber Security Agency  of Singapore, aims to enhance the  security and resilience of Singapore’s  essential service sectors, improve  cross-sector response to mitigate cyber  threats in the OT environment, and  strengthen partnerships with industry and  stakeholders. The Masterplan applies to  both Critical Information Infrastructure   (CII) owners that operate OT systems, as  well as other enterprises that face the  same OT threats and similar vulnerabilities.  These include manufacturing plants in  the oil and gas sector, semiconductor  factories, and pharmaceutical companies,  among others. In addition, the Masterplan  will be useful for members of the   OT cybersecurity industry, including  equipment manufacturers, system  integrators and penetration testers. It  will help them better understand OT  cybersecurity challenges, so that they can  develop products and technologies that  can be used by operators to strengthen   the security of their OT systems.    To attain higher cybersecurity standards  in the OT environment, the Masterplan  focuses on enhancing the three  main factors of People, Process, and  Technology, through the following   four key thrusts:    • Enhance OT cybersecurity training to  raise CII sectors’ preparedness through  intermediate to advanced training  courses offered by the CSA Academy  and its training partners.    • Set up an OT Cybersecurity Information  Sharing and Analysis Centre to facilitate   threat information sharing among   OT stakeholders in both the public and  private sectors, allowing them to tap  on the experiences and expertise from  thousands of global organisations and  share actionable cyber intelligence.    • Strengthen OT cybersecurity policies  and processes, including prescribing  measures in the OT Cybersecurity   Code of Practice that provide  cybersecurity controls and outcomes  specific to OT systems.    • Adopt innovative technologies for  system resilience, via the National  Cybersecurity Research and  Development Programme, industry  calls for innovation and putting in place  sectoral Security Operations Centres.   CSA will continue to work with our OT  cybersecurity stakeholders, guided by  the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan, to  achieve a more resilient and secure OT  environment to better serve Singapore.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20192 3    What is Operational Technology?  Operational Technology (OT) refers to technologies  involving interconnected devices and computers for the  monitoring and control of physical processes. Today, OT  is deployed in industrial sectors such as manufacturing,  transportation, energy and water, among others.   OT is integral to our everyday lives. For example, the  traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic, the signalling  systems that regulates train deployment, the sensors  detecting the chemical content in our drinking water, and  the electricity grid that powers up our appliances, are all  managed by OT systems. These systems effectively and  seamlessly drive our modern way of life today.  INTRODUCTION  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20194 5    EVOLUTION OF OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY  IN THE AGE OF DIGITALISATION  Operational Technology has had a  long evolutionary history. The control  of industrial processes used to be  managed by a complicated series  of hard-wired relays, timers and  sequencers, coupled with manual  processes. OT systems arose out of a  need to automate and digitalise these  manual processes in order to enhance  productivity and meet rising market  demands for goods and services.  OT systems were designed to have a  long life span, with a focus on reliability  and safety, rather than security. These  systems ran on proprietary control   protocols using specialised hardware  and software, and were often isolated  from business networks and the Internet.  This allowed OT systems to be “secure  by obscurity”, as they were typically   not connected to and air-gapped   from other systems. The possibility of  a cyber-incident on OT systems was  deemed to be remote due to the belief  that their systems were completely  isolated and air-gapped. In addition,  OT systems were traditionally looked  after by the engineering departments  of companies, with little or no security  considerations in mind.  Rapid digitalisation has caused industrial  processes to shift from systems  based on proprietary computing and  communications, to those based on  open standard Information Technology  (IT) computing platforms. This has   led to the convergence of IT and OT,   and created an industrial revolution   of systems interconnectivity.   Today, the extensive linkages among  enterprise IT and OT networks,  businesses, operators, vendors, and  other third party systems have greatly  increased the operational footprint of   networks. OT systems are no longer  air-gapped like before, and the cyber  risk profiles of these systems have  increased significantly. We need to  ensure that cybersecurity measures to  safeguard our OT systems evolve with  the rise in cyber risks. The next section  details the OT cyber threat landscape  and how it affects Singapore.  INTRODUCTION  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20196 7    OT CYBER THREAT  LANDSCAPE  In the past, malicious cyber activities were limited  to website defacement, data theft and cyber-fraud.  Cyber criminals also relied on social engineering  tactics – for example, through phishing emails that  entice individuals to click on malicious links that will  compromise their accounts or online credentials.   A more worrying threat has developed with  the increased connectivity between IT and OT  systems. Adversaries are now able to compromise  IT systems connected to the Internet, secure their  footholds, and move to the OT systems to disrupt  industrial processes.  “As a community we have moved beyond the  land of theoretical cyber-attacks on industrial  operations to a world where these attacks  are a reality for denying power, disrupting  operations, and even specifically targeting  human life as was the case in the TRISIS cyber- attack in 2017. The threat is worse than we  realise but not as bad as we want to imagine.  It is a worthy cause to invest in and prioritise  OT cybersecurity and it is a winnable battle.”  Robert M. Lee CEO and Founder, Dragos, Inc.,   American ICS cybersecurity company  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 20198 9    Cyber-attacks against OT  systems are increasing in  number and having long- lasting and real impact  OT CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE  OVERVIEW OF CYBER-ATTACKS  AGAINST OT SYSTEMS  The malicious actors carrying  out these cyber-attacks  adopt vastly different modus  operandi from the run-of-the- mill hacktivists or cybercrime  groups. They are often  sophisticated Advanced  Persistent Threat (APT) groups,  which are a class of cyber- attackers, typically state-linked,  who can compromise systems  and remain undetected for  an extended period of time.  They aim to conduct cyber  campaigns to steal information  or disrupt operations.  Furthermore, the proliferation  of smart technologies and  the increased digitalisation of  industrial system environments  introduce a wider attack  surface for APT groups to  conduct their cyber campaigns.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201910 11    “World-wide, attacks that aim service  sabotage at critical infrastructure such as a  petroleum plant, an electricity utility, a nuclear  power plant, are real. NTT estimates OT cyber  threats will spread from critical infrastructure  industries to other industries such as  manufacturing. Awareness among business  executives is just emerging, and NTT believes  top-down action taking is critically important.”  Shinichi Yokohama Chief Information Security Officer, NTT Corporation,   Japanese telecommunications company  OT CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE  HOW THESE GLOBAL OT CYBER  TRENDS AFFECT SINGAPORE  APT groups that carry out cyber- attacks are of grave concern  globally. Singapore is not immune  to this threat. As Singapore  transforms itself into a Smart  Nation – a hyper-connected  country that deploys smart  technologies to enhance the  quality of life for every citizen –  our livelihood and economy will  increasingly depend upon and be  impacted by the digital domain.   The underlying OT infrastructure  systems, including those in the  energy, water and transport  sectors, are vital to support our  Digital Economy and deliver  essential services to Singapore.  We need vigilance in safeguarding  these systems toward ensuring a  robust and resilient Smart Nation.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201912 13    THE NEED FOR AN OT  CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN The Cyber Security Agency of  Singapore (CSA) has developed  the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan  (‘Masterplan’), as part of its  continuous efforts to enhance the  security and resilience of Singapore’s  essential service sectors, improve  cross-sector response to mitigate  cyber threats in the OT environment,  and strengthen partnerships with  industry and stakeholders.  The Masterplan has the following objectives:  • Create awareness on  the challenges faced by  the OT stakeholders and  promulgate cybersecurity  solutions developed through  Public-Private Partnerships.  • Align the efforts of multiple  OT cybersecurity initiatives  to address emerging  cyber threats in the OT  environment to better  prevent, detect, respond and  recover from cyber-attacks.  • Guide the development  of key OT cybersecurity  initiatives and build  capabilities and  competencies in securing  the OT environment, in  partnership with industry  and stakeholders.  The Masterplan is primarily relevant to  the Critical Information Infrastructure  (CII) owners who operate OT systems.  The Masterplan underscores the  need for a cohesive cybersecurity  effort within and across sectors, as  well as lays out key initiatives that will  help CII stakeholders augment the  cybersecurity of their OT systems.  Notwithstanding, the Masterplan  also applies to other enterprises  running OT systems, which face the  same OT threats and possess the  same vulnerabilities. These include  manufacturing plants in the oil and gas  sector, semiconductor factories, and   “CII sectors delivering essential services are  facing greater cyber threats today. There is a  need to focus efforts on safeguarding CII sectors  provisioning essential services. We hope that with  the timely publication of the OT Cybersecurity  Masterplan, it can drive efforts to address some  of the people, process and technology challenges  faced by CII sectors operating OT systems.”  Lim Thian Chin Director, Critical Information Infrastructure (CII),  Cyber Security Agency of Singapore  WHO THE MASTERPLAN IS FOR  pharmaceutical companies, among  others. Enterprises can leverage the  capacity building mechanisms in   the Masterplan to strengthen overall   cyber resilience in their businesses.  In addition, the Masterplan will  be useful for members of the OT  cybersecurity industry, including  equipment manufacturers, system  integrators and penetration testers,   to better understand OT cybersecurity  challenges, and where feasible,  develop products and technologies  that can be used by owners or  operators to strengthen the security   of their OT systems.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201914 15    ICS include:  The focus of this Masterplan is on Industrial Control Systems  (ICS), as ICS makes up a majority of OT systems. ICS are  industrial automation systems responsible for data acquisition,  visualisation and control of industrial processes. They are  deployed using different protocols configured to operate in  various industries based on their specific operational needs.   ICS communicate with field devices, such as electrical sensors  and actuators that work together to monitor, control and achieve  an industrial process objective. For example, Distributed Control  Systems (DCS) are used in power stations to monitor and control  turbine generators to generate electricity. DCSs are also used   in water treatment plants to monitor and control the pumps   and valves involved in the treatment of used water.  • Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems, which are typically  geographically dispersed  systems with long-range  communications to monitor  data and control industrial  functions in remote locations.  • DCS, which are process  oriented, closed-loop  control systems with  multiple controllers and  integrated applications  typically used within a  single location, such as a  manufacturing plant.  • Programmable Logic  Controllers (PLC), which  are singular controllers  with discrete applications  also functioning on closed- loop communication within  a localised plant.  FOCUS AREA:   INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201916 17    CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS  ICS have become increasingly attractive  targets for cyber-attacks primarily  because successful attacks in the  ICS environment can have significant  consequences in the physical world.   A notable example of an attack on ICS   is the 2017 Triton malware attack in Saudi  Arabia, where a critical infrastructure’s  Safety Instrumented System (SIS) was  compromised by the malware, causing  the safety controllers to enter ‘fail safe’  mode and shut down the industrial  process. As a result, operations in nuclear,  oil and gas plants were interrupted.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201918 19    Stakeholders globally are facing challenges in securing  their systems. The challenges in the OT environment  can be grouped under the trifecta of people, process  and technology, originating from the Diamond Model  by architect Harold Leavitt in 1965, and subsequently  popularised in the info-security community by  cryptographer Bruce Schneier.  Trifecta of People, Process, and Technology SANS 2019 State of OT/ICS Cybersecurity  Survey reported a general growth of  ICS incidents in 2019 compared to  2017 – for example, there was a 200%  increase in the number of organisations  that reported between 6 to 10 ICS  incidents within this time period. Among  ICS components, SCADA and PLC  were highlighted as having the highest  impact to manufacturing and production  processes. The survey also found that  62% of respondents considered people as  the greatest risk for compromise to ICS,  compared to 22% technology and 14%  process. Organisations are encouraged  to develop action plans on how their OT  systems will operate with IT systems,  as well as invest in external third-party  cybersecurity assessments and establish a  detailed inventory of assets.   Number of Incidents in the Past 12 Months  Risk Categories for Compromise  Above infographics referenced from SANS 2019 State of OT/ICS Cybersecurity Survey  CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201920 21    To protect against external threats, more  needs to be done beyond strengthening  the network. There is a need to shift  from the traditional mind-set that  OT systems are isolated or within a  closed network, and hence safe from  cyber-attacks. A platform of trust and  communication to facilitate information  sharing among sectors and businesses  is necessary to share actionable insights  with other stakeholders for situational  awareness, and to detect and respond  to cyber threats promptly. There is  also a need to consider third-party  and supply chain compromises, which  are fast becoming a realistic avenue of  compromise for an attacker to gain a  foothold into OT systems.   People are the key resource of any  organisation. Engineers working on  OT systems must be trained on cyber  threats and its mitigating measures.  There is often a disconnect between OT  and IT engineers, as they have differing  priorities. Firstly, ICS cybersecurity  is typically managed by process  (or OT) engineers – with little or no  involvement from IT engineers – who  are not prepared to share information  openly due to market competitive  pressures and information sensitivity.  Secondly, process engineers prioritise  the resumption of production, while IT  engineers want to ensure that systems  are fully secure before restarting  production. These different priorities  tend to impede operational response to  cybersecurity incidents.   Therefore, the process engineers should  work with IT engineers to understand  that cyber threats can happen in their  environment, and to put in place a suite of  process and IT cybersecurity controls to  better defend against external threats.  In order to effectively manage OT  cybersecurity, the team of skilled  defenders must comprise both engineers  and IT analysts, covering the entire system  cycle of cyber protection, threat detection,  incident response and system recovery.  This requires niche and targeted training  for engineers and IT analysts to attain the  necessary skillsets. There is therefore a  compelling need to increase the numbers  and skill levels of our OT cyber defenders.  PEOPLE  “Building a Smart Port will require us to  progressively integrate and unify IT and OT  systems in order to exploit the benefits of  digitalisation. Inadvertently, this provides  new opportunities for cyber-attackers given  that OT systems tend to be more vulnerable  as they have traditionally been designed to  be separated from IT systems. Any successful  attack on individual OT or integrated IT-OT  systems can cause major disruptions to port  operations. Therefore, the integration of IT and  OT cybersecurity strategies is critical to address  such risks. As the maritime sector regulator for  cybersecurity, MPA will partner CSA closely in  implementing the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan  to ensure that Singapore remains a safe,  efficient and sustainable global hub port.”  David Foo Senior Director, Operations Technology,  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore  CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201922 23    In order to bring people together in  a coordinated manner and have a  common understanding, organisations  must have governing processes in the  form of policies, standards, guidelines  and procedures in place. At the top  tier of formalised governance are  policies, which provide a generalised  overview of the organisation’s security  needs and direction. This is followed  by mandatory codes and standards for  compliance, as well as recommended  guidelines for best practice. Finally,  all of the above are distilled into   procedures for detailed steps on the   exact actions necessary to implement   a specific mechanism, control or solution.  Only through such formal documentation  can organisations produce a robust and  reliable security infrastructure by reducing  uncertainty and simplifying complexity.   While there are established global OT  cybersecurity standards and guidelines,  what is lacking is a set of localised  guidelines for OT stakeholders. Many  attack vectors can make the jump from  IT networks to OT systems, through the   PROCESS  “Shell has been on an ICS security journey  for more than a decade. ICS security  is one of the essential elements of  ensuring asset integrity and preventing  process safety incidents that could  potentially result in harm to people  or the environment. Safety is a deeply  held value and we are committed to   ‘Goal Zero’ - No Harm, No Leaks, because  we care. Partnering with CSA, allows for  a unified country and industry approach  to cyber security. This is aimed at raising  awareness of the importance of cyber  security, strengthening existing controls, as  well as continuing to drive development  of new process and technology to manage  the ever-evolving threat environment we  operate in.”  Michelle Knight GM, Industrial Control Systems, Shell, British-Dutch oil and gas company  use of USB drivers for file transferring,  an external contractor with an infected  laptop performing maintenance, and even  through a compromised software patch.  Optimal ICS security can be achieved by  strengthening the network, backed up  with appropriate policies and procedures  to prevent infiltration through these  vectors. In addition, having prepared and  practised response plans in case of an  incident minimises damage to the assets.  Furthermore, ICS service support is often  via a single proprietary vendor. Protocols  and software codes are not shared with  customers; while maintenance hooks,  backdoors and other vulnerabilities are  unknown to users. As a result, patching   is irregular and only limited to ad-hoc   hot-fixes when vulnerabilities are  discovered. This leaves ICS operators  at the mercy of malicious actors, who  discover the vulnerabilities before they  are patched and carry out zero-day  attacks to compromise the system.   To aggravate matters, in some instances,  remote assistance through Virtual  Private Network (VPN) connection into  the system is required. If access is not  controlled and authenticated properly, or  if the link is not broken after maintenance,  this serves as a conduit for malicious  actors to exploit for entry into the system.  There is a need for system owners to work  with vendors to conduct regular code  reviews, enhance patch management,   and closely monitor remote access,  which are process measures that help  to better safeguard the cybersecurity  of ICS. In addition, as systems become  increasingly interconnected, more  protocols are likely to become open  source. This will mark a shift from the  old philosophy of “security through  obscurity” towards community threat  hunting and vulnerability reduction.  CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201924 25    It is also vital that cybersecurity  measures keep up with the rate  of technology adoption. Legacy  OT systems bring about unique  cybersecurity challenges as  these systems are often more  prone to failure towards any  modifications or changes (e.g.  due to aging technologies) and  they are usually run on obsolete  software and hardware. There  is also often a lack of basic  cybersecurity controls, such as  encryption and authentication,  designed into legacy ICS  systems. With legacy OT  infrastructure, protecting these  systems against cyber-attacks  remains a challenge. This is  made worse by the increasing  demand for systems to be  built at a faster pace, which  often causes cybersecurity-by- design to be neglected. With  more systems and devices  being connected, it increases  the attack surface creating an  impetus to explore innovation  cybersecurity solutions in the  OT domains in order to better  protect our systems and users.    In the current age of continuous  and rapid evolution, the  technological landscape is ever- changing. This especially applies  to many cybersecurity aspects  where new threats are emerging   TECHNOLOGY  and new vulnerabilities are  being discovered every day.  Therefore, it is important that  organisations stay abreast with  technology developments and  seek to have updated security  measures that mitigate against  the latest threats.  Owners and operators should  adopt a “defence-in-depth”  approach by implementing  multiple technical or logical  controls, physical controls  and administrative controls to  protect their assets. This way,  even if one layer is breached,  malicious actors are not able  to access the organisation’s   “crown-jewels” easily.   When designing defences, it  is also important to note the  inherent differences between  IT and OT, which traditionally  serves different purposes.  IT environments are more  dynamic and data centric  while OT systems are more  process centric and concerned  with availability and safety.  Therefore, designers of security  systems must appreciate these  priorities when building in  cyber defences for ICS.   CHALLENGES TO SECURE ICS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201926 27    The OT Cybersecurity Masterplan outlines the key thrusts   to uplift the cybersecurity posture of people, process   and technology of OT stakeholders. Key thrusts include:   KEY THRUST 1:  OT Cybersecurity Training  KEY THRUST 2: OT Cybersecurity Information Sharing     and Analysis Center (OT-ISAC)  KEY THRUST 3: Strengthening Policies and Processes   KEY THRUST 4: Adopting Technologies for Cyber Resilience  KEY THRUSTS  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201928 29    NSHC instructor explaining attack scenario with trainees.  The CSA Academy was set up in September  2017 to raise the Government’s and CII  sectors’ preparedness, response and  resilience against cyber threats. It provides  customised intermediate to advanced  training courses in cybersecurity areas  that are not readily available in the market.  Courses offered by the CSA Academy cover  different specialisations and technology  platforms to address different threat actors  and attack vectors, and offer realistic  environments that trainees can relate   to their day-to-day cybersecurity work.   In 2018, FireEye became CSA’s first training  partner and delivered courses on incident  response and malware analysis to CSA   and other Government officers.   As part of the effort to build a more secure  and resilient OT community, CSA Academy  is rolling out OT cybersecurity courses to  train between 70 to 100 OT cybersecurity  professionals annually. The first OT  cybersecurity course which focused   on OT ethical hacking was launched in  September 2019 in collaboration with NSHC  Singapore, a security service company.  The course equips participants with recent  trends of different cyber-attacks on ICS  facilities and OT cybersecurity ethical  hacking skills, followed by measures to  defend against these cyber-attacks. Due to  the overwhelming demand, CSA Academy   will be conducting another two runs in 2019.  OT CYBERSECURITY TRAINING  KEY THRUST 1  “A properly functioning water system  makes everyday life in Singapore  possible, and is a basis of our  continued prosperity. The threat of  cyber-attacks on the water system  has to be one of most serious. In  this respect, the expertise that CSA  provides is crucial to safeguarding  cybersecurity in the water sector. PUB  is fully supportive of CSA’s effort in  training and developing a cadre of  cybersecurity practitioners to protect  Singapore’s OT ecosystem.”  Ng Joo Hee Chief Executive,  Public Utilities Board,  Singapore’s national water agency  CSA Academy is also working with iTrust,  a Singapore University of Technology   and Design (SUTD) R&D Centre, to launch  an OT cybersecurity course. iTrust water  and electrical testbeds and training skids  will be used to provide a realistic training  environment for OT cybersecurity  incident response. The course will  equip participants with best practices  in securing OT systems via hands-on  exercises and responding to realistic  simulations of sophisticated cyber- attacks in the OT environment. In addition,  the state-of-the-art testbeds and training  skids from iTrust will facilitate research  and training in the design of safe and  secure OT systems.

OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201930 31    “Cybersecurity incidents continue to grow in volume, complexity and impact across all industries. Similar  to safety sharing, we believe cybersecurity information sharing is a key component to improving our  industry’s overall cybersecurity resilience. Industry partners can leverage this information and apply  learnings across the business and the industrial control environment. Cybersecurity is such a broad and  complex area that it takes effective collaboration across all business areas to stay ahead of threats.”  Donnie W. Wilburn IT Risk Management Manager,   ExxonMobil Global Services Company, American oil and gas company  GRF APAC, a subsidiary of GRF, assists in the creation of member-driven  information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) for Asia Pacific regions or  industries in need of a cyber, physical and geopolitical sharing community.  GRF also provides support that augments analysis, technology, and  operational capabilities for a community and its constituent members.  To enhance information sharing and  permit timely responses against cyber  threats, CSA collaborated with the Global  Resilience Federation Asia Pacific (GRF  APAC) and launched the OT Cybersecurity  Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (OT-ISAC) on 1st October 2019. The  OT-ISAC will involve members from  the Government, CII and OT industries,  to drive knowledge exchanges and  adoption of essential OT cybersecurity  best practices and benchmarks. Through  promoting conferences, workshops and   meetings, OT cyber professionals can  stay updated on fast-evolving threats and  mitigation measures in the OT landscape.  In addition, the OT-ISAC will offer  insights from private cyber intelligence  vendors on incidents that could directly  impact the business operations of OT  industries. The OT-ISAC will also tap on  the experiences and expertise of more  than 7,000 organisations operating across  five continents, and share actionable  cyber intelligence with OT cybersecurity  stakeholders in Singapore.  The key objectives of setting up the OT-ISAC are to:  ❶   Create a platform of trust,    to improve the willingness and confidence  level for stakeholders to share knowledge,   information and practices that could optimise  cybersecurity outcomes.  ❷  Tailor OT cyber information    sharing for Singapore’s needs.   With the establishment of the local ISAC,    the usefulness and relevance of the shared   information will be ensured.  ❸   Build local OT cybersecurity analytics    and response competencies.   The setup and the experiences of operating    an ISAC provides opportunities to recruit,   grow and deepen cybersecurity    competencies of OT cybersecurity   analysts for the local ecosystem.  ❹   Foster cross-border cooperation    on OT cybersecurity.   The setup of the OT-ISAC offers opportunities   for the local OT industry to exchange  information and partner regional countries    to enhance collective cybersecurity.

The CCoP prescribes measures that  owners of CII systems are required  to implement, and mainly covers IT  systems to date. CSA will augment the  existing CCoP with a set of mandatory  cybersecurity measures applicable to   OT systems. This addendum is expected  to be released in November 2019.   These measures provide cybersecurity  controls and outcomes specific to  OT systems, and focus on network  segmentation, patch management,  detection and continuous monitoring.  They reduce the probability of threat  actors exploiting software vulnerabilities  and securing their footholds in OT  systems, while helping to equip OT  system owners with the ability to  mitigate emerging cyber threats   more effectively.   The measures included in the CCoP are  modelled upon the ICS Cybersecurity  Guidelines that CSA co-developed with  the local ICS community, including OT  CII owners. For businesses that own  OT systems but which are not CII, these  measures serve as best practices that  they may wish to consider implementing.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201934 35    → Helping CII owners and participating  user organisations improve their  cybersecurity posture by tackling  the cyber vulnerabilities faced;  → Providing opportunities for  cybersecurity companies to develop  new and innovative products and  services; and  → Encouraging the trial and adoption  of innovative solutions through  partnerships between users and  cybersecurity companies.  DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE   CYBERSECURITY SOLUTIONS   To address the deficit in OT cybersecurity  solutions, the Masterplan will push  further for the development of innovative  solutions within Singapore’s OT  industry. To help end users improve  their cybersecurity posture and develop  innovative cybersecurity solutions,  CSA introduced the Co-innovation  and Development Proof of Concept  (POC) scheme in 2018 to support cyber  innovation via seed funding to promising  proposals and solutions.  The scheme grows Singapore’s cyber  industry by:  In September 2018, a pilot run of  the industry call for innovation in  collaboration with Ascendas-Singbridge,  Energy Market Authority, PacificLight  Power, Singapore LNG Corporation,  Singapore Press Holdings and SMRT  corporation attracted a total of 72  proposals, of which 8 proposals were  successfully awarded funding. Projects  funded include solutions leveraging  Artificial Intelligence and Machine  Learning to address OT cybersecurity  challenges. Riding on the success of the  pilot in 2018, the 2019 Cybersecurity  Industry Call for Innovation will be  launched at SICW 2019.  “CSA’s Co-innovation and Development  Proof of Concept (POC) Funding Scheme  is another example of co-operation  to leverage cybersecurity skills and  technologies to develop innovative  solutions that address key business  priorities. Effective cybersecurity  protection is only as strong as the weakest  link. Schneider Electric believes in looking  at cybersecurity across the operation and  implementing solutions that consider the  existing systems, as well as the potential  value from future IIoT applications.”   Nathalie Marcotte SVP, Cybersecurity and Industry Services, Schneider Electric, French energy management and  automation company  Mr David Koh (Chief  Executive, CSA)   second from left,  interacting with  the participants   at Cybersecurity  Innovation Day.

RESEARCH &  DEVELOPMENT  (R&D)  The National  Cybersecurity R&D  (NCR) Programme  aims to improve the  trustworthiness of cyber  infrastructure with an  emphasis on security,  resiliency and usability.  The NCR was launched   in 2013 and received  strong funding support   of over $190M.   CSA has been working  closely with the National  Research Foundation  (NRF) through the NCR  Programme to develop  advanced capabilities  and cultivate innovative  solutions to solve  cybersecurity challenges  faced by OT domains  of which commercial  solutions could not   fully address.   Through the NCR,  collaborations have  been forged among the  research community,  industry and end users  to address cybersecurity  challenges in OT domains,  developing local  cybersecurity capabilities  in the process.  The NCR Programme builds upon the  research strengths developed in the local  ecosystem, through the establishment of  National Satellites of Excellence (NSoE).  A NSoE on cyber-physical systems  security has been set up at iTrust in  SUTD. iTrust’s research focuses on the  development of advanced tools and  methodologies to enhance the security  and safety of current and future cyber- physical systems in three testbeds:  the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT),  Water Distribution System (WADI), and  Electric Power and Intelligent Control  (EPIC). In addition to supporting research,  the testbeds are also used to validate  commercial cyber intrusion detection  systems and as training and exercise  platforms for Government agencies,  industry and students.  Projects funded by the NCR Programme  span the cybersecurity challenges of  asset identification, protection and  threat detection of OT systems to  strengthen its resilience. Some projects  have demonstrated potential to be  deployed in live environments and are  ready for commercialisation.   In the water sector, researchers  have developed a prototype  software tool to generate an  inventory of OT assets – inclusive  of field instrumentations – to  better identify unauthorised OT  devices connected to the network.   In the land transport sector,  researchers have developed  a SCADA packet inspection  firewall, a secure configuration  management system and secure  wireless communications  mechanisms for its OT systems.   In the water and energy sectors,  prototypes to detect anomalous  activities and formulate mitigation  responses for OT systems were  developed, based on machine  learning technology.  Top Left: The  Secure Water  Treatment (SWaT)  at SUTD is funded  by the Ministry  of Defence and  NRF. It will serve  as a key asset for  researchers in  Singapore and  abroad who are  studying the design  of secure cyber- physical systems.   “There is no perfect countermeasure in terms  of cybersecurity protection, the cybersecurity  managed service to monitor the ICS, to detect a  malware or a malicious attack, to notify it to the  customer and to take a quick action before having  a serious incident is our key focus now.”   Hiroshi Tanoguchi Head of Lifecycle Service Business Division, IA Systems & Service Business HQ, Yokogawa Electric Corporation,  Japanese industrial automation company  KEY THRUST 4  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201938 39    OT CYBERSECURITY DETECTION  AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES   A critical aspect of strengthening the OT  cybersecurity posture in Singapore involves  constant, robust monitoring of network  activities within CII, and swift and decisive  responses in the event anomalous activity  is detected. This requires putting in place  Security Operations Centres (SOCs) at  the sectoral level to oversee, monitor and  coordinate cybersecurity efforts between  Government agencies and CII owners.   “The power system is a complex  and critical network. With  digitalisation and the rising  trend of cyber threats, the  Energy Market Authority will  need to work closely with CSA  to strengthen the reliability and  resilience of our systems.”   Mr Ngiam Shih Chun Chief Executive, Energy Market Authority, Singapore’s energy  industry regulator  KEY THRUST 4  All CII sectors who operate OT systems are developing or have  in place sectoral SOCs suited toward their respective operating  environments, with three examples highlighted below:   Since 2017, the Energy  Market Authority (EMA) has  collaborated with CSA on  two systems to strengthen  the cybersecurity of the  power sector. This included  a Sectoral Detection & Early  Warning System (SDEWS)  to detect cyber-attacks.  The SDEWS analyses and  monitors security logs sent  from the power sector’s CII  for anomalous behaviour  in the OT environment.  Complementing this is the  Cyber Threat Detection  System (CTDS) that detects  cyber anomalies in the OT  network. These systems  help EMA safeguard our  power systems and ensure a  reliable supply of electricity  and gas for Singapore.   The Maritime and Port  Authority of Singapore  (MPA) operationalised  and officially launched the  Maritime Cybersecurity  Operations Centre (MSOC)  in May 2019. The MSOC  conducts round-the-clock  detection, monitoring, and  correlation and analysis  of data activities across  all maritime CII. This has  helped to strengthen the  maritime cybersecurity  posture in Singapore against  potential IT and OT cyber- attacks. Besides possessing  the capability to detect and  analyse anomalous activities  and cyber threats in the  IT environment, the MSOC  is also able to respond to  cybersecurity incidents by  employing and integrating  advanced OT technology  solutions. In addition, MPA  is in the process of linking  the MSOC and the Port  Operations Control Centre  (POCC) to respond to cyber- physical incidents in a more  holistic and timely manner.   The Public Utilities Board  (PUB) is also leveraging  the expertise and  infrastructure offered  by the cybersecurity  industry, and has  subscribed to Managed  Security Services for  its SOC operations.  This allows PUB to  monitor and analyse its  cybersecurity posture, as  well as provide the cyber  situational awareness  and anticipate cyber  threats. As part of PUB’s  capability development  roadmap, it will also  be harnessing new  technologies to enhance  cybersecurity resilience  for the water sector.  OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 2019OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY MASTERPLAN 201940 41    CONCLUSION  This Masterplan will serve as  a strategic blueprint to guide  Singapore’s efforts to foster a resilient  and secure cyber environment for  our OT CII, while taking a balanced  approach between security  requirements, evolving digitalisation  and ease of conducting business-as- usual activities.  With cyber threats expected to  become ever more sophisticated, it is  vital for the Government, businesses  and individuals to ensure that we have  the right defences in place to protect  our systems, detect and respond  to breaches robustly in order to  neutralise the threats expediently.  Given the niche expertise in OT  cybersecurity, Singapore needs  to grow our pool of cybersecurity  professionals through continuous  training and information sharing to  deepen their competencies. Through  this, we can build a stronger and more  resilient cyber defence against the  evolving cyber threats.  Our nation’s resilience against cyber  threats will also attract opportunities  offered by new digital technologies  that appeal to investors as a strategic  and secure location for their business.

C. 20503 October 30, 2015 Executive Summary Strengthening the cybersecurity of Federal networks, systems, and data is one of the most important challenges we face as a Nation. As a result, the Federal Government is bringing significant resources to bear to ensure cybersecurity remains a top priority. This includes strengthening government-wide processes for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing best practices; developing and retaining the cybersecurity workforce; and working with public and private sector research and development communities to leverage the best of existing, new, and emerging technology. In furthering this mission, the Federal Chief Information Officer (FCIO) initiated a 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint on June 12, 2015. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team (“Sprint Team”), led by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was comprised of representatives from the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), and other Federal civilian and defense agencies. The initial Sprint memo instructed agencies to implement a number of immediate high priority actions to enhance the cybersecurity of Federal information and assets. This Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (“CSIP”) is the result of the Cybersecurity Sprint, and incorporates progress reporting and corrective actions that are ongoing. The CSIP is the result of a comprehensive review of the Federal Government’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and practices by the Sprint Team. The goal was to identify and address critical cybersecurity gaps and emerging priorities, and make specific recommendations to address those gaps and priorities. The CSIP will strengthen Federal civilian cybersecurity through the following five objectives: Page 2 of 21 1) Prioritized Identification and Protection of high value information and assets; 2) Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to cyber incidents; 3) Rapid Recovery from incidents when they occur and Accelerated Adoption of lessons learned from the Sprint assessment; 4) Recruitment and Retention of the most highly-qualified Cybersecurity Workforce talent the Federal Government can bring to bear; and 5) Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and Emerging Technology. The CSIP is organized in the following manner: Objectives: “What we need to achieve” Actions: “How and where we focus our efforts to achieve those objectives” Specifically, the CSIP’s key actions include: All agencies will continue to identify their high value assets (HVAs) and critical system architecture in order to understand the potential impact to those assets from a cyber incident, and ensure robust physical and cybersecurity protections are in place. The identification of HVAs will be an ongoing activity due to the dynamic nature of cybersecurity risks. DHS will accelerate the deployment of Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) and EINSTEIN capabilities to all participating Federal agencies to enhance detection of cyber vulnerabilities and protection from cyber threats. All agencies will improve the identity and access management of user accounts on Federal information systems to drastically reduce vulnerabilities and successful intrusions. OMB, in coordination with NSC and DHS, will issue incident response best practices for use by Federal agencies, incorporating lessons learned from past cyber incidents to ensure future incidents are mitigated in a consistent and timely manner. The best practices will serve as a living document to be continuously updated. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will provide updated guidance to agencies on how to recover from cyber events. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and OMB will initiate several new efforts to improve Federal cybersecurity workforce recruitment, hiring, and training and ensure a pipeline for future talent is put in place. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council will create an Emerging Technology Sub- Committee to facilitate efforts to rapidly deploy emerging technologies at Federal agencies. The President’s Management Council (PMC) will oversee the implementation of the CSIP in recognition of the key role Deputy Secretaries play in managing cybersecurity within their agencies. CIOs and Chief Information Security Officers will also have direct responsibility and accountability for implementation of the CSIP, consistent with their role of ensuring the identification and protection of their agency’s critical systems and information. Page 3 of 21 The remainder of the CSIP outlines key actions, responsibilities, and timeframes for implementation. Progress will be tracked through several mechanisms, to include comprehensive reviews of agency-specific cybersecurity posture (CyberStats), the CIO Council, and the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC). The PMC will serve as the Executive Steering Committee and will oversee quarterly performance reviews to identify major performance gaps. Page 4 of 21 Page 5 of 21 Introduction Strengthening the cybersecurity of Federal networks, systems, and data is one of the most important challenges we face as a Nation. Every day, the Federal Government experiences increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats. While the Federal Government has prioritized its efforts to address these threats, several fundamental challenges exist which hinder progress in eliminating cybersecurity risks. Among these challenges is a broad surface area of legacy systems with thousands of different hardware and software configurations across the Federal Government, which introduces significant vulnerabilities and opportunities for exploitation. Additionally, each agency is responsible for managing its own information technology systems, which, due to varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and capacity, generates inconsistencies in capability across government. The Federal Government is bringing significant resources to bear to ensure cybersecurity remains a top priority and agencies are held accountable for improving their performance in this critical area. These efforts include strengthening government-wide processes for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing best practices; developing and retaining the cybersecurity workforce; and working with public and private sector research and development communities to leverage the best of existing, new, and emerging technology. To ensure that Federal agencies are dedicating appropriate attention and resources to address these critical and pressing challenges, the FCIO initiated a Cybersecurity Sprint on June 12, 2015. The Cybersecurity Sprint required agencies to take immediate steps to further protect Federal information and assets and improve the resilience of Federal networks. These actions included implementing strong user identity verification and authentication, patching critical vulnerabilities, scanning for cyber threat indicators, identifying critical information assets, and reviewing and reducing the number of privileged user accounts. In addition to providing direction to agencies, the FCIO established a Sprint Team to lead a 30-day review of the Federal Government’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and practices. Accordingly, the FCIO tasked the Sprint Team with creating and operationalizing a set of action plans and strategies to further address critical cybersecurity priorities and recommend a Federal civilian cybersecurity strategy. The result of those recommendations is the CSIP. The CSIP directs a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The CSIP is part of a broader series of actions to bolster Federal civilian cybersecurity, which includes the issuance of updated guidance under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-283) (FISMA); revisions to the Federal Government’s governing document establishing policies for the management of Federal information resources: Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource; new guidance on implementing cybersecurity contracting language; cyber incident response best practices for use by Federal civilian agencies; the issuance of a blanket purchase agreement for Identity Protection Services designed to give Federal agencies ready access to best-in-class solutions and reduce wasteful and inefficient duplicative contracts for common-use services; and an updated Cybersecurity Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal to improve Federal cybersecurity performance. Page 6 of 21 The CSIP emphasizes the need for a defense in depth1 approach that relies on the layering of people, processes, technologies, and operations to achieve more secure Federal information systems. Inherent in a defense in depth approach is the recognition that all protection mechanisms have weaknesses that adversaries may exploit through several paths. Implementing the CSIP will not prevent every cyber incident. In fact, it is likely that agencies will discover additional and previously unknown malicious activity as they improve prevention and detection capabilities. Accordingly, the CSIP incorporates procedures to prepare agencies to respond to and recover from incidents, secure Federal information and assets, and ultimately strengthen their overall security posture. The CSIP incorporates feedback from public and private sector subject-matter experts as well as lessons learned from current cyber incident response and recovery efforts affecting the Federal Government. The CSIP builds on existing policy work, including the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI); Presidential Policy Directives; Executive Orders; legislation such as FISMA; OMB guidance; agency performance and incident data; and Federal Continuity Directives. The CSIP emphasizes the government-wide adherence to NIST standards and guidelines and builds on the core concepts of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which NIST developed in accordance with Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Oversight Responsibility for Federal Government cybersecurity is distributed and shared by all agencies; however, specific agencies have additional roles in supporting this mission and ensuring that the Federal Government has the tools, resources, and guidance necessary to make the risk-based decisions necessary to secure their systems. FISMA states that OMB oversees Federal agency information security policies and practices. The OMB Cyber and National Security Unit (OMB Cyber) was created at the beginning of FY 20152 to strengthen Federal cybersecurity through: 1) Data-driven, risk-based oversight of agency and government-wide cybersecurity programs; 2) Issuance and implementation of Federal policies to address emerging IT security risks; and 3) Oversight of the government-wide response to major incidents and vulnerabilities to reduce their impact on the Federal Government. Progress on CSIP implementation will be tracked through several mechanisms, to include the PMC, comprehensive reviews of agency-specific cybersecurity posture (CyberStats), the CIO Council and the ISIMC. The quarterly performance reviews will be used to identify major performance and policy gaps, which will be addressed through regular engagement with agency leadership and future FISMA guidance. Additionally, OMB and NSC will work within the 1 NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, defines defense in depth as: “information security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization.” 2 OMB launched this dedicated unit within the Office of E-Government & Information Technology, also referred to as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, in the Fiscal Year 2014 Federal Information Security Management Act Report to Congress. Page 7 of 21 interagency to ensure government-wide input and engagement on the creation of usable, targeted policies and guidance to help agencies continue to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. The CSIP will strengthen Federal civilian cybersecurity through the following five objectives: 1) Prioritized Identification and Protection of high value information and assets; 2) Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to cyber incidents; 3) Rapid Recovery from incidents when they occur and Accelerated Adoption of lessons learned from the Sprint assessment; 4) Recruitment and Retention of the most highly-qualified Cybersecurity Workforce talent the Federal Government can bring to bear; and 5) Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and Emerging Technology. The CSIP implementation described herein is organized in the following manner: Objectives: “What we need to achieve” Actions: “How and where we focus our efforts to achieve those objectives” Page 8 of 21 I. Objective 1: Prioritized Identification and Protection of High Value Information and Assets Identify To protect Federal Government information and assets, agencies must first identify the value and impact of the information on their systems and networks. Agencies must also identify the IT assets used to store, process, and transmit that information. Further, agencies must identify those assets and capabilities that enable mission essential functions and ensure delivery of critical services to the public. Accordingly, OMB directed agencies to initiate processes to identify their High Value Assets (HVAs) at the beginning of the Cybersecurity Sprint. Agencies were to review and improve the security practices and controls around their HVAs. To assist agencies with this process, the Sprint Team developed a working definition of “high value asset”3 and a list of attributes to consider when determining whether an asset, dataset, or repository is of high value. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, also provides relevant guidance and requires Federal agencies to categorize their information and information systems to determine the worst-case adverse impact to operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if their information or systems are compromised.4 The effort to identify HVAs builds on FIPS 199 and seeks to implement lessons learned from cyber incidents involving personally identifiable information (PII), by asking agencies’ to give special consideration to the capability, intent, and specific targeting of high value data repositories by potential or actual adversaries. Going forward, OMB is directing the following actions to prioritize the identification and protection of high value information and assets: a. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) will identify the appropriate interagency resources to lead a threat assessment of Federal HVAs that are at high-risk of targeting by adversaries by December 31, 2015. DHS will simultaneously lead a team, augmented by DoD, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other agency resources as needed, to continuously diagnose and mitigate the cybersecurity protections around the HVAs identified during the Cybersecurity Sprint. The DHS-led team will continue to conduct proactive assessments on a rolling basis as the IC, law enforcement, and other Federal entities identify new threats. DHS and DNI will share the results of these assessments with the agencies, as necessary. 3 “High Value Assets” refer to those assets, systems, facilities, data and datasets that are of particular interest to potential adversaries. These assets, systems, and datasets may contain sensitive controls, instructions or data used in critical Federal operations, or house unique collections of data (by size or content) making them of particular interest to criminal, politically-motivated, or state-sponsored actors for either direct exploitation of the data or to cause a loss of confidence in the U.S. Government. 4 FIPS Publication 199 defines three levels of potential impact (i.e., low, moderate, and high) on organizations or individuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Page 9 of 21 i. To facilitate this process, OMB will establish a requirement in the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements 5 for civilian agencies to identify and submit their list of HVAs to DHS for assessment. ii. Agency leadership will direct their respective CIOs to engage and collaborate with DHS during these HVA assessments. iii. To identify HVAs containing PII, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy for each agency shall initiate a review of their information technology systems that maintain PII. The Senior Agency Official for Privacy shall evaluate the sensitivity and quantity of the PII and recommend to the CIO and agency head, as appropriate, whether a specific system or systems should be added to the agency’s list of HVAs. iv. In addition, for each HVA and information technology asset identified, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy shall review the processes for protecting PII on the systems and ensure that the applicable Privacy Act systems of records notice(s) and privacy impact assessment(s) that covers a given HVA or information technology asset is current, accurately addresses risks to PII, and includes any steps taken to mitigate those risks. b. Per OMB M-14-03, Enhancing the Security of Federal Information and Information Systems and OMB M-15-01, Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Guidance on Improving Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Practices, Federal agencies must accelerate the implementation of capabilities and tools to identify risks to their systems and networks, to include, but not limited to, DHS’s CDM program. CDM addresses parts of each stated objective of the CSIP, and its implementation is fundamental to helping agencies develop a better understanding of the risks to their IT systems and networks through improved identification and detection of cyber threats. Through CDM Phase 1, DHS is deploying sensors and tools at agencies that will provide a more accurate picture of: 1) the inventory of hardware and software assets under management, and 2) the ongoing security posture of each of those assets. DHS purchased CDM Phase 1 tools and integration services for all participating agencies in FY 2015. Implementation of these tools will result in coverage for all Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies and over 97% of the Federal Civilian Government. c. During the Cybersecurity Sprint, DHS identified the need to accelerate CDM implementation throughout Federal agencies and has since developed a plan to accelerate the deployment of CDM Phase 2. In the first quarter of FY 2016, DHS has begun purchasing tools to provide Phase 2 capabilities for participating agencies. This capability will help ensure all employees and contractors at covered agencies are using appropriately secure methods to access Federal systems. DHS is scheduled to provide Federal agencies with additional Phase 2 capabilities throughout FY 2016, with the full suite of CDM Phase 2 capabilities delivered by the end of FY 2016. 5 This guidance will be issued concurrent with the CSIP. The guidance is referred to as the “FY 2016 FISMA Guidance” hereafter in this document. Page 10 of 21 Protect Over the course of the Cybersecurity Sprint, Federal civilian agencies increased their overall use of strong authentication from 42 percent to 72 percent. Specifically, Federal civilian agencies increased use of strong authentication for privileged users from 33 percent to nearly 75 percent. Although there is no single method by which all cyber incidents can be prevented, improving the access management of user accounts on Federal information systems could drastically reduce current vulnerabilities. Privileged user accounts are a known target for malicious actors but can be protected by an existing, strong authentication solution: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials. Implementing strong authentication PIV credentials, as directed in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12: Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, is a cost-effective and immediate action that agencies should take to drastically reduce their risk profiles. PIV credentials efficiently authenticate an employee’s identity and reduce the risk of identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and exploitation. To build on the strong authentication progress made during the Cybersecurity Sprint, in FY 2016 Federal agencies should continue to target the Administration Cybersecurity CAP goal of 100% strong authentication for all privileged users and 85% strong authentication for unprivileged users. While impressive strides have been made in areas such as strong authentication implementation, there is still more work to do. For example, once agencies have identified and inventoried their HVAs and high value information technology systems, they must protect them with a variety of policies, processes, and tools, consistent with applicable OMB guidance and NIST standards. Effective protection activities can include reducing the attack surface and complexity of IT infrastructure; minimizing the use of administrative privileges; utilizing strong authentication credentials; safeguarding data at rest and in-transit; training personnel; ensuring repeatable processes and procedures; adopting innovative and modern technology; ensuring strict domain separation of critical/sensitive information and information systems; and ensuring a current inventory of hardware and software components. Furthermore, the employment of shared services is a proven approach for providing agencies with access to robust capabilities and can result in improved consistency and security across the Federal Government. They can also encourage the common application of standardized best practices, reduce costs and increases efficiencies. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team performed a Federal-wide inventory and assessment of current cyber-focused shared services. The Sprint Team assessed the maturity and effectiveness of these offerings, identified service gaps, and proposed additional offerings to address critical needs. The CSIP initiates the following protection activities to improve Federal cybersecurity. These actions are in addition to those already being undertaken by Federal agencies and do not preclude agencies from continuing complementary work to secure their systems. Page 11 of 21 a. Tighten privileged user policies, practices, and procedures. i. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team required agencies to immediately review policies and practices for privileged users. Agencies should continue to: inventory and validate privileged account scope and numbers; minimize the number of privileged users; limit functions that can be performed when using privileged accounts; limit the duration that privileged users can be logged in; limit the privileged functions that can be performed using remote access; and ensure that privileged user activities are logged and regularly reviewed. b. Complete PIV implementation for all employees and contractors6 required to obtain a PIV. i. The Cybersecurity Sprint directed agencies to immediately implement PIV for the following targets: 100% of privileged users.7 75% of non-privileged users.8 a. The CAP Goal for FY 2016 Q1 is 85% of non-privileged users. ii. To facilitate this process, the Cybersecurity Sprint Team developed a compilation of best practices for PIV implementation and posted the collection on the CIO Council’s Knowledge Portal. iii. Where necessary, GSA, in coordination with OMB, DHS, and DOD, and in consultation with NIST, will deploy technical resources for defined periods to assist agencies with remaining PIV implementation challenges. iv. The CSIP directs NIST to publish best practices for privileged user PIV implementation based on lessons learned from the Sprint within 30 days.9 v. OPM, in coordination with NIST, OMB, and GSA, will update guidance on foreign nationals with regards to HSPD-12 applicability by December 31, 2015. c. Address all critical vulnerabilities10 and scan for Indicators of Compromise. i. Moving forward and on a rolling basis, the CSIP requires agencies to scan for indicators of compromise within 24 hours of receipt of the indicators from DHS. 6 As defined by OMB Memorandum M-05-24: Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 – Policy for Common Identification Standards for Federal Employees and Contractors. 7 A network account with elevated privileges which is typically allocated to system administrators, network administrators, DBAs, and others who are responsible for system/application control, monitoring, or administration functions. – 2015 FISMA Metrics 8 An unprivileged network account is any account that is not a privileged network account. – 2015 FISMA Metrics 9 All instances of “within X days” in the CSIP means the deadline for the action is “within X days of the CSIP’s issuance.” 10 The DHS National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS) team identifies critical vulnerabilities at agencies and assigns a severity score based on an industry-standard scoring model. For further questions contact ncats_info@hq.dhs.gov. Page 12 of 21 ii. Consistent with DHS’s Binding Operational Directive 15-01, Critical Vulnerability Mitigation Requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch Departments’ and Agencies’ Internet-Accessible Systems, the CSIP directs agencies to patch all critical vulnerabilities immediately or, at a minimum, within 30 days of patch release. Vulnerabilities existing longer than 30 days will be included in agency PMC reports. d. NSC and OMB will release the EO 13681, Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions Implementation Plan by December 31, 2015, to require implementation of strong authentication and effective identity proofing for government digital services that make personal data accessible to citizens online. e. Drawing on the work of the Sprint Team, OMB will release a plan for implementing new cybersecurity shared services within 3 months. These services will augment or supplement existing agency services, while providing new services for agencies without existing capabilities. Potential service offerings could include, but are not limited to: i. Identity, Authentication, and Authorization Services: Agencies’ ability to further their mission and achieve efficiencies by placing high value services online requires them to be able to have confidence in the identities of users accessing these services. This set of shared identity services could enable agencies to access digital credentials based on effective identity proofing methodologies and user-friendly strong authentication technologies. In addition, agencies can obtain validated information to support authorization decisions so that appropriate users can access their resources or benefits. ii. Mobile Security Services: Mobile devices have become as powerful and connected as desktop and laptop computers, requiring the same level of attention to cybersecurity. Mobile security has unique challenges that require different solutions than existing programs offer. This service (or services) could address authentication, application management, device management, and encryption, and may include approved tools, best practices, and implementation support. iii. Network Segmentation Services: Effective network segmentation management requires consistent application of best practices to limit lateral movement across networks. This shared service could provide network segmentation shared service capabilities across the Federal Government to help ensure that agencies consistently apply best practices to this complex management task. If operationalized, all Federal organizations would be asked to provide recommendations to the network segmentation services management offering to guide the proper implementation of network segmentation within an organization. iv. Digital Rights Management: A digital rights management (DRM) shared service capability could enable a systematic approach to data-level protection across the Federal Government Page 13 of 21 and help prevent unauthorized review, redistribution, and modification of sensitive Government information. While protections at the network level remain essential, adding protection at the data level is critical to achieving defense in depth. v. Encryption Services: Encryption as a shared service could help ensure consistent application of security policies and potentially provide delivery of a range of cryptographic capabilities. If operationalized, this shared service could also leverage, and may require updates to the existing Federal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Proposals for this service offering may also include new requirements for employing web encryption (HTTPS), digitally signed email, and default encryption for sensitive information held by Federal civilian agencies. Page 14 of 21 II. Objective 2: Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to Cyber Incidents Detect The Sprint Team found that Federal civilian agency threat-detection capabilities have improved significantly in recent years. With DHS’s EINSTEIN program providing network perimeter protection and the CDM program providing ongoing awareness of assets and activities within the network, agencies deploying these capabilities are now in a stronger position. Agencies have also made great strides in their efforts to share and receive cyber threat information, both with other agencies and the private sector, which allows network defenders to detect and block cyber intrusions before they cause damage. This section of the CSIP identifies further improvements that OMB, DHS, and Federal agencies will take to enhance information sharing efforts, detect cyber threats in real time, and rapidly respond to cyber incidents. a. For agencies to deploy strong perimeter protections, DHS will build on the current EINSTEIN platform to implement advanced protections beyond the current signature- based approach. DHS has initiated the following efforts to advance the EINSTEIN program: i. DHS is piloting behavioral-based analytics to extend beyond the current approach of using known signatures and begin identifying threat activity that takes advantage of zero-day cyber intrusion methods. DHS is examining technologies from the private sector to evolve to this next stage of network defense. DHS will share lessons learned from the pilot study and next steps with OMB by March 31, 2016. ii. DHS has issued a contract action that will provide EINSTEIN 3A protections to participating agencies that are not covered by the ISPs currently under contract. This contract will make certain EINSTEIN 3A protections (e-mail and domain name system) available to all Federal Civilian Government agencies by December 31, 2015. b. Agencies rely on protections deployed through their trusted internet connection (TIC) or Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Services (MTIPS) providers. OMB Cyber, in coordination with DHS, will initiate a 30-day review of current TIC architecture and baseline controls upon release of the CSIP with a focus on: i. Continuous agency review of their public-facing Internet connections for consolidation and reduction. ii. Ensuring all possible traffic, including mobile and cloud, goes through a TIC. iii. Options for where TICs can be hosted to improve bandwidth coverage. iv. Additional tools that can be implemented at a TIC location. v. How external vendors who store, process, and transmit agency data for or on behalf of the government can have their traffic securely encapsulated within the TIC connectivity. c. The CSIP emphasizes ways to advance Federal-wide information sharing on critical vulnerabilities and threats, indicators of compromise, and best practices. Information sharing is essential not only for detecting and blocking intrusions on a specific targeted Page 15 of 21 organization, but for understanding the broader landscape of cyber risk. DHS analyzes cybersecurity information from sensors deployed across the Federal Government and from incidents reported by Federal agencies and the private sector. With this information, DHS is able to identify when adversaries appear to be targeting particular sectors or types of organizations and share the information proactively, helping agencies understand emerging risks and develop effective protective measures to block threats before incidents occur. i. One primary barrier to effective information sharing is a lack of operational speed. Information sharing must be sufficiently rapid to detect and block threats before targeted networks are adversely impacted. The DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) has developed an automated system to share cyber threat indicators in near real-time and is working aggressively to build this capability across government and out to the private sector. The CSIP directs all CFO Act agencies to work with DHS to implement automated indicator sharing by developing their own capability, procuring commercially available solutions, or participating in a shared service, once available, within 12 months. d. Beginning in FY 2016, GSA will develop a Business Due Diligence Information Service that will provide agencies with a common government-wide capability for identifying, assessing, and managing cyber and supply chain risk throughout the acquisition process. Respond The Sprint Team identified several common challenges during the Cybersecurity Sprint and determined that Federal Civilian Government cyber incident response procedures and practices are not consistently documented or implemented. As instances of cyber incidents simultaneously affecting multiple Federal agencies are likely to increase, the Federal Government requires streamlined response efforts and enhanced procedures for communication and coordination. The CSIP aims to address these challenges through the creation of incident response best practices for Federal civilian agencies. This new guidance will help set expectations across all involved parties and ensure consistency across incident response efforts while remaining flexible enough to guide activities under various conditions and situations. The CSIP addresses this challenge by initiating the following actions: a. OMB, in coordination with NSC and DHS, will provide Federal civilian agencies with incident response best practices along with the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, which will be issued concurrent with the CSIP, to provide a reference guide for responding to major incidents11 affecting Federal civilian agencies. The best practices will address several common challenges identified during the Sprint by formalizing the role of an on-scene coordinator, assigning incident response work streams, and establishing entry and exit criteria for the response phase. Furthermore, the best practices will clarify existing requirements for agencies to notify US-CERT, Congress, and victims of a cyber incident; 11 For a definition of major incidents, please see the FISMA FY 2016 Guidance. Page 16 of 21 will help improve agency plans and procedures to ensure that relevant authorities are documented and understood; and will enhance inter-agency communication and coordination procedures to ensure incidents are mitigated appropriately and in a timely manner. b. In the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, OMB will require that all departments and agencies (not bureaus or components) designate one principal Security Operations Center (SOC), or equivalent organization to be accountable to agency leadership, DHS, and OMB for all incident response activities. Agencies will provide this information to US-CERT by November 13, 2015. c. Separately, within 3 months, OMB, in coordination with DHS, will provide agencies with best practices and use cases for Federal SOCs to ensure consistent roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures are employed by SOCs across the Federal Government. d. In the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, OMB will require agencies to have a standing Federal Network Authorization with DHS to ensure DHS can rapidly deploy on-site resources to conduct incident response activities, when necessary. The authorization should be reviewed on a semi-annual basis and remain on file with DHS. e. The CSIP directs GSA, in coordination with OMB, to research contract vehicle options and develop a capability to deploy incident response services that can quickly be leveraged by Federal agencies, on a reimbursable basis. The incident response service will be managed by the contracting agency, in coordination with DHS and OMB. GSA will develop requirements and deliver a detailed implementation plan for this task to OMB within 3 months; then complete the acquisition process and deliver the final capability within 6 months. Page 17 of 21 III. Objective 3: Rapid Recovery From Incidents When They Occur and Accelerated Adoption of Lessons Learned From The Sprint Assessment Recovery The CSIP defines “recover” as the development and implementation of plans, processes, and procedures for recovery and full restoration, in a timely manner, of any capabilities or services that are impaired due to a cyber event. The Cybersecurity Sprint identified that Federal-wide and agency-specific policies and practices for recovering from cyber events are inconsistent and vary in degree of maturity. In recent years, the Federal Government has prioritized protecting its assets and detecting threats. As an increasing number of threats are detected, the Federal Government must begin to improve both its response and recovery capabilities. Recent events have demonstrated the need for policies or plans related to recovery from cyber events to remain flexible to better allow agencies to respond to and recover from evolving and sophisticated threats. To date, there have been a number of Federal-wide policies and standards that provide guidance as to how agencies should recover from cyber events. For example, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity identifies “Recover”, which includes the sub-categories of Recovery Planning, Improvements, and Communications, as one of its primary Functions. Additionally, numerous controls within NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4 address elements of recovery controls and capabilities that agencies should address. OMB also published OMB M-07-16: Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, which provides guidance to agencies as to how they should protect against data breaches and respond and recover when one occurs. Despite the existence of available standards and guidance, there remains room for improvement. The CSIP initiates the following actions to help agencies rapidly recover from incidents when they occur and accelerate adoption of lessons learned from these events. a. The CSIP directs NIST to provide guidance to agencies by June 30, 2016, on how to recover from a cyber event, focusing on potential scenarios to include, but not limited to, a data breach or a destructive malware campaign. b. The CSIP directs OMB to update OMB M-07-16 by March 31, 2016, to reflect current best practices and recent lessons learned regarding privacy protections and data breach standards. This updated guidance regarding the collection and disposal of PII will help agencies ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations for the protection of this sensitive information. c. To complement these efforts, the CSIP also directs OPM within 3 months to review options and develop and deliver to OMB recommendations for making Identity Protection Services a standard Federal employee benefit. Page 18 of 21 IV. Objective 4: Recruitment and Retention of the Most Highly-Qualified Cybersecurity Workforce Talent the Federal Government Can Bring to Bear Human Resources Strengthening Federal cybersecurity is not possible without the appropriate talent. The Federal workforce must keep pace with the growing dependence on technology for mission essential activities. A well-functioning security organization requires a blend of technical, policy, legal, and leadership resources covering multiple disciplines within cybersecurity. A focus on any one skillset without an understanding of overall organizational needs can lead to failure. The Cybersecurity Sprint identified two key observations related to the Federal cybersecurity workforce: 1) the vast majority of Federal agencies cite a lack of cyber and IT talent as a major resource constraint that impacts their ability to protect information and assets; and 2) there are a number of existing Federal initiatives to address this challenge, but implementation and awareness of these programs is inconsistent. The CSIP initiates the following actions to address these challenges in recruiting and retaining a high-quality cybersecurity workforce. These initiatives will inform a broader Cybersecurity Human Resources Strategy to be published by OMB within 6 months, which will help ensure the Federal Government can recruit, develop, and maintain a pipeline of cybersecurity talent throughout the Federal Government. a. The CSIP directs all agencies to participate in the following efforts: i. OPM and OMB will compile existing Special Hiring Authorities (by agency) that can be used to hire cybersecurity and IT professionals across government. OPM will clarify legal guidelines and provide guidance to agencies on how to increase the understanding of these Special Hiring Authorities, and how agencies should work with their human resources departments to implement them, where appropriate, and rapidly close talent gaps and accelerate hiring by December 31, 2015. ii. Agencies will participate in OPM’s existing Special Cyber Workforce Project, which provides cybersecurity job codes by specialty, so that agency leadership can identify the universe of their cyber talent, understand Federal-wide challenges for retaining talent, and address gaps accordingly. Agency CIOs, working collaboratively with Chief Human Capital Officers, should use this assessment to identify their top five cyber talent gaps, which will be due to OPM and OMB by December 31, 2015. b. The CSIP directs DHS to begin piloting their Automated Cybersecurity Position Description Hiring Tool across the Federal Government. DHS is also directed to develop and report on performance and adoption metrics so that agency leadership can better understand how to leverage the tool. Used in concert with relevant OPM Position Classification Standards, the tool will assist in the implementation of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework by consistently mapping the NICE job codes according to selected skills and KSAs (Knowledge, Skills and Abilities). The tool enhances cybersecurity workforce recruitment by decreasing the applicant time- Page 19 of 21 to-hire and by ensuring cybersecurity job announcements contain clear, technical content. DHS must also post their own internal Cyber Workforce Analysis results on the CIO Council Knowledge Portal by November 30, 2015, as a best practice for other agencies to leverage. c. The CSIP directs OPM, DHS, and OMB, in coordination with NIST and other NICE partner agencies, to map the entire cyber workforce landscape across all agencies using the NICE National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and identify cyber talent gaps and recommendations for closing them within 6 months. The mapping exercise and recommendation report should focus on: i. Existing employees and open positions, starting with the civilian agencies, this assessment should also consider contractor resources. ii. Existing resources and open positions within the DoD and the IC, this assessment should also consider contractor resources. iii. Changes to human resources processes and systems that not only incorporate best practices for retaining and incentivizing employees, but simplify and expedite the hiring process. iv. Capacity building actions to assist human resource professionals in their efforts to implement CSIP recommendations. v. Training and professional development opportunities for the existing workforce in order to address critical needs. vi. Leveraging the National Science Foundation CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service and the Advanced Technological Education program to help inform potential educational programs to help develop a pipeline of students from colleges, universities, and other providers. vii. Driving awareness of cybersecurity internship opportunities and programs that establish the possibility of hiring participants into permanent positions. viii. Creating and deploying “Tiger Teams” comprised of subject matter experts from across the Government to address critical workforce needs. d. The CSIP also directs OPM, DHS, and OMB, in coordination with NIST and other NICE partner agencies, to develop recommendations for Federal workforce training and professional development in functional areas outside of cybersecurity and information technology that support cybersecurity efforts within 6 months. These recommendations should address, at a minimum, the following functional areas: legal counsel, budget, procurement, privacy, and civil rights and liberties. Page 20 of 21 V. Objective 5: Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and Emerging Technology Existing/Emerging Technology As stated above, the CSIP acknowledges the need for a defense in depth approach, or a layering of people, processes, procedures, and tools, to achieve a more secure Federal landscape. This section describes the steps the Federal Government must take to provide agencies with the appropriate technological toolset to adequately secure the functions, systems, and information enabling their missions. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team observed that the Federal Government has made strides in the incubation and adoption of emerging technology for cybersecurity purposes through innovation and incubator programs, to include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Innovation Office (I2O), the DHS Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), in particular the Transition to Practice (TTP) program, and the NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Transition to Practice (TTP) program. Furthermore, Federal agencies have adopted existing commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) technology through programs like EINSTEIN and CDM. In addition to these incubators, the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is a public-private partnership that fosters innovation and accelerates the adoption of secure technologies for the public and private sectors. However, the connection between these programs and the agencies in need of existing and emerging technology must be strengthened. The Cybersecurity Sprint identified a need for a Federal-wide technology assessment followed by a comprehensive program to assist agencies with the procurement, assessment, certification and accreditation of existing and emerging technology. The CSIP initiates the following actions to address the challenge of acquisition and deployment of existing and emerging technology: a. OMB, in coordination with NSC, and OSTP, will convene a working group comprising representatives, as appropriate, from DHS, GSA, NIST, DOD, and the CIO Council, to develop recommendations for strengthening and better coordinating the collective ability of Federal civilian departments and agencies to identify, acquire, and rapidly implement innovative commercially-available cybersecurity products and services. The working group will deliver its recommendations to the Federal CIO and NSC Coordinator for Cybersecurity by March 31, 2016. b. The CSIP directs GSA to develop a procurement capability to allow Federal agencies to access the technology at any known Federal technology incubator, to include, but not limited to, the NCCoE, I2O, and DHS HSARPA by December 31, 2015. c. The CSIP directs the Federal CIO Council to create an Emerging Technology Sub- Committee under the ISIMC by December 31, 2015 that will be responsible for facilitating efforts to expediently deploy emerging technologies at Federal agencies. This group will provide requirements, challenges, and feedback to both incubators and agencies. Page 21 of 21 d. The CSIP directs GSA and DOE, in coordination with the Federal CIO Council, DOD, ODNI, DHS, and the NCCoE, to establish a working group that will identify and connect current testing environments for new technology solutions and submit recommendations for establishing new testing environment solutions to OMB no later than December 31, 2015. Additionally, GSA will establish formal protocols for agencies to utilize these shared testing capabilities and share results broadly for promising technology solutions with potentially broad applicability. e. The CSIP directs the DHS CDM Program to work with the NCCoE to develop solutions and guidance related to CDM including providing technical guidance, best practices, sample implementation plans, and capability assessment methodologies within 2 months. f. The CSIP directs the NCCoE, in addition to their existing priorities, to focus on derived credentials solutions and other strong authentication solutions for mobile devices as a critical component of a broader effort to improve mobile device management.",

C.  20503  October 30, 2015  Executive Summary  Strengthening the cybersecurity of Federal networks, systems, and data is one of the most  important challenges we face as a Nation.  As a result, the Federal Government is bringing  significant resources to bear to ensure cybersecurity remains a top priority.  This includes  strengthening government-wide processes for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing  best practices; developing and retaining the cybersecurity workforce; and working with public  and private sector research and development communities to leverage the best of existing, new,  and emerging technology.  In furthering this mission, the Federal Chief Information Officer (FCIO) initiated a 30-day  Cybersecurity Sprint on June 12, 2015. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team (“Sprint Team”), led by  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was comprised of representatives from the  National Security Council (NSC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department  of Defense (DoD), and other Federal civilian and defense agencies. The initial Sprint memo  instructed agencies to implement a number of immediate high priority actions to enhance the  cybersecurity of Federal information and assets. This Cybersecurity Strategy and  Implementation Plan (“CSIP”) is the result of the Cybersecurity Sprint, and incorporates  progress reporting and corrective actions that are ongoing.  The CSIP is the result of a comprehensive review of the Federal Government’s cybersecurity  policies, procedures, and practices by the Sprint Team. The goal was to identify and address  critical cybersecurity gaps and emerging priorities, and make specific recommendations to  address those gaps and priorities. The CSIP will strengthen Federal civilian cybersecurity  through the following five objectives:        Page 2 of 21    1) Prioritized Identification and Protection of high value information and assets;  2) Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to cyber incidents; 3) Rapid Recovery from incidents when they occur and Accelerated Adoption of lessons   learned from the Sprint assessment; 4) Recruitment and Retention of the most highly-qualified Cybersecurity Workforce   talent the Federal Government can bring to bear; and  5) Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and Emerging   Technology.    The CSIP is organized in the following manner:   Objectives: “What we need to achieve” Actions: “How and where we focus our efforts to achieve those objectives”  Specifically, the CSIP’s key actions include: All agencies will continue to identify their high value assets (HVAs) and critical system  architecture in order to understand the potential impact to those assets from a cyber incident,  and ensure robust physical and cybersecurity protections are in place. The identification of  HVAs will be an ongoing activity due to the dynamic nature of cybersecurity risks. DHS will accelerate the deployment of Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) and  EINSTEIN capabilities to all participating Federal agencies to enhance detection of cyber  vulnerabilities and protection from cyber threats. All agencies will improve the identity and access management of user accounts on Federal  information systems to drastically reduce vulnerabilities and successful intrusions. OMB, in coordination with NSC and DHS, will issue incident response best practices for use  by Federal agencies, incorporating lessons learned from past cyber incidents to ensure future  incidents are mitigated in a consistent and timely manner.  The best practices will serve as a  living document to be continuously updated. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will provide updated guidance to  agencies on how to recover from cyber events. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and OMB will initiate several new efforts to  improve Federal cybersecurity workforce recruitment, hiring, and training and ensure a  pipeline for future talent is put in place. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council will create an Emerging Technology Sub- Committee to facilitate efforts to rapidly deploy emerging technologies at Federal agencies. The President’s Management Council (PMC) will oversee the implementation of the CSIP in  recognition of the key role Deputy Secretaries play in managing cybersecurity within their  agencies.  CIOs and Chief Information Security Officers will also have direct responsibility and  accountability for implementation of the CSIP, consistent with their role of ensuring the  identification and protection of their agency’s critical systems and information.          Page 3 of 21    The remainder of the CSIP outlines key actions, responsibilities, and timeframes for  implementation. Progress will be tracked through several mechanisms, to include  comprehensive reviews of agency-specific cybersecurity posture (CyberStats), the CIO Council, and the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC). The PMC will  serve as the Executive Steering Committee and will oversee quarterly performance reviews to  identify major performance gaps.       Page 4 of 21       Page 5 of 21      Introduction Strengthening the cybersecurity of Federal networks, systems, and data is one of the most  important challenges we face as a Nation. Every day, the Federal Government experiences  increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats. While the Federal Government has  prioritized its efforts to address these threats, several fundamental challenges exist which hinder  progress in eliminating cybersecurity risks.  Among these challenges is a broad surface area of  legacy systems with thousands of different hardware and software configurations across the  Federal Government, which introduces significant vulnerabilities and opportunities for  exploitation.  Additionally, each agency is responsible for managing its own information  technology systems, which, due to varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and capacity,  generates inconsistencies in capability across government.  The Federal Government is bringing significant resources to bear to ensure cybersecurity  remains a top priority and agencies are held accountable for improving their performance in this  critical area.  These efforts include strengthening government-wide processes for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing best practices; developing and retaining the cybersecurity  workforce; and working with public and private sector research and development communities to  leverage the best of existing, new, and emerging technology.  To ensure that Federal agencies are dedicating appropriate attention and resources to address  these critical and pressing challenges, the FCIO initiated a Cybersecurity Sprint on June 12,  2015.  The Cybersecurity Sprint required agencies to take immediate steps to further protect  Federal information and assets and improve the resilience of Federal networks.  These actions  included implementing strong user identity verification and authentication, patching critical  vulnerabilities, scanning for cyber threat indicators, identifying critical information assets, and  reviewing and reducing the number of privileged user accounts.  In addition to providing  direction to agencies, the FCIO established a Sprint Team to lead a 30-day review of the Federal  Government’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and practices.  Accordingly, the FCIO tasked  the Sprint Team with creating and operationalizing a set of action plans and strategies to further  address critical cybersecurity priorities and recommend a Federal civilian cybersecurity strategy.  The result of those recommendations is the CSIP.    The CSIP directs a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and  further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when  incidents inevitably occur.  The CSIP is part of a broader series of actions to bolster Federal  civilian cybersecurity, which includes the issuance of updated guidance under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-283) (FISMA); revisions to the  Federal Government’s governing document establishing policies for the management of Federal  information resources: Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource; new  guidance on implementing cybersecurity contracting language; cyber incident response best  practices for use by Federal civilian agencies; the issuance of a blanket purchase agreement for  Identity Protection Services designed to give Federal agencies ready access to best-in-class  solutions and reduce wasteful and inefficient duplicative contracts for common-use services; and  an updated Cybersecurity Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal to improve Federal cybersecurity  performance.        Page 6 of 21      The CSIP emphasizes the need for a defense in depth1 approach that relies on the layering of  people, processes, technologies, and operations to achieve more secure Federal information  systems.  Inherent in a defense in depth approach is the recognition that all protection  mechanisms have weaknesses that adversaries may exploit through several paths.  Implementing  the CSIP will not prevent every cyber incident.  In fact, it is likely that agencies will discover  additional and previously unknown malicious activity as they improve prevention and detection  capabilities.  Accordingly, the CSIP incorporates procedures to prepare agencies to respond to  and recover from incidents, secure Federal information and assets, and ultimately strengthen  their overall security posture.  The CSIP incorporates feedback from public and private sector subject-matter experts as well as lessons learned from current cyber incident response and recovery efforts affecting the Federal  Government.  The CSIP builds on existing policy work, including the Comprehensive National  Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI); Presidential Policy Directives; Executive Orders; legislation  such as FISMA; OMB guidance; agency performance and incident data; and Federal Continuity  Directives. The CSIP emphasizes the government-wide adherence to NIST standards and  guidelines and builds on the core concepts of the Framework for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which NIST developed in accordance with Executive Order 13636,  Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.  Oversight Responsibility for Federal Government cybersecurity is distributed and shared by all agencies;  however, specific agencies have additional roles in supporting this mission and ensuring that the  Federal Government has the tools, resources, and guidance necessary to make the risk-based  decisions necessary to secure their systems. FISMA states that OMB oversees Federal agency  information security policies and practices.  The OMB Cyber and National Security Unit (OMB  Cyber) was created at the beginning of FY 20152 to strengthen Federal cybersecurity through:     1) Data-driven, risk-based oversight of agency and government-wide cybersecurity  programs;  2) Issuance and implementation of Federal policies to address emerging IT security risks; and  3) Oversight of the government-wide response to major incidents and vulnerabilities to  reduce their impact on the Federal Government.   Progress on CSIP implementation will be tracked through several mechanisms, to include the  PMC, comprehensive reviews of agency-specific cybersecurity posture (CyberStats), the CIO Council and the ISIMC. The quarterly performance reviews will be used to identify major  performance and policy gaps, which will be addressed through regular engagement with agency  leadership and future FISMA guidance.  Additionally, OMB and NSC will work within the                                                               1 NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  defines defense in depth as: “information security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations  capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization.”  2 OMB launched this dedicated unit within the Office of E-Government & Information Technology, also referred to  as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, in the Fiscal Year 2014 Federal Information Security  Management Act Report to Congress.        Page 7 of 21      interagency to ensure government-wide input and engagement on the creation of usable, targeted  policies and guidance to help agencies continue to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.  The CSIP will strengthen Federal civilian cybersecurity through the following five objectives:  1) Prioritized Identification and Protection of high value information and assets;  2) Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to cyber incidents;  3) Rapid Recovery from incidents when they occur and Accelerated Adoption of   lessons learned from the Sprint assessment; 4) Recruitment and Retention of the most highly-qualified Cybersecurity Workforce   talent the Federal Government can bring to bear; and  5) Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and Emerging   Technology.    The CSIP implementation described herein is organized in the following manner:   Objectives: “What we need to achieve” Actions: “How and where we focus our efforts to achieve those objectives”       Page 8 of 21      I. Objective 1: Prioritized Identification and Protection of High Value Information and  Assets    Identify To protect Federal Government information and assets, agencies must first identify the value  and impact of the information on their systems and networks.  Agencies must also identify  the IT assets used to store, process, and transmit that information. Further, agencies must  identify those assets and capabilities that enable mission essential functions and ensure  delivery of critical services to the public.    Accordingly, OMB directed agencies to initiate processes to identify their High Value Assets  (HVAs) at the beginning of the Cybersecurity Sprint.  Agencies were to review and improve  the security practices and controls around their HVAs. To assist agencies with this process,  the Sprint Team developed a working definition of “high value asset”3 and a list of attributes  to consider when determining whether an asset, dataset, or repository is of high value.   Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization  of Federal Information and Information Systems, also provides relevant guidance and  requires Federal agencies to categorize their information and information systems to  determine the worst-case adverse impact to operations and assets, individuals, other  organizations, and the Nation if their information or systems are compromised.4 The effort  to identify HVAs builds on FIPS 199 and seeks to implement lessons learned from cyber  incidents involving personally identifiable information (PII), by asking agencies’ to give  special consideration to the capability, intent, and specific targeting of high value data  repositories by potential or actual adversaries.     Going forward, OMB is directing the following actions to prioritize the identification and  protection of high value information and assets:    a. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) will identify the appropriate interagency  resources to lead a threat assessment of Federal HVAs that are at high-risk of targeting by  adversaries by December 31, 2015.  DHS will simultaneously lead a team, augmented by  DoD, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other agency resources as needed, to  continuously diagnose and mitigate the cybersecurity protections around the HVAs  identified during the Cybersecurity Sprint. The DHS-led team will continue to conduct  proactive assessments on a rolling basis as the IC, law enforcement, and other Federal  entities identify new threats.  DHS and DNI will share the results of these assessments  with the agencies, as necessary.                                                              3 “High Value Assets” refer to those assets, systems, facilities, data and datasets that are of particular interest to  potential adversaries.  These assets, systems, and datasets may contain sensitive controls, instructions or data used in  critical Federal operations, or house unique collections of data (by size or content) making them of particular interest  to criminal, politically-motivated, or state-sponsored actors for either direct exploitation of the data or to cause a loss  of confidence in the U.S. Government. 4 FIPS Publication 199 defines three levels of potential impact (i.e., low, moderate, and high) on organizations or  individuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability).        Page 9 of 21      i. To facilitate this process, OMB will establish a requirement in the Fiscal Year  2015-2016 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management  Requirements 5 for civilian agencies to identify and submit their list of HVAs to  DHS for assessment.  ii. Agency leadership will direct their respective CIOs to engage and collaborate  with DHS during these HVA assessments.    iii. To identify HVAs containing PII, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy for each  agency shall initiate a review of their information technology systems that  maintain PII.  The Senior Agency Official for Privacy shall evaluate the  sensitivity and quantity of the PII and recommend to the CIO and agency head, as  appropriate, whether a specific system or systems should be added to the agency’s  list of HVAs.  iv. In addition, for each HVA and information technology asset identified, the Senior  Agency Official for Privacy shall review the processes for protecting PII on the  systems and ensure that the applicable Privacy Act systems of records notice(s) and privacy impact assessment(s) that covers a given HVA or information  technology asset is current, accurately addresses risks to PII, and includes any steps taken to mitigate those risks.  b. Per OMB M-14-03, Enhancing the Security of Federal Information and Information  Systems and OMB M-15-01, Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Guidance on Improving Federal  Information Security and Privacy Management Practices, Federal agencies must  accelerate the implementation of capabilities and tools to identify risks to their systems  and networks, to include, but not limited to, DHS’s CDM program. CDM addresses parts  of each stated objective of the CSIP, and its implementation is fundamental to helping  agencies develop a better understanding of the risks to their IT systems and networks  through improved identification and detection of cyber threats.  Through CDM Phase 1,  DHS is deploying sensors and tools at agencies that will provide a more accurate picture  of:  1) the inventory of hardware and software assets under management, and 2) the  ongoing security posture of each of those assets.  DHS purchased CDM Phase 1 tools and  integration services for all participating agencies in FY 2015. Implementation of these  tools will result in coverage for all Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies and over  97% of the Federal Civilian Government.   c. During the Cybersecurity Sprint, DHS identified the need to accelerate CDM  implementation throughout Federal agencies and has since developed a plan to accelerate  the deployment of CDM Phase 2.  In the first quarter of FY 2016, DHS has begun purchasing tools to provide Phase 2 capabilities for participating agencies.  This  capability will help ensure all employees and contractors at covered agencies are using  appropriately secure methods to access Federal systems.  DHS is scheduled to provide  Federal agencies with additional Phase 2 capabilities throughout FY 2016, with the full  suite of CDM Phase 2 capabilities delivered by the end of FY 2016.                                                              5 This guidance will be issued concurrent with the CSIP. The guidance is referred to as the “FY 2016 FISMA  Guidance” hereafter in this document.        Page 10 of 21      Protect Over the course of the Cybersecurity Sprint, Federal civilian agencies increased their overall  use of strong authentication from 42 percent to 72 percent.  Specifically, Federal civilian  agencies increased use of strong authentication for privileged users from 33 percent to nearly  75 percent.  Although there is no single method by which all cyber incidents can be  prevented, improving the access management of user accounts on Federal information  systems could drastically reduce current vulnerabilities. Privileged user accounts are a  known target for malicious actors but can be protected by an existing, strong authentication  solution: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials. Implementing strong  authentication PIV credentials, as directed in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12:  Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, is a cost-effective and immediate  action that agencies should take to drastically reduce their risk profiles.  PIV credentials  efficiently authenticate an employee’s identity and reduce the risk of identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and exploitation.   To build on the strong authentication progress made during the Cybersecurity Sprint, in FY  2016 Federal agencies should continue to target the Administration Cybersecurity CAP goal  of 100% strong authentication for all privileged users and 85% strong authentication for  unprivileged users.  While impressive strides have been made in areas such as strong  authentication implementation, there is still more work to do.  For example, once agencies have identified and inventoried their HVAs and high value information technology systems,  they must protect them with a variety of policies, processes, and tools, consistent with  applicable OMB guidance and NIST standards. Effective protection activities can include  reducing the attack surface and complexity of IT infrastructure; minimizing the use of  administrative privileges; utilizing strong authentication credentials; safeguarding data at rest  and in-transit; training personnel; ensuring repeatable processes and procedures; adopting  innovative and modern technology; ensuring strict domain separation of critical/sensitive  information and information systems; and ensuring a current inventory of hardware and  software components.  Furthermore, the employment of shared services is a proven approach for providing agencies  with access to robust capabilities and can result in improved consistency and security across  the Federal Government.  They can also encourage the common application of standardized  best practices, reduce costs and increases efficiencies. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team  performed a Federal-wide inventory and assessment of current cyber-focused shared  services.  The Sprint Team assessed the maturity and effectiveness of these offerings,  identified service gaps, and proposed additional offerings to address critical needs.   The CSIP initiates the following protection activities to improve Federal cybersecurity.   These actions are in addition to those already being undertaken by Federal agencies and do  not preclude agencies from continuing complementary work to secure their systems.       Page 11 of 21      a. Tighten privileged user policies, practices, and procedures.  i. The Cybersecurity Sprint Team required agencies to immediately review policies   and practices for privileged users.  Agencies should continue to:  inventory and validate privileged account scope and numbers; minimize the number of privileged users;  limit functions that can be performed when using privileged accounts;  limit the duration that privileged users can be logged in;  limit the privileged functions that can be performed using remote access; and ensure that privileged user activities are logged and regularly reviewed.  b. Complete PIV implementation for all employees and contractors6 required to obtain a  PIV.  i. The Cybersecurity Sprint directed agencies to immediately implement PIV for the  following targets:  100% of privileged users.7  75% of non-privileged users.8  a. The CAP Goal for FY 2016 Q1 is 85% of non-privileged users. ii. To facilitate this process, the Cybersecurity Sprint Team developed a compilation   of best practices for PIV implementation and posted the collection on the CIO  Council’s Knowledge Portal.  iii. Where necessary, GSA, in coordination with OMB, DHS, and DOD, and in  consultation with NIST, will deploy technical resources for defined periods to  assist agencies with remaining PIV implementation challenges.    iv. The CSIP directs NIST to publish best practices for privileged user PIV  implementation based on lessons learned from the Sprint within 30 days.9  v. OPM, in coordination with NIST, OMB, and GSA, will update guidance on  foreign nationals with regards to HSPD-12 applicability by December 31, 2015.  c. Address all critical vulnerabilities10 and scan for Indicators of Compromise. i. Moving forward and on a rolling basis, the CSIP requires agencies to scan for   indicators of compromise within 24 hours of receipt of the indicators from DHS.                                                               6 As defined by OMB Memorandum M-05-24: Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)  12 – Policy for Common Identification Standards for Federal Employees and Contractors. 7 A network account with elevated privileges which is typically allocated to system administrators, network  administrators, DBAs, and others who are responsible for system/application control, monitoring, or administration  functions. – 2015 FISMA Metrics 8 An unprivileged network account is any account that is not a privileged network account. – 2015 FISMA Metrics 9 All instances of “within X days” in the CSIP means the deadline for the action is “within X days of the CSIP’s issuance.”  10 The DHS National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS) team identifies critical  vulnerabilities at agencies and assigns a severity score based on an industry-standard scoring model. For further  questions contact ncats_info@hq.dhs.gov.          Page 12 of 21      ii. Consistent with DHS’s Binding Operational Directive 15-01, Critical  Vulnerability Mitigation Requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch  Departments’ and Agencies’ Internet-Accessible Systems, the CSIP directs  agencies to patch all critical vulnerabilities immediately or, at a minimum, within  30 days of patch release. Vulnerabilities existing longer than 30 days will be  included in agency PMC reports.  d. NSC and OMB will release the EO 13681, Improving the Security of Consumer Financial  Transactions Implementation Plan by December 31, 2015, to require implementation of  strong authentication and effective identity proofing for government digital services that  make personal data accessible to citizens online.  e. Drawing on the work of the Sprint Team, OMB will release a plan for implementing new  cybersecurity shared services within 3 months.  These services will augment or  supplement existing agency services, while providing new services for agencies without  existing capabilities.  Potential service offerings could include, but are not limited to:   i. Identity, Authentication, and Authorization Services: Agencies’ ability to further their mission and achieve efficiencies by placing  high value services online requires them to be able to have confidence in the identities of users accessing these services. This set of shared identity  services could enable agencies to access digital credentials based on effective  identity proofing methodologies and user-friendly strong authentication  technologies. In addition, agencies can obtain validated information to  support authorization decisions so that appropriate users can access their resources or benefits.    ii. Mobile Security Services: Mobile devices have become as powerful and connected as desktop and laptop  computers, requiring the same level of attention to cybersecurity. Mobile  security has unique challenges that require different solutions than existing  programs offer. This service (or services) could address authentication,  application management, device management, and encryption, and may  include approved tools, best practices, and implementation support.    iii. Network Segmentation Services: Effective network segmentation management requires consistent application  of best practices to limit lateral movement across networks.  This shared  service could provide network segmentation shared service capabilities across  the Federal Government to help ensure that agencies consistently apply best  practices to this complex management task. If operationalized, all Federal organizations would be asked to provide recommendations to the network  segmentation services management offering to guide the proper  implementation of network segmentation within an organization.  iv. Digital Rights Management:  A digital rights management (DRM) shared service capability could enable a  systematic approach to data-level protection across the Federal Government        Page 13 of 21      and help prevent unauthorized review, redistribution, and modification of  sensitive Government information. While protections at the network level  remain essential, adding protection at the data level is critical to achieving defense in depth.  v. Encryption Services: Encryption as a shared service could help ensure consistent application of  security policies and potentially provide delivery of a range of cryptographic  capabilities.  If operationalized, this shared service could also leverage, and  may require updates to the existing Federal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Proposals for this service offering may also include new requirements for  employing web encryption (HTTPS), digitally signed email, and default  encryption for sensitive information held by Federal civilian agencies.        Page 14 of 21      II. Objective 2: Timely Detection of and Rapid Response to Cyber Incidents  Detect The Sprint Team found that Federal civilian agency threat-detection capabilities have  improved significantly in recent years.  With DHS’s EINSTEIN program providing network  perimeter protection and the CDM program providing ongoing awareness of assets and  activities within the network, agencies deploying these capabilities are now in a stronger  position.  Agencies have also made great strides in their efforts to share and receive cyber  threat information, both with other agencies and the private sector, which allows network  defenders to detect and block cyber intrusions before they cause damage.  This section of the  CSIP identifies further improvements that OMB, DHS, and Federal agencies will take to  enhance information sharing efforts, detect cyber threats in real time, and rapidly respond to  cyber incidents.     a. For agencies to deploy strong perimeter protections, DHS will build on the current  EINSTEIN platform to implement advanced protections beyond the current signature- based approach.  DHS has initiated the following efforts to advance the EINSTEIN  program:   i. DHS is piloting behavioral-based analytics to extend beyond the current approach  of using known signatures and begin identifying threat activity that takes advantage of zero-day cyber intrusion methods.  DHS is examining technologies  from the private sector to evolve to this next stage of network defense. DHS will  share lessons learned from the pilot study and next steps with OMB by March  31, 2016.  ii. DHS has issued a contract action that will provide EINSTEIN 3A protections to  participating agencies that are not covered by the ISPs currently under contract.   This contract will make certain EINSTEIN 3A protections (e-mail and domain  name system) available to all Federal Civilian Government agencies by December 31, 2015.  b. Agencies rely on protections deployed through their trusted internet connection (TIC) or  Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Services (MTIPS) providers.  OMB Cyber, in  coordination with DHS, will initiate a 30-day review of current TIC architecture and  baseline controls upon release of the CSIP with a focus on:  i. Continuous agency review of their public-facing Internet connections for  consolidation and reduction.  ii. Ensuring all possible traffic, including mobile and cloud, goes through a TIC. iii. Options for where TICs can be hosted to improve bandwidth coverage. iv. Additional tools that can be implemented at a TIC location. v. How external vendors who store, process, and transmit agency data for or on   behalf of the government can have their traffic securely encapsulated within the  TIC connectivity.    c. The CSIP emphasizes ways to advance Federal-wide information sharing on critical  vulnerabilities and threats, indicators of compromise, and best practices.  Information  sharing is essential not only for detecting and blocking intrusions on a specific targeted        Page 15 of 21      organization, but for understanding the broader landscape of cyber risk. DHS analyzes  cybersecurity information from sensors deployed across the Federal Government and  from incidents reported by Federal agencies and the private sector. With this  information, DHS is able to identify when adversaries appear to be targeting particular  sectors or types of organizations and share the information proactively, helping agencies  understand emerging risks and develop effective protective measures to block threats  before incidents occur.  i. One primary barrier to effective information sharing is a lack of operational  speed. Information sharing must be sufficiently rapid to detect and block threats  before targeted networks are adversely impacted. The DHS National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) has developed  an automated system to share cyber threat indicators in near real-time and is  working aggressively to build this capability across government and out to the  private sector.  The CSIP directs all CFO Act agencies to work with DHS to  implement automated indicator sharing by developing their own capability,  procuring commercially available solutions, or participating in a shared service,  once available, within 12 months.  d. Beginning in FY 2016, GSA will develop a Business Due Diligence Information Service  that will provide agencies with a common government-wide capability for identifying,  assessing, and managing cyber and supply chain risk throughout the acquisition process.      Respond The Sprint Team identified several common challenges during the Cybersecurity Sprint and  determined that Federal Civilian Government cyber incident response procedures and practices  are not consistently documented or implemented. As instances of cyber incidents simultaneously  affecting multiple Federal agencies are likely to increase, the Federal Government requires  streamlined response efforts and enhanced procedures for communication and coordination. The  CSIP aims to address these challenges through the creation of incident response best practices for  Federal civilian agencies. This new guidance will help set expectations across all involved  parties and ensure consistency across incident response efforts while remaining flexible enough  to guide activities under various conditions and situations.   The CSIP addresses this challenge by initiating the following actions:   a. OMB, in coordination with NSC and DHS, will provide Federal civilian agencies with incident response best practices along with the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, which will be  issued concurrent with the CSIP, to provide a reference guide for responding to major  incidents11 affecting Federal civilian agencies. The best practices will address several  common challenges identified during the Sprint by formalizing the role of an on-scene  coordinator, assigning incident response work streams, and establishing entry and exit  criteria for the response phase. Furthermore, the best practices will clarify existing  requirements for agencies to notify US-CERT, Congress, and victims of a cyber incident;                                                              11 For a definition of major incidents, please see the FISMA FY 2016 Guidance.        Page 16 of 21      will help improve agency plans and procedures to ensure that relevant authorities are  documented and understood; and will enhance inter-agency communication and  coordination procedures to ensure incidents are mitigated appropriately and in a timely  manner.  b. In the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, OMB will require that all departments and agencies  (not bureaus or components) designate one principal Security Operations Center (SOC),  or equivalent organization to be accountable to agency leadership, DHS, and OMB for all  incident response activities. Agencies will provide this information to US-CERT by  November 13, 2015.  c. Separately, within 3 months, OMB, in coordination with DHS, will provide agencies  with best practices and use cases for Federal SOCs to ensure consistent roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures are employed by SOCs across the Federal  Government.  d. In the FY 2016 FISMA Guidance, OMB will require agencies to have a standing Federal  Network Authorization with DHS to ensure DHS can rapidly deploy on-site resources to  conduct incident response activities, when necessary. The authorization should be  reviewed on a semi-annual basis and remain on file with DHS.   e. The CSIP directs GSA, in coordination with OMB, to research contract vehicle options  and develop a capability to deploy incident response services that can quickly be  leveraged by Federal agencies, on a reimbursable basis. The incident response service  will be managed by the contracting agency, in coordination with DHS and OMB. GSA  will develop requirements and deliver a detailed implementation plan for this task to  OMB within 3 months; then complete the acquisition process and deliver the final  capability within 6 months.

Objective 3: Rapid Recovery From Incidents When They Occur and Accelerated  Adoption of Lessons Learned From The Sprint Assessment  Recovery The CSIP defines “recover” as the development and implementation of plans, processes, and  procedures for recovery and full restoration, in a timely manner, of any capabilities or  services that are impaired due to a cyber event.  The Cybersecurity Sprint identified that  Federal-wide and agency-specific policies and practices for recovering from cyber events are  inconsistent and vary in degree of maturity.  In recent years, the Federal Government has  prioritized protecting its assets and detecting threats.  As an increasing number of threats are  detected, the Federal Government must begin to improve both its response and recovery  capabilities.  Recent events have demonstrated the need for policies or plans related to  recovery from cyber events to remain flexible to better allow agencies to respond to and  recover from evolving and sophisticated threats.  To date, there have been a number of Federal-wide policies and standards that provide  guidance as to how agencies should recover from cyber events.  For example, the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework for Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity identifies “Recover”, which includes the sub-categories of Recovery Planning, Improvements, and  Communications, as one of its primary Functions.  Additionally, numerous controls within  NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4 address elements of recovery controls and  capabilities that agencies should address.  OMB also published OMB M-07-16:   Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, which provides guidance to agencies as to how they should protect against data breaches and  respond and recover when one occurs.  Despite the existence of available standards and  guidance, there remains room for improvement.   The CSIP initiates the following actions to help agencies rapidly recover from incidents when they occur and accelerate adoption of lessons learned from these events.      a. The CSIP directs NIST to provide guidance to agencies by June 30, 2016, on how to  recover from a cyber event, focusing on potential scenarios to include, but not limited to, a data breach or a destructive malware campaign.  b. The CSIP directs OMB to update OMB M-07-16 by March 31, 2016, to reflect current  best practices and recent lessons learned regarding privacy protections and data breach  standards.  This updated guidance regarding the collection and disposal of PII will help  agencies ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations for the protection of this  sensitive information.   c. To complement these efforts, the CSIP also directs OPM within 3 months to review  options and develop and deliver to OMB recommendations for making Identity  Protection Services a standard Federal employee benefit.       Page 18 of 21      IV. Objective 4: Recruitment and Retention of the Most Highly-Qualified Cybersecurity  Workforce Talent the Federal Government Can Bring to Bear   Human Resources Strengthening Federal cybersecurity is not possible without the appropriate talent. The Federal workforce must keep pace with the growing dependence on technology for mission  essential activities.  A well-functioning security organization requires a blend of technical,  policy, legal, and leadership resources covering multiple disciplines within cybersecurity.  A  focus on any one skillset without an understanding of overall organizational needs can lead to  failure.  The Cybersecurity Sprint identified two key observations related to the Federal  cybersecurity workforce:  1) the vast majority of Federal agencies cite a lack of cyber and IT  talent as a major resource constraint that impacts their ability to protect information and  assets; and 2) there are a number of existing Federal initiatives to address this challenge, but  implementation and awareness of these programs is inconsistent.  The CSIP initiates the  following actions to address these challenges in recruiting and retaining a high-quality  cybersecurity workforce.  These initiatives will inform a broader Cybersecurity Human  Resources Strategy to be published by OMB within 6 months, which will help ensure the  Federal Government can recruit, develop, and maintain a pipeline of cybersecurity talent  throughout the Federal Government.  a. The CSIP directs all agencies to participate in the following efforts: i. OPM and OMB will compile existing Special Hiring Authorities (by agency) that   can be used to hire cybersecurity and IT professionals across government. OPM  will clarify legal guidelines and provide guidance to agencies on how to increase  the understanding of these Special Hiring Authorities, and how agencies should  work with their human resources departments to implement them, where  appropriate, and rapidly close talent gaps and accelerate hiring by December 31, 2015.  ii. Agencies will participate in OPM’s existing Special Cyber Workforce Project, which provides cybersecurity job codes by specialty, so that agency leadership  can identify the universe of their cyber talent, understand Federal-wide challenges  for retaining talent, and address gaps accordingly.  Agency CIOs, working  collaboratively with Chief Human Capital Officers, should use this assessment to  identify their top five cyber talent gaps, which will be due to OPM and OMB by  December 31, 2015.  b. The CSIP directs DHS to begin piloting their Automated Cybersecurity Position  Description Hiring Tool across the Federal Government.  DHS is also directed to develop  and report on performance and adoption metrics so that agency leadership can better  understand how to leverage the tool. Used in concert with relevant OPM Position  Classification Standards, the tool will assist in the implementation of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework by consistently mapping the  NICE job codes according to selected skills and KSAs (Knowledge, Skills and Abilities).  The tool enhances cybersecurity workforce recruitment by decreasing the applicant time-       Page 19 of 21      to-hire and by ensuring cybersecurity job announcements contain clear, technical content. DHS must also post their own internal Cyber Workforce Analysis results on the CIO  Council Knowledge Portal by November 30, 2015, as a best practice for other agencies  to leverage.   c. The CSIP directs OPM, DHS, and OMB, in coordination with NIST and other NICE partner agencies, to map the entire cyber workforce landscape across all agencies using  the NICE National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and identify cyber talent gaps  and recommendations for closing them within 6 months. The mapping exercise and  recommendation report should focus on:  i. Existing employees and open positions, starting with the civilian agencies, this  assessment should also consider contractor resources.  ii. Existing resources and open positions within the DoD and the IC, this assessment  should also consider contractor resources.  iii. Changes to human resources processes and systems that not only incorporate best  practices for retaining and incentivizing employees, but simplify and expedite the  hiring process.  iv. Capacity building actions to assist human resource professionals in their efforts to implement CSIP recommendations.  v. Training and professional development opportunities for the existing workforce in  order to address critical needs.  vi. Leveraging the National Science Foundation CyberCorps® Scholarship for  Service and the Advanced Technological Education program to help inform potential educational programs to help develop a pipeline of students from  colleges, universities, and other providers.  vii. Driving awareness of cybersecurity internship opportunities and programs that  establish the possibility of hiring participants into permanent positions.  viii. Creating and deploying “Tiger Teams” comprised of subject matter experts from  across the Government to address critical workforce needs.  d. The CSIP also directs OPM, DHS, and OMB, in coordination with NIST and other NICE  partner agencies, to develop recommendations for Federal workforce training and  professional development in functional areas outside of cybersecurity and information  technology that support cybersecurity efforts within 6 months.  These recommendations  should address, at a minimum, the following functional areas: legal counsel, budget,  procurement, privacy, and civil rights and liberties.       Page 20 of 21      V. Objective 5: Efficient and Effective Acquisition and Deployment of Existing and  Emerging Technology  Existing/Emerging Technology As stated above, the CSIP acknowledges the need for a defense in depth approach, or a  layering of people, processes, procedures, and tools, to achieve a more secure Federal  landscape.  This section describes the steps the Federal Government must take to provide  agencies with the appropriate technological toolset to adequately secure the functions,  systems, and information enabling their missions.  The Cybersecurity Sprint Team observed  that the Federal Government has made strides in the incubation and adoption of emerging  technology for cybersecurity purposes through innovation and incubator programs, to include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Innovation Office (I2O), the  DHS Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), in particular the  Transition to Practice (TTP) program, and the NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace  (SaTC) Transition to Practice (TTP) program.  Furthermore, Federal agencies have adopted  existing commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) technology through programs like  EINSTEIN and CDM.  In addition to these incubators, the NIST National Cybersecurity  Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is a public-private partnership that fosters innovation and  accelerates the adoption of secure technologies for the public and private sectors.  However, the connection between these programs and the agencies in need of existing and  emerging technology must be strengthened.  The Cybersecurity Sprint identified a need for a  Federal-wide technology assessment followed by a comprehensive program to assist agencies  with the procurement, assessment, certification and accreditation of existing and emerging  technology.  The CSIP initiates the following actions to address the challenge of acquisition  and deployment of existing and emerging technology:  a. OMB, in coordination with NSC, and OSTP, will convene a working group comprising  representatives, as appropriate, from DHS, GSA, NIST, DOD, and the CIO Council, to  develop recommendations for strengthening and better coordinating the collective ability  of Federal civilian departments and agencies to identify, acquire, and rapidly implement  innovative commercially-available cybersecurity products and services. The working  group will deliver its recommendations to the Federal CIO and NSC Coordinator for  Cybersecurity by March 31, 2016.  b. The CSIP directs GSA to develop a procurement capability to allow Federal agencies to  access the technology at any known Federal technology incubator, to include, but not  limited to, the NCCoE, I2O, and DHS HSARPA by December 31, 2015.  c. The CSIP directs the Federal CIO Council to create an Emerging Technology Sub- Committee under the ISIMC by December 31, 2015 that will be responsible for  facilitating efforts to expediently deploy emerging technologies at Federal agencies.  This  group will provide requirements, challenges, and feedback to both incubators and  agencies.        Page 21 of 21      d. The CSIP directs GSA and DOE, in coordination with the Federal CIO Council, DOD,  ODNI, DHS, and the NCCoE, to establish a working group that will identify and connect  current testing environments for new technology solutions and submit recommendations  for establishing new testing environment solutions to OMB no later than December 31, 2015. Additionally, GSA will establish formal protocols for agencies to utilize these  shared testing capabilities and share results broadly for promising technology solutions  with potentially broad applicability.  e. The CSIP directs the DHS CDM Program to work with the NCCoE to develop solutions  and guidance related to CDM including providing technical guidance, best practices,  sample implementation plans, and capability assessment methodologies within 2 months.  f. The CSIP directs the NCCoE, in addition to their existing priorities, to focus on derived  credentials solutions and other strong authentication solutions for mobile devices as a  critical component of a broader effort to improve mobile device management.",

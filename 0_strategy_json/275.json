Gonsalves P a g e | iii ur country has not been immune from the challenges facing the world today, whether it is the impact of a weakened global financial market or the reduction in tourist visits to the Caribbean. We are faced with a contracting agricultural sector due to the loss of preferential prices for our bananas and other products. There are many limitations to our small size and economies of scale as with other Small Island Developing State’ (SIDS) emerging economy. However, there are also advantages to our size in the ability to more easily implement critical proven innovations on a national scale. More- so the technologies of today, whether it is the mobile telephone, the Internet, the high speed global communications infrastructure, user friendly and easier-to-adapt software applications, or the ever-more powerful and affordable computers, have been changing the world and creating opportunites for countries like ours to leap frog and overcome the challenges of size, location and time. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have changed the way the world works and re-defined how countries trade and interact with their citizens and with each other. ICTs have created the opportunity for us to create a new vision and to build a new future for our people, our children and our country. The National 20-25 Plan has set a goal of becoming a Modern, Competitive, Multifaceted, Post-Colonial Economy which is local, national, regional, and global in its approach. St. Vincent & the Grenadines (SVG) had developed an ICT Strategy and Action Plan 2002 -2007, and I am pleased to state that we achieved most of our goals. We have recognised the importance of carefully crafting a National ICT Strategic Plan which will take our country to 2015. We understand the need to build international relationships and to respond to the pressures of globalisation; and, therefore, I want to assure you of our country’s commitment to the creation of a knowledge-based and smarter society. Our Ministry for Telecommunicatioins, Science, Technology and Innovation is mandated to ensure that our country is in the best possible position, in all sectors, to capitalise on the enabling capabilities of ICT. As we look to build and strengthen our service industry, ICT is going to play a vital role and the Caribbean is in an excellent location to offer a range of services like off-shoring and developing and promoting its creativity, culture and rich local content. The Ministry is looking to mould local ICT entrepreneurs with its various programmes and workshops, providing the necessary tools alongside business advice. We expect that the business community will rise to the occasion and grow the emerging ICT sector so that it makes a greater contribution to the national economy. We also recognise the importance of having a broad concensus on how ICT can be used to support our national development effort and as a consequence, this National ICT Plan has been developed through the efforts of a large number of people who participated in our Sector Working Groups. These Working Groups utilised the expertise and experience of both the public and private sectors and, O Prime Minister and Minister of Telecommunications, Science & Technology Dr. Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves PREFACE St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | iv therefore, took a holistic view of the programmes and projects that need to be pursued to 2015. You would see that the Plan addresses both government and the private sectors, and will impact on every citizen within the country and in the Diaspora, and on every business on our islands. Therefore for the Plan to be successful, every business, citizen, government employee and civil society organisation must be on board and working towards the common good of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I am pleased to state that ICT has been given prominance and a high level of priority, and that ICT is ‘moving on’ in St Vincent and the Grenadines. I am very happy to join our people and our country as we accelerate towards a modern competitive knowledge- based and smart society as we seek to support the national development aspirations of our people. Foreword: Dr. Honourable Jerrol C Thompson P a g e | v ost strategies are designed to offer solutions to ‘problems’. These strategies are delivered through frameworks and techniques that often necessitate the execution of costly experimental ‘trial to decide’ approaches to achieving developmental goals. This approach may offer substantial benefits by increasing the awareness of the specific role played by market forces in shaping the environment and, thereby providing a plan of action to address the ‘problem’. This gain infuses economics into the strategy, draws on theory to support empirical evidence. While offering some short-term benefits, the strategy automatically narrows to a competitive game plan and nothing more, achieved through the application of the popular SWOT analysis framework that produces a breadth of options at the expense of required depth. This means significant quantities of time lost in the formulation process and minimal implementation focus - more about getting a range of ideas delivered at the outset than a living strategy over time. It tends to be created in isolation ignoring the imperative role of stakeholders in formulating and implementing the strategy. Alternatively, the strategy formulation process adopted within the National ICT Strategy and Action Plan 2010 - 2015 is not just a conceptual framework based on a utopian idea; but a practical roadmap to an improved way of life for the country, and for its downstream benefactors and beneficiaries alike. Through the exploitation of the unique benefits offered by ICT, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has an unprecedented opportunity to transform our country into a knowledge- based society. At the heart of this strategy is ‘purpose’, complemented by a much more practical and less philosophical approach to ICT development. Indeed, leveraging on the ‘purpose’ and successes of the National ICT Plan 2002 to 2007, the launching point is re- defined based on three (3) main areas of focus for ICT development – infrastructure; content; and training. This approach to ICT development ensures that the new National ICT Plan is set within the local context. It also incorporates people, process, and technology - the three prerequisites for successful transformation of the country through ICT investments. The successful execution and continuity of the short, medium, and long term strategies proposed in the new Plan means the role of the ‘Strategist’ is significant, arduous, and of a permanent nature. This calls for a level of e-leadership that is inseparable from the most senior level of the Ministry, Private Sector, Civil Society and beyond. Indeed, the Strategist/e-Leader must recognize the strategic significance and implications of each ICT investment being contemplated and the opportunities it presents, viewing them through the lens of the whole, even as those with lesser responsibilities may be seeing the same issues parochially. In other words, the e-Leader must be the champion of ICT transformation who drives the implementation of government-wide ICT M Director of Telecommunications and Special Projects Dr. Jerrol C. Thompson FOREWORD St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | vi initiatives with a constant eye on the alignment with overarching national development objectives. Such decisions define the leadership capabilities required. As such, the functions of the Strategist must never be outsourced. Moreover, the strategies contemplated are not a permanent fixture; but require a regular review mechanism to guarantee their validity, relevance, and importance. Acknowledging that change is a welcome constant with a view to transform the economy through ICT, ongoing benefits can only accrue through a diligent perpetual monitoring and refresh process. This highlights the importance of the establishment of a new, refreshed National ICT Plan that incorporates the changing domestic, regional, and international environmental factors that require consideration based on potential implications of the current course of action. With this in mind, the recommended strategies and the articulation of future strategies are the primary enablers of innovation, sustainability, competitiveness, technology and socio-economic development. These strategies are never stand-alone; but are meant to integrate seamlessly to each of the relevant programs within the Public and Private sectors including education, social, and economic programs, and regional and international initiatives. I am, therefore, very pleased and excited to lead this National ICT Plan to successful implementation.

ICT has already transformed many parts of the world by reducing or negating the impact of time, space, and size. For countries such as Singapore and Malta, it has become less and less important where they are located in the world or their size in physical terms. Despite their limited physical resources, they now have the ability to produce goods and services that are considered desirable by other countries of the world. Their size and island status no longer determine the quality of the service that they deliver to their citizens, businesses, and visitors. What these countries have done over the past decade, is to embrace and adapt ICT for their own use and to create a sustainable competitive advantage. They have motivated their citizens and businesses to take advantage of the enabling capabilities of ICT for their own gain, and ultimately for the benefit of their countries. The Global Context Internationally there is agreement on ICT development goals, including those in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of Implementation. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) which took place in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis established a Plan of Action. One of its chief aims was to bridge the so-called global digital divide separating rich countries from poor countries by spreading access to the Internet in the developing world. The ITU, through the WSIS goals, is also seeking to leverage ICT to advance developmental goals. The ultimate outcome is the building of a framework of an all-inclusive and equitable information society. SVG’s ICT Strategy and Action plan in line with the WSIS action line items focuses on, among other things, ICT infrastructure, access, capacity building and economic development. Additionally, SVG’s Strategy and Plan is well timed to benefit from this global emphasis being placed on ICT and can expect significance guidance and insight from other global bodies such as OECD and non-OECD governments, private sector actors, civil society organisations, regional and international organisations as they work together to accomplish the goal at hand.

International and regional cooperation INTRODUCTION St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 12 On a Caribbean regional level, CARICOM in collaboration with its stakeholders has developed a Regional Digital Development Strategy (RDDS) which addresses the implications of international treaties, regulations, standards and trade agreements, and pressing development/digital divide issues, e.g. WSIS. The broad Caribbean regional goals included commitment to: Collaborative leadership, Research and Innovation for Sustainability, and Key social and economic development measures and objectives. These objectives included: 1. ICTs used to provide a supportive environment (business, regulatory, soft and hard infrastructure), for learning, working and social development 2. Education and lifelong learning environment established to support use of ICTs at levels of community, business and government 3. Creative use of ICT and a framework that is anchored in cultural industries, to encourage innovation The Regional Vision: An inclusive Regional Knowledge Society driving sustainable development incorporated a number of objectives. The Broad Regional Strategic Objectives  To fully establish modern regional regulatory and open telecommunications infrastructures with affordable networks using converged technologies, to provide affordable and ubiquitous access  Build a digital Community culture and increase the value and volume of the region’s trained ICT workforce that can create with, develop and use ICT to improve life style and otherwise add personal and economic value  To manage and use ICT to demonstrate good governance and increase efficiency in operations  To establish a culture of innovation and quality, and to enable sustainable production of Regional digital goods and services, the development of cultural industries and the inclusion of local content in delivery of information  To guide businesses and governments to use ICT for sustainable growth and support social development objectives through partnerships that use networked technologies The OECS Sub-Region has developed an ICT strategy and has already developed a robust regional regulatory framework in ECTEL governed by a council of Telecommunications Ministers and national NTRCs. Through the EGRIP project, the OECS is developing the capacity to manage its e-Government initiatives and to strengthen the integration movement. This will build on the wider Caribbean regional effort on collaboration, create economies of scale, improve efficiency of administration, and ensure social inclusion and people participation. The OECS’s efforts have now turned to filling the gaps, monitoring the implementation and bringing more significant benefits of telecommunication liberalization and ICT to the people of the sub-region. Fortunately, SVG can take advantage of the international experience and lessons learnt from countries like Barbados, Estonia, Malta and Singapore, to create its own unique ICT-enabled opportunities, and accelerate its national social and economic development. SVG can use ICTs to promote the core tourism, agricultural, and cultural attributes that the country is known for. It can improve the internal efficiencies and effectiveness of its ministries and agencies for the benefit of the country. It can use technology to create new electronic service delivery channels via the telephone and the Internet so that citizens will not have to travel to urban areas to obtain much needed government services. Knowledge can now be codified and used for individual and national development. SVG can derive the known benefits of being a knowledge based society that is linked to the global information economy. In this context, it is useful to consider SVG’s recent history of ICT planning and implementation. In 2002, the country’s first five- year ‘National ICT Strategy and Action Plan’ was adopted by Cabinet after public consultation. A series of short term and long term goals were identified in the plan which included the complete liberalisation of the telecommunications market, and the development of a robust regulatory framework which included ECTEL and NTRC. However, over the last ten years, there have been substantial technological advancements, including the emergence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and the resultant convergence of technologies. There have also been dramatic changes in the economic, financial, and geo-political make-up of the The Regional Digital Plan of Action addresses, among other things: Access, Connectivity and Internet Governance; Capacity-building and Sustainability Business, Trade, Culture and Disaster Management; and Policy Formulation and the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Implementation ICT4D Statistics Introduction P a g e | 13 Caribbean and the world with significant changes in attitude, usage, and demand by citizens, in particular youth, for new technological opportunities, training, greater transparency and social inclusion in the governance decision making process. These changes warrant a complete review and refresh of the national (and related regional) ICT strategy, and hence the need for an updated National ICT Strategy and Action Plan for SVG. This Plan must outline the mechanisms, including the enabling policy framework, and the programmes and projects that need to be implemented over the 2010 to 2015 period. It should define the way forward and proposes an implementation framework based on the local and international experience. Therefore, the broad policies and strategies to be outlined in the updated National ICT Plan must include:  Streamlining the existing telecommunications regulatory process for more cost effective regulations of utilities (and possibly energy) and enacting the required legislation and regulations to embrace ICT  Ensuring there is a robust modern national next generation and regional ICT infrastructure which does not just meet, but exceeds international standards and the demands of investors in order to attract and draw them and to bolster our level of competitiveness. It must include the redundancy and innovation which can help to leapfrog any unnecessary stages and enable national development  Ensuring a high percentage of households, government agencies, schools and businesses have access to adequate broadband access  Leveraging the increase in mobile telephone penetration through the use of a suite of mobile government applications and e- government initiatives to improve efficiency of government and bring significant service improvements  Enhancing the use of ICT in all sectors with an emphasis on education, health, agriculture and tourism  Complementing the expansion of broadband access with increased access to computers at tele-centres, schools and community facilities, and implementing strategies which increase personal computers or laptops for students  Ensuring that computer and internet usage is safe by addressing issues of cybercrime  Empowering business and trade through the use of ICT in e-commerce  Expanding training at all age levels with emphasis on bridging the digital divide by using ICT in education, the creation of skilled workers and advance training to produce ICT engineering and knowledge workers  Facilitating the creation of local content, new appropriate software applications and the creation of a Vincentian and regional knowledge economy  Developing and becoming known for an ICT export sector which feature the export of unique ICT and electronic goods and the export of ICT services However, before determining what needs to be done in the future, it is important to determine what SVG has achieved and defining where it is starting from. It is also critical to review the international best practices and to extract relevant experiences that will assist SVG in moving forward. The re-launching point is therefore reviewed based on the best available national statistics and an assessment of performance against the 2002–2007 Strategic ICT Plan. It took into account selected international best practices and trends. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 14 This Page left Blank Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 15 Vincent and the Grenadines is an archipelago in the Eastern Caribbean Sea comprising of 32 islands and cays. SVG is spread over 340 square kilometres. The population is concentrated in St. Vincent itself and dispersed across other islands such as Bequia, Union Island, Canouan, Mayreau, Mustique, Palm Island, and Petit St. Vincent. The country is a traditional small open economy which is highly susceptible to external economic shocks and natural disasters such as hurricanes. It relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, and construction as the major contributors to the economy. The population, estimated at 106,000 in the 2001 census and 118,000 (estimated) in July 2009, has a flat growth rate with migration matching natural growth. Unemployment was officially estimated at 15% and the country has a per capita GDP of US$ 5,335 (2009). The total labour force has been estimated in 2009, as 53,888. Foreign direct investment and domestic investment account for some 32% of GDP, which grew from just over US$ 1 billion in 2003 at an annual growth rate of about 11%, to an estimated US$ 1.5 billion in 2007. The country’s mainstay continues to be agriculture, predominantly bananas, which contribute about 50% of the total goods exported. However, over the last few years, agriculture and particularly the banana industry, declined significantly due to the erosion of European Union (EU) preferential market access for bananas, the impact of negative weather shocks, and disease. Despite the introduction of better irrigation and upgraded infrastructure, banana export earnings and volumes continued to fall, from EC$ 89.51 million in 2003 to EC$ 28.83 million in 2004. Agriculture is being gradually replaced by improved growth in the services sector - largely through developments in tourism. The % contribution of the agricultural sector to Real Gross Domestic Product fell from 11.66% in 2002 to 9.28 in 2006. The country’s main revenue is now determined by the level of tourism receipts and some foreign direct investment, and as such, the expansion of the tourism sector is being accelerated as part of the national development agenda. SVG has a small manufacturing sector and a small offshore financial sector. Fisheries and manufacturing production have also expanded and are contributing to economic growth. 1.1 NATIONAL STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2002-2007 Recognising these challenges, Government has for many years been actively pursuing the development of alternate mechanisms to promote economic development, including the use of ICT. In 2001, the Government of St. Vincent & the Grenadines developed its first National Strategy and Action Plan 2002 – 2007. During the development process, assessments were conducted to establish the status of ICT development In SVG. Some of the resulting highlights are now presented below. Governance is a critical pillar of any national ICT plan. With the change in Government on 28th March 2001, a new Ministry for Telecommunications, Science, Technology and Innovation was established. Government appointed an Information Communication Technology Advisory Council (ICTAC) as the lead advisory agency on development and implementation of ICT. Both of these organisations are critical contributors to successful implementation. By 2002, the regulatory framework for telecommunications was well underway. An agreement was achieved with the incumbent, licenses were issued and regulations published. The regulator began pursuing internal capacity building and engaging in knowledge transfer. St. “Strategies for the use of ICT are not universal. St. Vincent and the Grenadines faces different circumstances, financial means and priorities and will need a specifically tailored strategy. Nevertheless a strategy that focuses its ICT interventions towards achieving developmental goals is more likely to achieve marked socioeconomic development.” DEFINING THE RE-LAUNCHING POINT St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 16 As a result of the policy to open up the telecommunication environment, domestic business activity has increased and lower prices have resulted as the once ‘monopoly provider’ moved their rates to address the growing competition. The 2002 assessment recognised the significant absence of formal legal and regulatory frameworks governing e-commerce, within SVG and across the region. It was recognised that collaboration within the OECS was highly desired in addressing this aspect of commerce. It was noted that relative to other developing countries, SVG and the OECS region as a whole had a significant comparative advantage through high levels of literacy and trainability in their workforce. The Ministry for Telecommunications, Science, Technology and Innovation and ICTAC has begun building on this base through the important step of increasing the level of computer literacy of the school-going population. It was noted that apart from niche markets such as call centres, data processing centres and online gaming, the supply of ICT products and services was a small aspect of the SVG economy. It was recognised that in most areas of the private sector, ICT was in the early stages of adoption. This ICT strategy focussed on ICT as an enabler of development rather than the development of a definitive ICT Export Sector. The role of Government in utilising ICT to address its need for improvements in internal efficiency and effectiveness, while simultaneously demonstrating to its constituents the benefits as a “model user”, was acknowledged in 2002. The need for the banking sector to support the growth of e-business by addressing existing financial impediments was noted, as was the need for SVG to move ahead with its planned Fiscal Incentive Act. In the context described above, a Framework for Action was created to illustrate how to use and support ICT-based development. The Framework took a holistic and multidimensional approach to strengthening the synergies between the different developmental components that can be impacted by ICT. See Figure 1 which follows. Using this Framework as the basis, a number of actions (see pages 18-21), short term goals and longer term goals were developed which form the 2002 – 2007 Plan. During the periods, 2002 - 2007 and 2007 - 2010, these actions and goals were addressed with varying degrees of success. Their completion was assessed as part of the development of this current 2010 – 2015 Plan, and the factors underpinning the completion rate were determined. These outputs were used to create a Performance Scorecard for the execution of the 2002 - 2007 National Strategy and Action Plan. The Scorecard provides a good summary of progress from 2002 to 2010 and is outlined below. THE MINISTRY FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION It is advisable to undertake aligned interventions in a number of ICT strategic areas including: Coordinated actions, strong partnership and local implementation This requires a greater focus on the interplay of the different components and a coordinated action among diverse stakeholders and an inclusive policy. The process will address barriers and resistance, put in place transitional mechanisms to address trade-offs and create positive incentives to change, needs and opportunities. Global, National and Local Linkages The Global network economy creates new opportunities for nations and communities. National ICT strategies must be positioned within the global context, while at the same time addressing the local context.

In defining the re-launching point and in completing the current situation e-assessment, the success of these short term Actions and longer term Actions were considered, and some important ACTION ITEMS were identified. These ACTION ITEMS inform the strategies and tactics to be utilised in moving forward in 2010 and beyond, and will now be considered alongside the 2010 current state assessment. Additionally, best practices in the context of SVG will be presented as these inform the re-launching strategy. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 22 1.2 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ICT ADVANCEMENTS The telecommunications infrastructure of a country is a foundational element of its ICT agenda and is a fundamental building block of a national ICT plan. As such, it is instructive to review some key telecommunications indicators for SVG and to assess how this defines the re- launching point for the 2010 – 2015 national ICT plan. SVG is fortunate to have a relatively young population, with some 51% being under the age of 25 years, as it is generally acknowledged that young people have the most potential to embrace and innovate with ICT. So not surprisingly, given the tough economic realities, Government embarked on an aggressive and comprehensive ICT and Private Sector Development Programme to increase the country’s efficiency and competitiveness. Recognising the nexus between ICT and national development, Government sought to develop a comprehensive National ICT Plan for the development and operation of the ICT sector itself, and for using ICT to enable other sectors, including government, over 2010 to 2015. SVG’s telecommunications infrastructure is relatively well developed and has improved substantially over the last decade. Fixed line penetration has been relatively stable, moving from 22.75% in 2004 to a peak of 23.43% in 2008, and settling at 22.24% in 2009. NTRC reports about 22,777 main telephone lines as of July 2008, shared between the two fixed line providers. This represents a total number of landlines to total number of households of about 54.6%. The % of fixed line subscribers over the last five years are shown in Figure 2 above. The rate in EC$ for ‘fixed line to fixed line’ during peak hours has stabilised, moving from $0.09 in 2004, to $0.07 during the period 2005 to 2008, and rising to $0.08 in 2009. ‘Fixed line to mobile’ has fallen over the period 2004 to 2009, from $0.81 to $0.70. Mobile penetration has grown tremendously - 54.7% over the last 5 years, from 65.9% in 2004 to a high of 120.6% in 2009. There are now about 121,114 mobile users in SVG. This growth is due to government’s strategic management of the sector which saw a new entrant entering the market in 2005 and the introduction of prepaid services. More than 90% of current mobile customers use prepaid services. Mobile handsets are now available at prices comparative to markets in the USA. Figure 3 illustrates the rapid growth in mobile penetration rates over the period 2005 to 2009. ‘Mobile to mobile’ calls have stayed relatively constant at $0.85 for the new entrant, rising to $0.86 in 2009. On the other hand, the incumbent’s rates fell from $0.99 (2004) to match the new provider in 2006 and 2007, eventually falling to $0.63 (2009). ‘Mobile to fixed line’ moved from $0.88 in 2004 to $0.98 in 2009 for the new entrant. While the rates fell from $0.79 in 2004 to $0.63 for the incumbent. SVG is clearly experiencing the benefits of well-managed competition. 59.57 64.94 89.27 112.46 120.6 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Mobile Penetration rates (%) 2005-2009 21.68 21.61 22.49 23.43 22.24 0 25 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Fixed line Penetration rates (%) Figure 2: Fixed Line Penetration 2005 – 2009 Figure 3: Mobile Penetration Rate 2005 – 2009 Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 23 Internet penetration increased by about 200% over the period 2004 to 2009, growing from 4.29% to 12.30%. There are now about 990 Internet connections in SVG representing a 20% growth as compared to a 30% growth reported for 2008. Expansion in the Internet market was again fuelled by an uptake of fixed broadband service; the number of fixed broadband subscribers increased some 22% but was offset by a 24% reduction in dial-up subscribers. Fixed broadband subscribers accounted for 97% of all fixed Internet subscribers, up from 92% previously. At the same time, the cost of Internet broadband fell significantly over the same period, from a cost of $299 for 256 kbps to a rate of $79 per month for the minimum speed offered to residential customers of 1 Mbps. There are presently three licensed fixed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in SVG which offers one or more of the following: ADSL broadband, dial-up access, and high speed Internet access via cable modem. Mobile Internet access is via ordinary mobile subscription using GPRS and EDGE rather than through a separate subscription for mobile broadband as true mobile broadband through 3G networks is not yet available to users. This made it very difficult to determine the true number of mobile Internet users in SVG as any subscriber with a GPRS or EDGE ready mobile phone can browse the Internet. Users with a pre-paid mobile subscription can access Internet service for $0.01 per kbps while post-paid users have access for $40 per month. Network speed and quality are generally regarded as good across the country. DSL, ISDN, ADSL, Leased Circuits (frame relay) and Dial-Up service are available. The initial cost of access to the Internet for the residential customers averages around EC$ 219, with a recurrent cost averaging EC$ 90 per month for unlimited access. For commercial customers, the initial cost averages around EC$ 343. Subscriber complaints per 100 connections are about 17%, and generally ISPs attend to 40% of these complaints within 24 hours. In addition to an estimated 18 Internet cafes, about 200 free or subsidized Internet access points are available across the country. Based on national import figures, it is estimated that personal computers (PCs) per 100 inhabitants averaged 43.5% over the period 2005 to 2009. It is therefore clear that citizens have reasonable access to the technology necessary to access on- line government services and information on the Internet, as tele-centres and Internet cafes are contributing significantly to making the Internet available to those who cannot afford personal access at home, or who do not have access from school, or at the workplace. However, such facilities are less common in the rural areas of the country as compared to availability in the urban communities. Though this figure appears to be moderate showing that citizens can access online government services and information via tele-centres, Internet cafes and from home, much more needs to be done to ensure that greater Internet access is available to every community including the rural areas of SVG. Figure 4: Internet Subscribers in St. Vincent and the Grenadines Source: ECTEL/operators-with estimates where ECTEL did not receive data from operators St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 24 This is critical to supporting the proposed national ICT initiatives to be implemented across the country. Cable TV is available through a single cable TV operator whose distribution network currently connects about 13,789 households or about 64.2% of all households. The cable TV operator now offers digital TV alongside the analogue version. Another provider is also poised to offer IP TV. FM broadcasting facilities are widely available with about 13 stations in current operation. AM broadcasting infrastructure has been put in place and will be re-activated in the coming months. TV broadcasting covers about 70% of the island. There is no local manufacture or assembly of ICT equipment in SVG, and local dealers / agents import ICT products - mainly from the USA. Most of the software used by the public and private sectors is imported. The use of open source products is limited but growing. The Government is committed to increasing its broadband penetration and usage and has conducted extensive research on the provision of laptop computer devices to students of primary and secondary school age. In the exploration of several avenues, an offer has been made by Portugal to supply students in St. Vincent and the Grenadines with laptops. A rationale has been developed which shows that this is a viable project which is consistent with the growing trends towards laptop usage and greater mobility for continued learning. Figure 5 indicates a significant increase in the number of laptops entering St. Vincent and the Grenadines during 2009. Figure 6 shows the amount of desktops and clearly shows a shift from desktops to laptops even though the desktop market is still larger than laptops. Several factors may have contributed to this emerging trend as laptops are more affordable and there is an increase of wireless Internet access at both domestic and public areas. The ICT sector’s contribution to GDP has been relatively stable, moving from 10.6% in 2004 to 10.7% in 2009, with a low of 10.2% in 2005. Investment in the sector varied from EC$ 33.8M in 2004 to EC$ 25.7M in 2009, with a low of EC$ 19.6M in 2005. The sector grew in direct employment from 147 in 2004 to 162 in 2009, despite the current challenges in the global economy. The ICT sector therefore remains an important contributor to the economy. Figure 5: Laptops entering SVG 2000 -2009 Source: NTRC Universal Service Fund Annual Report 2009 Figure 6: Desktops entering SVG 2000 – 2009 Source: NTRC Universal Service Fund Annual Report 2009 Action Item: To enhance access to Broadband and facilitate the use of ICT and e-Government applications by communities, the USF will facilitate an additional 8,000 household broadband connections to exceed 50% penetration by 2015 and subsidised computers / laptops. Students will receive a special price for broadband connections. Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 25 Figure 7 shows a constant level of investment as the country has marginal increases and decreases in GDP. It has been observed (see Figure 8) that revenues from the telecommunications operators has been on a steady incline since 2002 and reached the one hundred and fifty million mark in 2007. However in 2008, there was a slight decrease in the revenue received. This decrease was possibly due to the onset of the global economic crisis which has impacted most sectors in SVG. The revenue generated in 2009 was slightly higher than 2008. 1.3 THE POLICY, LEGAL & REGULATORY FRAMEWORK May 2010 marked the 10th Anniversary of the ECTEL Treaty which presented a joint, harmonised, cost-effective approach to telecommunication regulations in the OECS, consistent with the thrust towards regional integration. ECTEL strongly supports the work of the National Regulatory Telecommunications Commission (NRTC). The NRTC was established with the passing of the Telecommunications Act 2001. It regulates the telecommunications industry in SVG and is guided closely in its activities by the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL). NTRC’s responsibilities include telecommunication regulation, technical and broadcasting regulation, licensing and fee collection, setting of technical standards, interconnection and dispute resolution, price regulation and providing advisory services to the government on telecommunications matters such as anti-competitive practices. It represents government in international telecommunications organizations and agencies, and ensures compatibility with the standards of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). On the other hand, the Ministry for Telecommunications, Science, Technology and Innovation, through its Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), manage ICT in the public sector. It is responsible for ICT policy, ICT services, standardization and awareness of ICT within SVG. The NTRC is responsible for managing the Universal Service Fund (USF) which was established under Section 42 of the Telecommunications Act of 2001. This fund is intended to compensate telecommunications providers who are required to provide universal service. This service is typically Internet access and telecommunications to schools, hospitals, clinics, community and Learning Resource Centres, public voice telephony to rural communities and underserved areas, facilities for the differently abled, and provision of some maritime services. The USF is funded by payments made by telecommunications providers according to the Telecommunication (Universal Service Fund) Contribution Order 2008 which was gazetted on 22nd April 2008, with retroactive effect from 1st January 2008. The USF regulations were gazetted on 16th September 2008, and the Figure 8: Investment of Companies in Telecoms Source: NTRC Annual Report 2009 Figure 7: Telecommunications Investment and Revenue in SVG 2004 –2008 Source: ECTEL/Operators (includes estimates where ECTEL did not receive data) St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 26 Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund) Guidelines 2009 provides for its management and usage. The USF was expected to accumulate EC$ 2.7 million by end 2009, of which EC$ 2.593 million will fund USF projects directly. Considerable work is in progress, including a country-wide survey, to determine priority projects for implementation from 2009 onwards. In order to promote the use of ICT for education, health and economic development, the Government has set goals of 70% for Households access to broadband, 80% access for Businesses and 100% access for Public Facilities - by 2015. However, the current goals of the USF have been identified as shown in the Table 1 below. 2010 USF GOALS # Goal 1 Introduce Internet Broadband services at the community level in each of the major communities north of the Dry River and north of Coull’s Hill (to achieve a 70% household penetration) 2 Outfit public institutions (health facilities and police stations) throughout SVG with computers and Internet access 3 Outfit public institutions with an emphasis on police stations with extra phone lines 4 Increase the cellular coverage in the Fancy, Sandy Bay, Overland and Owia villages 5 Place payphones along the main roads of all major communities throughout the island 6 Improve the maritime coverage of VHF and cellular phones around SVG 7 Increase Broadband penetration to households. 8 Improve access to computer devices for students and individuals. Table 1: USF Goals for 2010 Notwithstanding the good progress made under the Telecommunications Act of 2001, Government has recognised the urgent need to manage the converged communications environment, in particular to encompass electronic communications. A new Bill is under development in coordination with ECTEL Member States, and is titled, ‘Electronic Communications Bill’. It will replace the Telecommunications Act. The new bill is aimed at bringing ICT under the existing regulatory process, allowing a liberalised and non-discriminatory entry into the electronic communications sector and enabling a robust competitive environment in which there is fairness, transparency and accountability on the part of the regulators of the sector. Government has recognised the need to strengthen the internal capacity of the NTRC and the Ministry for Telecommunications, Science, Technology and Innovation, and has therefore embarked on a telecommunications skills enhancement project at a cost of EC$ 512,068. Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 27 Good progress has been made with the introduction of legislation that enables the use of ICT for national development. For example, the Electronic Transaction Act of 2007 provides for the facilitation and regulation of electronic communications and transactions to prevent abuse and misuse of information systems and to provide for related matters. It addresses the legal requirements for electronic transactions, electronic signatures, accreditation, cryptography providers, consumer protection, protection of critical information systems, liability of service providers, cyber inspectors, information systems and computer related crimes, and procedural powers. There have been workshops on the establishment of a regional Certification Authority which in a cost effective manner can approve the licensure of cryptography providers and accreditation electronic signature providers. The Information and Communication Technology Services Investment Incentives Act, 2007 encourages and facilitates investment in the information and communication technology services sector, and stimulates employment in, and the development of, the private sector of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines by: Reducing impediments to investment in the information and communication technology services sector Providing appropriate inducements by way of tax reduction and other incentives specifically designed to encourage investment in the information and communication technology services sector. Adopting measures which are calculated to transfer technology and increase the rate at which the information and communication technology services sector is developed and expanded. The ICT legislative framework was enhanced by the introduction of the Small Business Development Act of 2007 and the Consumer Protection Act of 2008. A new Small Business Development Policy was approved and adopted by cabinet in 2010 and in view of the new global environment; a new Small Business Development Act was drafted to be enacted in 2010. A new Investment Act is also being developed to replace the Fiscal Incentive Acts No 5 of 1982, in order to be in compliance with WTO mandates. Action Item:  Enact the new Electronic Communications Act to replace the Telecommunications Act 2001.  Enact the new Electronic Communications Act currently under consultations to replace the Telecommunications Act of 2001. This will recognise the trends of convergence of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and the various forms of Technology.  Approve regulations for ICT Incentive Act, Electronic Transaction Act and establish a Regional Certification Authority St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 28 In addition to the Acts identified above, the regulatory framework is quite robust and includes: Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund) Regulations 2008 Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund Contribution) Order 2008 Telecommunications (Licensing Classification) Regulations 2002 Telecommunications (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2007 Telecommunications (Licensing Classification) (Amendment) Notice, 2002 Telecommunications (Fees Regulations) 2007 Telecommunications (Fees Amendment) 2008 Telecommunications (Licensing and Authorisation) Regulations 2007 Telecommunications (Private Network Licensing) Regulations 2002 Telecommunications (Tariff) Regulations 2004 Telecommunications (Interconnection) Regulations 2008 Telecommunications (Spectrum Management) Regulations 2007 Telecommunications (Numbering) Regulations 2008 Telecommunications (Confidentiality in Networks & Services) Regulations 2002 Telecommunications (Terminal Equipment & Public Network) Regulations 2002 Regulations have also been developed for the Money Services Act. The East Caribbean Central Bank is establishing an Automated Clearing House (ACH). In a modern, competitive, post colonial Caribbean era, the nature of SVG’s continued existence depend heavily on what the country can produce and market on the international market, but the cost of interconnecting and doing business is very expensive. It is imperative that new and existing technologies be adapted in order to bring about solutions; and in this particular case, the establishment of a National Internet Exchange Point (IXP). The primary purpose of an IXP is to allow networks to interconnect directly rather than through one or more 3rd party networks. The advantages of the direct interconnection are numerous, but the primary reasons are cost, latency, and bandwidth. Traffic passing through an exchange is typically not billed by any party. However traffic to an ISP's upstream provider is; and in SVG’s particular case all local ISPs buy bandwidth from a transit provider in the United States. At present an email from the Prime Minister to another member of government sitting across the hall must travel the route SVG, Barbados, Antigua, Miami and back before it reaches him. The case of moving the relevant IXP from Miami to St Kitts, a reduction from 6,000 miles (round trip) to perhaps one mile, the decrease in distance is so dramatic that cost can be minimized to near zero, while speeds can be increased from some multiple of STM-1 to 1 GBPS or 10 GBPS. A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale to domestic customers, without demanding significant corresponding capital or operational investment. This would make more bandwidth available for important activities such as video streaming and telemedicine and increase the national penetration of Broadband Internet. An IXP will also add more value to projects like CKLN, EGRIP and the Intranet Backbone. It will also make available a logical place to locate, and hence attract, other Internet infrastructure resources, such as top-level name servers, time servers, performance measurement tools, and research projects. It is clear that SVG is at a disadvantage in the absence of a neighbouring IXP, and that this shortcoming needs to be addressed urgently. A direct interconnection (often located in the same country or region) avoids the need for data to travel to other countries outside the region to get from one network to another, thus reducing latency and the possibility of attack from cybercrime. The third advantage, speed, is most noticeable in areas that have poorly developed long-distance connections and this is absolutely critical for web services, telemedicine and video conferencing, etc. ISPs in the Caribbean region normally pay between 10 or 100 times more for data transport than ISPs in North America, Europe or Japan. Therefore, Caribbean ISPs typically have slower, more limited connections to the rest of the internet. However, a connection to a local IXP may allow them to transfer data without limit, and without cost, vastly improving the bandwidth between customers of the adjacent ISPs. Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 29 With the continuing depletion of available IPV4 addresses, a new version of the Internet Protocol was created called IPV6, also known as IP Next Generation (IPNG). Among other things, this version seeks to address the main issue of exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or hosts. The introduction of this version means that SVG will have to take stock of what exists and with its ICT National Plan see how greater use of the initiatives can be implemented bearing in mind IPV6 will soon be adopted around the world. 1.4 WORLD BANK SURVEY: DOING BUSINESS IN ST. VINCENT & THE GRENADINES The business sector in SVG can take advantage of ICT for internal improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, and equally important for interacting with Government. Recent (2007 & 2010) World Bank Surveys provide useful insights into how ICT is currently used by the business sector and makes suggestions as to the services provided by Government that can be improved. The World Bank assessment uses ten (10) distinct criteria shown in Table 2 below. It is useful to review some of the relevant World Bank results and recommendations, which inform the ICT current state assessment process. Action Item: Establish National Task Force with Public, Private & Civil Society Stakeholders to: 1. Install an IXP in SVG 2. Public Awareness on Cyber Security 3. Public Awareness on IPv6 Transition IPV6 has a large address space of 128 bits compared to 32 bits of the version 4. It addresses issues such as improving the quality of service required for some new applications like IP telephony, video/audio, interactive games or ecommerce which can be delivered over the network. This version easily deals with the avoidance of network traffic, loss of data or bandwidth. In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the following benefits: 1) Increased address space 2) More efficient routing 3) Reduced management requirement 4) Improved methods to change ISP 5) Better mobility support 6) Multi-homing 7) Security 8) Scoped address: link-local, site-local and global-address space Criteria St. Vincent & the Grenadines 2007 OECS Average 2007 St. Vincent & the Grenadines 2010 i.

In dealing with licences, St. Vincent ranked first. However, in starting a company it ranked 29th, registering property 101st, paying taxes 32nd and closing a business 151st. In subsequent years, additional developed countries have been added to the World Bank survey, and a number of innovations have not been captured by the World Bank, resulting in a fall in some rankings of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2010. The World Bank went on to make several specific recommendations for improving the competitiveness of SVG, which on review, provided a good assessment of the current challenges facing the business sector. Government has commenced action to implement all ICT and other non-ICT recommendations with the goal that SVG’s level of competitiveness, ease of doing business and ranking will improve to be placed within the top 30 nations. The ICT initiatives that have been put in train include: Computerising of CIPO to enable to starting a Business on line Digitizing the Land Registry records and introducing on-line access to title searches and survey plans Introducing on-line tax payments Continually improving ASYCUDA World - customs data and clearance system – to facilitate movement of goods There are therefore clear opportunities for improving the current usage of ICT by the business sector of SVG, and for upgrading the ICT-supported services provided by the public service to this important sector of the economy. Action Item Make Solid advancements to the ten major recommendations to raise the competitiveness of SVG. Introduce the mechanisms to effectively report on these advancements Table 3: ICT Recommendations to Improve Competitiveness CRITERIA SOME ICT RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS Starting a business Computerise records and introduce electronic name search Reduce the number of procedures Dealing with licenses Consolidate project clearances and provide information to builders on line to improve transparency.

Enforcing contracts Closing a business Amend Bankruptcy Act Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 31 1.5 THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND ICT IN PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM 1.5.1 e-Government Broadly speaking, e-Government is the use of ICT by a government for the provision of information and services to its citizens and businesses. This normally includes the efficient internal management of such information, better service delivery through electronic delivery channels, and greater citizen empowerment through easier access to information and more participation in public policy decision-making. It is useful to measure the state of readiness of countries with respect to e-government as such benchmarking enables countries to learn from each others’ experiences. One such measure is the Global E- Government Readiness Index which has been assessed for many United Nations (UN) member states. The Index includes an assessment of the state of website development within the public sector of a country, the state of the telecommunications infrastructure of the country, and finally the capacity of the people of the country to use the available technology for their own benefit as measured by their level of education. As such, it is a composite Index created from the Web Measure Index, the Telecommunication Infrastructure Index and the Human Capital Index of the country. It is further noted that e-Government includes several types of electronic interactions, namely: government - to - government (G2G), government - to - business (G2B), business- to -government (B2G), government-to-citizen (G2C) and finally citizen-to- government (C2G). While the other forms of interactions are important, the United Nations Global Survey is limited to the G2C and C2G aspects of e- Government. However, any comparative measurement of G2C and C2G includes some assessment of G2G since improvements in G2C and C2G are closely linked to G2G improvements. Table 4: UN Global E-Government Readiness Index 2007 Details of the results for the Caribbean are shown in Table 4 above. Unfortunately, St. Vincent & the Grenadines and other OECS states were not benchmarked in 2007. It is noteworthy that the highest ranked Caribbean countries are newly ranked Barbados at 40th, Jamaica (45th), and Trinidad and Tobago at 68th. The rankings for the region show an encouraging upward trend which SVG aims to replicate. It is useful to consider some other relevant international rankings for ICT and related areas. Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 32 1.5.2 E-Readiness and Assessments The 2007 network readiness assessment completed by the World Economic Forum is a useful measure. Details of the results for the Caribbean are shown in Table 5 below. It is noted that St. Vincent & the Grenadines ranked 98th in 2007, falling ten places from its ranking in 2005. It is further noted that SVG ranked 10th in the Caribbean out of 13 countries surveyed in 2007. Table 5: The 2007 World Economic Forum Global IT Report: Network Readiness Index (NRI) 1.5.3 Challenges to e-Government E-Government has the ability to impact the governance of a country and to influence the organisation of the public sector itself. A heavily centralized and controlling decision-making structure in government is antithetical to an emerging environment that is decentralized and horizontal and in which power, resources, and information are widely distributed. The latter environment is often that desired by the people of developing countries. Rigid hierarchical and prescriptive accountability mechanisms do not provide the flexibility required to develop policy and to adjust service delivery to meet changing circumstances or local realities of SVG. More collaboration and connecting with citizens and businesses will put public servants in the public eye and make them less anonymous. Managers and executives therefore must pay greater attention to career development, succession planning, value-added labour relations and other basic human resource management practices to ensure public officers are treated as a strategic resource. E-Government can therefore impact the foundation of public sector institutional frameworks, and consequently be challenging to get right despite its obvious benefits for all stakeholders. The need to interconnect the public sector has been recognised as a priority and Government is making progress with the development of an intranet. This project is aimed The Networked Readiness Index (NRI) measures the propensity of countries to leverage the opportunities offered by ICT for development and increased competitiveness. In the most current report, 122 economies globally participated in the assessment. It also establishes a broad international framework mapping out the enabling factors of such capacity. It examines the preparedness of countries to use ICT effectively on three dimensions: 1) General business, 2) Regulatory and 3) Infrastructure Several countries have set the pace with the strategic use of ICT, in particular the Nordic countries. Their success is strongly linked to having a very strong focus on education, thus enabling the establishment of highly efficient educational institutions and a culture of innovation; and having transparent and well- functioning public institutions. This has resulted in a business-friendly environment with a strong readiness to adopt the latest technologies. Denmark's outstanding levels of networked readiness have to do with the country's excellent regulatory environment, government’s e-leadership in leveraging ICT for growth, resulting in impressive levels of Internet and PC usage, e-government and a dynamic e-business environment. A well- developed internal market, an emphasis on education and Research and Development (R&D) and a talent for pioneering applications and technologies have laid the basis for the development of a first-league high-tech industry. Estonia, stands out for its impressive progress within the space of a decade in networked readiness and general competitiveness, driven by an efficient government ICT vision and strategy. Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 33 at electronic connectivity between all ministries and agencies within the public sector, at a current anticipated cost of EC$ 566,347 for the first Phase. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) assisted the Government with enhancing SVG’s official website. The development of a single entry government Web Portal is now being developed with assistance from the Government of Taiwan through the establishment of an ICT Centre. This project when completed will enable new portal functionality. SVG uses ICT as an enabler of economic development and in the growth of its ICT Business Sector. Essentially there are four (4) quadrants of activities which must be integrated to create a modern and dynamic ICT Sector. This comprises (1) a robust regulatory system; (2) adequate training of the human resource; (3) appropriate and relevant e-government initiatives, and; (4) building a vibrant innovative and creative ICT and business sectors including the promotion of businesses to adopt ICT. The effective management and coordination of the projects and ICT initiatives in this sector will increase efficiency, provider quicker transactions, ensure better trained citizens, reduce costs, increase revenue collection and spur greater business activity and competitiveness. 1.5.4 Key Role of the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD) The Information Technology Services Division (ITSD) is the main ICT policy, advisory and technical maintenance services provider to the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The Division is headed by a Director who is the Chief Technical Advisor on Non-Regulatory ICT matters. Several major functional Units are integrated under the ITSD banner (refer to Figure 9 below) as follows: 1. The Web and Internet Content Unit designs, maintains and promotes the Government’s and national web presence. The Unit maintains the Government Web site consistent with the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The Intranet is geared to providing public servants with a range of electronic services which improve efficiency 2. The E-Mail, Internet and Intranet Network Services Unit provides public servants with professional email, Internet and Intranet services and a means for information to be disseminated throughout the Public Service and through which clients can communicate with officials 3. The Government Video-conferencing Services Unit 4. The Computer Repair Section which services computers throughout the government service 5. Development and upgrading of new software application and content creation where required by departments or where deemed necessary; and providing advice to ministries on the appropriateness of ICT & THE BUSINESS SECTOR The challenges are to separate out the many forces driving changes to this sector, to identify the critical trends from the false starts, and to piece together a big picture out of the many new visions. There are some emerging trends that cannot be ignored which include: 1. The hot technologies with the greatest promise 2. The best practices needed to harness all this potential 3. The challenging blend of new paradigms 4. Fresh ideas and disruptive technologies and tactics needed to exploit and manage them 5. Green IT and its impact on society. 6. The megatrends – business acceleration, the commoditizing of IT, the new agility and beyond 7. The macro forces – standardization, globalization, super powers & sleeping dragons 8. The new IT responses – virtualization, convergence, search, the rise of IP 9. The upstart ideas – social networking, virtual world economies, social analytics, and user-generated media Action Item: Make solid advancements in 10 major recommendations to raise the competitiveness of SVG and introduce the mechanisms to effectively report theses advancements.

This Centre will provide equipment and expertise implementing advanced cyber-security measures, and the construction of a new government wide web portal through which citizens can access many on-line government services. The Taiwan ICT Centre will work with the ITSD in the implementation of the Government’s e- government initiatives and provide advice and assistance in training and building the ICT capacity of other government agencies. for the development of applications, 1.7 ESTABLISHING ICT STANDARDS As part of its current investment initiatives, SVG has begun the process of establishing standards and guidelines which will ensure that the country meets international best practice and is attractive for new businesses in the ICT sector. The Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC) outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that design and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. SVG has commenced action to ensure that these standards are applied and complied with in the near future. Another focus area of Government is ensuring that businesses exhibit strong ‘corporate social and environmental responsibility’ behaviour by ensuring that they understand the compelling need to act now. SVG is commencing action to let local and international businesses know that the country is firmly supportive of protecting the environment; and that Government is willing to work with industry to ensure that their CSER is met. Furthermore, Government has acknowledged that the following factors, from an ICT perspective, have informed their strategic thinking: INITIATITIVES & PROJECTS PROPOSED FOR THE TAIWAN ICT CENTRE 1 Development of a comprehensive Government Web Portal 2 Full implementation of a Police Records Information Capture and Management System 3 Establishment of a Government Data Warehouse 4 Enhancement of the Government Intranet 5 Training and Human Capacity building of Public Servants in the Management of ICT applications Electronics Industry Code of Conduct This Code outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that design and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. It notes that: 1. Suppliers must provide their employees with a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with all 2. Suppliers are required to uphold the highest standards of ethics 3. Suppliers must comply with all laws and regulations on bribery, corruption, and prohibited business practices Corporate Social & Environmental Responsibility (CSER) “CSER is the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community, environment and society at large.” Businesses must be both “profitable & responsible”. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 36 Being environmentally-friendly is beneficial for both ICT and the enterprise A sustainable ICT strategy is good commercial practice ICT initiatives can and must lead in being more environmentally responsible Technology and ICT strategies can make efficient operations and save cost Energy consumption is an important area of focus for the ICT manager The need to share what other organisations are doing in SVG to comply with their CSER SVG is currently moving aggressively to making the country ICT-friendly for the business sector. 1.8 WEB PORTAL (GOVERNMENT) The Government is currently in the process of developing a new Government Web Portal, with planned deployment by the end of 2010. This electronic facility will enable Government to place information on-line in a form that meets the evolving needs of citizens and businesses. It will provide ministries and agencies with the capability of presenting content to the public that will support some of the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It will allow a proactive approach to responding to the needs of the FOIA. Government has also indicated its intention to build this portal based on Web 2.0 technologies, business models and current usage patterns. It is anticipated that this strategy will support greater user participation and more open business processes. The Portal: New Home for Web 2.0 'Mashups' in the Organisation or Enterprise. Web 2.0 is the next generation of technologies, business models, and usage patterns of the World Wide Web. Some of the major features of Web 2.0 are: Greater user participation - User-generated data and metadata, and user-centric designs Openness - Transparent processes, open application programming interfaces (APIs), and open-source software and content Lightweight, rather than heavyweight, technology - Scripting languages, asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax)-based user interfaces, representational state transfer (REST)-based interaction protocol, RSS-based syndication and HTML-based micro-formats. Decentralized, distributed process - Ad hoc \"mashups\" of Web sites building on public APIs; bottom-up, bazaar-style development; and content tagged by locally defined \"folksonomies,\" rather than one global taxonomy Web 2.0 will have a direct effect on enterprise portals, but this impact will start in the consumer world. Eventually, Web 2.0 mashups will appear in the enterprise, facilitated by portals Action Item: Construct a new Government Web 2.0 based Portal Expand the Government Backbone to the rural areas Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 37 1.9 SUMMARY OF INITIATIVES IN THE ICT ENVIRONMENT The Figure 10 below summaries the various initiatives being pursued by SVG and the region around four quadrants, namely: • Effective Regulatory Services • Well Trained Human Resources • E-government Initiatives • Business Development It is clear that there are a lot of ICT initiatives being pursued across SVG. This current suite of initiatives, once managed well, will create a formidable strategic thrust and become a significant enabler of development and enhanced competitiveness for the country. The successful implementation of these current and proposed initiatives is critical both in defining the re- launching point, and in guiding the pathway and pace of the re-launch. However, it is important to assess the resources available within SVG to support these initiatives and to identify any critical gaps that must be addressed. It is also important to consider how ICT is utilised in the other (non-ICT) sectors of the country. Figure10: Summary of the Existing ICT Initiatives St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 38 This Page left Blank Current Usage by Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 39 2.1 JUDICIARY overnment is utilising justice software, JEMS – Judicial Enforcement Management System, to facilitate the administration of the Courts. This application software supports all types of court cases, payments, warrants, sentencing, docket scheduling, and forms/reports generation. The various registries (Civil Registry, Electoral Registry, and Commerce and Intellectual Property Registry (CIPO)) have been computerized, but needs to be integrated. 2.2 FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION Standard Integrated Tax Administration System (SIGTAX) is used to manage tax collection, while Automatic System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) World supports Customs. SMARTSTREAM is utilised by the finance departments of Government. 2.3 AGRICULTURE Work is in train on the development of a national agriculture production and marketing information system to provide market information and intelligence to the agricultural sector. 2.4 HEALTH SVG has about 97 Medical Doctors, 298 Registered Nurses, 13 Dentists and about 47 Pharmacists, with a 2009 Health Budget of about EC$ 71,607,805. The country is home to a School of Nursing and to an Off-shore Medical College. A draft national strategic plan exists for health for the period 2007–2012. The stated goal of the sector is to improve the health status of the people through enhancing and expanding public health services, expansion of secondary services, improving the quality of and access to the services, and improving the decision making capacity of the sector. The current challenges in the health sector include chronic non-communicable diseases, insufficient funding, the ineffective management of inventory, the excessive need of overseas referrals, insufficient statistical information on the appropriate utilisation of services and G CURRENT USAGE BY NON-ICT SECTORS Action Item: Launch NAPMIS Train Farmers and Extension Staff in the use of Information Systems and ICT in Agriculture Action Item: Make solid advancements in 10 major recommendations to raise the competitiveness of SVG and introduce the mechanisms to effectively report theses advancements Action Item: Create and Launch a well designed Web-2.0 Government Portal which allow sector stakeholder participation and centralised standards Draft Policy 26th June 2009 St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 40 supplies, and inadequate staffing including key specialisations. The sector is required to respond to an increase in the elderly and a decreasing birth rate. There are 39 clinics, 5 rural hospitals, 1 mental hospital, 1 private hospital, and 1 general hospital (Milton Cato Memorial Hospital - MCMH). Community care is provided through the clinics located across the country. Each clinic serves about 3,000 people and is easily accessible. Health centres are well staffed and provide a wide range of services, including midwifery, family planning, immunization and emergency care. Some computers are available at the Ministry, MCMH, and 4 district clinics. However ICT is now being introduced into various institutions and into the heath sector on a larger scale, including the provision of patient administration and medical records. A major project, the National Health Information System, is expected to restructure and re- engineer the business processes at the hospitals and clinics and is anticipated to cost about EC$ 2.3 million. A new fibre optic cable was laid to connect the Ministry of Health with the MCMH. Telemedicine is being used at the MCMH. The mass media, particularly radio, is used to disseminate information to the public at large. With a new Diagnostic Hospital being built at Georgetown, three regional Poly-Clinics being built at Stubbs, Mespotamia and Buccament, and a new Milton Cato Memorial Hospital proposed for the Arnos Vale Airport Site after 2012, the connectivity between these institutions will present a major challenge. 2.5 EDUCATION Formal education is provided at three levels: primary education (seven years), secondary education (five years), and tertiary education (two to three years). Specialisation starts at secondary level where programmes are offered from general / academic and extends to the tertiary level. There is currently no curriculum incorporating IT at the primary or secondary level. Formal education relating to IT or computer science is only available at the tertiary level. The process of acquiring hardware and connecting schools to the Internet has accelerated over the last 3 years. According to the statistics available from the Ministry of Education (MOE), about 34 educational institutions have Internet connectivity via computer labs - which includes 18 primary schools and 12 secondary schools. The total number of students in SVG’s educational system is 32,338 which include 3,426 pre-schoolers, 15,532 in primary schools, 11,688 in secondary schools and 1,692 in private schools. While most institutions have Internet access via the principal office/lab, the number of students per PC in these institutions is 55.6 which are not optimal. The number of students with Internet connectivity is 9.7 per 100 primary school students and 6.4 per 100 secondary school Action Item: Launch HIS to track patient records, diagnostic tests, discharges summaries, medications, medical supplies, and laboratory results & health trends Education Technology A complex set of forces now drives the uptake of educational technology: 1. Government policies are driving more educators to tailor their instruction to the individual needs of students 2. Important constituency groups expect to see technology used in the classroom 3. Online learning offers a solution to the challenge of increasing access while maintaining cost 4. Significant factors impede the more substantive adoption of educational technology 5. Popular support has waned for using technology as a tool to reform education institutions 6. Technology purchases must compete with other priorities for increasingly scarce budgetary resources 7. Moving to the next level of technology adoption requires significant and difficult behavioural changes Educators are increasingly sophisticated consumers of educational technology: 8. The most appealing solutions will provide compelling evidence of their effectiveness 9. Seeking the benefits of standardization, institutions will migrate from point to enterprise-wide solutions 10. The acceptance of vendor-hosted solutions and other delivery options will grow in the market Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 41 students. It is therefore clear that the technology in the education system is not adequate for supporting acceleration in the utilization of ICT for national development, and in fact, is unlikely to even meet the current demand. It should be noted that budgetary constraints have been the main limiting factor in making ICT available to MOE. However, three (3) major initiatives will significantly improve or provide additional infrastructure, namely: • The EU-funded ICT in Education Project • The use of the Universal Service Fund to enhance connectivity for school and household access to wireless broadband • The Laptop Project which will enable a level playing field Figure 11 below illustrates the global trend of students to computers. Within this context, the Ministry of Education (MOE) embarked in late 2007, on an Improvement of Education through the use of Information and Communication Technology Project. This project is funded by the European Community (EU) to a maximum of 12.1 million Euros of the total cost of 13.27 million Euros. The operational implementation phase of the project is expected to be completed by 31 December 2011, and closed by 31 December 2013. The purpose of the project is to improve the quality of education at all levels nationwide by creating opportunities to use ICT in innovative ways, including its integration into the pedagogy of the teaching/learning processes. ICT IN EDUCATION PROJECT 1. New wireless computer labs in all 20 Secondary Schools 2. New wireless computer labs in 43 (70%) of Primary Schools which have the infrastructure and space for computer labs 3. Ten (10) laptops for each of the remaining twenty (20) primary schools (which do not yet have the physical space for a computer lab) 4. Each school will receive innovative whiteboards, a projector and two teaching laptops for teachers to use ICT, internet and power-point presentations to prepared and teach certain subjects 5. Teachers will be retrained to use ICT to teach specific courses 6. The development of an on-line SVGeNET 7. The Project will construct three new high tech, state-of-the-art lecture theatres at the Community College to accommodate 1,000 students. It will also construct ICT labs and install Distance Learning Equipment for on-line degree courses Figure 11: Global Trend on Student to Computer Ratio STUDENT LAPTOP NETBOOK PROJECT 30,000 Netbooks will be distributed to Primary, Secondary and Community College Students free. 1.

SVGeNET will be used to facilitate teaching and learning St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 42 2.5.1 Project Scope The education project has three focus areas, namely: 1. Improved educational management, administration and governance through the incorporation of effective strategies 2. Improved quality of basic education, and technical and vocational education and training, through the integration of ICT 3. Improved infrastructure at the SVG Community College to include ICT-enhanced facilities It also supports the development of knowledge- based systems, SVGeNET, electronic document management, and information-driven decision making processes in the MOE. It includes hardware, software, computer networks, projectors, academic software, furniture and equipment, teacher training, and a modern Lecture Theatre and ICT facilities. The project includes maintenance of the procured infrastructure. When this project is completed, it is anticipated that the people of SVG will have the sustainable provision of learning opportunities for all. They should therefore be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for creating and maintaining a productive and innovative society. Training of the people who are currently employed in the area of ICT has also been recognised as a priority. The need to increase local competitiveness and the employable of the local labour force is being addressed by the National Information and Communication Technology Training Project (NICTTP). This project is in progress at a cost of about EC$2,655,174, and is aimed at providing a cadre of trained persons with various levels of computer skills. An adjunct to the massive expansion at schools and learning institutions is the use of the network of Learning Resource Centres (LRCs) Community Centres and Libraries. The Modern National Library will be a shining example of ICT in usage and virtual Libraries. 2.5.2 Human Development The state of human development in SVG is captured in the statistics from the 2008 UNDP Human Development Report shown in Table 7. Table 7: Human Development Statistics for SVG 2.5.3 National Centre Technological Innovation (NCTI) The NCTI was established as a State Company in 2006 and won the contract to implement training under the NICTTP. It conducts training at the advanced level at its main facility in Kingstown and basic computer literacy at the network of Learning Resource Center labs in each constituency. Human Development Index 0.772 Combined gross enrolment ratio in education (%) 2007 68.9 Adult illiteracy rate (% aged 15 and above), 1999-2007 11.9 Female combined gross enrolment ratio (%), 2007 70.3 Public current expenditure on primary education per pupil (PPP$US$) 1,227 Public expenditure on education as a percentage of total government expenditure, 2000 – 2007 16.1 Action Item: Launch SVGeNET to track student records, tests results reports, requisitions for supplies, repairs and other communications between teachers, principals and the MOE. Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 43 The NCTI is also expected to conduct training in software development at the new Centre of Excellence (COE) at Diamond. This training will focus on training talented individuals in the creation of a new wave of innovative web- based software applications including entertainment and games for mobile phones, and to meet the needs of the private sector. 2.5.4 Centre of Excellence (Diamond) The Center of Excellence (COE) also provides services for ICT enterprises to be nurtured in resident, outreach and virtual incubators. There will be a focused drive to link the COE with other regional and international Centers of Excellence to facilitate the process of transfer of appropriate technology. The COE will establish strategic alliances with the Government of India as part of a Windward Island (OECS) initiative which will provide state of the art ICT equipment and trainers. Other strategic alliances will be sought with the COE to enable a global reach. The various ICT training initiatives currently in train in SVG within the education sector has been summarised in pictorial form in Figure 12. It is clear that the strategic value of ICT in this sector has been recognised across the various educational institutions of the country. Close coordination and alignment of these various initiatives will aid tremendously in ensuring that the benefits anticipated are in fact achieved in this sector. Figure12: Spectrum of Public Sector Training in ICT in the Education Sector (From Primary School to Advanced Training) Centre of Excellence, Diamond St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 44 2.6 ICT & EMPLOYMENT Information and communication technology skills have become increasingly fundamental for workers beyond the ICT sector itself. It is now desirable that lower wage, lower skill workers have basic ICT skills to enhance their employability. For example, auto repair, retail and health care are industries where incorporation of ICT into their workflows has raised the skills bar for workers. However, despite the importance of having a basic knowledge of ICT, it is only part of the answer to job preparation. It is clear that soft skills, such as interpersonal communication, teamwork, and work attitudes or habits, are also essential for employability. In essence, lower wage, lower skill workers face multiple barriers, many of which are more complex than simple unfamiliarity with email or word processing. Therefore ICT literacy cannot be isolated from the larger social and personal context that exist globally and in SVG in particular. Soft skills as well as solutions to challenges such as childcare, transportation, time, and appropriate attire are critically important. Social ties and personal networks are also recognized as crucial to finding a job and succeeding at work. Notwithstanding the importance of other factors, SVG has begun the process of ensuring that the lower wage, lower skill workers have equitable access to ICT training and exposure. 2.6.1 Freedom of information The Freedom of Information Act was passed in December 2003. This Act extends the right of members of the public to access public information about the operations of public authorities. Information about the rules and practices of public authorities which will affect members of the public must be readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices. Under this Act, the members of the public have the right to access information in documentary form which is in the possession of public authorities limited only by expectations and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by public authorities. Also, this Act creates a right to bring about the amendment of records containing personal information that is incomplete, incorrect or misleading. 2.6.2 Privacy A side effect of being connected is the need to protect the privacy of the individual. This issue is closely linked to cyber security since in recent times databases containing personal information on thousands of persons have been compromised. This is an issue that affects the individual, large corporations, and public institutions. There are instances where some of the larger ICT companies collect personal information to support targeted marketing to their advertisers. There is therefore a balance that needs to be struck by public sector policy makers in the creation of privacy legislation. This must be balance with the general requirements of the FOIA, and is an issue that is even more acute for small countries like SVG. The Privacy Act for the Public Sector was passed in 2005. A Privacy Bill for the Private Sector is yet to be enacted and is required to complete the suite of enabling legislation. Action Item: Introduced a program which provides subsidised laptops to each student in St. Vincent and the Grenadines Action Item: Establish Strategic Alliances between the COE and an International Company with sufficient technical depth, training capacity and global reach to make the COE a premier training institution and creator of software applications Action Item: A suite of ICT related legislation will be enacted: Electronic Transaction Act; Data Protection Act; Electronic Crimes Bill; and Electronic Evidence Bill A program of Child Online Protection will be promoted. Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 45 2.6.3 Cyber Security The challenge of security is the ultimate side effect of a well connected society. The more connected SVG becomes, the more opportunities are created for individuals who wish to commit cyber crime. Developing countries have to be careful to not underestimate the security threat posed by being connected. In parallel with the many initiatives being taken in SVG to get connected to everyone and to the world, must be the completion of projects to protect such connectivity. This requires national projects which involve educating and training all users. It will involve new legislative measures and new investigative units within the security organisations of the country. As cyber crimes can be committed in any country from any country, it is important that SVG works closely with external agencies and establish the necessary bilateral and multilateral instruments to make investigations and trials as easy as possible. Work has commenced in SVG to address the cyber security challenge, but much remains to be done. Government has recognised that the initiatives being undertaken to provide universal connectivity to the Internet creates other challenges that must be addressed in moving forward. To some extent, some initiatives are already in train in this regard. The Internet, by default, allows anyone to post anything on any subject for anyone to access anywhere in the world, unless specific effort is made to try to restrict this. This fact creates two areas of concern for SVG on the issue of content. The first issue is that of content that is created specifically for a criminal purpose; and the second issue is content that can lead to the programming of young minds that can lead to criminal and other non-productive behaviour in the future. The control of content is a sensitive issue, especially in democratic countries such as SVG. There is a delicate balance that must be made between controlling content and the right of the individual to access content of their choice. SVG is currently in the process of creating public policy to address this concern. Equally important is the content on radio and television and its impact on local culture and the young people of SVG. Again, government policy with respect to local content and the nature of content on the airwaves are being developed. 2.6.4 Civil Society The general centralized view of governance and services to civil society has been impacted by the Internet. It is clear that the centre of a country’s social systems and networks is no longer at the figurative traditional central meeting place whether city or village square, but is now at the edges. Individual users have the ability to instantly act both locally and globally, and to interact with consummate ease with huge diverse human networks from the comfort of their homes. Almost anyone in society now has the power to create and distribute diverse content at will. Once it is recognised that power is now in the hands of ordinary citizens, it is recognised that a great opportunity exists to orientate policy initiatives towards a true multi-stakeholder consensus style of non-centralized governance which can revolutionize the public sector by streamlining government services, and which can herald a new dialogue between the state and civil society. The opportunity to mobilize otherwise unrecognised or previously unknown expertise and capability is innovative in itself and government is best placed to spearhead the enabling environment which will generate and disseminate home-grown knowledge at will. SVG will therefore pursue the formulation of national policy which will nurture the human capital of the country. This policy will recognise the enormous potential for ordinary citizens across the social spectrum to contribute to their nation state with an increased sense of security, well being and belonging. The policy will enable the building of a highly creative and innovative society. It will attempt to exercise the minds of the youth so that they are able to partake on level footing with regional and international partners. But the policy will be so crafted to maintain the country’s cultural differences and to enable the dissemination of the uniqueness of its people to others. In order to unleash this national ‘power source of the people’, SVG must mainstream ICT into the The issue of cyber security is not just an issue for businesses and consumers. It is an issue of National Security whereby its effects can shut down the entire country as have been seen in the recent past in Eastern Europe. SVG cannot wait until such events occur in the region, and therefore it is necessary to start planning and putting in place the necessary local and regional institutions to address this issue. The Internet as a tool, rather than a goal in itself, has changed many of the traditional governance models that we have become used to in civil society. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 46 traditional economic sectors where it is recognised that an untapped knowledge pool exists. It is expected that new policies and strategic alliances will need to be created to achieve this objective. Such policies must address the creation of ad hoc community networks within the context of the existing telecommunications regulations which were originally designed to deal with specific legacy issues. The Caribbean has been held up to much criticism for its apparent failure to generate content that is Caribbean-based and which is relevant to its people. However, if the content being created by Caribbean internet users on external networks like Facebook and IMVU and Tagged are reviewed, the talent of the people of the Caribbean becomes very apparent. The opportunity to exploit this untapped capability and capacity is real and significant, and SVG will take steps to make the best use of its people in this regard. Government has recognised the emergence of social networking as having the capacity to significantly raise the level of contribution of civil society. It is therefore planned that SVG will apply these new tools and similar principles to the areas of culture and heritage, local festivals and music. Social networking tools will also be used to simulate discourse on the environment, health and safety, healthcare, and education. E-literacy or digital literacy is core to the creation of a knowledge-based society which is a primary aim of SVG. While many of the towns and villages in the country have the basic infrastructure in the form of resource centres, much more is needed to promote literacy at all levels and ensure that both young and old in the country are given the basic tools to allow them to participate in sustainable nation building. While youth will be a major area of focus, equal emphasis will be placed on senior members of society to ensure that they can use technology for their own development. This is important given the traditional roles that the senior members play in maintaining discipline and social governance in homes, villages, towns and communities. NGOs, sporting associations, and other civil society groupings will also be supported and strengthened through ICT investments. In essence, the innovation that is often inherent in civil society will be supported by ICT. A tailored SVG strategy will be developed to allow education, business and the public sector to partner with civil society to mobilize expertise and capacity to kick-start the generation and dissemination of new forms of knowledge within the country. This will be a transformative and people-centred approach built on ICT-based knowledge centres. In moving forward with the development of civil society, connectivity will be treated as a utility in the same way that electricity and water are utilities that enable modern societies. It is expected that a major proportion of civil society will be connected either at home or via a mobile device. 2.6.5 The Diaspora The National Homecoming and Diaspora Framework for Action 2009 provide recommendations for action on behalf of Vincentians living abroad and those living in SVG. Government has begun planning on the use of ICT to better enhance business relations between SVG and the Diaspora. 2.7 DEVELOPING AN E-CITIZEN CHARTER The development of an e-Citizens Charter along the lines of the document shown in the Appendix 2 is considered an important best practice which SVG will be pursuing. The development of the Charter will be done in conjunction with Civil Society and will include the participation of the Private Sector. The Charter will address the key issues of choice, freedom of information and privacy. Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 47 2.8 THE PRIVATE SECTOR SVG has had a major monopoly telecommunications provider for over 100 years. Since the liberalisation of this sector, two new major providers, a refashioned incumbent, and other organisations have brought major advancements in technology, affordability and value to the ICT Sector. However in order to achieve the true benefits and potential of liberalisation, the entire Private Sector has to be fully engaged, firstly to support the goals and initiatives of connectivity, and secondly to adopt ICT to improve their own internal efficiency, communication and marketing. Additionally, if the Sector fully engages in training of all employees in ICT, it is believed that this will improve their level of competitiveness, sustainability and success. Figure 13 below give some details of the challenges that business typically faces with utilization of ICT, which must be addressed by local enterprises in SVG, if they are to obtain the desired improvements. Developing core ICT skills within the organisation is a priority in ensuring the ICT operations function smoothly. The involvement of ICT leaders in the alignment of ICT and business strategy is also critical to the strategic use of ICT by any organisation. At a regional level, organisations such as the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) and the Caribbean Organisation of National Telecommunication Operators (CANTO) have outlined programmes for connecting the Caribbean, in which partnerships with Governments and Civil Society are seen as critical to success. 2.8.1 ICT for Economic Diversification Under the EU Special Framework of Assistance 2005 Programme, the economic diversification, competitiveness and employment capacity improvement is being pursued for the productive sectors of SVG. The Programme aims to create an enabling environment and human resource pool to support the further introduction and sustainable use of ICT. In fact, the development of this National ICT strategy was supported by this Programme. SVG is pursuing diversification in several areas including agriculture, tourism and ICT, so it is useful to review how ICT is utilised in these sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture is in the process of updating its 1997 – 2006 National Agriculture Development Plan. Within this context, work is in progress on the development of an Agricultural Portal and on the introduction of a National Agricultural Production and Marketing Information System. The implementation of a Geographic Information System is being investigated and a Land Bank Project is expected to be implemented soon. An Organisation of American States (OAS) project is also being pursued with the assistance of the Centre of Enterprise Development to reduce poverty in rural areas by assisting individuals in starting up businesses. Computer Resource and Internet Centres (CORIC) have been implemented in five rural communities to offer free computer access and instruction to citizens of all ages which will aid the establishment of SMEs. The Ministry of Tourism, the Tourism Authority and the National Rivers, Beaches and Rivers Authority are responsible for the development of tourism in SVG. Figure 13: The ICT Challenges faced by Business There is a general perception that ICT leaders of departments and enterprises lack appropriate essential skills to meet the strategic needs of business enterprises and of governments, isolated from the strategy definition phases and relegated to delivering systems and maintenance procedures. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 48 The Ministry has completed a feasibility study on the establishment of Hospitality Institute to be completed by 2012. This Ministry is supported by the main government website which has many of SVG’s attractions available online. SVG is aiming to launch a one-stop shop travel portal by the end of 2010.The tourism sector produces a weekly newsletter, “What’s on in SVG” which highlights weekly events, and which is distributed widely to visitors and hotels. 2.8.2 Investment Promotion in ICT The National Investment Promotion Incorporation – SVG Invest has been mandated to deal with foreign investment including ICT, so that some level of attention is being paid to the ICT sector. The current business community in SVG has been characterised by succession of family ownership and management, heavily import reliant, and resistant to change, concentrated in the retail and distribution trade. It has been suggested that more than 75% of businesses utilise computers. However, e-Commerce activities within the country are limited by the high costs of operating merchant accounts. Work has been completed under the EU/SFA 2005 Business Skills and e-Business Incubators Project, Strategic Alliance Programme (SAP), on the utilisation of strategic alliances on key sectors. The SAP is expected to contribute to the economic diversification and improve the competitiveness and employment capacity of the ICT services, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism sectors through the fostering of strategic alliances between the beneficiary SMEs, local stakeholders, and regional / international partners. For example, the SAP proposes to provide technical assistance in the development of at least three joint e-commerce projects in specified sectors with the participation of about 100 SMEs. It proposes among other things, the development of SVG’s ICT Portal to act as a gateway for the promotion of ICT service providers which would contain the following: Directory of providers Service procurement facility marketplace Delivery of e-learning courses/webinars Central databank of all ICT initiatives in SVG Networking and development of an online community of ICT service providers ICT hub to attract investors Promote SVG as a competitive location for ICT Sector and Service Industries The concept of business incubators is being pursued in the proposed Centre of Excellence and will play a role in supporting the software development business. CIPO, Commercial Intellectual Property Organisation in 2010 will mandate business registration on line with a long transition for the persons who have difficulty with registering business names. 2.8.3 Off-shoring, In-sourcing, Supply Chaining, Customer Care Centre and Foreign Direct Investment There are several Customer Care Centres in St. Vincent in Legal, Medical Transcription and Telemarketing. Substantial experience and lessons have been learnt on the success and failure of attracting such investments. It has become clear that the critical and important competitiveness and quality issues must be addressed in moving forward. These issues include the relatively high telecommunications cost, the choice of technology, quality of management, availability of human resource, and the skills required by potential employees. The relocation of Arnos Vale Airport to Argyle provides tremendous opportunity for the creation of a New City, educational and sporting institutions, local businesses, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Regional Organisations and Associations P a g e | 49 VG is committed, actively participating and providing support to most regional ICT initiatives and these must be factored into the National ICT Strategy plan. 3.1 CARICOM SVG is a member of CARICOM which has elaborated a regional policy on ICT. The country is a member of the CTU, ITU, CTO, CKLN, CARICAD, OECS EGRIP Project, ECTEL, OAS (CITEL), COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT, COMSYC and a regional network of TAIWANESE ICT Centres. The linkages are summarised in Figure 14. The interaction between these regional organisations, and coordinating and aligning their activities are critical and involves the National Authorising Officer, National Planning Ministry, EFD, and cooperation of other state and Private Sector Agencies. Similarly the relationship with the major funding agencies of the European Union, World Bank, CIDA, UNDESA, UNDP, UNESCO, CDB and other donors needs to be carefully managed, coordinated and aligned. The support of the regional organisations and the support from the regional organisations are an important part of SVG’s national policy. The highest level of collaboration, cooperation and coordination is required to obtain the best value, synergy and successes from these regional agencies. CARICOM Heads of State, in November 2002, agreed on the need to diversify the economies of the Caribbean through the promotion of new technologies and regional cooperation through the mechanism of Centres of Excellence. The work of these agencies and their relevance to SVG will now be reviewed. 3.2 CARIBBEAN KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING NETWORK (CKLN) The Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network (CKLN) evolved in pursuance of the Network’s implied vision, and to lay the foundation for the development of regional functional cooperation in the area of ICT. S Figure 14: Diagram of SVG’s Regional Links and Associations CKLN ICT in Education & content Creation CTU ICT for Economic Development OECS E-GRIP E-Government for OECS Integration TAIWAN/SVG ICT Support Centre NTRC ECTEL Regulatory Services & USF CARICAD ICT-E-Government In Public Administration Reform SVG CARICOM REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 50 The main objectives of the CKLN are defined as follows: To improve the relevance of tertiary education and training by increasing the number of accredited tertiary education programs recognized internationally for their excellence To strengthen tertiary institutions, foster specialization and knowledge sharing To ensure the convergence of fragmented regional and international initiatives to maximize results in the region as well as for the international market At the 27th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community in July 2006, it was decided to develop a Caribbean Regional Research and Education Network (C@ribNET), coordinated and managed by CKLN to enable the integration of Member States in the world‘s global education and research network infrastructure with the objective of enhancing regional competitiveness and the development of a knowledge-based economy. In this context, the vision for C@ribNET is that of a network of national research and education networks specifically intended to support: A virtual learning environment shared by Caribbean Institutions of Tertiary Research and Education Centres The connection of Universities and other Tertiary Institutions in the Caribbean to the Universities in Europe, North America, Latin America and elsewhere to facilitate research, collaboration and knowledge sharing Support for the Caribbean integration process by providing an enabling environment, through connectivity, in support of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy and the Economic Partnership Agreement Bridging the digital divide in the Region to achieve social cohesion of Caribbean people through digital inclusion C@ribNET will support interactive learning, peer- to-peer exchange and the development of knowledge networks, and cost-effective access to high quality e-learning content and other knowledge resources drawn from the region and around the world. It is expected that the learning offerings made available on the Network are prioritized to the needs of the Caribbean labour market and the cultural and socio-economic context of CARICOM countries. C@ribNET is planned with an initial phase for five years and is projected to be a network of national Research and Education (R&E) networks. It will be available to all public tertiary education institutions in CARICOM member states, including the University of the West Indies (UWI) and institutions in SVG, and expanded to other national public research facilities and other public sector/not- for-profit institutions engaged in research and education in the Caribbean. It is therefore essential for this CKLN’s initiative to be integrated into SVG’s ICT and educational initiatives. 3.3 CARIBBEAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNION The Governments of the Member States of the Caribbean Community, cognizant of the growing importance of telecommunications for the social and economic development of the Caribbean and the need to foster international cooperation and development by means of efficient telecommunications services, established the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) by treaty, on 28th April, 1989. SVG is a vibrant member of the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) and has helped provided ICT leadership in the Caribbean. As a result of convergence of technologies, the CTU has expanded its role and mandate beyond telecommunications to that of ICT. The original mandate of the CTU included: 1. Harmonize telecommunications and ICT policies, laws and regulations in CARICOM 2. Establish a permanent framework for regional collaboration among telecommunications regulators, policy makers and academics 3. Empowering the private sector to take a more active role in shaping policy on Free Trade negotiations and regional integration The CTU has been actively engaged since 2005 in the process of ICT harmonization. It initiated a major project to reform and harmonise regional approaches to spectrum management and a focus on ICT for Economic Development. 3.3.1 Policy Development The CTU has developed several Policy Documents of relevance and interest to SVG, including: Caribbean Spectrum Management Framework Policy informed by a Regional Task Force of policy advisors in The goal of the CKLN is to: ‘Leverage information and communications technology and modern approaches to education to enhance the global competitiveness of countries in the Region, overcoming the constraints of remoteness and scale in tertiary education.’ Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 51 collaboration with regulators, operators and other stakeholders Caribbean Internet Governance Policy Framework Handbook for IPv4 Exhaust and IPv6 Adoption 3.3.2 Capacity Building and Public Awareness The CTU has also conducted 6 Ministerial Briefing Seminars to apprise ICT Ministers of technological developments and the implications for national development and exposed more than 160 ICT stakeholders to Internet Governance issues. The organisation has trained 100 Caribbean ccTLD Managers and students, 180 Spectrum managers and technicians in various subjects in Spectrum Management, and 60 regulators on Numbering 3 Representation. 3.3.3 The CTU in Representing the Caribbean The organisation was responsible for the inclusion of regional projects on the ITU’s World Telecommunications Development Conference Agenda 2007-2011, and actively participates in regional and international ICT fora. 3.3.4 Industry Watch The CTU has brought to the attention of SVG and Caribbean ICT Stakeholders several important issues, including: The potential difficulties posed by mobile operators using foreign Home Number Identification Codes That the Caribbean should be de-linked from Latin America and have responsibility for its own ITU Centre of Excellence nodes in the region The imminent exhaustion of IPv4 Internet addresses and the need for IPv6 adoption by member governments; and the establishment of national advisory bodies to manage this transition and provide adequate public awareness 3.3.5 Technical Support The CTU routinely provides technical support to members and ICT stakeholders in the region. Some of the activities include: ICT Project Funding Proposal preparation Technical advice on ICT matters Review of ICT policy and regulatory documents Conducted Spectrum Field Audits in seven member states The work of the CTU will continue to impact SVG; in particular its regional initiatives identified in Table 8 above, are important for the country. 3.4 CARICAD SVG is also a member of CARICAD which is the region’s lead agency on Public Sector Reform and the use of e-Government. CARICAD has developed a Regional E-Government Policy which outlines the appropriate focus for harmonised E- Government initiatives. The agency provides advice on and continued Public Administration Reform in the advancement of effective public administration. 3.5 EGRIP SVG joined the World Bank funded Electronic Government for Regional Integration Project (EGRIP) in November 2009 with a strongly articulated political will and determination for sub-regional cooperation in the OECS. This cooperation is emphasised in the area of e- government, including the application of ICT for public sector modernisation with an IDA credit of US$ 2.3 million. In particular the focus is on improving competitiveness of SVG, enhancing public sector efficiency, transparency and accountability, developing the private sector, enhancing social inclusion, and facilitating sub- regional harmonisation and integration. EGRIP recognises the CARICOM Connectivity Agenda (2003), the Action-Oriented e-Government Strategy for Countries of the Caribbean Regions 2004-2007, the EU SFA 2005 Programme and CIDA’s proposed Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR). PLANNED REGIONAL INITIATIVES 1 Continuing the Caribbean ICT harmonisation process 2 Establishing the Caribbean Spectrum Management Task Force as a permanent advisory body to Member States 3 Promoting the adoption of IPv6 in the Caribbean 4 Implementing measures to facilitate information sharing between Caribbean Governments under its Connected Caribbean Initiative 5 Providing revenue-generating ICT-related services to augment the inadequate contributions of members Table 8: Regional Initiatives of the CTU St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 52 EGRIP has two main components, cross-sectoral e-government interventions and sectoral e- government. 3.5.1 The horizontal e-government interventions include: Policy and strategy implementation Legal and regulatory framework implementation ICT standards and total cost of ownership optimisation Regional e-government institutional framework strengthening Automated registries and multi-purpose ID systems 3.5.2 The vertical e-government interventions include: E-government in public financial management E-government in tax administration E-government in customs Electronic government procurement E-government in Health, Postal, Roads and other sectors The e-Grip project has a well defined set of deliverables, a major outcome of which is the establishment of a team of technical expertise who can serve the sub-region in maintaining and continually upgrading the e-government systems critical infrastructure and applications. The project will also explore the measures to ensure self financing so as to avoid escalating costs. 3.5.3 E-Government Pitfalls There are well identified pitfalls that must be avoided in developing and executing an e- government agenda which must be considered in designing a way forward. It is well acknowledged that the adoption of technologies without developing the necessary human skills and capacities to manage, integrate and maintain them is not sustainable. Further, the centralized use of technologies by national government departments without ensuring that the benefits of technology are also derived by associated or intermediary institutions, such as local government, Parliament, and civil society, will create unbalanced institutions. And finally, the failure to link better governance to broader and more inclusive democracy which gives voice to those who cannot afford technologies, but have needs and ideas to express, will create negative challenges for citizenry. 3.5.4 e-Government Integration Success The focus has often been on using technology to build front-end visibility with the citizen. While this can potentially create a superior citizen experience, this is only possible if the backend technology enables the electronic completion of the service or information request. Otherwise, the end-to-end experience for the citizen will be poor. In this context, the end-to-end quality of the infrastructure must be continuously managed and strengthened to ensure maximum citizen care. And appropriate governance frameworks must be put in place. Government accounts for fifty percent or more of ICT use. In SVG, it is the only entity that has the potential to support the development of a thriving ICT industry. SVG Government is also well positioned to be the catalyst for developing ICT careers to attract and retain people in the sector for the longer term, and therefore creating a sustainable ICT resource pool. The need to centralise ICT resources must therefore be investigated in greater detail. There is a need to determine the business case for outsourcing defined ICT activities to a Regional OECS Team or to the ICT community through Public-Private- Partnerships. The use of cloud computing technology needs to be investigated as a mechanism to ensure full e-government integration in a viable manner. Figure 15 on the following page summarises the key issues and barriers that need to be addressed in moving e-government forward in SVG. It is important to encompass the EGRIP initiatives in moving forward with the ICT agenda. Regional Organisations and Associations P a g e | 53 1 MANDATE Mandate the treating of ICT filing and services with higher priority. To reduce lines and make transactions, easier, and quicker; and so attract users to the e-gov on-line modality, there must be benefits to consumer for using ICT 2 MAINTAINANCE Effective technical maintenance of quality on-line e-gov services Provide a high quality user friendly experience Reduce total cost of ownership Develop standards Use OECS technical teams to reduce down time and avoid costly upgrades 3 GREATER ACCESS Ensure citizen household and community access to broadband Promote business, urban and rural access to broadband Greatly increase percentage of household penetration and business penetration 4 TRAIN PUBLIC SERVANT Train ministry staff and human resources to adopt and handle ICT as part of public sector and administrative reform And address other fundamental non-ICT transformational reforms SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION AND USE OF E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES & SERVICES 5 TRAIN CITIZENS Promote training of citizens, communities and business in the use and practical benefits of ICT and E-government services 6 TECHNICAL FINANCIAL MECHANISM Ensure effective ability to implement financial transactions including on-line payments and on-line refunds 7 ICT REGULATORY Ensure an effective regulatory process Including Certification Authority and Encryption Services Implement a modern electronic communication Act 8 CYBERCRIMES Address issues of cybercrime and public fear of on- line transactions In particular, address the issue of identity theft and computer misuse Figure 15: Ensuring Success of e-Government Initiatives The success of implementing of the e-Government initiatives identified in the various preceding sections will largely depend on the degree to which the critical issues and barriers shown above are addressed. It is now necessary to consider how SVG can move forward in the context of the best practices that the country wishes to adopt and the current state of e- readiness defined previously. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 54 This Page left Blank Accelerating Forward P a g e | 55 4.1 THE ICT STRATEGY FUNDAMENTALS An ICT Strategy is a blueprint that anchors and guides events and activities through a never ending lifecycle. It delivers technological advancements and is able to sustain itself through an iterative cycle of improvements for which the consensus of all parties is a critical success factor. If, however, the strategy is unilaterally altered or compromised without due regard to its custodians and to stakeholders, then it can ‘self-destruct’ and quickly become obsolete from lack of broad support. Understanding the national development strategy and translating the current business-of- government strategy as a first step, is an indisputable best practice in shaping the ICT strategy and architecture in alignment with the goals and objectives of the SVG stakeholder community. Engaging the strategy’s leadership at an early stage makes the strategy definition process a strong confidence-building measure. This is critically important for obtaining funding and ensuring successful implementation. The close partnering of ICT and sponsors (including business, government, and civil-society) in a collaborative manner delivers transparency and ensures that strong relationships are created which results in a partnership that delivers a rapid and agile approach to the use of ICT at a national level. 4.2 DEVELOPING THE NATIONAL ICT POLICY AND PLAN A national ICT Policy and associated Strategic Plan have far reaching impacts, and must therefore be developed as a national effort to ensure ownership and support for its implementation. The private sector and key stakeholders must be part of the development process. Government therefore appointed several Sector-Specific Working Groups or SWGs. The architecture of the SWG is illustrated in Figure 16 and included: Technical Infrastructure Government (including Justice and National Security) Agriculture Community Development Health Figure 16: Architecture of SWG e2G Strategy All Encompassing Team Infrastructure Training Human Resources Legal & regulatory Governance eCommerce E-GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES, NATIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS. THE DIASPORA AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS Public Sector Transformation ICT Sector ICT Strategy & Core Team Specific Sector Content & Application The strategic plan must address the demands for transparency and privacy which require defined, documented security, standards and baselines for all national ICT assets. It must apply coherent, consistent risk management processes across all major classes of risk, especially in addressing compliance and governance requirements. ACCELERATING FORWARD St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 56 Tourism Legal and Regulatory Education and Human Resource Development Industry and ICT Sector (including Trade and Financial Services) The members of the SWG were generally selected based on their experience and expertise in the specific sector, and were often well respected subject matter experts. With external facilitation and utilising a best practice development process, eVolve™, the SWGs met over the period May 2009 to March 2010, and crafted the national ICT policy and plan. It should be noted that some of the initiatives that were considered by the SWGs did not made its way into this document as issues of prioritisation and resourcing had to be taken into consideration. However, this plan must be reviewed regularly and be kept updated annually as St. Vincent and the Grenadines progresses over the coming years else it will run the risk of becoming irrelevant to the national goals and aspirations. And such initiatives can be re-visited. 4.3 ICT VISION The vision statement created for SVG focuses heavily on sustainability and on quality of life improvements for all of the country’s people. It gives life to the desired outcomes of the National ICT Plan. The Vision is captured in the following statement: “St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a sustainable knowledge-based society that maximises the use of Information and Communication Technology for greater competitiveness, economic development, an improved quality of life and work for all its people, at home and abroad.” The Vision is clear that the benefits of its ICT agenda must be shared equitably, within SVG and with the Diaspora. The inclusion of the Diaspora is an important mechanism in addressing resource constraints. An emphasis on improvements in the quality of work experience is explicitly detailed. Sustainability is considered key and underpins the vision, and Government expects that the considerable benefits of being a knowledge-based society will be derived by the country. 4.4 CORE VALUES It was decided that there are some core values which underpin this Vision and which must be supported throughout the implementation effort. These core values were identified as follows: Sustainable Competitive Promoting Innovation Transformative People-centred All stakeholders agreed that in the process of implementation, the core values must not be lost or subsumed, but are always explicitly built into each and every individual plan for execution. Key questions must be continuously asked: Will the outputs and outcomes of the ICT execution effort be sustainable? Will it enable St. Vincent and the Grenadines to become more competitive? Will it promote innovation? Will it enable the people and the country to become more effective and productive through its transformative capability? And finally does the execution agenda have people at its core? If any action taken or project executed under the ambit of this Plan does not provide satisfactory answers to the above tests or subset of these tests, then the action will need to be re-examined as it will not support the core values defined and therefore be inconsistent with the strategic direction desired for SVG. 4.5 DESIRED OUTCOMES It was important that SVG determine the specific outcomes which it wants achieved within the life of the Plan. After much debate, particularly around the issue of available resources, the desired outcomes were defined and are presented below: Strengthened ICT sector contributing significantly to the country’s economic vigour, to the drive for OECS sub-regional integration and economic union, and to regional integration Further strengthening of legislative and regulatory framework to embrace ICT, minimize cybercrimes, and engender greater trust and confidence in ICT among all citizens Processes which is inclusive of Civil Society, the Private Sector and the Diaspora Integrated government with all appropriate information and services on line and knowledge effectively managed by 2015 Universal, affordable and secure access to Broadband Internet ICT services by all citizens, businesses and communities by 2015 ICT is accessible and entrenched into the education system and an ICT-literate society created; and persons with high aptitude and excellence harnessed and facilitated to excel in this field Health care delivery optimised by use of ICT Growth of unique and innovative medium and micro ICT enterprises in the creation of local content and local software applications Accelerating Forward P a g e | 57 Using ICT for innovation, growth in the cultural arts and increased competitiveness of the private sector Attracting Investment in the ICT sector Computer and ICT waste managed effectively and safely ICT-enabled emergency response systems saving lives and protecting livelihoods and property It is evident that in achieving these outcomes, SVG’s growth and prosperity will have been accelerated, and the national ICT plan would have achieved its purpose. 4.6 NATIONAL ICT OBJECTIVES The SWGs developed the broad objectives of the National ICT Policy and Plan. These were organised along the focus areas as follows: 4.6.1 Technical Infrastructure To ensure that the national ICT infrastructure expands and adapts such that it delivers widespread, secure, and cost effective access to state-of-the-art ICT that meets the evolving needs of the country and its people. 4.6.2 Government (Inc. Justice and National Security) To ensure that ICT is optimally utilised within government to improve cost-effectiveness and the quality of services provided to citizens and businesses, and to support the administration of justice and national security. 4.6.3 Agriculture To enable the effective and efficient supply chain management (from production to sales and marketing) through the use of ICT and thereby promote the economic viability of agricultural related activities. 4.6.4 Community Development To promote affordable and universal access to ICT services and resources in rural and underserved communities so as to develop and strengthen them, to impact on poverty and gender inequalities, and to improve disaster preparedness. And additionally, to ensure Civil Society plays a critical role in community development, and that the borders which separate Vincentians within the Diaspora are broken down by the use of ICT. 4.6.5 Health To enable greater equity in the allocation and use of health care resources by exploiting ICT mechanisms to promote quality health care delivery and management in a cost effective manner. 4.6.6 Tourism To improve the overall coordination of the marketing and other destination management functions and to promote linkages with other key sectors, through the use of ICT and thereby enable the growth of the sector in terms of visitor arrivals, visitor expenditure and the overall level and distribution of revenue generated in the sector. 4.6.7 5.6.7 Legal and Regulatory To establish a comprehensive harmonized legal and regulatory framework which facilitates the development of ICT within the country and which supports its participation in the global information society and economy. 4.6.8 Education and Human Resource Development To establish mechanisms that utilize ICT in the education sector which will facilitate a better quality of life through life-long learning. 4.6.9 Industry and ICT Sector (incl. Trade and Financial Services) To ensure that ICT is optimally utilised by industry, particularly medium and micro- enterprises, so as to improve internal operational efficiencies and to support the export of goods and services, and to ensure that the ICT sector itself expands and contributes significantly to the national economy. More-so St, Vincent and the Grenadines endeavours to become the hub for ICT software development and the creation of appropriate local and exciting content and mobile applications. 4.7 POLICY STATEMENTS The SWGs then focussed on the enabling policies which will facilitate the achievement of the objectives and desired outcomes outlined previously. The broad policy framework has been defined by policy statements which collectively contribute towards St. Vincent and the Grenadines achieving its National ICT Vision and hence contributes towards the social, economic, cultural and human resource development of the country. It is important to note that these policy statements are built on the e-readiness foundation outlined previously. The statements build on the best practices identified, and which are intended to bridge the current gaps and strengthen the ICT operational base. In some instances, the statements are intended to move SVG in a direction consistent with knowledge- based societies and economies. These policy statements are given below by sectors: St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 58 4.7.1 Technical Infrastructure Establish mechanisms to ensure the continued development of reliable, state of the art, country-wide ICT infrastructure with adequate capacity and network speeds. Ensure all installed ICT infrastructure and capacity is utilized effectively and contributes to resilience, redundancy and emergency response at a national level.

St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 60 4.7.8 Education and Human Resource Development Promote innovation, science and modern learning software technology for efficiency in education, as well as to promote skill development and professional capacity building. Improve the basic infrastructure with modern, wireless computer labs and other appropriate productivity tools. Develop a comprehensive plan for the smooth deployment of mobile computer devices (laptops) for students, as a learning tool, the maintenance and effective usage of the laptops at school and at home. Develop a focus on motivation and teacher training in ICT. Introduce an Education Management and Information Systems (EMIS) in a phased manner into the education sector to bring about more transparency, efficiency and productivity. Encourage and support ICT training and development of knowledge and its active use by all teachers and other public servants. Foster the use of ICT for formal and non- formal education, skills development and adult learning regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disability or location. Encourage training in innovation and software applications development for the knowledge economy. 4.7.9 Industry and ICT Sector (incl. Trade and Financial Services) Create a conducive environment for a vibrant and sustainable ICT industry in SVG that is aligned to national priorities and which makes a significant economic contribution with a focus on content and software creation. Support and facilitate programs in the private sector that encourage the effective use of ICT to improve operational efficiencies and international competitiveness. Develop monitoring and measurement systems to enable government to determine the impact of its ICT policies and measures on the ICT sector and industry generally. Encourage and support local ICT innovation and development of the current and potential markets through incentive and other schemes. Encourage and promote joint ventures between local and foreign entrepreneurs in the ICT sector. Support the growth of the ICT sector by the strategic outsourcing of ICT support and services by government. Support the use of ICT by MSMEs as an enabler of growth and economic development, including the online registration of businesses. Develop government-industry collaborations that work effectively manage cyber risk and to protect cyberspace. Provide a mechanism for bringing a variety of perspective, equities, and knowledge together to reach consensus and move forward together to enhance security at a national level. One of the most effective ways of ensuring that the desired outcomes and associated policy statements are achieved is through action: the execution of programmes and projects that are designed for this purpose. SVG thus focussed on the identification and development of such programmes and projects - with expert external facilitation. The National ICT Strategy and Action Plan was, therefore, crafted from ground up with implementation in mind, taking into consideration St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ re- launching point. [It should be noted that the issue of cyber security at a national level is of great concern to SVG. Detailed action plans were developed and these are outlined in an Appendix.] HIS Unit – Ministry of Health Projects and Programmes P a g e | 61 The initiatives to be pursued by St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the next few years are organised as Programmes and Projects (Actions), which when executed well will enable the successful achievement of the defined Vision and the attainment of the desired outcomes. It is expected that the Programmes and Projects will be implemented and managed using a standard project management framework. A project management approach will ensure that the Plan has the greatest possible chance of success as it allows activities to be properly planned, and effectively monitored and controlled, during delivery. Another practical way of looking at ICT proposals which will facilitate the citizen’s level of understanding of benefits, promote usage, and still be consistent with the ICT abbreviation is INFRASTRUCTURE, CONTENT, and TRAINING. This practical approach highlights the need for a modern, robust, nation-wide Infrastructure and connectivity which allows the private sector’s and citizen’s access to ICT and an adequate government-owned backbone to facilitate efficient, cost effective communication across the public administration. Appropriate Content covers all the various e- government and other applications which are used or have been specially designed and crafted for the local context. It also includes the Training in ICT at all levels in schools, communities, and the public service for the creation of enlightened users, technicians and knowledge workers; and the promotion and adoption of these services by the business sector. The Programmes and Projects identified to be completed during the period 2010 – 2015 are summarised by sectors in Table 8 below. It must be noted that some of these projects are currently being planned or are at some stage of implementation. The National ICT Plan aims to embrace current initiatives and projects, and to bring them into a collective framework such that they can be reviewed and managed as a national portfolio, rather than, as unrelated or separate initiatives. This portfolio approach allows better prioritisation and resource allocation at a national level, and allows synergies and dependencies to be taken into account to maximise the benefits of ICT to the country.

Trade and Financial Services) e-Industry Virtual Directory - Survey and Benchmarking Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) e-Commerce Projects and Programmes P a g e | 63 5.1 INFRASTRUCTURE, CONTENT, AND TRAINING A practical layman and citizen’s approach to looking at ICT as Infrastructure, Content, and Training, and the technology initiatives specifically designed to enhance business, will now be considered. 5.1.1 Technical Infrastructure SVG has made excellent progress with its national infrastructure as is evident in the rapid growth in mobile communications and in the movement of rates to a more affordable level. This Programme therefore seeks to monitor and evaluate the current initiatives in progress so as to maximise success and alignment with the needs of the national ICT agenda. However, this Programme, Universal Connectivity, seeks to ensure that all of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has the same level of access to communications services irrespective of living in an urban or rural part of St. Vincent or on one of the Grenadine islands. This means continued strategic use of the Universal Service Fund and ensuring that the proposed projects are taken to completion and in fact expanded to include all communities over r the life of the Plan. The Universal Connectivity Programme will build on the demand created by other programmes and projects under this Plan, such as the Community Integration Project and the various Portals that will be accessible at a community level in rural areas. This programme will build on the SMS capacity of the mobile telephony infrastructure for disaster preparedness and for dissemination of government information and delivery of e- services. In order for citizens and business to participate in this medium, they must have access to Broadband and the computer related devices to access information. It is imperative that SVG adapt technologies to create solutions to existing problems, and in this particular case, the establishment of a National Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is required. There are a number of benefits that can be derived directly from the establishment of a local IXP and these include the establishment of a well defined Internet economy that will keep SVG internet traffic local, enhance the Internet experience of users, reduce overall cost related to providing Internet services, promote and encourage the creation of local content, create Internet opportunities, build technical capacity, improved connectivity through fibre optic and high speed wireless, and the aggregation of demand will make it more attractive for additional transit providers to enter the market. A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale to domestic customers, without demanding any significant corresponding capital or operational investment. This would make more bandwidth available for important activities such as video streaming and telemedicine and increase the national penetration of broadband Internet. An IXP is a prerequisite to the development of any significant domestic content production, hosting, or co-location industry. This barrier must be overcome before major content providers like Google or Amazon will consider providing local services within national markets. The increased demand for these services, and the ISPs ability to supply them at a lower price-point, will serve to increase both market penetration and the total revenue-value of the market, relative to the pre- IXP status-quo. This is an important infrastructure initiative that will be given priority in implementation. With the reduction of available IPv4 address space, a new version of the Internet Protocol was established called IPv6, also known as IP Next Generation (IPNG). This version will address the exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or host. However its implementation requires careful planning and coordination. SVG will have to take stock of what exists and manage its introduction. 5.1.2 e-Government The e-Government Programme aims to provide a shared technology infrastructure that is stable and secure and which embraces a set of policies and standards for the connection to and use of this shared infrastructure. It provides for the development of the public sector people capacity to manage the e-government communications network that is already under construction and which will be expanded under this Programme. The e-government platform will enable G2G, C2G and B2G connectivity, while providing services such as domain management, security and intrusion protection, virtual private networks, firewalls, and physical connectivity between government locations. The shared infrastructure will enable the provision and management of shared services such as email, Internet, Intranet, Voice over IP, collocation of servers, application hosting and SAN facilities. The challenge will be for the government of SVG to re-organise itself to take advantage of the enabling technology to improve its business processes and its service delivery model to its businesses and citizens. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 64 Further, the Programme will contain a Government On-line initiative and a Process Re- Design initiative. The scope of both these initiatives will be heavily dependent on the resources available and the level of support for transformation of the public sector through the strategic use of ICT. The shared connectivity infrastructure or e- government backbone will have several Projects, namely Standards and Policies, Shared Services, Communications Infrastructure and a Government Portal. The Standards and Policies Project will cover a range of initiatives, in particular, the shared infrastructure usage, but also procurement and use of ICT within the public sector. It will cover areas such as data and information management, interconnectivity and interoperability, security, web standards, use of open source software, and standardisation of technology. The Shared Services Project will focus on determining what services are best provided across the backbone to support all of government. This would include knowledge management including email, Internet, Intranet, VOIP, collocation of servers, use of SANs, and ASP operations. The Communications Infrastructure initiative will extend and strengthen the Intranet that is being currently implemented. It will include the provision of firewalls, network management, load-sharing facilities, and enhanced bandwidth to ensure that all of government can be supported in a safe, secure manner while carrying the required digital traffic. The use of a single point of entry via the Internet to all of government, or a Portal Project will be implemented as part of this Programme. The Portal project will include standards necessary for its success, including look and feel standards to maintenance and support issues. The central SVG Portal will be linked and integrated with the Agriculture, Tourism, Education and Community Development Portal. In fact, synergies and cost sharing should be pursued in moving forward with these initiatives. The Government On-line initiative is a Programme in itself and will likely run for many years, depending on the resources available. This programme focuses on making all relevant government information available on-line and will make use of the Portal infrastructure discussed previously. It will involve the careful consideration of the information needs of all stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, visitors and employees, and obtaining and organising that information in an easy-to- understand, easy-to-access format on the Portal. The initial focus should be on information most needed by the stakeholders irrespective of the ministry or agency from which it is obtained. In parallel with putting information on-line, SVG must move to placing key services on-line wherever appropriate and cost-effective. Again, stakeholders must be consulted to determine the priorities, and the infrastructure required to achieve on-line service provisioning must be determined. The services that are normally prioritised include births, deaths, and marriages, the business registry, taxes, national identification, and passports. During the life of this Plan, the key services should be determined and the most common services placed on-line in a secure and accessible manner. This initiative should look at all service delivery channels including the provision of information via the telephone. This will require a well- designed call centre which is equipped to handle all standard or most frequently asked service related questions from citizens. This government on-line initiative will build on the current ICT investments across government, including SIGTAX, SMARTSTREAM and ASYCUDA. Investments in ICT, without a commensurate review of business processes, are often of limited value. Government, through the Business Process The increased number of paths learned through an IXP improves routing efficiency and fault-tolerance for participants and renders participants far more resilient to international cable failures. An Internet exchange point (IX or IXP) is a physical infrastructure that allows different Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems) by means of mutual peering agreements, which allow traffic to be exchanged without cost. IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP's traffic which must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of their service. Furthermore, the increased number of paths learned through the IXP improves routing efficiency and fault tolerance. It should be noted that this area of focus is central government and excludes health, education, agriculture etc which were special areas of focus in their own right. Projects and Programmes P a g e | 65 Review Programme, will seek to improve the internal efficiencies and effectiveness of all Ministries and Agencies that are implementing ICTs under the umbrella of this Plan. This means that in general ICT investments would have a process re-design component. This Programme will deliver re-design projects for Government generally, and supports re-design initiatives for other agencies and areas of focus such as health and education. It is expected that the process re- design initiative, the Government On-line initiative and the common infrastructure projects such as the e-government backbone and the Portal, will be developed hand-in-hand to ensure synergies, compatibility and cost sharing. 5.1.3 Agriculture Agriculture continues to be an important contributor to the economy of SVG, and supports many families across the country. It is important that this sector be strengthened so that it would become more globally competitive and in fact grow. The key objective of the Programmes and Projects in the area of agriculture is to enable the effective and efficient supply chain management, from production to sales and marketing, in SVG through the use of ICT. This will inevitably promote the economic viability of agricultural related activities by impacting on costs. It should be recognised that some of these initiatives, including the Agricultural Portal and the National Agricultural Production and Marketing Information System, are already in the planning or implementation stages. However, it is important to review and coordinate national ICT initiatives under a single unified umbrella. The key Programme and Projects are now presented. The NAIMS, National Agricultural Information Management System, or Programme will strengthen the information management, information sharing, and information reporting capabilities of the central Ministry and other agencies / organisations / stakeholders in the sector. This will lead to improved communication and policy dialogue with key sectors and stakeholders for the optimum benefit of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This Programme has a number of associated Projects which collectively will deliver AIMS. These initiatives are now outlined. The Reporting & Monitoring Information System (RMIS) is an internal work management system. RMIS will allow the Ministry to manage its human and capital resources optimally. Caribbean Fisheries Information System (CARIFIS) will provide primary support to the fishermen of SVG. It will include the Fisheries Registration System that will register fishermen and monitor the catch so that the limited resources of the seas can be managed in a sustainable manner. It will facilitate the safety of fishermen. This information system will support the development and growth of the fisheries industry. The Forestry Information Management System will enable the Ministry to manage the forests and associated wildlife of SVG in a sustainable manner. It will facilitate controlled utilisation of the limited resources available within the country and allow this sector to contribute to the economy in an effective manner. IPv6 In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the following benefits: 1)Increased address space 2) More efficient routing 3) Reduced management requirement 4) Improved methods to change ISP 5) Better mobility support 6) Multi-homing 7) Security 8) Scoped address: link-local, site- local and global-address space IPv6 brings a number of benefits such as the improved quality of service required for new applications like IP telephony, video/audio, interactive games and ecommerce. This version also easily deals with the avoidance of network traffic, loss of data or bandwidth. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 66 The agricultural sector has always been susceptible to the introduction of new or variations to existing diseases to plant and animals due to the uncontrolled and ineffective management of the entry of plant and animals to the country, both intentionally and unintentionally. The Plant & Animal Quarantine Information System (PAQIS) will provide the information system support to manage this challenge in a real time and proactive manner. The Farmers Registration System will allow the farming community to be registered and managed, particularly with respect to grants, subsidiaries and non- monetary benefits that are or may become available. It will allow the human resources that are devoted to this sector to be better managed. And finally, there is a need to manage the quality and quantity of the livestock within SVG. This will be done by the introduction of a Livestock Registration System. This will allow improved quality of livestock products to be facilitated, by better management of the animals themselves. It will facilitate disease management amongst other important management functions. The NAPMIS - National Agricultural Production and Marketing Information System is a Programme that will include a number of systems that are intended to improve and support the supply chain management within the agricultural sector. It will support production, marketing, agro-processing and more effective sector planning. NAPMIS will enhance agro-processing and value-addition to the primary products of the agri- and fish products including improvement in distribution. It is recognised that good decisions can only be made consistently with good information. NAPMIS will therefore include the following information systems: National Agriculture Production and Marketing Information System (NAMIS) will support the marketing requirements of AIMS and will allow the Ministry to support farmers by providing information that will enable them to maximise the revenue that they generated from their produce. It will allow the Ministry to determine the best balance of products that should be produced by SVG and generally become the base decision support system for the sector. It will include a land bank system to track how land is being allocated to produce and to make land available for landless farmers interested in expansion or youths interested in agricultural start-ups. The Agriculture Portal will be the primary electronic entry point into the sector. It will provide links to all stakeholders with SVG and will enable stakeholders within and external to SVG to connect and to find the information required for operating and investing within the sector. Farmers and agencies generally operate independently in SVG, and this Portal is an important tool to facilitate the required linkages and the building of valuable business relationships. Furthermore, the Portal will provide linkages to banks, be accessible from community access centres, and assist farmers with the identification of niche markets and connections to foreign partners. NAMIS and the Agricultural Portal will be integrated to improve the linkages between primary producers or farmers and consumers especially supermarkets, restaurants and hotels. The ‘ICT in Agriculture’ Programme will promote the use of ICT to improve production technologies in agriculture such as the use of automation systems. Such systems improve the use of limited and costly resources such as water and fertiliser, and the use of technology for planting and harvesting. This Programme will focus on the identification and introduction of strategic ICT into the sector itself. The impact of strategic ICT should be greater yield, and better products on a more consistent basis at a lower cost. The NAIMS Programme entails the following series of related initiatives: Reporting & Monitoring Information System (RMIS) Caribbean Fisheries Information System (CARIFIS) Forestry Information System Plant & Animal Quarantine Information System Farmers Registration System Livestock Registration System Action Item: Launch NAPMIS Train Farmers and Extension Staff in the use of Information System and ICT in Agriculture Projects and Programmes P a g e | 67 5.1.4 Community Development The key objective of the Programmes and Projects in the Community Development area of focus is to leverage the power of ICT into the country’s response to critical issues such as poverty reduction, social justice and gender equity and equality, institutional strengthening of the Ministry, collaboration, cooperative development and stakeholder empowerment, and finally disaster preparedness and recovery. Some aspects of these initiatives have already begun or are being planned. It is important that at a community level, from the ground up that the ICT infrastructure introduced delivers value to the community and its residents. This means that the community must see value in these technologies, and must be prepared and equipped to exploit its enabling capacity. It is recognised that stronger communities mean a more resilient society and generally results in a more productive country. This focus area has three Programmes, namely: Community Empowerment Ministry ICT Development Community Integration The Community Empowerment Programme promotes the development and implementation of Projects that use ICT to enable community development and poverty alleviation. A policy framework will be created for the governance of this programme involving broad-based representation across the community development stakeholder group. Research will be done to identify successful ICT-enabled community development projects across the world; and the experiences and learning from such projects will be codified and transferred to other communities. The assistance of international agencies will be utilised to assist with this knowledge transfer effort. The use of ICT at a community level, in community centres and by all categories of users from the community will be encouraged. And finally, a funding mechanism for community based ICT projects and projects will be created utilising the financial and other capabilities of the public sector and with a special focus on utilisation of the enabling capacity of the private sector. This Programme will include Projects that seek to facilitate regional disaster preparedness, including the identification of funding and development and expansion of the existing infrastructure which includes appropriate application software. The Ministry of Community Development’s ICT Development Programme focuses on the institutional strengthening of the Ministry itself through ICT-enabled processes and the general integrating of ICT. This will include amongst other things the development of a Strategic ICT Plan for the Ministry, identification of funding for its implementation and the development of internal capacity to manage the success of such implementation. The Community Integration Project involves the development of an electronic portal which will allow networking, collaboration and the consolidation of the service delivery capacity amongst all social development partners, namely: NGOs, CBOs, Community Associations, Cooperatives and Family Service Organisations. The mechanism for the management and operations of this Portal will need to be developed so that it benefits all partners equally, and the communities of interest directly. It will provide connectivity to other Ministries such as the Ministries of Agriculture and Tourism. The development of community level content for inclusion on the Portal is a useful initiative and can include the preparation of cultural artefacts which are of national interest or of interest to the Diaspora. 5.1.5 Health The e-Health Programme is designed to facilitate greater equity in the allocation and use of healthcare resources by exploiting ICT mechanisms to promote quality healthcare delivery and management. The Programme will encompass technology components such as a web-enabled Health Information System (HIS) and the enactment of legislation, protocols and public education for utilisation of the health information which will be created. It includes the introduction of tele-medicine on a larger scale and improved connectivity amongst health institutions. It proposes a comprehensive staff information system and the piloting of the electronic tagging of patients. The Programmes builds on current initiatives by expanding on the computers that have been introduced at the Ministry, MCMH and the district clinics, and on the NHIS that is being introduced. It is recognized that in this context, the HIS will collect standardized data and facilitate the retrieval, processing and reporting on the healthcare delivery system. However, it must protect patient’s privacy and confidentiality and must be easy to use. In so doing the HIS must be robust and protected from disasters and must be easily accessible to health care providers and patients. It must improve the continuity of care and the provision of quality healthcare services to the population of SVG, and enable greater equity in the allocation and use of healthcare resources, given that SVG is a multi-island state with obvious geographical challenges and vulnerabilities to disasters. The HIS must also St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 68 provide citizens with access to appropriate yet comprehensive information that would inform and guide their health care management. The HIS will contain a complete medical and health supply inventory system to manage inventory and expiration dates. It will provide information of individual drug items and drug interaction, track utilization and enable the management and allocation of limited resources across health districts. A policy framework for tele-medicine will be crafted as part of this programme and which will enable the managed broad introduction of this technology into the health system. The enactment of appropriate legislation to ensure safe and secure operation will facilitate the use of telemedicine as a possible export service. The ICT infrastructure to support the HIS and telemedicine by providing interconnectivity between health institutions and to the international health community will be developed as part of this Programme. The Infrastructure will also enable the implementation of a comprehensive staff information system, SIS, which is aimed at improving the management of personal staff information, benefits administration, professional development, succession planning, staffing and organization management and recruitment. And finally the electronic tagging of patients will be piloted as part of this programme, as an inordinate number of patients abscond from the hospitals of SVG. Such tagging facilitates the tracking of patients by using a device or electronic tag to monitor the location and status of a patient from a central location. This will enhance the healthcare system. Attention will need to be paid to any possible legal issues that may arise through this initiative. The e-Health Programme therefore proposes many related but integrated healthcare projects which need to be prioritized over the life of the plan. 5.1.6 Tourism The work of the Ministry of Tourism and associated agencies in the development of a one- stop travel Portal for St. Vincent and the Grenadines is strongly supported by this national ICT plan. This initiative forms the basis for the ‘Virtual St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ Project. This project seeks to maximise the use of ICTs to attract visitors to the country. It will expand the proposed Portal to be highly interactive, building on the SVG’s ‘many islands, different cultural experiences’ of the cultural gems of Vincy Life theme. The opportunity exists here to utilise the private sector to build components of the required infrastructure such that it can be exported to the OECS in the medium term and to other island states in the long term. This portal will provide virtual tours, booking of flights, hotel and car rentals, promote tourism packages, brand SVG as a premier tourist destination, and maximise the revenue generated from current and proposed tourism products. The second major initiative that is proposed under this sector is the integrated Supply Chain Management Project. During the life of this plan, ICTs will used to integrate all agencies, organisations and businesses within the tourism supply chain into a seamless whole. This means fresh produce from farmers will be available just in time to support the needs of visitors at the hotels and guest houses. It means that the SMEs which support the tourism sector will be able to obtain work on-line, invoice and receive payments electronically. This project will inevitably support the agricultural sector and because it will encourage all businesses to go on- line, it will grow the demand for ICT development and support – in effect strengthening the ICT sector itself. 5.1.7 Legal and Regulatory Excellent progress has been made with the development of a robust legislative regime to support the telecommunications sector and with the introduction of the Electronic Transaction Act, the Information and Communications Technologies Services Investment Incentives Act & the Small Business Development Act in 2007. However, as the country accelerates its ICT agenda, the legal and regulatory framework needs to be further strengthened. This will be done under the e- Legislation Programme. Action Item: Launch HIS and Connect all Clinics, Hospitals and Health Centres to Broadband Projects and Programmes P a g e | 69 Under this Programme, the work with ECTEL in enacting the Electronics Communications Bill will be completed. As more information on citizens and businesses go on-line and as information becomes shared across ministries and agencies, and as health information goes on-line, the need to strengthen privacy and personal identification legislation becomes more important. The potential need for a Data Protection Commissioner or similar post will need to be considered carefully. The legislation currently in place will need to be reviewed to determine if it will fully provide the protection required for computer crime, electronic evidence, and increased e- commerce. This programme will also introduce training and capacity building requirements for the judiciary and the legal community. 5.1.8 Education and Human Resources The key objective of the Programmes and Projects in this area of focus is to establish mechanisms to utilise ICT to facilitate a better quality of life through life-long learning. It is intended that through the initiatives in this area that all persons within and entering the labour force will have the capacity to utilise ICT in their daily life through ICT literacy training. It will ensure that all institutions of learning in St. Vincent and the Grenadines will be equipped with the necessary technology and that teachers will be trained in utilising ICT as part of the learning process. The cost of technology necessary to support continuous education will need to be managed and opportunities for affording higher levels of training in ICT would be created. In essence, ICT will be exploited to the fullest in enabling the empowerment of the human resources of the country to be the best that they can be. Several of the initiatives in this area of focus are being implemented and are therefore being brought into the overall National ICT vision. The Plan recognises the considerable investments over the last few years in acquiring hardware and connecting schools to the Internet. It builds and integrates the considerable investment in teacher training, modern buildings with ICT facilities and training of the local labour force. The Plan recognises that equipping the people of SVG, particular the children is critical to successful implementation. ICT which cannot be harnessed by people will inevitably be a useless investment. It also recognises the long term investment that must be made to transform the country to a knowledge-based society – the Plan prepares SVG for the social and economic challenges of the next two decades and that no child leaves school without basic computer literacy. The first Project is AWARE – All Workers ARe e-Enabled or the ICT Literacy Project, which will focus on the existing labour force and on new entrants into the workplace. A critical element of the ICT strategy is ensuring that people are equipped to take advantage of the enabling opportunities that ICT can present. It recognises that the current training opportunities in SVG are relatively limited in scope and are under-funded and centralised. A special focus will continue to be placed on the training of public officers so that the e-government investments can be fully and effectively exploited for the benefit of all. A catalogue of training necessary for computer literacy will be created and training providers will be identified to deliver the required material. An associated marketing plan will be developed to ensure that Action Item: Enact a new converged Electronic Communication Act to regulate the ICT Sector and replace the Telecommunications Act 2001 Action Item: Continue training all aspect of the Human Resources Establish programs where no child leaves school without basic computer literacy Action Item: Connect all Schools to Broadband Using the USF Establish Computer Labs in all Schools & Community College Use ICT in Teaching and introduce distance learning. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 70 the needs of the various target groups, including those in the public service, are met. The role of the Service Commission Department will need to be defined in the context of AWARE which seeks to address the level of ICT literacy only. Under this Project, the issue of the challenges faced by the people of SVG in obtaining ICT at affordable prices will be identified. Public consultation may be necessary to determine the nature and extent of the challenge, and an analysis of the ICT market and a determination of the strategies necessary to promote competitive and fair market pricing will be needed. These outputs will inform government policy in this regard to enable and support AWARE and its related projects. The ICT Infrastructure-in-Education Project will build the required ICT infrastructure to provide Computer Based Training (CBT) through all available channels. The infrastructure will include computer labs, networks for connecting facilities, teaching and learning support software, and access to the Internet. Current training facilities would need to be reviewed and upgraded to a consistent sustainable high standard. Based on best practice research, special focus will be placed on developing and enabling ICT leadership and performance evaluation techniques. Teachers will be trained as part of their professional development, and a guide will be developed to ICT standards, professional development needs, and integration approaches. It is likely that the integration of ICT into teaching and learning will need to be incentivised and that funding will need to be identified or raised. It is also critical that teaching and learning resource materials be localised, and that regional partnerships will need to be created as a mechanism to manage cost and to enable regional growth and development. And finally, there is a need for an education portal as a mechanism to enable collaboration in the use and development of teaching and learning resources, and in enabling networking between school administrators, teachers, students and parents. The Smart People, Smart Worker Programme is designed to support ICT-enabled life-long learning. SVG is aiming to be more self- sufficient in managing its ICT development and on promoting innovation. It is being recognised that having higher level ICT skills will be valued and eventually rewarded. This Programme will therefore build on current initiatives and involve identifying the set of higher level ICT skills required to promote the development of SVG and developing an associated training plan to meet these needs. Courses will be designed and incentives will be created and offered to both training providers and students to encourage pursuance of higher level ICT skills training to create Smart People. For the public service in particular, software application projects will be developed to sustain and entrench the use of the higher level ICT skills being acquired by the public sector worker – the Smart (Knowledge) Worker. This activity will be managed through a central body that will be created to identify and manage projects under the Smart Worker initiative and which will identify and engage experts to mentor, develop and transfer the skills through the experiential involvement of local professionals. So Smart Workers will be utilised for the benefits of SVG in that they would provide the capacity to provide application software systems and ICT systems to meet the needs of the public sector under this plan. Action Item: Commence software development training and content application creation at COE Conduct training of Public Service Technical Professional on Government applications Projects and Programmes P a g e | 71 5.1.9 Industry and ICT Sector (Inc. Trade and Financial Services) The initiatives proposed in this area of focus aim to develop the nascent ICT sector and to facilitate the utilisation of ICT by the business community itself. The development of e-Commerce will also provide an incentive for businesses to go on-line and to present SVG to the global business community. And finally the strategic introduction of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) will be pursued as a mechanism to develop the ICT sector itself. These initiatives will be delivered as part of the e-Industry Programme. The first initiative will focus on better defining the use of ICT by the business community and seek to better define and understand the capabilities and capacity of the ICT sector itself. This will require a comprehensive survey of what ICTs are used by the business community to support its internal business processes and to interact with the rest of the world, whether as part of a supply chain or offering its services via the Internet. It will seek to determine the capability of the organisations’ employees to support an accelerated e-Industry programme. The ICT businesses will be surveyed to assess their capability to support the national ICT plan and to grow and support a profitable ICT sector. This survey will review the software development and support capability of the existing sector and the ability to support modern ICT as well as the capacity to innovate with technology. The information derived from this survey will be used to benchmark SVG with countries such as Barbados, Malta and Singapore and concrete recommendations developed to strengthen and develop both the business community and the ICT sector to take on the challenges that will arise in supporting the national ICT agenda. The information will also be utilised on the Government Portal or via the proposed ICT Portal as a Virtual Directory such that the services and capabilities of the business community of SVG can be presented and offered to the rest of the world. While the National Investment Promotion Incorporation – SVG has made some progress with foreign investment in the ICT sector, and the EU/SFA 2005 Business Skills and e-Business Incubator Project has sought to improve strategic alliances to strengthen the ICT sector, much more needs to be done. Government is the largest consumer of ICT goods and services in SVG, and therefore has the potential to facilitate the growth of the ICT sector through the strategic outsourcing of some aspects of ICT development and support. This can be specific software development projects which have the potential for export to other Caribbean countries and the world at large. In this regard, the opportunities to work collaboratively with other OECS countries to develop ICT products that can be shared will be pursued. In order for this strategic outsourcing arrangement to work, a clear policy framework must be developed. During the period of this Plan, it is expected that the policy framework will be crafted and approved and at least three ICT projects which have sharing and export potential will be distributed under PPPs to the ICT community. The role of the private sector in support the e-government agenda, including government on-line will be defined under this initiative. E-Commerce initiatives are being pursued under the EU/SFA 2005 Project. These initiatives need to be considered under the ambit of the national ICT plan. The expansion of the proposed 100 SMEs in the ICT Portal project will be expanded to the entire SME community. The enabling policy framework to allow this Portal to grow and expand to support a thriving business community will be finalised and implemented. The Portal will expand to support full business- to-business transactions and support the export development effort in the long term. 5.2 ICT-ENABLED SMES The smart use of tools and resources can make the difference for SMEs to survive and prosper. However, business owners still have to add a certain \"X-factor\" to ensure business success. There is a direct correlation between ICT adopted by SMEs and its competitiveness. The implication is that SMEs stand to make their businesses much more efficient and capable by taking advantage of the benefits of technology. Depending on affordability, high speed connectivity tend facilitate competitiveness; and St. Vincent and the Grenadines is now at a stage where it can leverage several investment criteria to intensively promote and attract greater ICT Investments. 1. Low Competitive Telecommunication Costs 2. Highly Trained Labour Force in ICT 3. Suitable locations to accommodate ICT firms 4. Low Crime and soon easy air accessibility 5. Progressive Fiscal Incentive package 6. Assistance provided in identifying and training suitable human resources St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 72 the use of support services such as end-user training, hardware and software sales, Web development and strategic consulting, and Internet services (e-mail excluded) also has a high correlation with competitiveness. Many SME owners in SVG would like to adopt technology and services to improve their efficiency but are financially constrained. This project will propose mechanism to address the financing challenges faced by SMEs in obtaining ICT. 5.3 ATTRACTING CUSTOMER CARE CENTRES St. Vincent needs to be marketed as a destination where an ICT Investor has the highest chance of success. The labour cost is competitive and people tend to make the Customer Service Sector a long term career choice. This offers some organisational stability after expensive training has been conducted. There are suitable locations within the Capital Kingstown or in the suburbs which offer access to quick transport and communications. The cost of telecommunications services has fallen considerably such that it is now competitive with the USA. For Telemarketing and Inbound Services, the language and accent is quite neutral and easily moulded to the targeted marketplace. The low crime and tropical setting also offer an ideal distraction for the business executive compared to other locations at a higher risk for crime and travel related diseases. A special focus will be taken and a project developed to promote SVG as an ideal location of ICT investments over the long term. It is expected that FDI improvements will be obtained through this and related measures. 5.4 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME The adoption of technologies without developing local human skills and capacities to manage, integrate and maintain them is not sustainable. As a workforce ages and trained employees leave the marketplace or migrate, knowledge gaps grow and will negatively impact the implementation of the national ICT action plan. Successful implementation requires substantial quantities of trained and highly knowledgeable people. SVG needs to develop and retain knowledge to sustain and support ICT-enabled economic growth and development. It is therefore important that the country embarks on a tailored knowledge management programme. More information and best practices on knowledge management (KM) is given in Appendix 5. Action Item: Action Item: Invest Promotion will establish a brochure which effectively promotes SVG as an ideal location for ICT Investments Six Step Approach to Implementing KM Projects Step 1 - Identify strategic and operational objectives What are the general objectives for the organisation? Consider the business and the environment; Step 2 - Find functional, structural and business value Find actual changes in efficiency and effectiveness that will achieve the desired objectives; Consider the functional and structural organization; Step 3 - Finding and using financially valuable knowledge Knowledge does have an effect on efficiency and effectiveness ; Consider the process and the individual; Step 4 - Quantifying and understanding the knowledge Ensures accurate understanding and codification or personalisation of that resource. Considers the knowledge itself. Step 5 - Integrating with information technology guide the infrastructure that supports the management of knowledge ; Considers information and transmission ; Step 6 - Select knowledge technique and technology Making the right choice of knowledge management technique and enabling technology elements of a KM environment is important. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 73 If employees possess valuable knowledge, government needs to identify this early, define a capture and knowledge-sharing strategy, and close the loop to any vulnerability. Therefore commencing a KM program is a key component of this five year plan. 5.5 CLOUD COMPUTING A growing number of private and public organizations are turning to clouds or investigating the use of clouds to manage key applications, including basic word processing and spreadsheets through Google, CRM tools, ERP and databases. Many major enterprise application vendors have adapted or are adapting their applications to run in the cloud. Cloud computing is a new technology trend that has potential cost and other benefits for the government of SVG, and therefore needs to be investigated further. The Cloud Computing model is illustrated in Figure 17 below. Secure clouds may allow the government of SVG to create ICT resource pools across WANs, which can reduce the number of servers needed by the public sector, boost availability, and improve disaster recovery. This technology has revolutionary potential and therefore a technical team will be established by Government to evaluate the appropriateness, cost and benefits of cloud computing and the possibilities of deployment in St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the OECS Sub-region or the wider Caribbean. More details can be obtained in Appendix 7. 5.6 EFFECTIVE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT Information is the key to success when organised, processed, and available to the right people in a form conducive to rapid accurate decision making enabling the desired results. Poorly structured information prevents accuracy of decision-making. Today, ministries and agencies in SVG are being challenged by ineffective information management, and citizens and businesses are impacted by this shortcoming. Effective information management requires the careful and deliberate blend of human skills, processes and technology. SVG will therefore begin the process of improving information management across the public service with the strategic goal of significantly improving the quality of decision making at all levels of employees.

However for successful implementation, based on an evaluation of the experiences of emerging economies, there are some recommended steps and actions that the Government of SVG must take, namely: Provide effective e-Leadership and Championing Put effective governance arrangements in place Engage an experienced implementation team Obtain funding and optimise procurement Monitor and manage major risks Implement quick wins to build confidence and support Manage the change and transformation Engage all stakeholders and communicate effectively Measure and report progress 7.1 LEADERSHIP E-Leadership is a proven technique for creating an environment of speed and flexibility in the progress towards a digital economy. It will engage employees in the public and private sector and allow radical ideas to thrive as only those enterprises that move fast and innovate first will reap the financial and social rewards the digital economy has to offer. The adoption of technology may represent only a small percent of the transformation process. The rest of an enterprise’s metamorphosis represented by changes in the organisational behaviour and culture are at the heart of e- Leadership. As an e-Leader, the job is to transcend the inappropriate staid old culture and create an environment that encourages and rewards creativity, imagination, innovation, collegiality and discipline. History teaches us that, the societies to which wealth and power gravitate to, are less likely to be those that in response to challenges over a long period of time painstakingly build the enabling governance systems and institutions such that after it is finally built, it is obsolete; but rather those either by historical accident, or by seizing critical and timely opportunities, or by bold reforms become readied for the coming wave of change. The leadership of the Ministry responsible for telecommunications, Science, Technology and Innovation and the Government of SVG will provide strong leadership at the national, sub- regional, regional and global level to adopt ICT and promote SVG and the Caribbean as a competitive place. 7.2 GOVERNANCE The National ICT Plan is ambitious in its scope and impact. However, based on the experiences of several small island states, including Malta and Singapore, it is achievable. But one on the biggest challenges that has been identified over the past few years is the issue of governance. The Plan has many programmes and projects which will take many years to implement. Implementation of the Plan will require the coordination of many ICT initiatives that are T MOVING TO IMPLEMENTATION St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 86 currently underway in different ministries and agencies, and which have different funding bodies and mechanisms, and which have differing existing governance arrangements. However, unless synergies are created, resources are optimised, and all current planned and proposed ICT initiatives are aligned and coordinated, St. Vincent and the Grenadines will not achieve the known benefits of moving to a knowledge-based society in a reasonable timeframe. The key to success is effective governance. There are several mechanisms proposed to ensure that the national ICT Plan is executed in a coordinated and optimised manner. Firstly, there is the need for a Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister responsible for Telecommunications, Science and Technology Innovation. It should include Ministers from the key ministries who are impacted by the Plan and who need to support its implementation, such as Ministers responsible for education, tourism, agriculture, health and finance. The Committee should have representation at the Permanent Secretary level, including the Permanent Secretary with responsibility for ICT. The Ministerial Steering Committee will have the mandate to ensure the following objectives are achieved: The Plan is fully aligned with the national development goals of the country It is implemented as a cohesive whole and is fully integrated Appropriate funding and other resources are provided for its successful implementation The Government On-line and Business Process Re-design initiatives are coordinated across Government The engagement of the private sector and civil society is maximised EGRIP, CKLN, CTU and other regional initiatives are integrated, aligned and optimised with the Plan The initiatives of the proposed ICT Industry Association are supported The Plan is monitored and controlled throughout its life Risks are monitored and managed in a proactive manner As the Plan moves deeper into implementation and horizontal projects across ministries and agencies come into focus, the need for a Chief Information Communication Technology Officer for Government should be pursued. This Officer will be responsible for common infrastructure across the public sector such as the government backbone, the portal, common policies and standards, horizontal business applications, e- services, strategic outsourcing, liaising with bodies such as CARICOM, ECTEL, OECS, CTU and the ITU on ICT matters, and reporting to the Steering Committee on implementation of the National ICT Plan. The Plan places emphasis on growing the ICT sector so that it can make a significant contribution to the economic well-being of SVG. It also supports greater use of ICT within the business community to facilitate internal efficiencies and effectiveness and to optimise the supply chains, and connectivity to the global marketplace. Given the relatively low level of ICT usage in business, the creation of an ICT Industry Association is a good mechanism to encourage collaboration and cohesion across the business community. This Association should be implemented and managed by the private sector with support and encouragement from Government. Its mandate will be to achieve the following objectives: Grow the ICT sector itself Facilitate the greater use of ICT by the business community Organise the business community to support the national ICT plan, including possible strategic outsourcing Encourage and support the use of ICT by citizens and visitors by going on-line with products and services Grow e-commence within SVG 7.3 IMPLEMENTATION TEAM It is recognised that some of the initiatives proposed in the Plan are new; some are already in train, but need to be aligned with the national ICT vision; and some are in the planning stage. The resources that are available to execute the Plan are heavily dependent on what can be allocated by Government. Given the need for a dedicated focus on getting the Plan operational, there is a requirement for a National ICT Implementation Secretariat to get the implementation effort started. The Implementation Secretariat will evolve as the initiatives of the Plan accelerate, but its immediate mandate is as follows: Operationalise the National ICT Plan in the shortest possible time Initiate and deliver the Quick Win Projects Accelerate procurement consistent with the requirements of funding agencies and Government Support the promotion and awareness effort Begin the coordination process across government Moving to Implementation P a g e | 87 Report progress to the focal points, lead ministry and the Steering & Advisory Committee This Secretariat is not expected to have more than 3 to 5 resources at inception but should be headed by a senior officer who is well respected in the ICT community and across government. Initially the National ICT Implementation Secretariat (NICTIS) will be centred in the EGRIP project which has funding for the next 4 years. It will incorporate two technical persons from the ITSD and E-Government units as supporting staff to assist with the monitoring. It will be directly involved in the implementation of EGRIP project activities It will closely monitor and be indirectly involved in Non-EGRIP project activities by other agencies. Monitor the progress of new initiatives and proposals which arise at different times The Implementation Secretariat will liaise with designated ICT Officers (ICTOs), ICT or communication departments in each ministry and department and provide coordination of all ICT Activities. The National ICT Steering & Advisory Forum will provide approval of the government ICT policy and major initiatives and make recommendations to Cabinet. The various governance arrangements are illustrated in Figure 17 which follows.

The functions of NICTIMS is summarised in Table 11 below, and the various relationships in Figure 18 which follow. Other Government agencies will be mandated to cooperate with the NICTIS, ITSD and National ICT SAF to ensure that the objectives of the National ICT Strategy & Action Plan and the policies and objectives are achieved.

However it is generally true that international agencies will support well designed ICT programmes and that there is often room to optimise existing resources assigned to ICT initiatives across government when they are reviewed as an all-of-government portfolio. The Steering Advisory Committee (NICTSAF) and the National ICT Implementation Secretariat (NICTIS) therefore play critical roles in obtaining funding for the Plan. It is difficult to determine the cost of implementing the Plan without considerable more analysis and doing a more detailed design of each programme, project, or initiative. However using a costing by analogy process based on similar Plans in other island states, the potential budget for the Plan to 2015 will be in the order of US$ 25 million. This figure does not include investments made by the private sector in its own operations. 7.4.1 Source of Additional Funding or Cost Savings Several other avenues for funding will be investigated and utilised, including the following: 1. Currently the Regulation of the Telecommunications Sector is fairly well funded through the collection of spectrum fees. 2. The regulations of the ICT Sector can also be funded by similar fees from regulating ICT services and using the same NTRC / ECTEL administrative structure. 3. Through the OECS EGRIP, there will be economies of scale in the regional procurement of software licenses, the creation of a regional expert and applications maintenance team. 4. Leveraging the support of the regional organisations for attendance at workshops, ICT industry meetings and advice at: CARICOM, CTU, ITU, CKLN and CARICAD. 5. Utilize the Taiwan ICT Centre to accelerate the creation of costly applications and avoid the cost of some expensive consultants and technical expertise. 6. Embrace Cloud Computing and Data Services to reduce costs. 7. Fully establish the Government Backbone to reduce cost of Government owned Intranet initiatives 8. Leverage the National ICT Strategy and Action Plan to obtain funding from donor organisations International best practice has also shown that unless the procurement process within government is streamlined, the various initiatives will not align and integrate, and the aggressive timeline of the implementation will not be achieved, and ultimately the success of the integration across government will be stymied. It is therefore necessary for the National ICT Implementation Secretariat to work with the procurement agencies to streamline the processes within the accepted procurement policies and laws to ensure that the goods and services needed for success are procured when required. 7.5 RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is about the identification of the things that can go wrong in the implementation of the Plan and about designing plans to manage and mitigate such risks. An ambitious Plan such as this will be faced with many risks. These risks vary from lack of funding, insufficient human resources for execution, to weak stakeholder support. Some of the risks as associated mitigated actions are now considered. One of the major risks is that of insufficient funding allocated to the implementation effort. This risk has been addressed in the process of development of the Plan to some degree, in that the SWGs were quite inclusive and therefore would have generated a degree of awareness and support for the Plan itself, which will facilitate the funding effort. The probability of this risk happening is high, using a high/medium/low scale. However, its impact is considered medium, using a high/medium/low scale, as some of these initiatives are already underway and in some cases available resources can be re-focussed if needed. The key mitigation strategies for this risk is to prioritise and focus on the key initiatives that best support the national development effort and to do these projects in the immediate term. Additionally, the various funding and development agencies need to be engaged immediately as they will often support well designed and managed initiatives. And finally, a robust mechanism for submitting budget requests to Government must be developed and implemented, which will include monitoring processes, and detailed reporting on achievements and on the associated outputs, impacts and outcomes. The second challenge that the Plan will face is the potential loss of momentum between the completion and approval of this Plan and its implementation. The probability of the risk is medium but its impact would be high. The probability of the risk is medium because the plan itself is supported by key stakeholders, including senior public officials. The key mitigating strategy is to move forward with the quick win initiatives immediately so that progress is demonstrated even while the Plan is being formally approved. Moving to Implementation P a g e | 91 The scarcity of human resources to implement the Plan will always pose a serious risk. The Plan requires a broad range of skills and experience that may not be present within Government nor within St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The probability of this risk is high and the impact would be high. However, this risk can be managed by carefully prioritising the initiatives to enable skills and expertise to be developed over the implementation period, and to target the Diaspora for resources as well as strategically utilising external contracted resources. It is essential that Implementation Secretariat be appropriately staffed from inception. While there are many other risks that will need to be reviewed and managed in the coming years, the final risk that will be identified is that of lack of coordination and integration across and within government itself, leading to a fragmentation of the implementation effort and unmanageable competition for the limited human and financial resources available with the country. The risk of this happening is considered medium with the impact on the success of the plan being high. The risk is considered to medium because the benefits of ICT across government is generally well known and well accepted, and therefore it is expected that once the Plan is seen to benefit all stakeholders in the medium term, co-operation will be eventually facilitated. However, to ensure that this risk is mitigated, the use of an Executive Sponsor in the form of a Minister is required. The Minister in charge of the Steering Committee is the clear choice or the Prime Minister if deemed necessary. The use of the Executive Sponsor will also mitigate any political risks that impact the Plan. 7.6 QUICK WINS It is important to kick-start the implementation of the Plan as soon as possible to ensure that momentum is not lost from the planning effort and to build on the support created through the use of the Sector Working Groups. This can be achieved by the implementation of some Quick Win projects (summarised in Table 12 on the following page) which have the following characteristics: They can commence with relatively few resources that are generally available They have a high probability of success and deliver tangible results They can be completed within 6 to 9 months They will have high visibility and can generate significant support amongst a broad range of stakeholders They demonstrate Government’s commitment to the success of the Plan About Quick Wins It is proposed that these quick win projects will be completed within six months using existing resources, while funding is sought for the larger more medium term projects and programmes. However, dedicated resources and a focussed effort is required if the various portals are to be created within this timeframe.

Government will need to develop a change management strategy which will facilitate and strengthen the service delivery culture within the public service and which will encourage the establishment and measurement of service delivery standards across all service delivery channels on a routine and regular basis. 7.8 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS It is almost self-evident that unless stakeholders buy into the initiatives being implemented on their behalf that investments in technology will be of limited value. It is therefore critical that stakeholder engagement be strengthened so that the programmes and projects continue to be shaped to meet their needs. This is important in the case of industry as they are required to make investments in ICT and in training their people in order to derive the benefits of the initiatives being pursued under the Plan. Citizens and communities will need to be fully engaged if they are to grasp the opportunities that will be presented to them on the educational and training front and at the community level. The communications effort will need to be sustained and focussed, and will therefore required dedicated resources and appropriate funding over the life of the Plan. 7.9 MONITORING AND REPORTING It is generally accepted that what is measured, monitored and reported gets focussed attention by the stakeholders who are impacted. It is important that the outputs, outcomes and impacts of the implementation of the national ICT Plan be measured and reported. In many instances, current measurement systems will suffice such as the systems in place with NTRC and ECTEL for the telecommunications sector. In many cases though, new measurements systems will have to be put in place to determine the impact and outcomes of the wide range of ICT initiatives. This may involve support from the Central Statistical Office and the commissioning of other surveys which is critical to the success of the Plan, and ensuring on-going support of development and funding agencies. It is also important that the progress of SVG against the Plan is routinely reported to international agencies such as the ITU, World Economic Forum and other bodies that rank countries on their e-agenda, so that SVG’s progress can be properly reflected on the international stage. The Advisory Committee and the Implementation Secretariat Committee will have important roles in ensuring that monitoring and reporting is appropriate to the requirements of the Plan. 7.10 ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE CORE ICT INDICES The National ICT Implementation & Monitoring Secretariat (NICTIMS) will ensure the relevant national agencies, National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (NTRC), National Statistical Office (NSO) and UNESCO Education Statistical Secretariat conducts annual surveys in the five (5) areas of interest. 1. ICT Infrastructure (NTRC - ITU). 2. House-Hold ICT usage (NSO - ITU) 3. Business usage of ICT (NSO - UNCTAD) 4. ICT Trade (NSO – UNCTAD and 5. ICT use in Education (UNESCO). The ICT Infrastructure will be conducted quarterly; however, the Household assessment can only realistically be conducted every 10 years as part of a census as in 2001 and now in 2011. The business and Educational surveys will be conducted for the first time in 2011 and subsequently on an annual basis. Several projects, including the Laptop per Student Project and the use of the USF to improve connectivity will significantly improve all the Vincentian indices and is likely to catapult SVG to an unprecedented top bracket of the global rankings. Conclusion P a g e | 95 CONCLUSION St. Vincent and the Grenadines have commenced on an exciting new journey of accelerating the country to a knowledge-based society and economy through the implementation of a pragmatic and well-thought our national ICT strategy and action plan. This re-launch is built of the good successes of the previous national ICT strategy, and has been crafted by a large number of stakeholders. The Plan recognises the challenges facing its implementation and the cost to achieve its strategic outcomes but it is expected that with exemplary e-leadership at the senior levels, with good project management, with continued broad stakeholder involvement and with pride, enthusiasm and support of citizens and businesses, then SVG will grow and prosper with ICT in the coming years. An exciting new future is being created for the children and the people of SVG. The Strategy & Action Plan will be reviewed annually by the Ministry responsible for Telecommunications, the National ICT Ministerial Steering & Advisory Forum (NIMSAF) and Stakeholders. The grid of current projects and new ICT initiatives will be upgraded. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 96 POLICY REFERENCES 1.

Cyberspace interconnects our ministries, industries, health systems and crosses national borders. Coordinated national action by government, the private sector, and citizens/users is required for the prevention of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from incidents. Cooperation and coordination with international partners are also required. Goals: 1. Create awareness at national policy level about cyber security and the need for national action and international cooperation. 2. Develop a national strategy to enhance cyber security to reduce the risks and effects of cyber disruptions. 3. Participate in international efforts for the prevention of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from incidents. Specific Steps to Achieve Goals: 1. Persuade national leaders in government of the need for national action to address threats to and vulnerabilities of national cyber infrastructure through policy level discussions. 2. 2. Appoint a lead person and institution for the overall national effort. Two Computer Security Incident Response Teams will be located in the ITSD and the Royal SVG Police Force with national responsibility (N-CSIRT) will be established, and identify lead institutions for each elements of national strategy. 3. Identify the appropriate experts and policy makers within government ministries, 4. government, and private sector, and their roles. 5. Identify Cooperative arrangements for and among all participants. 6. Establish mechanisms for cooperation among government and private sector entities at the national level. 7. Identify international expert counterparts and foster international efforts to address cyber security issues, including information sharing assistance efforts. 8. Establish an integrated risk management process for identifying and prioritizing protective efforts for cyber security. 9. Assess and periodically reassess the current state of cyber security efforts and develop program priorities. 10. Identify training requirements and how to achieve them. Government-Industry collaboration Policy: The protection of cyberspace is a shared responsibility that requires cooperation between governments at all levels and the private sector, which owns and operates much of the underlying infrastructure. Goals: 1. Develop government-industry collaborations that work effectively manage cyber risk and to protect cyberspace. 2. Provide a mechanism for bringing a variety of perspective, equities, and knowledge together to reach consensus and move 3. forward together to enhance security at a national level. Specific Steps To Achieve Goals: 1. Include industry perspectives in the earliest stages of development and implementation of security policy and related efforts. 2. Encourage development of private sector groups from different critical infrastructure industries to address common security interests collaboratively with government. 3. Bring private sector groups and government together in trusted forums to address common cyber security challenges. 4. Encourage cooperation among groups from interdependent industries. 5. Establish cooperative arrangements between government and the private sector for incident management. Deterring Cybercrime Policy: The protection of cyberspace requires updating criminal laws, procedures and policy to address and respond to Cybercrime. Goals: 1. Assess the current legal authorities for adequacy. A country should review its criminal code to determine if it is adequate to address current (and future) problems. 2. Draft and adopt substantive, procedural and mutual assistance laws and policies to address computer related crime. 3. Establish or identify national Cybercrime units. 4. Develop cooperative relationships with other elements of the national cyber- St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 104 security infrastructure and the private sector. 5. Develop an understanding among prosecutors, judges, and legislators of Cybercrime issues. 6. Participate in the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network. Development of Incident Management Capabilities Policy: The protection of cyberspace requires an organization to serve as the national focal point for securing cyberspace, whose mission includes watch, warning, response and recovery efforts and the facilitation of collaboration between and among government entities at the national, state and local levels; the private sector; academia; and the international community. Goals: 1. Develop a coordinated national cyberspace security response system to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and recover from cyber incidents. 2. Establish a focal point for managing cyber incidents that bring together critical elements from government (including law enforcement) and essential elements from infrastructure operators and vendors to reduce both the risk and severity of incidents. 3. Participate in watch, warning and incident response information sharing mechanisms. 4. Develop, test and exercise emergency response plans, procedures, and protocols to ensure that government and non- government collaborators can build trust and coordinate effectively in a crisis. Specific Steps To Achieve Goals: 1. Identify or establish a national Computer Security Incident Response Team (N-CSIRT). 2. Establish mechanisms within government for coordination among civilian and government agencies. 3. Establish collaborative relationships with industry to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from national cyber incidents. 4. Establish point(s) of contact within government agencies, industry and international partners to facilitate consultation, cooperation, and information exchange with the N-CSIRT. 5. Participate in international cooperative and information sharing activities. 6. Develop tools and procedures for the protection of the cyber resources of government entities. 7. Develop a capability through the N-CSIRT for coordination of government operations to respond to and recover from large-scale cyber attacks. 8. Promote responsible disclosure practices to protect operations and the integrity of cyber infrastructure. Develop A Culture Of Cyber Security Policy: Because personal computers are becoming ever more powerful, technologies are converging, the use of ICTs is becoming more and more widespread, and connections across national borders are increasing. All participants who develop, own, provide, manage, service and use information networks must understand cyber security and take action appropriate to their roles to protect cyberspace. Government must take a leadership role in bringing about this culture of cyber security and in supporting the efforts of other participants. Goals 1. Promote a national culture of security consistent with UNGA Resolutions 57/239 creation of global culture of cyber security, and 58/199, Creation of a global culture of cyber security and the protection of critical information infrastructures. Action Item: Action Item: Launch Policy on Cyber security & Cyber Crimes as part of IPv6 Task Force Launch campaign on computer use and misuse in the Public Service and standards for equipment Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 105 Specific Steps To Achieve Goals: 1. Implement a cyber security plan for government – operated systems. 2. Implement security awareness programs and initiatives for users of government systems and networks. 3. Encourage the development of a Culture of Cyber security in business enterprises. 4. Support outreach to civil society with special attention to the needs of children and individual users. 5. Promote a comprehensive national awareness program so that all participants – businesses, the general workforce, and the general population – secure their own parts of cyberspace. 6. Enhance Science and Technology (S&T) and Research and Development (R&D) activities. 7. Review existing privacy regime and update it to the online environment. 8. Develop awareness of cyber risks and available solutions. St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 106 4:INTERNET EXCHANGE POINT (IXP) time progresses and the world’s population continue to increase at an exponential rate, more and more strains are placed on the fixed amount of non- renewable resources that are at our disposal. With the collapse of the banana industry, a fragile tourism industry, a global economic crisis and a culture that is consumer based rather than production based, SVG find itself in a fiscal dilemma trying to chart a way forward. SVG therefore has to turn to non-traditional ways of developing and sustaining the economy. In a modern, competitive, post colonial Caribbean civilization, the nature of our continued existence depend heavily on what we can produce and market on the international market, but the cost of interconnecting and doing business is very expensive. It is imperative that we adapt to new and existing technologies in order to bring about solutions to these problems, and one such strategy is to employ the use of Information Telecommunication Technology (ICT); and in this particular case, the establishment of a National Internet Exchange Point (IXP) as illustrated in Figure 19 above. The primary purpose of an IXP is to allow networks to interconnect directly rather than through one or more 3rd party networks. The advantages of the direct interconnection are numerous, but the primary reasons are cost, latency, and bandwidth. Traffic passing through an exchange is typically not billed by any party. However traffic to an ISP's upstream provider is, and in our particular case, all our local ISPs buy bandwidth from a transit provider in the United States. Moreover, there are quite a number of other benefits that can be derived directly from the establishment of a local IXP and these include: the establishment of a well-defined Internet Economy that would keep SVG internet traffic local, enhance the internet experience of users, reduce overall cost related to providing internet services, promote and encourage the creation of local content, create internet opportunities, and build technical capacity. It would include improved connectivity through fibre optic and high speed wireless (FSO) connectivity, GSM Operators - GPRS/3G Services, establishment of Academic Networks – Providers, E-learning, Local Loop Operators (LLO's) - Voice/data, Content hosting providers - e-business, more of Government including e- government, Multi-media Service providers - SMS/gaming. In addition, aggregation of demand makes it more attractive for additional transit providers to enter the market. As Figure 19: Operational Model for IXP A direct interconnection (often located in the same country or region) avoids the need for data to travel to other countries outside the region to get from one network to another, thus reducing latency and the possibility of attack from cybercrime. The third advantage, speed, is most noticeable in areas that have poorly developed long-distance connections and this is absolutely critical to our web services, telemedicine and video conferencing, etc. ISPs in the Caribbean region normally pay between 10 or 100 times more for data transport than ISPs in North America, Europe or Japan. Therefore, our ISPs typically have slower, more limited connections to the rest of the internet. However, a connection to a local IXP may allow them to transfer data without limit, and without cost, vastly improving the bandwidth between customers of the adjacent ISPs. Appendices 1 – 9 P a g e | 107 At present an email from the Prime Minister to another member of government sitting across the hall must travel the route SVG, Barbados, Antigua, Miami and back before it reaches him. The case of moving the relevant IXP from Miami to St Kitts, a reduction from 6,000 miles (round trip) to perhaps one mile, the decrease in distance is so dramatic that cost can be minimized to near zero, while speeds can be increased from some multiple of STM-1 to 1 GB or 10 GB. A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale to domestic customers, without demanding any significant corresponding capital or operational investment. This would make more bandwidth available for important activities such as video streaming and telemedicine and increase the national penetration of Broadband Internet. An IXP is a prerequisite to the development of any significant domestic content production, hosting, or collocation industry. This barrier must be surpassed before major content providers like Google, Amazon, Akamai, or UltraDNS will even consider providing local services within Caribbean national markets. The increased demand for these services, and ISPs ability to supply them at a new lower price-point, serves to increase both market penetration and the total revenue-value of the market, relative to the pre-IXP status-quo. The maturation of the local network infrastructure provides a nucleus for education and retention of the Internet-skilled labour force that ISPs, central government, schools and the private sector need in order to continue their growth and economic progress. Furthermore, sending sensitive data across national borders presents a privacy risk to governments and corporations. By keeping local traffic local, sensitive data is not subject to inspection by other governments. Then too, the having a local IXP will aid in the setting up of a local certificate authority and web hosting facility. This will enable more of our businesses to do ecommerce in a safer and more secure internet environment. An IXP enables co-ordination of security, infrastructure protection, and abuse response activities. As our society becomes more ICT oriented and internet dependent, so too will number of incidents of cyber crime. Internet crimes are not like traditional crimes and can be committed across jurisdiction. Having an IXP will make it easier for us to track and bring these criminals to justice. An IXP will, therefore, add more value to projects like CKLN, EGRIP and the Intranet Backbone It will also make available a logical place to locate, and hence attract, other Internet infrastructure resources. For example top-level name servers, time servers, performance measurement tools, research projects. Action: Establishing The IXP  Communicate with the internet society the desire to establish the IXP  Form a small working-group of committed- participant organizations  Determine a neutral location that is acceptable to all  Define an IXP policy document that participants agree to abide by  Secure small IPv4 and IPv6 subnets from ARIN/LACNIC for the peering subnet  Install a Gigabit-Ethernet capable switch  Configure BGP rout- announcement between peers. Fully include the community in the process; awareness raising and training activities may be necessary. Potential members will need to be familiar with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used for routing between networks, and each network will need to have a publicly registered Autonomous System Number (ASN) for their exchange communications. This can be obtained from the relevant Regional Internet Registry.  Establishment of neutral ISP associations capable of managing IXPs and other shared facilities on behalf of their members  The most important features of the IXP facility are reliable and redundant power supplies, air conditioning, security, space for growth, and access to communications infrastructure. Most important, the facility should retain a neutral status with its members. Proximity and accessibility of the facility are also factors to consider. IPV6 also brings with it a number of benefits such as the quality of service required for some new applications like IP telephony, video/audio, interactive games or ecommerce which can be delivered over the network. This version easily deals with the avoidance of network traffic, loss of data or bandwidth. Appendices 1 – 9 P a g e | 108 Transition to IPv6 With the depletion of IPV4, a new version of the Internet Protocol was established called IPV6, also known as IP Next Generation (IPNG). This version seeks to address the main issue of exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or host. It has a large address space of 128 bits compared to 32 bits of the version 4. The introduction of this version means that SVG will have to take stock of what exists and with its ICT National Plan see how greater use of the initiatives can be implemented bearing in mind IPV6 would soon be adopted around the world. In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the following benefits: 1) Increased address space 2) More efficient routing 3) Reduced management requirement 4) Improved methods to change ISP 5) Better mobility support 6) Multi-homing 7) Security 8) Scoped address: link-local, site-local and global-address space The increased number of paths learned through an IXP improves routing efficiency and fault-tolerance for participants and renders participants far more resilient to international cable failures. Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 109 5: KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT The adoption of technologies without developing human skills and capacities to manage, integrate and sustain them. The centralized use of technologies by national government departments, without developing and extending the benefit of technology to intermediary institutions, such as local government, parliament, parties, civil society organization and independent media. A failure to link better governance to broader and more inclusive democracy which gives voice to those who cannot afford technologies, but have needs and ideas to express. These are all critical lessons learned in the use of ICT for development. Historically, the focus has been on building front- end visibility with the citizen. However, while establishing superior citizen experiences, the backend must be made capable to ensure such initiatives are not wasted. Clearly, the quality of the infrastructure must be continuously managed and strengthened to ensure maximum citizen care. Governance frameworks and technology architectures must integrate the human, financial and social aspects to guarantee precision and accuracy of response. The main advantage of any advance in technology is to allow more attention to the real goals and challenges of knowledge management (KM), which will always concentrate on people and operational issues. Improved portal, content management and collaboration (PCC) facilities have removed many of the basic technical impediments to using knowledge assets in enterprises. KM projects can concentrate on where to target these efforts and how to manage them effectively - see Figure 20 below - using the following steps. Step 1 - Identify strategic and operational objectives. What are the general objectives for the organisation? Consider the business and the environment. Step 2 - Find functional, structural and business value. Find actual changes in efficiency and effectiveness that will achieve the desired objectives. Consider the functional and structural organisation. Step 3 - Finding and using financially valuable knowledge. Knowledge does have an effect on efficiency and effectiveness. Consider the process and the individual. Step 4 - Quantifying and understanding the knowledge. Ensures accurate understanding and codification or personalisation of that resource. Consider the knowledge itself. Step 5 - Integrating with information technology guide the infrastructure that supports the management of knowledge. Consider information and transmission. Step 6 - Select knowledge technique and technology. Making the right choice of knowledge management technique and enabling technology elements of a KM environment. Critical components which should not be ignored in the development process include:  Security  Infrastructure  Enterprise Applications Integration  People & Learning  Connectivity  Collaboration  Storage  Disaster Protection Figure20: Six step approach to implementing knowledge management projects St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 110 Table 13: Knowledge Management Trends Knowledge Management In Government It is critical to design a KM program aimed at knowledge sharing and preservation to ensure no loss of knowledge occurs as a result of key employees leaving the organization or retiring or to maintain strong levels of security - see KM trends in Table 13 above. If employees possess valuable knowledge, government needs to identify this early, define a capture and knowledge-sharing strategy based on their personal style, and close the loop to any vulnerability. If this process is not planned for disaster it could lead to an imminent crisis. The exit strategy should be based on risk mitigation. It's important to note that: 1) The knowledge transfer question is relevant for all workforce reconfiguration programs, including those stemming from reorganization, outsourcing, mergers and acquisitions and consolidation. Retirement is quite possibly the only thing on any organization’s radar screen that it can anticipate. 2) Determining who has the knowledge is a process of interaction, interviews and open- ended questions. If stakeholders wait for an investment in software tools for this, they'll never capture the knowledge before people leave. 3) The knowledge transfer process could be more about how to reconstruct knowledge than how to replicate or document it. 4) The living, breathing interview process quickly reveals who are the high-value members — those people who form the connective tissue, to whom many people in multiple constituent groups turn for information and whose importance in that role is seldom acknowledged or recognized. 1. Government policies are driving more educators to tailor their instruction to the individual needs of students 2. Important constituency groups expect to see technology used in the classroom 3. Online learning offers a solution to the challenge of increasing access while maintaining costs 4. Popular support has waned for using technology as a tool to reform education institutions 5. Technology purchases must compete with other priorities for increasingly scarce budgetary resources and must be targeted and cost-effective 6. Moving to the next level of technology adoption requires significant and difficult behavioural changes 7. The most appealing solutions must also provide compelling evidence of their effectiveness 8. Seeking the benefits of standardization, lessons learnt and proven benefits, institutions will migrate from point to enterprise-wide solutions 9. The acceptance of Cloud Computing and other vendor-hosted solutions and other delivery options will grow in the market 10. The uptake of LMS solutions will expand rapidly in the Caribbean’s higher education market 11. There are four approaches that institutions are likely to take when selecting an LMS solution 12. Institutional preferences for LMS solutions are not monolithic and vary across geographic regions 13. Lecture capture solutions represent the next horizon for extending the power of LMS solutions. The deployment of Master Teachers (The best teachers) to teach across the network will emerge Action Item: Examine existing KM projects to ensure that they address the trends and best practices of Table 13. Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 111 KM In Technical Support Most ICT managers who want to start their KM initiatives begin with the ICT department. Technical support is a good place to start, as it is an expensive, high-profile function where finding the right answer quickly is critical. ICT service and support delivered via a Web portal is a proven method of increasing customer satisfaction and significantly lowering costs. Lowering costs can be the main driver for a self- service Web portal. However, ICT organizations also look to self-service to improve the consistency and quality of service support, reduce the volume of unnecessary status checks, expand the hours of operations of ICT support, involve employees more in the process of service support design, allow employees to solve issues quicker, offer another avenue for requesting service, and educate employees on how to resolve future issues independently. While ICT can be a good place to start, we find that extending systems developed here to the rest of the organization is rarely successful. ICT employees are generally more receptive to these techniques, and the systems developed for ICT generally do not meet the needs of Line-of- Business (LOB) groups. Several vendors offer packaged solutions for help desk KM, either as part of an overall service management package or standalone. The alternative is to build your own solution. KM In A High-Performance Workplace Justification for position and speed of adoption Knowledge management first appeared in a Hype Cycle in 1997, and has since followed a predictable path through the hype. It has now left the Trough of Disillusionment and begun to climb the Slope of Enlightenment. It is expected that KM will go off the hype cycle, due to its widespread adoption. The wide variety of technologies that enable knowledge management — portals, content management, collaboration and many others — are steadily improving their support for the human and work processes of knowledge management. Action Item: Sensitize the Public and Private Sector to benefits of KM KM governance requires both top-down and bottom-up efforts, although much more of the latter than the former. Action Item: Enterprises can use knowledge management programs to support individual users, teams or their entire organization. But they should concentrate on teams, as research shows that this is where the greatest benefits arise in terms of productivity and innovation.

The burden of poorly structured information eliminates accuracy of decision- making. Today, organisations in every sector are experiencing the reality of this perspective as they strive to maintain a competitive position, increase effectiveness or offer efficiency, in an environment shaped by value and quality of information. The traditional boundaries of the organisation are becoming increasingly blurred as business partnerships evolve into complex interrelationships, customers and citizens expect rapid access to services and localised operations feel the impact of globalisation. Information management no longer represents a repository but a transactional capability for simpler, faster, secure collaboration. As with any transactional environment, tactical investments in solutions introduce the risk of unmanageable chaos. The added challenge of effectively information use requires the careful and deliberate blend of human skills, processes and technology. All such tactical investments require strategy formulation driven ultimately by the requirements of individuals and groups, as well as by the objectives of the organisation. There must be a solid underlying infrastructure that provides cost effective storage, security, and business continuity; a management layer to handle classification, lifecycle management, integration, and data quality; a services layer to provide information capture, search, retrieval, query, and analysis; and a delivery layer to enable reporting, publishing, customisation, and collaboration. These capabilities must span structured and unstructured information, combine both tangible and intangible sources, and be abstracted as far as possible from individual technologies.

Many argue that government need not get involved in the details of buying and maintaining complex computer systems. Consequently, Governments around the world are actively looking into cloud computing as a means of increasing efficiency and reducing cost. This Appendix outlines highlight the value and risk associated with this new concept. However, before exploring the merits of Cloud computing it’s important to understand fundamental concepts including the definition, characteristics and variation. Definition According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” Characteristics They also identify five characteristics of cloud computing - see Figure 21 above:  On demand self-service  Broad Network Access  Resource Pooling  Rapid Elasticity and  Measured Service1 Service Models The relationship between cloud client and provider can vary significantly. An organization can pay an outside cloud provider for data, applications, operating platforms, raw digital storage, and/or processing resources: Data as a Service (DaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), respectively. Deployment Method These can be categorised using four services models – public, private, community and hybrid. The public model can be considered the original model of cloud computing. In this typical cloud computing scenario organisations run their applications from a data centre provided by a third-party – the cloud provider. Pros Figure 22 highlights the Pros of Public Cloud computing. A key advantage is that the provider is responsible for providing the infrastructure, servers, storage and networking necessary to ensure the availability and scalability of the applications. This allows Government to focus on what matters and without having to worry about technology side of things. Cloud computing allows government to buy in only wanted services, when wanted, cutting the upfront capital costs of computers and peripherals. Additionally, extra services can be added (or taken away) at a moment's notice as needs change without waiting weeks or months for the new computer (and its software) to arrive. G Benefits  Management moves to cloud provider  Reduce costs  Resource sharing is more efficient  Cost based on consumption  Faster time to roll out new services  Dynamic resource availability for crunch periods Figure 22: Benefits to Cloud Computing Figure 21: Cloud Computing St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 116 No doubt this model also lends itself well to Government agencies more efficiently, and effectively sharing resources. Inhibitors Despite all heralded pros of Cloud computing Governments must be sober its adoption of this concept. The following questions represent some of the more popular considerations requiring resolution before the adoption of cloud computing within any government - refer to Figure 23. Governance Arrangement: Who owns/accesses/deletes/replicates data in the cloud? Legislation, policies and regulations: The legal framework must support this concept therefore Governments must develop the relevant policies and regulations that would support the proper implementation and offer protection to all parties involved. Analyse Hidden Cost: Instead of purchasing computers and software, cloud computing means you buy services, so one-off, upfront capital costs become ongoing operating costs instead. Higher ongoing operating costs. Will cloud computing work out more expensive? Lock-in: Governments’ options are limited to what’s being offered by providers. Furthermore the risk of being locked into proprietary or vendor-recommended systems is very real. Consideration must be given to the ease of migration to another system or service provider if needed to? Additionally, how interoperable would one cloud be to another offered by a different provider? Need for Robust SLA: Greater dependency on service providers requires government to develop robust SLS to ensure that problems get resolved quickly? Availability & Reliability: What happens if supplier suddenly decides to stop supporting a product or system you've come to depend on? Security and Privacy: Potential privacy and security risks of putting valuable data on someone else's system in an unknown location? Where does the data reside and does the location have legal ramifications. “Public and private clouds aren’t for every organization and every situation,” concludes PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Lobel, “but they will play a key role in ICT.”A technical team will evaluate the appropriateness, cost and benefits of cloud computing and the possibilities of deployment in St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the OECS Sub-region or the wider Caribbean.

To assist in achieving this goal, the indicators must have associated statistical standards and guidance. There are currently 46 ICT indicators in the 2010 revised core list and two (2) reference indicators. In comparison, the 2005 list only contained 41 ICT indicators. The Geneva phase of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in 2003 highlighted the importance of benchmarking and measuring progress towards the Information Society. The 2005 Tunis phase of WSIS re-iterated the importance and at the second phase of WSIS, held in Tunis in November 2005 the final list was officially launched. The 2005 core list included 41 core ICT indicators in several groups: (1) ICT infrastructure and access; (2) access to, and use of, ICT by households and individuals; (3) use of ICT by businesses; the ICT sector; and (4) trade in ICT goods. The original 41 core list and the revisions it underwent were based on a supply/demand conceptual model of the information society. Feedback on the policy and practical relevance of the core indicators in 2008 and their particular relevance resulted in the addition of new categories in the household and business use indicators to reflect changes in the nature of ICT use. They included categories on mobile Internet access, updates to means of Internet access to include mobile broadband, more details on communication using the Internet, new business Internet activities and the adoption of OECD tariff basket methodology for measuring mobile cellular prepaid tariffs. An important improvement to the first core list has been the addition of eight new indicators on measuring ICT in education which were developed by the UNESCO. A number of other possible ICT indicators, including indicators on (1) the economic and social impacts of ICT, (2) e-government, (3) barriers to ICT use, (4) ICT expenditure, (5) investment, (6) trade in ICT services, (7) ICT security & (7) trust are being developed. Indicators in these and other areas, such as (8) use of mobile telephony and (9) digital content, may be added to the core list in the future, after more development work. The core indicators on ICT infrastructure and access are collected by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as part of a much larger collection of telecommunication indicators. The ITU data, some of which go back as far as 1960, are published in the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database (ITU) and are defined in ITU’s Telecommunication Indicators Handbook (ITU, 2007). Data for the indicators come from several sources, the main one of which is an annual survey of telecommunication authorities and some private companies. Other sources include reports provided by telecommunication regulatory authorities, ministries and operators. Because data are collected from providers rather than users, they are widely available for both developed and developing economies. ICT household and educational statistics should be collected by National Statistical Offices through household surveys and census. Most developed economies have been collecting these statistics for years, using model OECD questionnaires. Other economies are making good progress in collecting these indicators using the core indicators and associated standards. Most countries do not have good time series of ICT access and ICT use data and much of the available data are out-of-date, therefore, less useful, given the pace of change in adoption of many technologies. In St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (NTRC) has been only mandated to collect infrastructure, traffic, tariff, policy, legislative, regulatory and infrastructure investment data which includes the core ICT Infrastructure Indices and forward it to the ITU. However, the other core indices (Household access and use, business, trade and education were not being collected and forwarded by the National Statistical Office or any agency. Instead there has been a reliance on old data from the 2001 National Census which precedes the tremendous advances in household usage of ICT, the introduction of one laptop (Net-book) per student and the Educational Revolution. A new collaborative approach will ensure this data is collected, posted on several Web sites (NTRC, Government and National Statistical Office Web sites and forwarded to the relevant international agencies (ITU, UNCTAD and UNESCO). St. Vincent & the Grenadines plans to make a major leap in ICT usage indices in 2011.

Gonsalves P a g e | iii                                      ur country has not been immune from  the challenges facing the world today,  whether it is the impact of a weakened   global financial market or the reduction in  tourist visits to the Caribbean. We are faced  with a contracting agricultural sector due to  the loss of preferential prices for our bananas  and other products. There are many  limitations to our small size and economies of  scale as with other Small Island Developing  State’ (SIDS) emerging economy. However,  there are also advantages to our size in the  ability to more easily implement critical  proven innovations on a national scale. More- so the technologies of today, whether it is the  mobile telephone, the Internet, the high speed  global communications infrastructure, user  friendly and easier-to-adapt software  applications, or the ever-more powerful and  affordable computers, have been changing the  world and creating opportunites for countries  like ours to leap frog and overcome the  challenges of size, location and time.  Information and Communication Technologies  (ICTs) have changed the way the world works   and re-defined how countries trade and  interact with their citizens and with each  other. ICTs have created the opportunity for  us to create a new vision and to build a new  future for our people, our children and our  country.  The National 20-25 Plan has set a goal of  becoming a Modern, Competitive,  Multifaceted, Post-Colonial Economy which is  local, national, regional, and global in its  approach.  St. Vincent & the Grenadines (SVG)  had developed an ICT Strategy and Action  Plan 2002 -2007, and I am pleased to state  that we achieved most of our goals.  We have recognised the importance of  carefully crafting a National ICT Strategic Plan  which will take our country to 2015. We  understand the need to build international  relationships and to respond to the pressures  of globalisation; and, therefore, I want to  assure you of our country’s commitment to  the creation of a knowledge-based and  smarter society. Our Ministry for  Telecommunicatioins, Science, Technology  and Innovation is mandated to ensure that our   country is in the best possible position, in all  sectors, to capitalise on the enabling  capabilities of ICT. As we look to build and  strengthen our service industry, ICT is going  to play a vital role and the Caribbean is in an  excellent location to offer a range of services  like off-shoring and developing and  promoting its creativity, culture and rich local  content. The Ministry is looking to mould  local ICT entrepreneurs with its various  programmes and workshops, providing the  necessary tools alongside business advice. We  expect that the business community will rise  to the occasion and grow the emerging ICT  sector so that it makes a greater contribution  to the national economy.  We also recognise the importance of having a  broad concensus on how ICT can be used to  support our national development effort and  as a consequence, this National ICT Plan has  been developed through the efforts of a large  number of people who participated in our  Sector Working Groups. These Working  Groups utilised the expertise and experience  of both the public and private sectors and,   O      Prime Minister and Minister of Telecommunications, Science & Technology  Dr. Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves      PREFACE        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | iv        therefore, took a holistic view of the  programmes and projects that need to be  pursued to 2015. You would see that the Plan  addresses both government and the private  sectors, and will impact on every citizen  within the country and in the Diaspora, and  on every business on our islands. Therefore   for the Plan to be successful, every business,  citizen, government employee and civil  society organisation must be on board and  working towards the common good of St.  Vincent and the Grenadines.  I am pleased to state that ICT has been given  prominance and a high level of priority, and   that ICT is ‘moving on’ in St Vincent and the  Grenadines. I am very happy to join our  people and our country as we accelerate  towards a modern competitive knowledge- based and smart society as we seek to support  the national development aspirations of our  people.        Foreword: Dr. Honourable Jerrol C Thompson P a g e | v                                          ost strategies are designed to offer  solutions to ‘problems’. These  strategies are delivered through   frameworks and techniques that often  necessitate the execution of costly  experimental ‘trial to decide’ approaches to  achieving developmental goals. This approach  may offer substantial benefits by increasing  the awareness of the specific role played by  market forces in shaping the environment  and, thereby providing a plan of action to  address the ‘problem’. This gain infuses  economics into the strategy, draws on theory  to support empirical evidence. While offering  some short-term benefits, the strategy  automatically narrows to a competitive game  plan and nothing more, achieved through the  application of the popular SWOT analysis  framework that produces a breadth of options  at the expense of required depth. This means  significant quantities of time lost in the  formulation process and minimal  implementation focus - more about getting a  range of ideas delivered at the outset than                                   a living strategy over time. It tends to be  created in isolation ignoring the imperative  role of stakeholders in formulating and  implementing the strategy.   Alternatively, the strategy formulation process  adopted within the National ICT Strategy and  Action Plan 2010 - 2015 is not just a  conceptual framework based on a utopian  idea; but a practical roadmap to an improved  way of life for the country, and for its  downstream benefactors and beneficiaries  alike.  Through the exploitation of the unique  benefits offered by ICT, St. Vincent and the  Grenadines has an unprecedented opportunity  to transform our country into a knowledge- based society.  At the heart of this strategy is  ‘purpose’, complemented by a much more  practical and less philosophical approach to  ICT development. Indeed, leveraging on the   ‘purpose’ and successes of the National ICT  Plan 2002 to 2007, the launching point is re- defined based on three (3) main areas of focus  for ICT development – infrastructure; content;  and training. This approach to ICT                                   development ensures that the new National  ICT Plan is set within the local context. It also  incorporates people, process, and technology  - the three prerequisites for successful  transformation of the country through ICT  investments.    The successful execution and continuity of the  short, medium, and long term strategies  proposed in the new Plan means the role of  the ‘Strategist’ is significant, arduous, and of  a permanent nature.  This calls for a level of  e-leadership that is inseparable from the most  senior level of the Ministry, Private Sector,  Civil Society and beyond. Indeed, the  Strategist/e-Leader must recognize the  strategic significance and implications of each   ICT investment being contemplated and the  opportunities it presents, viewing them  through the lens of the whole, even as those  with lesser responsibilities may be seeing the  same issues parochially. In other words, the  e-Leader must be the champion of ICT  transformation who drives the  implementation of government-wide ICT   M      Director of Telecommunications and Special Projects   Dr. Jerrol C. Thompson      FOREWORD     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | vi           initiatives with a constant eye on the  alignment with overarching national  development objectives. Such decisions define  the leadership capabilities required. As such,  the functions of the Strategist must never be  outsourced. Moreover, the strategies  contemplated are not a permanent fixture; but  require a regular review mechanism to  guarantee their validity, relevance, and  importance.  Acknowledging that change is a  welcome constant with a view to transform   the economy through ICT,  ongoing benefits  can only accrue through a diligent perpetual  monitoring and refresh process. This  highlights the importance of the  establishment of a new, refreshed National ICT  Plan that incorporates the changing domestic,  regional, and international environmental  factors that require consideration based on  potential implications of the current course of  action. With this in mind, the recommended   strategies and the articulation of future   strategies are the primary enablers of  innovation, sustainability, competitiveness,  technology and socio-economic development.  These strategies are never stand-alone; but  are meant to integrate seamlessly to each of  the relevant programs within the Public and  Private sectors including education, social,  and economic programs, and regional and  international initiatives. I am, therefore, very  pleased and excited to lead this National ICT  Plan to successful implementation.

                                                                                                                                              nformation and Communication Technology  (ICT) has the capacity to transform small  developing island states and emerging   economies like St. Vincent and the Grenadines  (SVG). ICT has already transformed many parts of  the world by reducing or negating the impact of  time, space, and size. For countries such as  Singapore and Malta, it has become less and less  important where they are located in the world or  their size in physical terms. Despite their limited  physical resources, they now have the ability to  produce goods and services that are considered  desirable by other countries of the world. Their  size and island status no longer determine the  quality of the service that they deliver to their  citizens, businesses, and visitors. What these  countries have done over the past decade, is to  embrace and adapt ICT for their own use and to  create a sustainable competitive advantage. They  have motivated their citizens and businesses to  take advantage of the enabling capabilities of ICT  for their own gain, and ultimately for the benefit  of their countries.     The Global Context  Internationally there is agreement on ICT  development goals, including those in the  Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus   and the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of  Implementation.   The World Summit on the Information Society  (WSIS) which took place in 2003 in Geneva and  in 2005 in Tunis established a Plan of Action. One  of its chief aims was to bridge the so-called  global digital divide separating rich countries  from poor countries by spreading access to the  Internet in the developing world.   The ITU, through the WSIS goals, is also seeking  to leverage ICT to advance developmental goals.   The ultimate outcome is the building of a  framework of an all-inclusive and equitable   information society.  SVG’s ICT Strategy and  Action plan in line with the WSIS action line  items focuses on, among other things, ICT  infrastructure, access, capacity building and  economic development.  Additionally, SVG’s  Strategy and Plan is well timed to benefit from  this global emphasis being placed on ICT and can  expect significance guidance and insight from  other global bodies such as OECD and non-OECD  governments, private sector actors, civil society  organisations, regional and international  organisations as they work together to  accomplish the goal at hand.   I                                                                                                                                           The Objectives, goals and targets outlined in WSIS.  C1.

The broad Caribbean regional goals included  commitment to: Collaborative leadership,  Research and Innovation for Sustainability, and  Key social and economic development measures  and objectives.    These objectives included:  1. ICTs used to provide a supportive environment  (business, regulatory, soft and hard  infrastructure), for learning, working and social  development  2. Education and lifelong learning environment  established to support use of ICTs at levels of  community, business and government  3. Creative use of ICT and a framework that is  anchored in cultural industries, to encourage  innovation  The Regional Vision: An inclusive Regional  Knowledge Society driving sustainable  development incorporated a number of  objectives.    The Broad Regional Strategic Objectives   To fully establish modern regional   regulatory and open telecommunications  infrastructures with affordable networks  using converged technologies, to provide  affordable and ubiquitous access    Build a digital Community culture and  increase the value and volume of the  region’s trained ICT workforce that can  create with, develop and use ICT to improve  life style and otherwise add personal and  economic value    To manage and use ICT to demonstrate good  governance and increase efficiency in  operations    To establish a culture of innovation and  quality, and to enable sustainable  production of Regional digital goods and  services, the development of cultural  industries and the inclusion of local content  in delivery of information    To guide businesses and governments to use  ICT for sustainable growth and support  social development objectives through  partnerships that use networked  technologies       The OECS Sub-Region has developed an ICT  strategy and has already developed a robust  regional regulatory framework in ECTEL  governed by a council of Telecommunications  Ministers and national NTRCs. Through the EGRIP  project, the OECS is developing the capacity to  manage its e-Government initiatives and to  strengthen the integration movement. This will  build on the wider Caribbean regional effort on  collaboration, create economies of scale, improve  efficiency of administration, and ensure social  inclusion and people participation.   The OECS’s efforts have now turned to filling the  gaps, monitoring the implementation and  bringing more significant benefits of  telecommunication liberalization and ICT to the  people of the sub-region.  Fortunately, SVG can take advantage of the  international experience and lessons learnt from  countries like Barbados, Estonia, Malta and  Singapore, to create its own unique ICT-enabled  opportunities, and accelerate its national social  and economic development. SVG can use ICTs to  promote the core tourism, agricultural, and  cultural attributes that the country is known for.  It can improve the internal efficiencies and  effectiveness of its ministries and agencies for the  benefit of the country. It can use technology to  create new electronic service delivery channels  via the telephone and the Internet so that citizens  will not have to travel to urban areas to obtain  much needed government services. Knowledge  can now be codified and used for individual and  national development. SVG can derive the known  benefits of being a knowledge based society that  is linked to the global information economy.  In this context, it is useful to consider SVG’s  recent history of ICT planning and  implementation. In 2002, the country’s first five- year ‘National ICT Strategy and Action Plan’ was  adopted by Cabinet after public consultation. A  series of short term and long term goals were  identified in the plan which included the  complete liberalisation of the telecommunications  market, and the development of a robust  regulatory framework which included ECTEL and  NTRC. However, over the last ten years, there  have been substantial technological  advancements, including the emergence of Voice  over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and the resultant  convergence of technologies. There have also  been dramatic changes in the economic,  financial, and geo-political make-up of the   The Regional Digital Plan of Action  addresses, among other things:  Access, Connectivity and Internet  Governance;  Capacity-building and Sustainability  Business, Trade, Culture and Disaster  Management; and  Policy Formulation and the Legal and  Regulatory Framework for  Implementation   ICT4D Statistics        Introduction P a g e | 13       Caribbean and the world with significant changes  in attitude, usage, and demand by citizens, in  particular youth, for new technological  opportunities, training, greater transparency and  social inclusion in the governance decision  making process. These changes warrant a  complete review and refresh of the national (and  related regional) ICT strategy, and hence the need  for an updated National ICT Strategy and Action  Plan for SVG. This Plan must outline the  mechanisms, including the enabling policy  framework, and the programmes and projects  that need to be implemented over the 2010 to  2015 period. It should define the way forward  and proposes an implementation framework  based on the local and international experience.       Therefore, the broad policies and  strategies to be outlined in the updated  National ICT Plan must include:    Streamlining the existing  telecommunications regulatory process for  more cost effective regulations of utilities  (and possibly energy) and enacting the  required legislation and regulations to  embrace ICT    Ensuring there is a robust modern national  next generation and regional ICT  infrastructure which does not just meet, but  exceeds international standards and the  demands of investors in order to attract and  draw them and to bolster our level of  competitiveness. It must include the  redundancy and innovation which can help  to leapfrog any unnecessary stages and  enable national development    Ensuring a high percentage of households,  government agencies, schools and  businesses have access to adequate  broadband access    Leveraging the increase in mobile telephone  penetration through the use of a suite of  mobile government applications and e- government initiatives to improve efficiency  of government and bring significant service  improvements    Enhancing the use of ICT in all sectors with  an emphasis on education, health,  agriculture and tourism    Complementing the expansion of broadband  access with increased access to computers  at tele-centres, schools and community  facilities, and implementing strategies  which increase personal computers or  laptops for students    Ensuring that computer and internet usage  is safe by addressing issues of cybercrime    Empowering business and trade through the  use of ICT in e-commerce    Expanding training at all age levels with  emphasis on bridging the digital divide by  using ICT in education, the creation of  skilled workers and advance training to  produce ICT engineering and knowledge  workers    Facilitating the creation of local content,  new appropriate software applications and  the creation of a Vincentian and regional  knowledge economy     Developing and becoming known for an ICT  export sector which feature the export of  unique ICT and electronic goods and the  export of ICT services   However, before determining what needs to be  done in the future, it is important to determine  what SVG has achieved and defining where it is  starting from. It is also critical to review the  international best practices and to extract  relevant experiences that will assist SVG in  moving forward. The re-launching point is  therefore reviewed based on the best available  national statistics and an assessment of  performance against the 2002–2007 Strategic ICT  Plan. It took into account selected international  best practices and trends.        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 14            This Page left Blank         Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 15         Vincent and the Grenadines is an  archipelago in the Eastern  Caribbean Sea comprising of 32   islands and cays. SVG is spread over 340 square  kilometres. The population is concentrated in St.  Vincent itself and dispersed across other  islands such as Bequia, Union Island,  Canouan, Mayreau, Mustique, Palm Island,  and Petit St. Vincent. The country is a  traditional small open economy which is  highly susceptible to external economic  shocks and natural disasters such as  hurricanes. It relies heavily on agriculture,  tourism, and construction as the major  contributors to the economy. The population,  estimated at 106,000 in the 2001 census and  118,000 (estimated) in July 2009, has a flat  growth rate with migration matching natural  growth. Unemployment was officially estimated  at 15% and the country has a per capita GDP of  US$ 5,335 (2009). The total labour force has been  estimated in 2009, as 53,888. Foreign direct  investment and domestic investment account for  some 32% of GDP, which grew from just over US$  1 billion in 2003 at an annual growth rate of  about 11%, to an estimated US$ 1.5 billion in  2007.  The country’s mainstay continues to be  agriculture, predominantly bananas, which  contribute about 50% of the total goods exported.   However, over the last few years, agriculture  and particularly the banana industry, declined  significantly due to the erosion of European  Union (EU) preferential market access for  bananas, the impact of negative weather shocks,  and disease. Despite the introduction of better  irrigation and upgraded infrastructure, banana  export earnings and volumes continued to fall,  from EC$ 89.51 million in 2003 to EC$ 28.83  million in 2004. Agriculture is being gradually   replaced by improved growth in the services  sector - largely through developments in tourism.  The % contribution of the agricultural sector to  Real Gross Domestic Product fell from 11.66% in  2002 to 9.28 in 2006. The country’s main revenue   is now determined by the level of  tourism receipts and some foreign direct  investment, and as such, the expansion of the  tourism sector is being accelerated as part of the  national development agenda. SVG has a small  manufacturing sector and a small offshore  financial sector. Fisheries and manufacturing  production have also expanded and are  contributing to economic growth.    1.1 NATIONAL STRATEGY AND ACTION   PLAN 2002-2007  Recognising these challenges, Government has  for many years been actively pursuing the   development of alternate mechanisms to promote  economic development, including the use of ICT.  In 2001, the Government of St. Vincent & the  Grenadines developed its first National Strategy  and Action Plan 2002 – 2007. During the  development process, assessments were  conducted to establish the status of ICT  development In SVG. Some of the resulting  highlights are now presented below.    Governance is a critical pillar of any national ICT  plan. With the change in Government on 28th  March 2001, a new Ministry for  Telecommunications, Science, Technology and  Innovation was established. Government  appointed an Information Communication  Technology Advisory Council (ICTAC) as the lead  advisory agency on development and  implementation of ICT. Both of these  organisations are critical contributors to  successful implementation.  By 2002, the regulatory framework for  telecommunications was well underway. An  agreement was achieved with the incumbent,  licenses were issued and regulations published.  The regulator began pursuing internal capacity  building and engaging in knowledge transfer.           St.    “Strategies for the use of ICT are not  universal. St. Vincent and the  Grenadines faces different  circumstances, financial means and  priorities and will need a specifically  tailored strategy. Nevertheless a  strategy that focuses its ICT  interventions towards achieving  developmental goals is more likely to  achieve marked socioeconomic  development.”    DEFINING THE      RE-LAUNCHING  POINT     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 16         As a result of the policy to open up the  telecommunication environment, domestic  business activity has increased and lower prices  have resulted as the once ‘monopoly provider’  moved their rates to address the growing  competition.    The 2002 assessment recognised the significant  absence of formal legal and regulatory  frameworks governing e-commerce, within SVG  and across the region. It was recognised that  collaboration within the OECS was highly desired  in addressing this aspect of commerce.   It was noted that relative to other developing  countries, SVG and the OECS region as a whole  had a significant comparative advantage through  high levels of literacy and trainability in their  workforce. The Ministry for Telecommunications,  Science, Technology and Innovation and ICTAC  has begun building on this base through the  important step of increasing the level of  computer literacy of the school-going population.  It was noted that apart from niche markets such  as call centres, data processing centres and  online gaming, the supply of ICT products and  services was a small aspect of the SVG economy.   It was recognised that in most areas of the  private sector, ICT was in the early stages of  adoption.    This ICT strategy focussed on ICT as an enabler  of development rather than the development of a  definitive ICT Export Sector. The role of  Government in utilising ICT to address its need  for improvements in internal efficiency and  effectiveness, while simultaneously  demonstrating to its constituents the benefits as a  “model user”, was acknowledged in 2002.  The  need for the banking sector to support the  growth of e-business by addressing existing  financial impediments was noted, as was the  need for SVG to move ahead with its planned  Fiscal Incentive Act.  In the context described above, a Framework for  Action was created to illustrate how to use and  support ICT-based development. The Framework  took a holistic and multidimensional approach to  strengthening the synergies between the different  developmental components that can be impacted  by ICT. See Figure 1 which follows.    Using this Framework as the basis, a number of  actions (see pages 18-21), short term goals and  longer term goals were developed which form  the 2002 – 2007 Plan. During the periods, 2002 -  2007 and 2007 - 2010, these actions and goals  were addressed with varying degrees of success.  Their completion was assessed as part of the  development of this current 2010 – 2015 Plan,  and the factors underpinning the completion rate  were determined. These outputs were used to  create a Performance Scorecard for the execution  of the 2002 - 2007 National Strategy and Action  Plan. The Scorecard provides a good summary of  progress from 2002 to 2010 and is outlined  below.       THE MINISTRY FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS,  SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION   It is advisable to undertake aligned  interventions in a number of ICT  strategic areas including:    Coordinated actions, strong partnership  and local implementation  This requires a greater focus on the  interplay of the different components and  a coordinated action among diverse  stakeholders and an inclusive policy.  The process will address barriers and  resistance, put in place transitional  mechanisms to address trade-offs and  create positive incentives to change,  needs and opportunities.    Global, National and Local  Linkages  The Global network economy creates new  opportunities for nations and  communities. National ICT strategies  must be positioned within the global  context, while at the same time  addressing the local context.

In defining the  re-launching point and in completing the current  situation e-assessment, the success of these short  term Actions and longer term Actions were  considered, and some important ACTION ITEMS      were identified. These ACTION ITEMS inform the  strategies and tactics to be utilised in moving  forward in 2010 and beyond, and will now be  considered alongside the 2010 current state  assessment. Additionally, best practices in the  context of SVG will be presented as these inform  the re-launching strategy.        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 22        1.2 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ICT  ADVANCEMENTS     The telecommunications infrastructure of a  country is a foundational element of its ICT  agenda and is a fundamental building block of a  national ICT plan. As such, it is instructive to  review some key telecommunications indicators  for SVG and to assess how this defines the re- launching point for the 2010 – 2015 national ICT  plan.  SVG is fortunate to have a relatively young  population, with some 51% being under the age  of 25 years, as it is generally acknowledged that  young people have the most potential to embrace  and innovate with ICT. So not surprisingly, given  the tough economic realities, Government  embarked on an aggressive and comprehensive  ICT and Private Sector Development Programme  to increase the country’s efficiency and  competitiveness. Recognising the nexus between  ICT and national development, Government  sought to develop a comprehensive National ICT  Plan for the development and operation of the ICT  sector itself, and for using ICT to enable other  sectors, including government, over 2010 to  2015.  SVG’s telecommunications infrastructure is  relatively well developed and has improved  substantially over the last decade. Fixed line  penetration has been relatively stable, moving  from 22.75% in 2004 to a peak of 23.43% in  2008, and settling at 22.24% in 2009. NTRC  reports about 22,777 main telephone lines as of  July 2008, shared between the two fixed line  providers. This represents a total number of  landlines to total number of households of about  54.6%. The % of fixed line subscribers over the  last five years are shown in Figure 2 above. The   rate in EC$ for ‘fixed line to fixed line’ during  peak hours has stabilised, moving from $0.09 in  2004, to $0.07 during the period 2005 to 2008,  and rising to $0.08 in 2009. ‘Fixed line to mobile’  has fallen over the period 2004 to 2009, from  $0.81 to $0.70.   Mobile penetration has grown tremendously -   54.7% over the last 5 years, from 65.9% in 2004  to a high of 120.6% in 2009. There are now about  121,114 mobile users in SVG. This growth is due  to government’s strategic management of the  sector which saw a new entrant entering the  market in 2005 and the introduction of prepaid  services. More than 90% of current mobile  customers use prepaid services. Mobile handsets   are now available at prices comparative to  markets in the USA. Figure 3 illustrates the rapid  growth in mobile penetration rates over the  period 2005 to 2009.  ‘Mobile to mobile’ calls have stayed relatively  constant at $0.85 for the new entrant, rising to  $0.86 in 2009. On the other hand, the   incumbent’s rates fell from $0.99 (2004) to match  the new provider in 2006 and 2007, eventually  falling to $0.63 (2009). ‘Mobile to fixed line’  moved from $0.88 in 2004 to $0.98 in 2009 for  the new entrant. While the rates fell from $0.79  in 2004 to $0.63 for the incumbent. SVG is clearly  experiencing the benefits of well-managed  competition.   59.57 64.94  89.27  112.46 120.6  0  25  50  75  100  125  150  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  Mobile Penetration rates (%) 2005-2009  21.68 21.61 22.49 23.43  22.24  0  25  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  Fixed line Penetration rates (%)  Figure 2: Fixed Line Penetration 2005 – 2009   Figure 3: Mobile Penetration Rate 2005 – 2009        Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 23    Internet penetration increased by about 200%  over the period 2004 to 2009, growing from  4.29% to 12.30%. There are now about 990  Internet connections in SVG representing a 20%  growth as compared to a 30% growth reported  for 2008.  Expansion in the Internet market was  again fuelled by an uptake of fixed broadband  service; the number of fixed broadband  subscribers increased some 22% but was offset  by a 24% reduction in dial-up subscribers. Fixed  broadband subscribers accounted for 97% of all  fixed Internet subscribers, up from 92%  previously.   At the same time, the cost of Internet broadband  fell significantly over the same period, from a  cost of $299 for 256 kbps to a rate of $79 per  month for the minimum speed offered to  residential customers of 1 Mbps. There are  presently three licensed fixed Internet Service  Providers (ISPs) in SVG which offers one or more  of the following:  ADSL broadband, dial-up  access, and high speed Internet access via cable  modem.   Mobile Internet access is via ordinary mobile  subscription using GPRS and EDGE rather than  through a separate subscription for mobile  broadband as true mobile broadband through 3G  networks is not yet available to users. This made  it very difficult to determine the true number of  mobile Internet users in SVG as any subscriber  with a GPRS or EDGE ready mobile phone can  browse the Internet. Users with a pre-paid mobile  subscription can access Internet service for $0.01  per kbps while post-paid users have access for  $40 per month.     Network speed and quality are generally  regarded as good across the country. DSL, ISDN,  ADSL, Leased Circuits (frame relay) and Dial-Up  service are available. The initial cost of access to  the Internet for the residential customers  averages around EC$ 219, with a recurrent cost   averaging EC$ 90 per month for unlimited access.  For commercial customers, the initial cost  averages around EC$ 343. Subscriber complaints  per 100 connections are about 17%, and  generally ISPs attend to 40% of these complaints  within 24 hours.  In addition to an estimated 18 Internet cafes,  about 200 free or subsidized Internet access  points are available across the country. Based on  national import figures, it is estimated that  personal computers (PCs) per 100 inhabitants  averaged 43.5% over the period 2005 to 2009. It   is therefore clear that citizens have reasonable  access to the technology necessary to access on- line government services and information on the  Internet, as tele-centres and Internet cafes are  contributing significantly to making the Internet  available to those who cannot afford personal   access at home, or who do not have access from  school, or at the workplace. However, such  facilities are less common in the rural areas of  the country as compared to availability in the  urban communities. Though this figure appears  to be moderate showing that citizens can access  online government services and information via  tele-centres, Internet cafes and from home, much  more needs to be done to ensure that greater  Internet access is available to every community  including the rural areas of SVG.

Cable TV is available through a single cable TV   operator whose distribution network currently  connects about 13,789 households or about  64.2% of all households. The cable TV operator  now offers digital TV alongside the analogue  version. Another provider is also poised to offer  IP TV. FM broadcasting facilities are widely  available with about 13 stations in current   operation. AM broadcasting infrastructure has  been put in place and will be re-activated in the  coming months. TV broadcasting covers about  70% of the island.      There is no local manufacture or assembly of ICT  equipment in SVG, and local dealers / agents  import ICT products - mainly from the USA. Most  of the software used by the public and private  sectors is imported. The use of open source   products is limited but growing.      The Government is committed to increasing its  broadband penetration and usage and has  conducted extensive research on the provision of  laptop computer devices to students of primary  and secondary school age. In the exploration of   several avenues, an offer has been made by  Portugal to supply students in St. Vincent and the  Grenadines with laptops. A rationale has been  developed which shows that this is a viable  project which is consistent with the growing  trends towards laptop usage and greater mobility  for continued learning.     Figure 5 indicates a significant increase in the  number of laptops entering St. Vincent and the  Grenadines during 2009.  Figure 6 shows the  amount of desktops and clearly shows a shift  from desktops to laptops even though the  desktop market is still larger than laptops.   Several factors may have contributed to this  emerging trend as laptops are more affordable  and there is an increase of wireless Internet  access at both domestic and public areas.   The ICT sector’s contribution to GDP has been  relatively stable, moving from 10.6% in 2004 to  10.7% in 2009, with a low of 10.2% in 2005.  Investment in the sector varied from EC$ 33.8M  in 2004 to EC$ 25.7M in 2009, with a low of EC$  19.6M in 2005. The sector grew in direct  employment from 147 in 2004 to 162 in 2009,  despite the current challenges in the global  economy. The ICT sector therefore remains an  important contributor to the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Figure 5: Laptops entering SVG 2000 -2009  Source:  NTRC Universal Service Fund Annual Report 2009                                 Figure 6:  Desktops entering SVG 2000 – 2009   Source:  NTRC Universal Service Fund Annual Report 2009     Action Item:   To enhance access to  Broadband and facilitate the  use of ICT and e-Government  applications by communities,  the USF will facilitate an  additional 8,000 household  broadband connections to  exceed 50% penetration by 2015  and subsidised computers /  laptops. Students will receive a  special price for broadband  connections.         Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 25       Figure 7 shows a constant level of investment as  the country has marginal increases and decreases  in GDP.     It has been observed (see Figure 8) that revenues  from the telecommunications operators has been  on a steady incline since 2002 and reached the  one hundred and fifty million mark in 2007.  However in 2008, there was a slight decrease in  the revenue received. This decrease was possibly  due to the onset of the global economic crisis  which has impacted most sectors in SVG. The  revenue generated in 2009 was slightly higher  than 2008.    1.3 THE POLICY, LEGAL & REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK   May 2010 marked the 10th Anniversary of the  ECTEL Treaty which presented a joint,  harmonised, cost-effective approach to  telecommunication regulations in the OECS,  consistent with the thrust towards regional  integration. ECTEL strongly supports the work of  the National Regulatory Telecommunications  Commission (NRTC).  The NRTC was established with the passing of the  Telecommunications Act 2001. It regulates the  telecommunications industry in SVG and is  guided closely in its activities by the Eastern   Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL).  NTRC’s responsibilities include  telecommunication regulation, technical and  broadcasting regulation, licensing and fee  collection, setting of technical standards,  interconnection and dispute resolution, price  regulation and providing advisory services to the  government on telecommunications matters such  as anti-competitive practices. It represents  government in international telecommunications  organizations and agencies, and ensures  compatibility with the standards of the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU).   On the other hand, the Ministry for  Telecommunications, Science, Technology and  Innovation, through its Information Technology  Services Division (ITSD), manage ICT in the public  sector. It is responsible for ICT policy, ICT  services, standardization and awareness of ICT  within SVG.  The NTRC is responsible for managing the  Universal Service Fund (USF) which was  established under Section 42 of the  Telecommunications Act of 2001. This fund is  intended to compensate telecommunications  providers who are required to provide universal  service. This service is typically Internet access  and telecommunications to schools, hospitals,  clinics, community and Learning Resource  Centres, public voice telephony to rural  communities and underserved areas, facilities for  the differently abled, and provision of some  maritime services.   The USF is funded by payments made by  telecommunications providers according to the  Telecommunication (Universal Service Fund)  Contribution Order 2008 which was gazetted on  22nd April 2008, with retroactive effect from 1st  January 2008. The USF regulations were gazetted  on 16th September 2008, and the                                 Figure 8: Investment of Companies in Telecoms   Source:  NTRC Annual Report 2009      Figure 7:  Telecommunications Investment and Revenue in SVG 2004 –2008  Source:  ECTEL/Operators (includes estimates where ECTEL did not receive data)        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 26        Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund)  Guidelines 2009 provides for its management and  usage. The USF was expected to accumulate EC$  2.7 million by end 2009, of which EC$ 2.593  million will fund USF projects directly.  Considerable work is in progress, including a   country-wide survey, to determine priority  projects for implementation from 2009 onwards.  In order to promote the use of ICT for education,  health and economic development, the  Government has set goals of 70% for Households   access to broadband, 80% access for Businesses  and 100% access for Public Facilities - by 2015.   However, the current goals of the USF have been  identified as shown in the Table 1 below.         2010 USF GOALS  # Goal  1 Introduce Internet Broadband services at the community level in each of the major   communities north of the Dry River and north of Coull’s Hill (to achieve a 70% household  penetration)   2 Outfit public institutions (health facilities and police stations) throughout SVG with  computers and Internet access   3 Outfit public institutions with an emphasis on police stations with extra phone lines  4 Increase the cellular coverage in the Fancy, Sandy Bay, Overland and Owia villages  5 Place payphones along the main roads of all major communities throughout the island  6 Improve the maritime coverage of VHF and cellular phones around SVG  7 Increase Broadband penetration to households.  8 Improve access to computer devices for students and individuals.     Table 1:  USF Goals for 2010         Notwithstanding the good progress made under  the Telecommunications Act of 2001, Government  has recognised the urgent need to manage the  converged communications environment, in  particular to encompass electronic  communications. A new Bill is under  development in coordination with ECTEL Member  States, and is titled, ‘Electronic Communications  Bill’. It will replace the Telecommunications Act.          The new bill is aimed at bringing ICT under the  existing regulatory process, allowing a liberalised  and non-discriminatory entry into the electronic  communications sector and enabling a robust  competitive environment in which there is  fairness, transparency and accountability on the  part of the regulators of the sector.  Government has recognised the need to  strengthen the internal capacity of the NTRC and          the Ministry for Telecommunications, Science,  Technology and Innovation, and has therefore  embarked on a telecommunications skills  enhancement project at a cost of EC$ 512,068.                Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 27    Good progress has been made with the  introduction of legislation that enables the use of  ICT for national development. For example, the  Electronic Transaction Act of 2007 provides for  the facilitation and regulation of electronic  communications and transactions to prevent  abuse and misuse of information systems and to  provide for related matters. It addresses the legal  requirements for electronic transactions,  electronic signatures, accreditation, cryptography  providers, consumer protection, protection of  critical information systems, liability of service  providers, cyber inspectors, information systems  and computer related crimes, and procedural  powers.  There have been workshops on the establishment  of a regional Certification Authority which in a  cost effective manner can approve the licensure  of cryptography providers and accreditation  electronic signature providers.   The Information and Communication Technology  Services Investment Incentives Act, 2007  encourages and facilitates investment in the  information and communication technology  services sector, and stimulates employment in,  and the development of, the private sector of  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines by:    Reducing impediments to investment  in the information and communication  technology services sector    Providing appropriate inducements by  way of tax reduction and other  incentives specifically designed to  encourage investment in the  information and communication  technology services sector.     Adopting measures which are  calculated to transfer technology and  increase the rate at which the  information and communication  technology services sector is  developed and expanded.   The ICT legislative framework was enhanced by  the introduction of the Small Business  Development Act of 2007 and the Consumer  Protection Act of 2008. A new Small Business  Development Policy was approved and adopted  by cabinet in 2010 and in view of the new global  environment; a new Small Business Development  Act was drafted to be enacted in 2010. A new  Investment Act is also being developed to replace  the Fiscal Incentive Acts No 5 of 1982, in order to  be in compliance with WTO mandates.          Action Item:     Enact the new Electronic   Communications Act to replace  the Telecommunications Act  2001.       Enact the new Electronic  Communications Act currently  under consultations to replace  the Telecommunications Act of  2001. This will recognise the  trends of convergence of  Broadcasting,  Telecommunications and the  various forms of Technology.       Approve regulations for ICT  Incentive Act, Electronic  Transaction Act and establish a  Regional Certification Authority        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 28        In addition to the Acts identified above, the regulatory framework is quite robust and includes:   Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund) Regulations 2008   Telecommunications (Universal Service Fund Contribution) Order 2008   Telecommunications (Licensing Classification) Regulations 2002   Telecommunications (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2007   Telecommunications (Licensing Classification) (Amendment) Notice, 2002   Telecommunications (Fees Regulations) 2007   Telecommunications (Fees Amendment) 2008   Telecommunications (Licensing and Authorisation) Regulations 2007   Telecommunications (Private Network Licensing) Regulations 2002   Telecommunications (Tariff) Regulations 2004   Telecommunications (Interconnection) Regulations 2008   Telecommunications (Spectrum Management) Regulations 2007   Telecommunications (Numbering) Regulations 2008   Telecommunications (Confidentiality in Networks & Services) Regulations 2002   Telecommunications (Terminal Equipment & Public Network) Regulations 2002     Regulations have also been developed for the  Money Services Act. The East Caribbean Central  Bank is establishing an Automated Clearing House  (ACH).                     In a modern, competitive, post colonial Caribbean  era, the nature of SVG’s continued existence  depend heavily on what the country can produce  and market on the international market, but the  cost of interconnecting and doing business is  very expensive. It is imperative that new and  existing technologies be adapted in order to  bring about solutions; and in this particular case,  the establishment of a National Internet Exchange  Point (IXP).     The primary purpose of an IXP is to allow  networks to interconnect directly rather than  through one or more 3rd party networks. The  advantages of the direct interconnection are  numerous, but the primary reasons are cost,  latency, and bandwidth. Traffic passing through  an exchange is typically not billed by any party.   However traffic to an ISP's upstream  provider is; and in SVG’s particular case  all local ISPs buy bandwidth from a  transit provider in the United States. At  present an email from the Prime Minister  to another member of government sitting  across the hall must travel the route SVG,  Barbados, Antigua, Miami and back before it  reaches him.  The case of moving the relevant  IXP from Miami to St Kitts, a reduction from  6,000 miles (round trip) to perhaps one mile, the  decrease in distance is so dramatic that cost can  be minimized to near zero, while speeds can be  increased from some multiple of STM-1 to 1 GBPS  or 10 GBPS.    A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the  network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale  to domestic customers, without demanding  significant corresponding capital or operational  investment. This would make more bandwidth  available for important activities such as video   streaming and telemedicine and increase the  national penetration of Broadband Internet. An  IXP will also add more value to projects like  CKLN, EGRIP and the Intranet Backbone. It will  also make available a logical place to locate, and  hence attract, other Internet infrastructure  resources, such as top-level name servers, time  servers, performance measurement tools, and  research projects.  It is clear that SVG is at a disadvantage in the  absence of a neighbouring IXP, and that this  shortcoming needs to be addressed urgently.   A direct interconnection (often located in the  same country or region) avoids the need for data  to travel to other countries outside the region to  get from one network to another, thus reducing  latency and the possibility of attack from  cybercrime. The third advantage, speed, is most  noticeable in areas that have poorly developed  long-distance connections and this is absolutely  critical for web services, telemedicine and video  conferencing, etc.    ISPs in the Caribbean region normally pay  between 10 or 100 times more for data transport  than ISPs in North America, Europe or Japan.  Therefore, Caribbean ISPs typically have slower,  more limited connections to the rest of the  internet. However, a connection to a local IXP  may allow them to transfer data without limit,  and without cost, vastly improving the  bandwidth between customers of the adjacent  ISPs.        Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 29    With the continuing depletion of available IPV4  addresses, a new version of the Internet Protocol   was created called IPV6, also known as IP Next  Generation (IPNG). Among other things, this  version seeks to address the main issue of  exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or  hosts.  The introduction of this version means that SVG  will have to take stock of what exists and with its  ICT National Plan see how greater use of the  initiatives can be implemented bearing in mind  IPV6 will soon be adopted around the world.      1.4 WORLD BANK SURVEY: DOING   BUSINESS IN ST. VINCENT & THE  GRENADINES      The business sector in SVG can take advantage of  ICT for internal improvements in efficiency and  effectiveness, and equally important for   interacting with Government. Recent (2007 &  2010) World Bank Surveys provide useful  insights into how ICT is currently used by the  business sector and makes suggestions as to the  services provided by Government that can be  improved. The World Bank assessment uses ten  (10) distinct criteria shown in Table 2 below. It is  useful to review some of the relevant World Bank  results and recommendations, which inform the  ICT current state assessment process.   Action Item:    Establish National Task Force   with Public, Private & Civil Society  Stakeholders to:   1. Install an IXP in SVG  2. Public Awareness on Cyber   Security   3.  Public Awareness on IPv6    Transition     IPV6 has a large address space of 128  bits compared to 32 bits of the version  4. It addresses issues such as improving  the quality of service required for some  new applications like IP telephony,  video/audio, interactive games or  ecommerce which can be delivered over  the network.  This version easily deals  with the avoidance of network traffic,  loss of data or bandwidth.      In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the  following benefits:  1) Increased address space  2) More efficient routing   3) Reduced management requirement  4) Improved methods to change ISP  5) Better mobility support   6) Multi-homing   7) Security   8) Scoped address: link-local, site-local  and global-address space    Criteria  St. Vincent &   the Grenadines  2007   OECS   Average    2007   St. Vincent &    the Grenadines   2010   i.

In  dealing with licences, St. Vincent ranked first.  However, in starting a company it ranked 29th,  registering property 101st, paying taxes 32nd and   closing a business 151st. In subsequent years,  additional developed countries have been added  to the World Bank survey, and a number of  innovations have not been captured by the World  Bank, resulting in a fall in some rankings of St.  Vincent and the Grenadines in 2010.   The World Bank went on to make several specific  recommendations for improving the  competitiveness of SVG, which on review,  provided a good assessment of the current  challenges facing the business sector.  Government has commenced action to implement  all ICT and other non-ICT recommendations with  the goal that SVG’s level of competitiveness, ease  of doing business and ranking will improve to be  placed within the top 30 nations.    The ICT initiatives that have been put in train  include:    Computerising of CIPO to enable to starting  a Business on line    Digitizing the Land Registry records and  introducing on-line access to title searches  and survey plans     Introducing on-line tax payments   Continually improving ASYCUDA World -   customs data and clearance system – to  facilitate movement of goods   There are therefore clear opportunities for  improving the current usage of ICT by the  business sector of SVG, and for upgrading the  ICT-supported services provided by the public  service to this important sector of the economy.      Action Item  Make Solid advancements to the  ten major recommendations to   raise the competitiveness of SVG.

This  normally includes the efficient internal  management of such information, better service  delivery through electronic delivery channels,  and greater citizen empowerment through easier  access to information and more participation in  public policy decision-making. It is useful to  measure the state of readiness of countries with  respect to e-government as such benchmarking  enables countries to learn from each others’  experiences. One such measure is the Global E- Government Readiness Index which has been  assessed for many United Nations (UN) member  states.     The Index includes an assessment of the state of  website development within the public sector of  a country, the state of the telecommunications  infrastructure of the country, and finally the  capacity of the people of the country to use the   available technology for their own benefit as  measured by their level of education. As such, it  is a composite Index created from the Web  Measure Index, the Telecommunication  Infrastructure Index and the Human Capital Index  of the country.    It is further noted that e-Government includes  several types of electronic interactions, namely:  government - to - government  (G2G),  government - to - business  (G2B),    business- to -government  (B2G),  government-to-citizen (G2C) and finally citizen-to- government (C2G).     While the other forms of interactions are  important, the United Nations Global Survey is  limited to the G2C and C2G aspects of e- Government. However, any comparative  measurement of G2C and C2G includes some  assessment of G2G since improvements in G2C  and C2G are closely linked to G2G improvements.                                                                                              Table 4:  UN Global E-Government Readiness Index 2007        Details of the results for the Caribbean are shown  in Table 4 above. Unfortunately, St. Vincent & the  Grenadines and other OECS states were not  benchmarked in 2007. It is noteworthy that the         highest ranked Caribbean countries are newly  ranked Barbados at 40th, Jamaica (45th), and  Trinidad and Tobago at 68th. The rankings for the  region show an encouraging upward trend which         SVG aims to replicate.  It is useful to consider some other relevant  international rankings for ICT and related areas.         Defining the Re-launching Point P a g e | 32       1.5.2 E-Readiness and Assessments  The 2007 network readiness assessment  completed by the World Economic Forum is a  useful measure. Details of the results for the  Caribbean are shown in Table 5 below. It is noted  that St. Vincent & the Grenadines ranked 98th in   2007, falling ten places from its ranking in 2005.  It is further noted that SVG ranked 10th in the  Caribbean out of 13 countries surveyed in 2007.       Table 5:  The 2007 World Economic Forum Global IT Report: Network Readiness Index (NRI)         1.5.3 Challenges to e-Government  E-Government has the ability to impact the  governance of a country and to influence the  organisation of the public sector itself. A heavily  centralized and controlling decision-making  structure in government is antithetical to an  emerging environment that is decentralized and  horizontal and in which power, resources, and  information are widely distributed. The latter  environment is often that desired by the people  of developing countries. Rigid hierarchical and  prescriptive accountability mechanisms do not  provide the flexibility required to develop policy  and to adjust service delivery to meet changing  circumstances or local realities of SVG. More  collaboration and connecting with citizens and   businesses will put public servants in the public  eye and make them less anonymous. Managers  and executives therefore must pay greater  attention to career development, succession  planning, value-added labour relations and other  basic human resource management practices to  ensure public officers are treated as a strategic  resource. E-Government can therefore impact the  foundation of public sector institutional  frameworks, and consequently be challenging to  get right despite its obvious benefits for all  stakeholders. The need to interconnect the public  sector has been recognised as a priority and  Government is making progress with the  development of an intranet. This project is aimed   The Networked Readiness Index (NRI)  measures the propensity of countries to  leverage the opportunities offered by ICT for  development and increased competitiveness.  In the most current report, 122 economies  globally participated in the assessment. It also  establishes a broad international framework  mapping out the enabling factors of such  capacity. It examines the preparedness of  countries to use ICT effectively on three  dimensions:   1) General business, 2) Regulatory and 3)  Infrastructure    Several countries have set the pace with the  strategic use of ICT, in particular the Nordic  countries. Their success is strongly linked to  having a very strong focus on education, thus  enabling the establishment of highly efficient  educational institutions and a culture of  innovation; and having transparent and well- functioning public institutions. This has  resulted in a business-friendly environment  with a strong readiness to adopt the latest  technologies.    Denmark's outstanding levels of networked  readiness have to do with the country's  excellent regulatory environment,  government’s e-leadership in leveraging ICT  for growth, resulting in impressive levels of  Internet and PC usage, e-government and a  dynamic e-business environment. A well- developed internal market, an emphasis on  education and Research and Development  (R&D) and a talent for pioneering applications  and technologies have laid the basis for the  development of a first-league high-tech  industry.     Estonia, stands out for its impressive progress  within the space of a decade in networked  readiness and general competitiveness, driven  by an efficient government ICT vision and  strategy.        Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 33    at electronic connectivity between all ministries  and agencies within the public sector, at a  current anticipated cost of EC$ 566,347 for the  first Phase.  The United Nations Department of Economic and  Social Affairs (UNDESA) assisted the Government  with enhancing SVG’s official website. The  development of a single entry government Web  Portal is now being developed with assistance  from the Government of Taiwan through the  establishment of an ICT Centre. This project when  completed will enable new portal functionality.  SVG uses ICT as an enabler of economic  development and in the growth of its ICT  Business Sector. Essentially there are four (4)   quadrants of activities which must be integrated  to create a modern and dynamic ICT Sector. This  comprises (1) a robust regulatory system; (2)  adequate training of the human resource; (3)  appropriate and relevant e-government  initiatives, and; (4) building a vibrant innovative  and creative ICT and business sectors including  the promotion of businesses to adopt ICT. The  effective management and coordination of the  projects and ICT initiatives in this sector will  increase efficiency, provider quicker  transactions, ensure better trained citizens,  reduce costs, increase revenue collection and  spur greater business activity and  competitiveness.             1.5.4 Key Role of the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD)    The Information Technology Services Division  (ITSD) is the main ICT policy, advisory and  technical maintenance services provider to the  Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  The Division is headed by a Director who is the  Chief Technical Advisor on Non-Regulatory ICT  matters. Several major functional Units are  integrated under the ITSD banner (refer  to  Figure 9 below) as follows:     1. The Web and Internet Content Unit designs,  maintains and promotes the Government’s  and national web presence. The Unit  maintains the Government Web site  consistent with the Freedom of Information  and Privacy Acts. The Intranet is geared to  providing public servants with a range of  electronic services which improve efficiency   2. The E-Mail, Internet and Intranet Network  Services Unit provides public servants with  professional email, Internet and Intranet  services and a means for information to be  disseminated throughout the Public Service  and through which clients can communicate  with officials   3. The Government Video-conferencing  Services Unit   4. The Computer Repair Section which services  computers throughout the government  service   5. Development and upgrading of new  software application and content creation  where required by departments or where  deemed necessary; and providing advice to  ministries on the appropriateness of   ICT & THE BUSINESS SECTOR   The challenges are to separate out the many  forces driving changes to this sector, to  identify the critical trends from the false  starts, and to piece together a big picture out  of the many new visions. There are some  emerging trends that cannot be ignored  which include:   1. The hot technologies with the greatest  promise    2. The best practices needed to harness all  this potential    3. The challenging blend of new paradigms  4. Fresh ideas and disruptive technologies   and tactics needed to exploit and  manage them    5. Green IT and its impact on society.  6. The megatrends – business acceleration,   the commoditizing of IT, the new agility  and beyond   7. The macro forces – standardization,  globalization, super powers & sleeping  dragons   8.

This Centre will provide equipment and expertise   implementing advanced cyber-security measures,  and the construction of a new government wide  web portal through which citizens can access  many on-line government services.  The Taiwan  ICT Centre will work with the ITSD in the   implementation of the Government’s e- government initiatives and provide advice and  assistance in training and building the ICT  capacity of other government agencies.     for the development of applications,          1.7 ESTABLISHING ICT STANDARDS  As part of its current investment initiatives, SVG  has begun the process of establishing standards  and guidelines which will ensure that the  country meets international best practice and is  attractive for new businesses in the ICT sector.  The Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC)  outlines standards to ensure that working  conditions in the electronics industry are safe,  that workers are treated with respect and  dignity, and that design and manufacturing  processes are environmentally responsible. SVG  has commenced action to ensure that these  standards are applied and complied with in the  near future.                   Another focus area of Government is ensuring  that businesses exhibit strong ‘corporate social   and environmental responsibility’ behaviour by  ensuring that they understand the compelling  need to act now.  SVG is commencing action to  let local and international businesses know that  the country is firmly supportive of protecting  the environment; and that Government is  willing to work with industry to ensure that  their CSER is met.    Furthermore, Government has acknowledged  that the following factors, from an ICT  perspective, have informed their strategic  thinking:          INITIATITIVES & PROJECTS PROPOSED FOR THE TAIWAN ICT CENTRE  1 Development of a comprehensive Government Web Portal  2 Full implementation of a Police Records Information Capture and Management System  3 Establishment of a Government Data Warehouse  4 Enhancement of the Government Intranet  5 Training and Human Capacity building of Public Servants in the Management of ICT   applications   Electronics Industry Code of Conduct    This Code outlines standards to ensure that  working conditions in the electronics industry are  safe, that workers are treated with respect and  dignity, and that design and manufacturing  processes are environmentally responsible. It notes  that:   1. Suppliers must provide their employees with  a safe and healthy workplace in compliance  with all    2. Suppliers are required to uphold the highest  standards of ethics   3. Suppliers must comply with all laws and  regulations on bribery, corruption, and  prohibited business practices   Corporate Social & Environmental  Responsibility (CSER)   “CSER is the continuing commitment by business  to behave ethically and contribute to economic  development while improving the quality of life of  the workforce and their families as well as of the  local community, environment and society at  large.” Businesses must be both “profitable &  responsible”.

This  electronic facility will enable Government to  place information on-line in a form that meets  the evolving needs of citizens and businesses. It  will provide ministries and agencies with the  capability of presenting content to the public that  will support some of the requirements of the  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It will allow a  proactive approach to responding to the needs of  the FOIA.    Government has also indicated its intention to  build this portal based on Web 2.0 technologies,  business models and current usage patterns. It is  anticipated that this strategy will support greater  user participation and more open business  processes.            The Portal: New Home for Web 2.0 'Mashups'  in the Organisation or Enterprise.   Web 2.0 is the next generation of technologies,  business models, and usage patterns of the World  Wide Web. Some of the major features of Web 2.0 are:    Greater user participation - User-generated data  and metadata, and user-centric designs    Openness - Transparent processes, open  application programming interfaces (APIs), and  open-source software and content     Lightweight, rather than heavyweight,  technology - Scripting languages, asynchronous  JavaScript and XML (Ajax)-based user interfaces,  representational state transfer (REST)-based  interaction protocol, RSS-based syndication and  HTML-based micro-formats.     Decentralized, distributed process - Ad hoc  \"mashups\" of Web sites building on public APIs;  bottom-up, bazaar-style development; and  content tagged by locally defined  \"folksonomies,\" rather than one global  taxonomy    Web 2.0 will have a direct effect on enterprise  portals, but this impact will start in the  consumer world. Eventually, Web 2.0 mashups  will appear in the enterprise, facilitated by  portals         Action Item:    Construct a new Government  Web 2.0 based Portal    Expand the Government  Backbone to the rural areas        Defining the Re-launch Point P a g e | 37    1.9  SUMMARY OF INITIATIVES IN THE  ICT ENVIRONMENT     The Figure 10 below summaries the various  initiatives being pursued by SVG and the region  around four quadrants, namely:     • Effective Regulatory Services   • Well Trained Human Resources  • E-government Initiatives  • Business Development               It is clear that there are a lot of ICT initiatives  being pursued across SVG. This current suite of  initiatives, once managed well, will create a  formidable strategic thrust and become a  significant enabler of development and enhanced  competitiveness for the country. The successful  implementation of these current and proposed  initiatives is critical both in defining the re-               launching point, and in guiding the pathway and  pace of the re-launch.  However, it is important to assess the resources  available within SVG to support these initiatives  and to identify any critical gaps that must be  addressed. It is also important to consider how  ICT is utilised in the other (non-ICT) sectors of the  country.          Figure10:   Summary of the Existing ICT Initiatives     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 38           This Page left Blank         Current Usage by Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 39                                          2.1 JUDICIARY  overnment is utilising justice software,  JEMS – Judicial Enforcement Management  System, to facilitate the administration of   the Courts. This application software supports all  types of court cases, payments, warrants,  sentencing, docket scheduling, and  forms/reports generation.   The various registries (Civil Registry, Electoral  Registry, and Commerce and Intellectual Property  Registry (CIPO)) have been computerized, but  needs to be integrated.     2.2 FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION  Standard Integrated Tax Administration System  (SIGTAX) is used to manage tax collection, while  Automatic System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA)  World supports Customs. SMARTSTREAM is  utilised by the finance departments of  Government.    2.3 AGRICULTURE  Work is in train on the development of a national  agriculture production and marketing   information system to provide market  information and intelligence to the agricultural  sector.    2.4 HEALTH  SVG has about 97 Medical Doctors, 298 Registered  Nurses, 13 Dentists and about 47 Pharmacists,  with a 2009 Health Budget of about EC$  71,607,805.  The country is home to a School of  Nursing and to an Off-shore Medical College. A  draft national strategic plan exists for health for  the period 2007–2012. The stated goal of the  sector is to improve the health status of the  people through enhancing and expanding public  health services, expansion of secondary services,  improving the quality of and access to the  services, and improving the decision making  capacity of the sector.  The current challenges in the health sector  include chronic non-communicable diseases,  insufficient funding, the ineffective management  of inventory, the excessive need of overseas  referrals, insufficient statistical information on  the appropriate utilisation of services and   G     CURRENT USAGE  BY NON-ICT  SECTORS       Action Item:  Launch NAPMIS  Train Farmers and Extension Staff  in the use of Information Systems  and ICT in Agriculture      Action Item:  Make solid advancements in 10  major recommendations to raise the  competitiveness of SVG and  introduce the mechanisms to  effectively report theses  advancements      Action Item:    Create and Launch a well designed  Web-2.0 Government Portal which  allow sector stakeholder  participation and centralised  standards Draft Policy 26th June  2009     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 40        supplies, and inadequate staffing including key  specialisations. The sector is required to respond  to an increase in the elderly and a decreasing  birth rate. There are 39 clinics, 5 rural hospitals,  1 mental hospital, 1 private hospital, and 1  general hospital (Milton Cato Memorial Hospital -  MCMH). Community care is provided through the  clinics located across the country. Each clinic  serves about 3,000 people and is easily  accessible. Health centres are well staffed and  provide a wide range of services, including  midwifery, family planning, immunization and  emergency care.      Some computers are available at the Ministry,  MCMH, and 4 district clinics. However ICT is now  being introduced into various institutions and  into the heath sector on a larger scale, including  the provision of patient administration and  medical records.   A major project, the National Health Information  System, is expected to restructure and re- engineer the business processes at the hospitals  and clinics and is anticipated to cost about EC$  2.3 million. A new fibre optic cable was laid to  connect the Ministry of Health with the MCMH.  Telemedicine is being used at the MCMH. The   mass media, particularly radio, is used to  disseminate information to the public at large.  With a new Diagnostic Hospital being built at  Georgetown, three regional Poly-Clinics being  built at Stubbs, Mespotamia and Buccament, and  a new Milton Cato Memorial Hospital proposed  for the Arnos Vale Airport Site after 2012, the  connectivity between these institutions will  present a major challenge.    2.5 EDUCATION  Formal education is provided at three levels:  primary education (seven years), secondary  education (five years), and tertiary education  (two to three years). Specialisation starts at  secondary level where programmes are offered  from general / academic and extends to the  tertiary level. There is currently no curriculum  incorporating IT at the primary or secondary  level.  Formal education relating to IT or  computer science is only available at the tertiary  level.  The process of acquiring hardware and  connecting schools to the Internet has  accelerated over the last 3 years. According to  the statistics available from the Ministry of  Education (MOE), about 34 educational  institutions have Internet connectivity via  computer labs - which includes 18 primary  schools and 12 secondary schools. The total  number of students in SVG’s educational system  is 32,338 which include 3,426 pre-schoolers,  15,532 in primary schools, 11,688 in secondary  schools and 1,692 in private schools.  While most institutions have Internet access via  the principal office/lab, the number of students  per PC in these institutions is 55.6 which are not  optimal. The number of students with Internet  connectivity is 9.7 per 100 primary school  students and 6.4 per 100 secondary school    Action Item:    Launch HIS to track patient  records, diagnostic tests,  discharges summaries,  medications, medical supplies, and  laboratory results & health trends           Education Technology    A complex set of forces now drives  the uptake of educational technology:   1. Government policies are driving more  educators to tailor their instruction to  the individual needs of students   2. Important constituency groups expect  to see technology used in the classroom   3. Online learning offers a solution to the  challenge of increasing access while  maintaining cost   4. Significant factors impede the more  substantive adoption of educational  technology   5. Popular support has waned for using  technology as a tool to reform  education institutions   6. Technology purchases must compete  with other priorities for increasingly  scarce budgetary resources   7. Moving to the next level of technology  adoption requires significant and  difficult behavioural changes   Educators are increasingly sophisticated  consumers of educational technology:   8. The most appealing solutions will  provide compelling evidence of their  effectiveness   9. Seeking the benefits of standardization,  institutions will migrate from point to  enterprise-wide solutions   10. The acceptance of vendor-hosted  solutions and other delivery options  will grow in the market                    Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 41       students. It is therefore clear that the technology  in the education system is not adequate for  supporting acceleration in the utilization of ICT  for national development, and in fact, is unlikely  to even meet the current demand. It should be  noted that budgetary constraints have been the  main limiting factor in making ICT available to  MOE. However, three (3) major initiatives will  significantly improve or provide additional  infrastructure, namely:   • The EU-funded ICT in Education Project  • The use of the Universal Service Fund to   enhance connectivity for school and  household access to wireless broadband   • The Laptop Project which will enable a level  playing field    Figure 11 below illustrates the global trend of  students to computers.    Within this context, the Ministry of Education  (MOE) embarked in late 2007, on an Improvement  of Education through the use of Information and  Communication Technology Project. This project  is funded by the European Community (EU) to a  maximum of 12.1 million Euros of the total cost  of 13.27 million Euros. The operational  implementation phase of the project is expected  to be completed by 31 December 2011, and  closed by 31 December 2013. The purpose of the  project is to improve the quality of education at  all levels nationwide by creating opportunities to  use ICT in innovative ways, including its  integration into the pedagogy of the  teaching/learning processes.              ICT IN EDUCATION PROJECT   1. New wireless computer labs in all 20  Secondary Schools   2. New wireless computer labs in 43 (70%)  of Primary Schools which have the  infrastructure and space for computer  labs   3. Ten (10) laptops for each of the  remaining twenty (20) primary schools  (which do not yet have the physical  space for a computer lab)   4. Each school will receive innovative  whiteboards, a projector and two  teaching laptops for teachers to use ICT,  internet and power-point presentations  to prepared and teach certain subjects   5. Teachers will be retrained to use ICT to  teach specific courses   6. The development of an on-line SVGeNET  7. The Project will construct three new   high tech, state-of-the-art lecture  theatres at the Community College to  accommodate 1,000 students. It  will  also construct ICT labs and install  Distance Learning Equipment for on-line  degree courses   Figure 11:  Global Trend on Student to Computer Ratio   STUDENT LAPTOP NETBOOK PROJECT   30,000 Netbooks will be distributed to  Primary, Secondary and Community College  Students free.   1.

SVGeNET will be used to facilitate  teaching and learning     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 42        2.5.1 Project Scope   The education project has three focus areas,  namely:  1. Improved educational management,   administration and governance through the  incorporation of effective strategies   2. Improved quality of basic education, and  technical and vocational education and  training, through the integration of ICT   3. Improved infrastructure at the SVG  Community College to include ICT-enhanced  facilities   It also supports the development of knowledge- based systems, SVGeNET, electronic document  management, and information-driven decision  making processes in the MOE. It includes  hardware, software, computer networks,  projectors, academic software, furniture and  equipment, teacher training, and a modern  Lecture Theatre and ICT facilities. The project  includes maintenance of the procured   infrastructure. When this project is completed, it  is anticipated that the people of SVG will have the  sustainable provision of learning opportunities  for all. They should therefore be equipped with  the skills and knowledge necessary for creating  and maintaining a productive and innovative  society.  Training of the people who are currently  employed in the area of ICT has also been  recognised as a priority. The need to increase  local competitiveness and the employable of the  local labour force is being addressed by the  National Information and Communication  Technology Training Project (NICTTP). This  project is in progress at a cost of about  EC$2,655,174, and is aimed at providing a cadre  of trained persons with various levels of  computer skills.  An adjunct to the massive expansion at schools  and learning institutions is the use of the  network of Learning Resource Centres (LRCs)   Community Centres and Libraries.  The Modern  National Library will be a shining example of ICT  in usage and virtual Libraries.              2.5.2 Human Development         The state of human development in SVG is captured  in the statistics from the 2008 UNDP Human  Development Report shown in Table 7.                        Table 7:  Human Development Statistics for SVG        2.5.3  National Centre  Technological Innovation  (NCTI)           The NCTI was established as a State Company  in 2006 and won the contract to implement  training under the NICTTP.

This training  will focus on training talented individuals in    the creation of a new wave of innovative web- based software applications including  entertainment and games for mobile phones,  and to meet the needs of the private sector.    2.5.4 Centre of Excellence   (Diamond)   The Center of Excellence (COE) also provides  services for ICT enterprises to be nurtured in  resident, outreach and virtual incubators.  There will be a focused drive to link the COE  with other regional and international Centers  of Excellence to facilitate the process of  transfer of appropriate technology.  The COE will establish strategic alliances with  the Government of India as part of a  Windward Island (OECS) initiative which will  provide state of the art ICT equipment and  trainers.  Other strategic alliances will be sought with  the COE to enable a global reach.  The various ICT training initiatives currently  in train in SVG within the education sector  has been summarised in pictorial form in  Figure 12. It is clear that the strategic value  of ICT in this sector has been recognised  across the various educational institutions of  the country. Close coordination and  alignment of these various initiatives will aid  tremendously in ensuring that the benefits  anticipated are in fact achieved in this sector.            Figure12:  Spectrum of Public Sector Training in ICT in the Education Sector  (From Primary School to Advanced Training)   Centre of Excellence,  Diamond     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 44        2.6 ICT & EMPLOYMENT  Information and communication technology skills  have become increasingly fundamental for  workers beyond the ICT sector itself. It is now  desirable that lower wage, lower skill workers  have basic ICT skills to enhance their  employability.  For example, auto repair, retail  and health care are industries where  incorporation of ICT into their workflows has  raised the skills bar for workers.   However, despite the importance of having a  basic knowledge of ICT, it is only part of the  answer to job preparation. It is clear that soft  skills, such as interpersonal communication,   teamwork, and work attitudes or habits, are also  essential for employability. In essence, lower  wage, lower skill workers face multiple barriers,  many of which are more complex than simple  unfamiliarity with email or word processing.  Therefore ICT literacy cannot be isolated from the  larger social and personal context that exist  globally and in SVG in particular.   Soft skills as well as solutions to challenges such  as childcare, transportation, time, and  appropriate attire are critically important. Social  ties and personal networks are also recognized as  crucial to finding a job and succeeding at work.   Notwithstanding the importance of other factors,  SVG has begun the process of ensuring that the  lower wage, lower skill workers have equitable  access to ICT training and exposure.                             2.6.1 Freedom of information     The Freedom of Information Act was passed in  December 2003. This Act extends the right of  members of the public to access public  information about the operations of public                                                                                                                              authorities. Information about the rules and  practices of public authorities which will affect  members of the public must be readily available  to persons affected by those rules and practices.   Under this Act, the members of the public have  the right to access information in documentary  form which is in the possession of public  authorities limited only by expectations and  exemptions necessary for the protection of  essential public interests and the private and  business affairs of persons in respect of whom  information is collected and held by public  authorities.  Also, this Act creates a right to bring  about the amendment of records containing  personal information that is incomplete, incorrect  or misleading.         2.6.2 Privacy    A side effect of being connected is the need to  protect the privacy of the individual. This issue is  closely linked to cyber security since in recent  times databases containing personal information  on thousands of persons have been compromised.  This is an issue that affects the individual, large   corporations, and public institutions. There are  instances where some of the larger ICT companies  collect personal information to support targeted  marketing to their advertisers.  There is therefore a balance that needs to be  struck by public sector policy makers in the  creation of privacy legislation. This must be  balance with the general requirements of the  FOIA, and is an issue that is even more acute for  small countries like SVG.   The Privacy Act for the Public Sector was passed  in 2005. A Privacy Bill for the Private Sector is  yet to be enacted and is required to complete the  suite of enabling legislation.    Action Item:   Introduced a program which  provides subsidised laptops to each  student in St. Vincent and the  Grenadines         Action Item:   Establish Strategic Alliances  between the COE and an  International Company with  sufficient technical depth, training  capacity and global reach to   make the COE a premier training  institution and creator of software  applications         Action Item:     A suite of ICT related legislation  will be enacted:   Electronic Transaction Act; Data  Protection Act; Electronic Crimes Bill;  and Electronic Evidence Bill   A program of Child Online  Protection will be promoted.          Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 45       2.6.3 Cyber Security    The challenge of security is the ultimate side  effect of a well connected society. The more  connected SVG becomes, the more opportunities  are created for individuals who wish to commit  cyber crime. Developing countries have to be  careful to not underestimate the security threat  posed by being connected. In parallel with the  many initiatives being taken in SVG to get  connected to everyone and to the world, must be  the completion of projects to protect such  connectivity. This requires national projects  which involve educating and training all users. It  will involve new legislative measures and new  investigative units within the security  organisations of the country. As cyber crimes can  be committed in any country from any country, it  is important that SVG works closely with external   agencies and establish the necessary bilateral and  multilateral instruments to make investigations  and trials as easy as possible. Work has  commenced in SVG to address the cyber security  challenge, but much remains to be done.  Government has recognised that the initiatives  being undertaken to provide universal  connectivity to the Internet creates other  challenges that must be addressed in moving  forward. To some extent, some initiatives are  already in train in this regard. The Internet, by  default, allows anyone to post anything on any  subject for anyone to access anywhere in the  world, unless specific effort is made to try to  restrict this. This fact creates two areas of  concern for SVG on the issue of content. The first  issue is that of content that is created specifically  for a criminal purpose; and the second issue is  content that can lead to the programming of  young minds that can lead to criminal and other  non-productive behaviour in the future.   The control of content is a sensitive issue,  especially in democratic countries such as SVG.  There is a delicate balance that must be made  between controlling content and the right of the  individual to access content of their choice. SVG  is currently in the process of creating public  policy to address this concern. Equally important  is the content on radio and television and its  impact on local culture and the young people of  SVG. Again, government policy with respect to  local content and the nature of content on the  airwaves are being developed.     2.6.4 Civil Society  The general centralized view of governance and  services to civil society has been impacted by the  Internet. It is clear that the centre of a country’s  social systems and networks is no longer at the  figurative traditional central meeting place   whether city or village square, but is now at the  edges. Individual users have the ability to  instantly act both locally and globally, and to  interact with consummate ease with huge diverse  human networks from the comfort of their  homes. Almost anyone in society now has the  power to create and distribute diverse content at  will.   Once it is recognised that power is now in the  hands of ordinary citizens, it is recognised that a  great opportunity exists to orientate policy  initiatives towards a true multi-stakeholder  consensus style of non-centralized governance  which can revolutionize the public sector by  streamlining government services, and which can  herald a new dialogue between the state and civil  society.   The opportunity to mobilize otherwise  unrecognised or previously unknown expertise  and capability is innovative in itself and  government is best placed to spearhead the  enabling environment which will generate and  disseminate home-grown knowledge at will.   SVG will therefore pursue the formulation of  national policy which will nurture the human  capital of the country. This policy will recognise  the enormous potential for ordinary citizens  across the social spectrum to contribute to their  nation state with an increased sense of security,  well being and belonging. The policy will enable  the building of a highly creative and innovative  society. It will attempt to exercise the minds of  the youth so that they are able to partake on  level footing with regional and international  partners. But the policy will be so crafted to  maintain the country’s cultural differences and to  enable the dissemination of the uniqueness of its  people to others.   In order to unleash this national ‘power source of  the people’, SVG must mainstream ICT into the   The issue of cyber security is not just  an issue for businesses and  consumers. It is an issue of National  Security whereby its effects can shut  down the entire country as have been  seen in the recent past in Eastern  Europe.   SVG cannot wait until such events  occur in the region, and therefore it  is necessary to start planning and  putting in place the necessary local  and regional institutions to address  this issue.    The Internet as a tool, rather than a  goal in itself, has changed many of the  traditional governance models that  we have become used to in civil  society.         St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 46        traditional economic sectors where it is  recognised that an untapped knowledge pool  exists. It is expected that new policies and  strategic alliances will need to be created to  achieve this objective. Such policies must address  the creation of ad hoc community networks  within the context of the existing  telecommunications regulations which were  originally designed to deal with specific legacy  issues.     The Caribbean has been held up to much  criticism for its apparent failure to generate  content that is Caribbean-based and which is  relevant to its people. However, if the content  being created by Caribbean internet users on  external networks like Facebook and IMVU and  Tagged are reviewed, the talent of the people of  the Caribbean becomes very apparent. The  opportunity to exploit this untapped capability  and capacity is real and significant, and SVG will  take steps to make the best use of its people in  this regard.  Government has recognised the emergence of  social networking as having the capacity to  significantly raise the level of contribution of  civil society. It is therefore planned that SVG will  apply these new tools and similar principles to  the areas of culture and heritage, local festivals  and music. Social networking tools will also be   used to simulate discourse on the environment,  health and safety, healthcare, and education.  E-literacy or digital literacy is core to the  creation of a knowledge-based society which is a  primary aim of SVG. While many of the towns and  villages in the country have the basic  infrastructure in the form of resource centres,  much more is needed to promote literacy at all  levels and ensure that both young and old in the  country are given the basic tools to allow them to  participate in sustainable nation building.  While youth will be a major area of focus, equal  emphasis will be placed on senior members of  society to ensure that they can use technology for  their own development. This is important given  the traditional roles that the senior members play  in maintaining discipline and social governance  in homes, villages, towns and communities.  NGOs, sporting associations, and other civil  society groupings will also be supported and  strengthened through ICT investments.   In essence, the innovation that is often inherent  in civil society will be supported by ICT. A  tailored SVG strategy will be developed to allow  education, business and the public sector to  partner with civil society to mobilize expertise  and capacity to kick-start the generation and  dissemination of new forms of knowledge within  the country.  This will be a transformative and  people-centred approach built on ICT-based   knowledge centres. In moving forward with the  development of civil society, connectivity will be  treated as a utility in the same way that  electricity and water are utilities that enable  modern societies. It is expected that a major  proportion of civil society will be connected  either at home or via a mobile device.     2.6.5 The Diaspora  The National Homecoming and Diaspora  Framework for Action 2009 provide  recommendations for action on behalf of  Vincentians living abroad and those living in  SVG.  Government has begun planning on the use  of ICT to better enhance business relations  between SVG and the Diaspora.          2.7 DEVELOPING AN E-CITIZEN   CHARTER  The development of an e-Citizens Charter along  the lines of the document shown in the Appendix  2 is considered an important best practice which  SVG will be pursuing. The development of the  Charter will be done in conjunction with Civil  Society and will include the participation of the  Private Sector. The Charter will address the key  issues of choice, freedom of information and  privacy.                     Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 47       2.8 THE PRIVATE SECTOR  SVG has had a major monopoly  telecommunications provider for over 100 years.  Since the liberalisation of this sector, two new  major providers, a refashioned incumbent, and  other organisations have brought major  advancements in technology, affordability and  value to the ICT Sector.   However in order to achieve the true benefits  and potential of liberalisation, the entire Private  Sector has to be fully engaged, firstly to support  the goals and initiatives of connectivity, and  secondly to adopt ICT to improve their own  internal efficiency, communication and  marketing. Additionally, if the Sector fully  engages in training of all employees in ICT, it is  believed that this will improve their level of  competitiveness, sustainability and success.  Figure 13 below give some details of the  challenges that business typically faces with  utilization of ICT, which must be addressed by  local enterprises in SVG, if they are to obtain the  desired improvements. Developing core ICT skills  within the organisation is a priority in ensuring  the ICT operations function smoothly. The  involvement of ICT leaders in the alignment of   ICT and business strategy is also critical to the  strategic use of ICT by any organisation.   At a regional level, organisations such as the  Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) and  the Caribbean Organisation of National  Telecommunication Operators (CANTO) have  outlined programmes for connecting the  Caribbean, in which partnerships with  Governments and Civil Society are seen as critical  to success.    2.8.1  ICT for Economic   Diversification  Under the EU Special Framework of Assistance  2005 Programme, the economic diversification,  competitiveness and employment capacity  improvement is being pursued for the productive  sectors of SVG. The Programme aims to create an  enabling environment and human resource pool  to support the further introduction and  sustainable use of ICT. In fact, the development of  this National ICT strategy was supported by this  Programme. SVG is pursuing diversification in  several areas including agriculture, tourism and  ICT, so it is useful to review how ICT is utilised in  these sectors.          The Ministry of Agriculture is in the process of  updating its 1997 – 2006 National Agriculture  Development Plan. Within this context, work is in  progress on the development of an Agricultural  Portal and on the introduction of a National  Agricultural Production and Marketing  Information System. The implementation of a  Geographic Information System is being  investigated and a Land Bank Project is expected  to be implemented soon.  An Organisation of American States (OAS) project  is also being pursued with the assistance of the  Centre of Enterprise Development to reduce  poverty in rural areas by assisting individuals in  starting up businesses. Computer Resource and  Internet Centres (CORIC) have been implemented  in five rural communities to offer free computer  access and instruction to citizens of all ages  which will aid the establishment of SMEs.  The Ministry of Tourism, the Tourism Authority  and the National Rivers, Beaches and Rivers  Authority are responsible for the development of  tourism in SVG.    Figure 13: The ICT Challenges faced by Business   There is a general perception that ICT  leaders of departments and  enterprises lack appropriate essential  skills to meet the strategic needs of  business enterprises and of  governments, isolated from the  strategy definition phases and  relegated to delivering systems and  maintenance procedures.     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 48        The Ministry has completed a feasibility study on  the establishment of Hospitality Institute to be  completed by 2012. This Ministry is supported by  the main government website which has many of  SVG’s attractions available online.   SVG is aiming to launch a one-stop shop travel  portal by the end of 2010.The tourism sector  produces a weekly newsletter, “What’s on in  SVG” which highlights weekly events, and which  is distributed widely to visitors and hotels.     2.8.2 Investment Promotion in ICT  The National Investment Promotion Incorporation  – SVG Invest has been mandated to deal with  foreign investment including ICT, so that some  level of attention is being paid to the ICT sector.   The current business community in SVG has been  characterised by succession of family ownership  and management, heavily import reliant, and  resistant to change, concentrated in the retail and  distribution trade. It has been suggested that  more than 75% of businesses utilise computers.   However, e-Commerce activities within the  country are limited by the high costs of operating  merchant accounts.  Work has been completed under the EU/SFA 2005  Business Skills and e-Business Incubators Project,  Strategic Alliance Programme (SAP), on the  utilisation of strategic alliances on key sectors.  The SAP is expected to contribute to the  economic diversification and improve the  competitiveness and employment capacity of the  ICT services, agricultural, manufacturing and  tourism sectors through the fostering of strategic  alliances between the beneficiary SMEs, local  stakeholders, and regional / international  partners.   For example, the SAP proposes to provide  technical assistance in the development of at  least three joint e-commerce projects in specified  sectors with the participation of about 100 SMEs.  It proposes among other things, the development  of SVG’s ICT Portal to act as a gateway for the  promotion of ICT service providers which would  contain the following:    Directory of providers   Service procurement facility marketplace   Delivery of e-learning courses/webinars   Central databank of all ICT initiatives in SVG   Networking and development of an online   community of   ICT service providers   ICT hub to attract investors   Promote SVG as a competitive location for   ICT Sector and Service Industries         The concept of business incubators is being  pursued in the proposed Centre of Excellence and  will play a role in supporting the software  development business.  CIPO, Commercial Intellectual Property  Organisation in 2010 will mandate business  registration on line with a long transition for the  persons who have difficulty with registering  business names.                 2.8.3 Off-shoring, In-sourcing, Supply   Chaining, Customer Care Centre  and Foreign Direct Investment   There are several Customer Care Centres in St.  Vincent in Legal, Medical Transcription and  Telemarketing. Substantial experience and  lessons have been learnt on the success and  failure of attracting such investments. It has  become clear that the critical and important  competitiveness and quality issues must be  addressed in moving forward. These issues  include the relatively high telecommunications  cost, the choice of technology, quality of  management, availability of human resource, and  the skills required by potential employees.  The relocation of Arnos Vale Airport to Argyle  provides tremendous opportunity for the creation  of a New City, educational and sporting  institutions, local businesses, and Foreign Direct  Investment (FDI).                              Regional Organisations and Associations P a g e | 49                                 VG is committed, actively participating and  providing support to most regional ICT  initiatives and these must be factored into   the National ICT Strategy plan.     3.1 CARICOM  SVG is a member of CARICOM which has  elaborated a regional policy on ICT. The country  is a member of the CTU, ITU, CTO, CKLN, CARICAD,  OECS EGRIP Project, ECTEL, OAS (CITEL),  COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT, COMSYC and a  regional network of TAIWANESE ICT Centres. The  linkages are summarised in Figure 14.  The interaction between these regional  organisations, and coordinating and aligning  their activities are critical and involves the  National Authorising Officer, National Planning  Ministry, EFD, and cooperation of other state and  Private Sector Agencies. Similarly the  relationship with the major funding agencies of  the European Union, World Bank, CIDA, UNDESA,  UNDP, UNESCO, CDB and other donors needs to be  carefully managed, coordinated and aligned.  The support of the regional organisations and the  support from the regional organisations are an  important part of SVG’s national policy. The  highest level of collaboration, cooperation and  coordination is required to obtain the best value,    synergy and successes from these regional  agencies. CARICOM Heads of State, in November  2002, agreed on the need to diversify the  economies of the Caribbean through the  promotion of new technologies and regional  cooperation through the mechanism of Centres of  Excellence. The work of these agencies and their  relevance to SVG will now be reviewed.     3.2 CARIBBEAN KNOWLEDGE AND  LEARNING NETWORK (CKLN)     The Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network  (CKLN) evolved in pursuance of the Network’s  implied vision, and to lay the foundation for the  development of regional functional cooperation  in the area of ICT.      S      Figure 14:  Diagram of SVG’s Regional Links and Associations         CKLN  ICT in Education &   content Creation        CTU  ICT for Economic   Development   OECS E-GRIP  E-Government for   OECS Integration   TAIWAN/SVG  ICT Support   Centre  NTRC  ECTEL  Regulatory  Services  & USF   CARICAD  ICT-E-Government   In Public Administration  Reform   SVG   CARICOM      REGIONAL   ORGANISATIONS   AND ASSOCIATIONS       St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 50        The main objectives of the CKLN are defined as  follows:    To improve the relevance of tertiary  education and training by increasing the  number of accredited tertiary education  programs recognized internationally for  their excellence    To strengthen tertiary institutions, foster  specialization and knowledge sharing    To ensure the convergence of fragmented  regional and international initiatives to  maximize results in the region as well as for  the international market   At the 27th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of  Government of the Caribbean Community in July  2006, it was decided to develop a Caribbean  Regional Research and Education Network  (C@ribNET), coordinated and managed by CKLN  to enable the integration of Member States in the  world‘s global education and research network  infrastructure with the objective of enhancing  regional competitiveness and the development of  a knowledge-based economy. In this context, the  vision for C@ribNET is that of a network of  national research and education networks  specifically intended to support:    A virtual learning environment shared by  Caribbean Institutions of Tertiary Research  and Education Centres    The connection of Universities and other  Tertiary Institutions in the Caribbean to the  Universities in Europe, North America, Latin  America and elsewhere to facilitate  research, collaboration and knowledge  sharing    Support for the Caribbean integration  process by providing an enabling  environment, through connectivity, in  support of the Caribbean Single Market and   Economy and the Economic Partnership  Agreement    Bridging the digital divide in the Region to  achieve social cohesion of Caribbean people  through digital inclusion   C@ribNET will support interactive learning, peer- to-peer exchange and the development of  knowledge networks, and cost-effective access to  high quality e-learning content and other  knowledge resources drawn from the region and  around the world. It is expected that the learning  offerings made available on the Network are  prioritized to the needs of the Caribbean labour  market and the cultural and socio-economic  context of CARICOM countries.     C@ribNET is planned with an initial phase for  five years and is projected to be a network of  national Research and Education (R&E) networks.  It will be available to all public tertiary education  institutions in CARICOM member states, including  the University of the West Indies (UWI) and  institutions in SVG, and expanded to other  national public research facilities and other  public sector/not- for-profit institutions engaged  in research and education in the Caribbean. It is  therefore essential for this CKLN’s initiative to be  integrated into SVG’s ICT and educational  initiatives.   3.3  CARIBBEAN  TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNION    The Governments of the Member States of the  Caribbean Community, cognizant of the growing  importance of telecommunications for the social  and economic development of the Caribbean and  the need to foster international cooperation and  development by means of efficient  telecommunications services, established the  Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) by  treaty, on 28th April, 1989. SVG is a vibrant  member of the Caribbean Telecommunications  Union (CTU) and has helped provided ICT  leadership in the Caribbean. As a result of  convergence of technologies, the CTU has  expanded its role and mandate beyond  telecommunications to that of ICT.  The original mandate of the CTU included:  1. Harmonize telecommunications and ICT   policies, laws and regulations in CARICOM  2. Establish a permanent framework for   regional collaboration among  telecommunications regulators, policy  makers and academics   3. Empowering the private sector to take a  more active role in shaping policy on Free  Trade negotiations and regional integration   The CTU has been actively engaged since 2005 in  the process of ICT harmonization. It initiated a  major project to reform and harmonise regional  approaches to spectrum management and a focus  on ICT for Economic Development.    3.3.1 Policy Development  The CTU has developed several Policy Documents  of relevance and interest to SVG, including:    Caribbean Spectrum Management  Framework Policy informed by a Regional  Task Force of policy advisors in   The goal of the CKLN is to: ‘Leverage  information and communications  technology and modern approaches to  education to enhance the global  competitiveness of countries in the  Region, overcoming the constraints of  remoteness and scale in tertiary  education.’        Current Usage in Non-ICT Sectors P a g e | 51       collaboration with regulators, operators  and other stakeholders    Caribbean Internet Governance Policy  Framework    Handbook for IPv4 Exhaust and IPv6  Adoption     3.3.2 Capacity Building and Public  Awareness   The CTU has also conducted 6 Ministerial Briefing  Seminars to apprise ICT Ministers of technological  developments and the implications for national  development and exposed more than 160 ICT  stakeholders to Internet Governance issues. The  organisation has trained 100 Caribbean ccTLD  Managers and students, 180 Spectrum managers  and technicians in various subjects in Spectrum  Management, and 60 regulators on Numbering 3  Representation.    3.3.3 The CTU in Representing the   Caribbean  The organisation was responsible for the  inclusion of regional projects on the ITU’s World  Telecommunications Development Conference  Agenda 2007-2011, and actively participates in  regional and international ICT fora.        3.3.4 Industry Watch  The CTU has brought to the attention of SVG and  Caribbean ICT Stakeholders several important  issues, including:    The potential difficulties posed by mobile  operators using foreign Home Number  Identification Codes    That the Caribbean should be de-linked  from Latin America and have responsibility  for its own ITU Centre of Excellence nodes in  the region    The imminent exhaustion of IPv4 Internet  addresses and the need for IPv6 adoption by  member governments; and the  establishment of national advisory bodies to  manage this transition and provide  adequate public awareness     3.3.5 Technical Support  The CTU routinely provides technical support to  members and ICT stakeholders in the region.  Some of the activities include:    ICT Project Funding Proposal preparation   Technical advice on ICT matters   Review of ICT policy and regulatory   documents   Conducted Spectrum Field Audits in seven   member states     The work of the CTU will continue to impact SVG;  in particular its regional initiatives identified in  Table 8 above, are important for the country.    3.4 CARICAD  SVG is also a member of CARICAD which is the  region’s lead agency on Public Sector Reform and  the use of e-Government. CARICAD has developed  a Regional E-Government Policy which outlines   the appropriate focus for harmonised E- Government initiatives. The agency provides  advice on and continued Public Administration  Reform in the advancement of effective public  administration.    3.5 EGRIP  SVG joined the World Bank funded Electronic  Government for Regional Integration Project  (EGRIP) in November 2009 with a strongly  articulated political will and determination for  sub-regional cooperation in the OECS. This  cooperation is emphasised in the area of e- government, including the application of ICT for  public sector modernisation with an IDA credit of  US$ 2.3 million. In particular the focus is on  improving competitiveness of SVG, enhancing  public sector efficiency, transparency and   accountability, developing the private sector,  enhancing social inclusion, and facilitating sub- regional harmonisation and integration. EGRIP  recognises the CARICOM Connectivity Agenda  (2003), the Action-Oriented e-Government  Strategy for Countries of the Caribbean Regions  2004-2007, the EU SFA 2005 Programme and  CIDA’s proposed Supporting Economic  Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR).           PLANNED REGIONAL INITIATIVES  1 Continuing the Caribbean ICT harmonisation process  2 Establishing the Caribbean Spectrum Management Task Force as a permanent advisory   body to Member States  3 Promoting the adoption of IPv6 in the Caribbean  4 Implementing measures to facilitate information sharing between Caribbean   Governments under its Connected Caribbean Initiative  5 Providing revenue-generating ICT-related services to augment the inadequate   contributions of members   Table 8:  Regional Initiatives of the CTU     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 52         EGRIP has two main components, cross-sectoral  e-government interventions and sectoral e- government.     3.5.1 The horizontal e-government   interventions include:   Policy and strategy implementation   Legal and regulatory framework   implementation   ICT standards and total cost of ownership   optimisation   Regional e-government institutional   framework strengthening   Automated registries and multi-purpose ID   systems     3.5.2 The vertical e-government   interventions include:   E-government in public financial   management   E-government in tax administration   E-government in customs   Electronic government procurement   E-government in Health, Postal, Roads and   other sectors  The e-Grip project has a well defined set of  deliverables, a major outcome of which is the  establishment of a team of technical expertise  who can serve the sub-region in maintaining and  continually upgrading the e-government systems  critical infrastructure and applications. The   project will also explore the measures to ensure  self financing so as to avoid escalating costs.       3.5.3 E-Government Pitfalls  There are well identified pitfalls that must be  avoided in developing and executing an e- government agenda which must be considered in  designing a way forward.  It is well acknowledged that the adoption of  technologies without developing the necessary  human skills and capacities to manage, integrate  and maintain them is not sustainable. Further,  the centralized use of technologies by national  government departments without ensuring that  the benefits of technology are also derived by  associated or intermediary institutions, such as  local government, Parliament, and civil society,  will create unbalanced institutions.   And finally, the failure to link better governance  to broader and more inclusive democracy which  gives voice to those who cannot afford  technologies, but have needs and ideas to  express, will create negative challenges for  citizenry.    3.5.4 e-Government Integration   Success  The focus has often been on using technology to  build front-end visibility with the citizen. While  this can potentially create a superior citizen  experience, this is only possible if the backend  technology enables the electronic completion of  the service or information request. Otherwise, the  end-to-end experience for the citizen will be   poor. In this context, the end-to-end quality of  the infrastructure must be continuously managed  and strengthened to ensure maximum citizen  care. And appropriate governance frameworks  must be put in place.  Government accounts for fifty percent or more of  ICT use. In SVG, it is the only entity that has the  potential to support the development of a  thriving ICT industry. SVG Government is also  well positioned to be the catalyst for developing  ICT careers to attract and retain people in the  sector for the longer term, and therefore creating  a sustainable ICT resource pool. The need to  centralise ICT resources must therefore be  investigated in greater detail. There is a need to  determine the business case for outsourcing  defined ICT activities to a Regional OECS Team or  to the ICT community through Public-Private- Partnerships. The use of cloud computing  technology needs to be investigated as a  mechanism to ensure full e-government  integration in a viable manner.    Figure 15 on the following page summarises the  key issues and barriers that need to be addressed  in moving e-government forward in SVG.                     It is important to encompass the EGRIP  initiatives in moving forward with the  ICT agenda.         Regional Organisations and Associations P a g e | 53       1  MANDATE   Mandate the treating of ICT filing and services with  higher priority.     To reduce lines and   make transactions, easier, and quicker; and so attract  users to   the e-gov on-line modality,  there must be benefits to consumer for using ICT   2  MAINTAINANCE   Effective technical maintenance of quality on-line  e-gov services     Provide a high quality user friendly experience   Reduce total cost of ownership  Develop standards   Use OECS technical teams to reduce down time  and  avoid costly upgrades   3  GREATER ACCESS   Ensure citizen household and community access  to broadband   Promote business, urban and rural access to  broadband     Greatly increase percentage of   household penetration  and business penetration   4  TRAIN PUBLIC SERVANT     Train ministry staff and human resources to adopt and  handle ICT as part of public sector and administrative   reform     And address other  fundamental non-ICT transformational reforms     SUCCESSFUL   INTRODUCTION  AND USE OF   E-GOVERNMENT  INITIATIVES &   SERVICES     5  TRAIN CITIZENS     Promote training of citizens, communities and   business  in the use and practical   benefits of ICT and  E-government services     6   TECHNICAL FINANCIAL MECHANISM     Ensure effective ability  to implement financial transactions including   on-line payments and  on-line refunds        7   ICT REGULATORY  Ensure an effective regulatory process     Including Certification Authority and   Encryption Services     Implement a modern electronic communication Act     8   CYBERCRIMES     Address issues of cybercrime and public fear of on- line transactions     In particular, address the issue of identity theft and   computer misuse     Figure 15:  Ensuring Success of e-Government Initiatives      The success of implementing of the e-Government  initiatives identified in the various preceding  sections will largely depend on the degree to   which the critical   issues and barriers shown  above are addressed. It is now necessary to  consider how SVG can move forward in the   context of the best practices that the country  wishes to adopt and the current state of e- readiness defined previously.     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 54            This Page left Blank        Accelerating Forward P a g e | 55                               4.1 THE ICT STRATEGY   FUNDAMENTALS   An ICT Strategy is a blueprint that anchors and  guides events and activities through a never  ending lifecycle. It delivers technological  advancements and is able to sustain itself  through an iterative cycle of improvements for  which the consensus of all parties is a critical  success factor. If, however, the strategy is  unilaterally altered or compromised without due  regard to its custodians and to stakeholders, then  it can ‘self-destruct’ and quickly become obsolete  from lack of broad support.   Understanding the national development strategy  and translating the current business-of- government strategy as a first step, is an  indisputable best practice in shaping the ICT   strategy and architecture in alignment with the  goals and objectives of the SVG stakeholder  community. Engaging the strategy’s leadership at  an early stage makes the strategy definition  process a strong confidence-building measure.  This is critically important for obtaining funding  and ensuring successful implementation. The  close partnering of ICT and sponsors (including  business, government, and civil-society) in a  collaborative manner delivers transparency and  ensures that strong relationships are created  which results in a partnership that delivers a  rapid and agile approach to the use of ICT at a  national level.        4.2 DEVELOPING THE NATIONAL ICT   POLICY AND PLAN  A national ICT Policy and associated Strategic  Plan have far reaching impacts, and must  therefore be developed as a national effort to  ensure ownership and support for its  implementation. The private sector and key  stakeholders must be part of the development  process. Government therefore appointed several  Sector-Specific Working Groups or SWGs. The  architecture of the SWG is illustrated in Figure 16  and included:    Technical Infrastructure    Government (including Justice and National   Security)   Agriculture       Community Development     Health      Figure 16:  Architecture of SWG      e2G Strategy All Encompassing Team  Infrastructure  Training Human Resources  Legal & regulatory  Governance  eCommerce  E-GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES, NATIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS. THE  DIASPORA AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS  Public Sector Transformation  ICT Sector  ICT Strategy  & Core Team      Specific Sector Content & Application  The strategic plan must address the demands  for transparency and privacy which require  defined, documented security, standards and  baselines for all national ICT assets. It must  apply coherent, consistent risk management  processes across all major classes of risk,  especially in addressing compliance and  governance requirements.          ACCELERATING  FORWARD        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 56         Tourism      Legal and Regulatory    Education and Human Resource   Development    Industry and ICT Sector (including Trade   and Financial Services)   The members of the SWG were generally selected  based on their experience and expertise in the  specific sector, and were often well respected  subject matter experts. With external facilitation  and utilising a best practice development  process, eVolve™, the SWGs met over the period  May 2009 to March 2010, and crafted the national  ICT policy and plan.   It should be noted that some of the initiatives  that were considered by the SWGs did not made  its way into this document as issues of  prioritisation and resourcing had to be taken into  consideration. However, this plan must be  reviewed regularly and be kept updated annually  as St. Vincent and the Grenadines progresses over  the coming years else it will run the risk of  becoming irrelevant to the national goals and  aspirations. And such initiatives can be re-visited.       4.3 ICT VISION  The vision statement created for SVG focuses  heavily on sustainability and on quality of life  improvements for all of the country’s people. It  gives life to the desired outcomes of the National  ICT Plan. The Vision is captured in the following  statement:  “St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a  sustainable knowledge-based society  that maximises the use of Information  and Communication Technology for  greater competitiveness, economic  development, an improved quality of  life and work for all its people, at  home and abroad.”   The Vision is clear that the benefits of its ICT  agenda must be shared equitably, within SVG and  with the Diaspora. The inclusion of the Diaspora  is an important mechanism in addressing  resource constraints. An emphasis on  improvements in the quality of work experience  is explicitly detailed. Sustainability is considered  key and underpins the vision, and Government  expects that the considerable benefits of being a  knowledge-based society will be derived by the  country.      4.4 CORE VALUES  It was decided that there are some core values  which underpin this Vision and which must be  supported throughout the implementation effort.  These core values were identified as follows:    Sustainable   Competitive   Promoting Innovation     Transformative   People-centred   All stakeholders agreed that in the process of  implementation, the core values must not be lost  or subsumed, but are always explicitly built into  each and every individual plan for execution. Key  questions must be continuously asked: Will the  outputs and outcomes of the ICT execution effort  be sustainable? Will it enable St. Vincent and the  Grenadines to become more competitive? Will it  promote innovation? Will it enable the people  and the country to become more effective and  productive through its transformative capability?  And finally does the execution agenda have  people at its core? If any action taken or project  executed under the ambit of this Plan does not  provide satisfactory answers to the above tests or  subset of these tests, then the action will need to  be re-examined as it will not support the core   values defined and therefore be inconsistent with  the strategic direction desired for SVG.      4.5 DESIRED OUTCOMES  It was important that SVG determine the specific  outcomes which it wants achieved within the life  of the Plan. After much debate, particularly  around the issue of available resources, the  desired outcomes were defined and are presented  below:    Strengthened ICT sector contributing  significantly to the country’s economic  vigour, to the drive for OECS sub-regional  integration and economic union, and to  regional integration     Further strengthening of legislative and  regulatory framework to embrace ICT,  minimize cybercrimes, and engender  greater trust and confidence in ICT among  all citizens    Processes which is inclusive of Civil Society,  the Private Sector and the Diaspora    Integrated government with all appropriate  information and services on line and  knowledge effectively managed by 2015    Universal, affordable and secure access to  Broadband Internet ICT services by all  citizens, businesses and communities by  2015    ICT is accessible and entrenched into the  education system and an ICT-literate society  created; and persons with high aptitude and  excellence harnessed and facilitated to excel  in this field    Health care delivery optimised by use of ICT   Growth of unique and innovative medium   and micro ICT enterprises in the creation of  local content and local software applications        Accelerating Forward P a g e | 57        Using ICT for innovation, growth in the  cultural arts and increased competitiveness  of the private sector    Attracting  Investment in the ICT sector   Computer and ICT waste managed effectively   and safely   ICT-enabled emergency response systems   saving lives and protecting livelihoods and  property   It is evident that in achieving these outcomes,  SVG’s growth and prosperity will have been  accelerated, and the national ICT plan would have  achieved its purpose.      4.6 NATIONAL ICT OBJECTIVES  The SWGs developed the broad objectives of the  National ICT Policy and Plan. These were  organised along the focus areas as follows:    4.6.1 Technical Infrastructure  To ensure that the national ICT infrastructure  expands and adapts such that it delivers  widespread, secure, and cost effective access to  state-of-the-art ICT that meets the evolving needs  of the country and its people.    4.6.2 Government (Inc. Justice and   National Security)  To ensure that ICT is optimally utilised within  government to improve cost-effectiveness and the  quality of services provided to citizens and  businesses, and to support the administration of  justice and national security.     4.6.3 Agriculture  To enable the effective and efficient supply chain  management (from production to sales and  marketing) through the use of ICT and thereby  promote the economic viability of agricultural  related activities.   4.6.4 Community Development  To promote affordable and universal access to ICT  services and resources in rural and underserved  communities so as to develop and strengthen  them, to impact on poverty and gender  inequalities, and to improve disaster  preparedness.    And additionally, to ensure Civil Society plays a  critical role in community development, and that  the borders which separate Vincentians within  the Diaspora are broken down by the use of ICT.    4.6.5 Health  To enable greater equity in the allocation and use  of health care resources by exploiting ICT  mechanisms to promote quality health care  delivery and management in a cost effective  manner.    4.6.6 Tourism  To improve the overall coordination of the  marketing and other destination management  functions and to promote linkages with other key  sectors, through the use of ICT and thereby  enable the growth of the sector in terms of visitor  arrivals, visitor expenditure and the overall level  and distribution of revenue generated in the  sector.    4.6.7 5.6.7 Legal and Regulatory  To establish a comprehensive harmonized legal  and regulatory framework which facilitates the  development of ICT within the country and which  supports its participation in the global  information society and economy.    4.6.8  Education and Human Resource   Development  To establish mechanisms that utilize ICT in the  education sector which will facilitate a better  quality of life through life-long learning.   4.6.9 Industry and ICT Sector (incl.  Trade and Financial Services)   To ensure that ICT is optimally utilised by  industry, particularly medium and micro- enterprises, so as to improve internal operational  efficiencies and to support the export of goods  and services, and to ensure that the ICT sector  itself expands and contributes significantly to the  national economy.     More-so St, Vincent and the Grenadines  endeavours to become the hub for ICT  software development and the creation of  appropriate local and exciting content  and mobile applications.      4.7 POLICY STATEMENTS  The SWGs then focussed on the enabling policies  which will facilitate the achievement of the  objectives and desired outcomes outlined  previously. The broad policy framework has been  defined by policy statements which collectively  contribute towards St. Vincent and the  Grenadines achieving its National ICT Vision and  hence contributes towards the social, economic,  cultural and human resource development of the  country. It is important to note that these policy  statements are built on the e-readiness  foundation outlined previously. The statements  build on the best practices identified, and which  are intended to bridge the current gaps and  strengthen the ICT operational base. In some  instances, the statements are intended to move  SVG in a direction consistent with knowledge- based societies and economies.   These policy statements are given below by  sectors:         St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 58        4.7.1 Technical Infrastructure   Establish mechanisms to ensure the   continued development of reliable, state of  the art, country-wide ICT infrastructure with  adequate capacity and network speeds.

St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 60        4.7.8  Education and Human Resource  Development    Promote innovation, science and modern  learning software technology for efficiency  in education, as well as to promote skill  development and professional capacity  building.    Improve the basic infrastructure with  modern, wireless computer labs and other  appropriate productivity tools.    Develop a comprehensive plan for the  smooth deployment of mobile computer  devices (laptops) for students, as a learning  tool, the maintenance and effective usage of  the laptops at school and at home.    Develop a focus on motivation and teacher  training in ICT.    Introduce an Education Management and  Information Systems (EMIS) in a phased  manner into the education sector to bring  about more transparency, efficiency and  productivity.    Encourage and support ICT training and  development of knowledge and its active  use by all teachers and other public  servants.     Foster the use of ICT for formal and non- formal education, skills development and  adult learning regardless of age, gender,  ethnicity, disability or location.    Encourage training in innovation and  software applications development for the  knowledge economy.     4.7.9 Industry and ICT Sector (incl.  Trade and Financial Services)    Create a conducive environment for a  vibrant and sustainable ICT industry in  SVG that is aligned to national  priorities and which makes a  significant economic contribution with   a focus on content and software  creation.     Support and facilitate programs in the  private sector that encourage the  effective use of ICT to improve  operational efficiencies and  international competitiveness.    Develop monitoring and measurement  systems to enable government to  determine the impact of its ICT policies  and measures on the ICT sector and  industry generally.    Encourage and support local ICT  innovation and development of the  current and potential markets through  incentive and other schemes.    Encourage and promote joint ventures  between local and foreign  entrepreneurs in the ICT sector.    Support the growth of the ICT sector  by the strategic outsourcing of ICT  support and services by government.    Support the use of ICT by MSMEs as an  enabler of growth and economic  development, including the online  registration of businesses.    Develop government-industry  collaborations that work effectively  manage cyber risk and to protect  cyberspace.    Provide a mechanism for bringing a  variety of perspective, equities, and  knowledge together to reach  consensus and move forward together  to enhance security at a national level.   One of the most effective ways of ensuring that  the desired outcomes and associated policy  statements are achieved is through action: the  execution of programmes and projects that are  designed for this purpose. SVG thus focussed on  the identification and development of such  programmes and projects - with expert external  facilitation. The National ICT Strategy and Action  Plan was, therefore, crafted from ground up with  implementation in mind, taking into  consideration St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ re- launching point.   [It should be noted that the issue of cyber  security at a national level is of great concern to  SVG. Detailed action plans were developed and  these are outlined in an Appendix.]           HIS Unit – Ministry of Health         Projects and Programmes P a g e | 61                                     The initiatives to be pursued by St. Vincent and  the Grenadines in the next few years are  organised as Programmes and Projects (Actions),  which when executed well will enable the  successful achievement of the defined Vision and  the attainment of the desired outcomes. It is  expected that the Programmes and Projects will  be implemented and managed using a standard  project management framework. A project  management approach will ensure that the Plan  has the greatest possible chance of success as it  allows activities to be properly planned, and  effectively monitored and controlled, during  delivery.  Another practical way of looking at ICT proposals  which will facilitate the citizen’s level of  understanding of benefits, promote usage, and  still be consistent with the ICT abbreviation is  INFRASTRUCTURE, CONTENT, and TRAINING.      This practical approach highlights the need for a  modern, robust, nation-wide Infrastructure and  connectivity which allows the private sector’s  and citizen’s access to ICT and an adequate  government-owned backbone to facilitate  efficient, cost effective communication across the  public administration.  Appropriate Content covers all the various e- government and other applications which are  used or have been specially designed and crafted  for the local context. It also includes the Training  in ICT at all levels in schools, communities, and  the public service for the creation of enlightened  users, technicians and knowledge workers; and  the promotion and adoption of these services by  the business sector.             The Programmes and Projects identified to be  completed during the period 2010 – 2015 are  summarised by sectors in Table 8 below. It must  be noted that some of these projects are currently  being planned or are at some stage of  implementation.   The National ICT Plan aims to embrace current  initiatives and projects, and to bring them into a  collective framework such that they can be  reviewed and managed as a national portfolio,  rather than, as unrelated or separate initiatives.   This portfolio approach allows better  prioritisation and resource allocation at a  national level, and allows synergies and  dependencies to be taken into account to  maximise the benefits of ICT to the country.           THE MILTON CATO MEMORAL HOSPITAL           THE STUBBS POLYCLINIC & OTHER     PROGRAMMES  AND PROJECTS      A more goal and success oriented definition of ICT which should guide is:  INNOVATION, CONNECTIVITY and TRANSFORMATION         St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan  P a g e | 62           Table 9:  Programmes and Projects   SECTOR PROGRAMMES & PROJECTS        Infrastructure  (Connectivity)   Administrative  Governance   Ministry MTSTI and  System of ICTOs    National Implementation Secretariat  National ICT Advisory Forum  Transition to IPv6   Technical Infrastructure  Universal Connectivity  Expand Government Backbone to Rural Areas                 Content    And     Applications   Government e-Government   Communications Backbone  Standards and Policies  Portal  Government On-Line  Process Re-design     Agriculture   AIMS – Agriculture Information Management System  NAPMIS - National Agricultural Production and Marketing Information System  ‘ICT in Agriculture’   Community Development Community Empowerment  Ministry of Community Development’s ICT Development  Community Integration           Health           e-Health   Portal  Hospital Information System  Policy, Legislation and Protocols  Medical and Health Inventory System  Telemedicine  Infrastructure  SIS - Staff Information System  Electronic Tagging   Tourism  ‘Virtual St. Vincent and the Grenadines’  Supply Chain Management   Legal and Regulatory e-Legislation   Training  Education and Human  Resources   AWARE – ICT Literacy   ICT Infrastructure-in-Education  SMART People – ICT Enabled Life Long Learning   Business Industry and ICT Sector (inc.  Trade and Financial Services) e-Industry   Virtual Directory - Survey and Benchmarking  Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)  e-Commerce           Projects and Programmes P a g e | 63       5.1 INFRASTRUCTURE, CONTENT, AND  TRAINING   A practical layman and citizen’s approach to  looking at ICT as Infrastructure, Content, and  Training, and the technology initiatives  specifically designed to enhance business, will  now be considered.    5.1.1 Technical Infrastructure  SVG has made excellent progress with its national  infrastructure as is evident in the rapid growth in  mobile communications and in the movement of  rates to a more affordable level. This Programme  therefore seeks to monitor and evaluate the  current initiatives in progress so as to maximise  success and alignment with the needs of the  national ICT agenda.   However, this Programme, Universal Connectivity,  seeks to ensure that all of St. Vincent and the  Grenadines has the same level of access to  communications services irrespective of living in  an urban or rural part of St. Vincent or on one of  the Grenadine islands. This means continued  strategic use of the Universal Service Fund and  ensuring that the proposed projects are taken to  completion and in fact expanded to include all  communities over r the life of the Plan.  The Universal Connectivity Programme will build  on the demand created by other programmes and  projects under this Plan, such as the Community  Integration Project and the various Portals that  will be accessible at a community level in rural  areas. This programme will build on the SMS  capacity of the mobile telephony infrastructure  for disaster preparedness and for dissemination  of government information and delivery of e- services.                                                           In order for citizens and business to participate   in this medium, they must have access to  Broadband and the computer related devices to  access information.  It is imperative that SVG adapt technologies to  create solutions to existing problems, and in this  particular case, the establishment of a National  Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is required. There  are a number of benefits that can be derived  directly from the establishment of a local IXP and  these include the establishment of a well defined  Internet economy that will keep SVG internet  traffic local, enhance the Internet experience of  users, reduce overall cost related to  providing  Internet services, promote and encourage the  creation of local content, create Internet  opportunities, build technical capacity, improved  connectivity through fibre optic and high speed  wireless, and the aggregation of demand will  make it more attractive for additional transit  providers to enter the market.  A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the  network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale  to domestic customers, without demanding any  significant corresponding capital or operational  investment. This would make more bandwidth  available for important activities such as video  streaming and telemedicine and increase the  national penetration of broadband Internet. An  IXP is a prerequisite to the development of any  significant domestic content production, hosting,  or co-location industry. This barrier must be  overcome before major content providers like  Google or Amazon will consider providing local  services within national markets. The increased  demand for these services, and the ISPs ability to  supply them at a lower price-point, will serve to  increase both market penetration and the total  revenue-value of the market, relative to the pre-  IXP status-quo. This is an important  infrastructure initiative that will be given priority  in implementation.  With the reduction of available IPv4 address  space, a new version of the Internet Protocol was  established called IPv6, also known as IP Next  Generation (IPNG). This version will address the  exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or  host.  However its implementation requires  careful planning and coordination. SVG will have  to take stock of what exists and manage its  introduction.    5.1.2 e-Government  The e-Government Programme aims to provide a  shared technology infrastructure that is stable  and secure and which embraces a set of policies  and standards for the connection to and use of  this shared infrastructure. It provides for the  development of the public sector people capacity  to manage the e-government communications  network that is already under construction and  which will be expanded under this Programme.  The e-government platform will enable G2G, C2G  and B2G connectivity, while providing services  such as domain management, security and  intrusion protection, virtual private networks,  firewalls, and physical connectivity between  government locations. The shared infrastructure  will enable the provision and management of  shared services such as email, Internet, Intranet,  Voice over IP, collocation of servers, application  hosting and SAN facilities. The challenge will be  for the government of SVG to re-organise itself to  take advantage of the enabling technology to  improve its business processes and its service  delivery model to its businesses and citizens.     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 64        Further, the Programme will contain a  Government On-line initiative and a Process Re- Design initiative. The scope of both these  initiatives will be heavily dependent on the   resources available and the level of support for  transformation of the public sector through the  strategic use of ICT.   The shared connectivity infrastructure or e- government backbone will have several Projects,  namely Standards and Policies, Shared Services,   Communications Infrastructure and a Government  Portal.  The Standards and Policies Project will cover a  range of initiatives, in particular, the shared   infrastructure usage, but also procurement and  use of ICT within the public sector. It will cover  areas such as data and information management,  interconnectivity and interoperability, security,  web standards, use of open source software, and  standardisation of technology.   The Shared Services Project will focus on  determining what services are best provided  across the backbone to support all of  government. This would include knowledge  management including email, Internet, Intranet,  VOIP, collocation of servers, use of SANs, and ASP  operations.  The Communications Infrastructure initiative will  extend and strengthen the Intranet that is being  currently implemented. It will include the  provision of firewalls, network management,  load-sharing facilities, and enhanced bandwidth  to ensure that all of government can be  supported in a safe, secure manner while  carrying the required digital traffic.  The use of a single point of entry via the Internet  to all of government, or a Portal Project will be  implemented as part of this Programme. The  Portal project will include standards necessary  for its success, including look and feel standards  to maintenance and support issues. The central  SVG Portal will be linked and integrated with the  Agriculture, Tourism, Education and Community  Development Portal. In fact, synergies and cost  sharing should be pursued in moving forward  with these initiatives.  The Government On-line initiative is a  Programme in itself and will likely run for many  years, depending on the resources available. This  programme focuses on making all relevant  government information available on-line and  will make use of the Portal infrastructure  discussed previously. It will involve the careful  consideration of the information needs of all   stakeholders, including citizens, businesses,  visitors and employees, and obtaining and  organising that information in an easy-to- understand, easy-to-access format on the Portal.   The initial focus should be on information most   needed by the stakeholders irrespective of the  ministry or agency from which it is obtained.    In parallel with putting information on-line, SVG  must move to placing key services on-line  wherever appropriate and cost-effective. Again,  stakeholders must be consulted to determine the  priorities, and the infrastructure required to  achieve on-line service provisioning must be  determined. The services that are normally  prioritised include births, deaths, and marriages,  the business registry, taxes, national  identification, and passports. During the life of  this Plan, the key services should be determined  and the most common services placed on-line in  a secure and accessible manner.  This initiative should look at all service delivery  channels including the provision of information  via the telephone. This will require a well- designed call centre which is equipped to handle  all standard or most frequently asked service  related questions from citizens. This government  on-line initiative will build on the current ICT  investments across government, including  SIGTAX, SMARTSTREAM and ASYCUDA.   Investments in ICT, without a commensurate  review of business processes, are often of limited  value. Government, through the Business Process   The increased number of paths learned  through an IXP improves routing  efficiency and fault-tolerance for   participants and renders participants  far more resilient to international   cable failures.      An Internet exchange point (IX or IXP)  is a physical infrastructure that allows  different Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) to exchange Internet traffic  between their networks (autonomous  systems) by means of mutual peering  agreements, which allow traffic to be  exchanged without cost. IXPs reduce  the portion of an ISP's traffic which  must be delivered via their upstream  transit providers, thereby reducing  the average per-bit delivery cost of  their service. Furthermore, the  increased number of paths learned  through the IXP improves routing  efficiency and fault tolerance.     It should be noted that this area of  focus is central government and  excludes health, education, agriculture  etc which were special areas of focus  in their own right.           Projects and Programmes P a g e | 65       Review Programme, will seek to improve the  internal efficiencies and effectiveness of all  Ministries and Agencies that are implementing  ICTs under the umbrella of this Plan. This means  that in general ICT investments would have a  process re-design component. This Programme  will deliver re-design projects for Government  generally, and supports re-design initiatives for  other agencies and areas of focus such as health  and education. It is expected that the process re- design initiative, the Government On-line  initiative and the common infrastructure projects  such as the e-government backbone and the  Portal, will be developed hand-in-hand to ensure  synergies, compatibility and cost sharing.    5.1.3 Agriculture  Agriculture continues to be an important  contributor to the economy of SVG, and supports  many families across the country. It is important  that this sector be strengthened so that it would  become more globally competitive and in fact  grow. The key objective of the Programmes and  Projects in the area of agriculture is to enable the  effective and efficient supply chain management,  from production to sales and marketing, in SVG  through the use of ICT. This will inevitably  promote the economic viability of agricultural  related activities by impacting on costs. It should  be recognised that some of these initiatives,  including the Agricultural Portal and the National  Agricultural Production and Marketing  Information System, are already in the planning  or implementation stages. However, it is  important to review and coordinate national ICT  initiatives under a single unified umbrella. The  key Programme and Projects are now presented.   The NAIMS, National Agricultural  Information Management System, or  Programme will strengthen the information  management, information sharing, and  information reporting capabilities of the central  Ministry and other agencies / organisations /  stakeholders in the sector. This will lead to  improved communication and policy dialogue  with key sectors and stakeholders for the  optimum benefit of St. Vincent and the  Grenadines. This Programme has a number of  associated Projects which collectively will deliver  AIMS. These initiatives are now outlined.    The Reporting & Monitoring  Information System (RMIS) is an  internal work management system. RMIS  will allow the Ministry to manage its human  and capital resources optimally.     Caribbean Fisheries Information  System (CARIFIS) will provide primary  support to the fishermen of SVG.  It will  include the Fisheries Registration System  that will register fishermen and monitor the  catch so that the limited resources of the  seas can be managed in a sustainable  manner. It will facilitate the safety of  fishermen. This information system will  support the development and growth of the  fisheries industry.    The Forestry Information  Management System will enable the  Ministry to manage the forests and  associated wildlife of SVG in a sustainable  manner. It will facilitate controlled  utilisation of the limited resources available  within the country and allow this sector to      contribute to the economy in an effective  manner.   IPv6   In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the  following benefits:   1)Increased address space   2) More efficient routing    3) Reduced management requirement   4) Improved methods to change ISP   5) Better mobility support    6) Multi-homing    7) Security    8) Scoped address: link-local, site- local  and global-address space   IPv6 brings a number of benefits such  as the improved quality of service  required for new applications like IP  telephony, video/audio, interactive  games and ecommerce.  This version  also easily deals with the avoidance of  network traffic, loss of data or  bandwidth.     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 66         The agricultural sector has always been  susceptible to the introduction of new or  variations to existing diseases to plant and  animals due to the uncontrolled and  ineffective management of the entry of  plant and animals to the country, both  intentionally and unintentionally. The  Plant & Animal Quarantine  Information System (PAQIS) will  provide the information system support to  manage this challenge in a real time and  proactive manner.    The Farmers Registration System will  allow the farming community to be  registered and managed, particularly with  respect to grants, subsidiaries and non- monetary benefits that are or may become  available. It will allow the human resources  that are devoted to this sector to be better  managed.    And finally, there is a need to manage the  quality and quantity of the livestock within  SVG. This will be done by the introduction  of a Livestock Registration System.  This will allow improved quality of  livestock products to be facilitated, by  better management of the animals  themselves. It will facilitate disease  management amongst other important  management functions.     The NAPMIS - National Agricultural  Production and Marketing Information  System is a Programme that will include a  number of systems that are intended to improve  and support the supply chain management within  the agricultural sector. It will support  production, marketing, agro-processing and more  effective sector planning. NAPMIS will enhance  agro-processing and value-addition to the      primary products of the agri- and fish products  including improvement in distribution. It is  recognised that good decisions can only be made  consistently with good information. NAPMIS will  therefore include the following information  systems:    National Agriculture Production and  Marketing Information System  (NAMIS) will support the marketing  requirements of AIMS and will allow the  Ministry to support farmers by providing  information that will enable them to  maximise the revenue that they generated  from their produce. It will allow the  Ministry to determine the best balance of  products that should be produced by SVG  and generally become the base decision  support system for the sector. It will  include a land bank system to track how  land is being allocated to produce and to  make land available for landless farmers  interested in expansion or youths interested  in agricultural start-ups.    The Agriculture Portal will be the  primary electronic entry point into the  sector. It will provide links to all   stakeholders with SVG and will enable  stakeholders within and external to SVG to  connect and to find the information  required for operating and investing within  the sector. Farmers and agencies generally  operate independently in SVG, and this  Portal is an important tool to facilitate the  required linkages and the building of  valuable business relationships.  Furthermore, the Portal will provide  linkages to banks, be accessible from  community access centres, and assist  farmers with the identification of niche  markets and connections to foreign  partners.   NAMIS and the Agricultural Portal will be  integrated to improve the linkages between  primary producers or farmers and consumers  especially supermarkets, restaurants and hotels.  The ‘ICT in Agriculture’ Programme will  promote the use of ICT to improve production  technologies in agriculture such as the use of  automation systems. Such systems improve the  use of limited and costly resources such as water  and fertiliser, and the use of technology for  planting and harvesting. This Programme will  focus on the identification and introduction of  strategic ICT into the sector itself. The impact of  strategic ICT should be greater yield, and better  products on a more consistent basis at a lower  cost.    The NAIMS Programme entails the  following series of related initiatives:    Reporting & Monitoring  Information System (RMIS)    Caribbean Fisheries Information  System (CARIFIS)    Forestry Information System   Plant & Animal Quarantine   Information System   Farmers Registration System   Livestock Registration System      Action Item:     Launch NAPMIS  Train Farmers and Extension  Staff in the use of Information  System and ICT in Agriculture        Projects and Programmes P a g e | 67       5.1.4 Community Development  The key objective of the Programmes and  Projects in the Community Development area of  focus is to leverage the power of ICT into the  country’s response to critical issues such as  poverty reduction, social justice and gender  equity and equality, institutional strengthening  of the Ministry, collaboration, cooperative  development and stakeholder empowerment, and  finally disaster preparedness and recovery. Some  aspects of these initiatives have already begun or  are being planned. It is important that at a  community level, from the ground up that the ICT  infrastructure introduced delivers value to the  community and its residents. This means that the  community must see value in these technologies,  and must be prepared and equipped to exploit its  enabling capacity. It is recognised that stronger  communities mean a more resilient society and  generally results in a more productive country.   This focus area has three Programmes, namely:    Community Empowerment   Ministry ICT Development   Community Integration     The Community Empowerment Programme  promotes the development and implementation of  Projects that use ICT to enable community  development and poverty alleviation. A policy  framework will be created for the governance of  this programme involving broad-based  representation across the community  development stakeholder group. Research will be  done to identify successful ICT-enabled  community development projects across the  world; and the experiences and learning from  such projects will be codified and transferred to  other communities. The assistance of  international agencies will be utilised to assist  with this knowledge transfer effort. The use of   ICT at a community level, in community centres  and by all categories of users from the  community will be encouraged. And finally, a  funding mechanism for community based ICT  projects and projects will be created utilising the  financial and other capabilities of the public  sector and with a special focus on utilisation of  the enabling capacity of the private sector. This  Programme will include Projects that seek to  facilitate regional disaster preparedness,  including the identification of funding and  development and expansion of the existing  infrastructure which includes appropriate  application software.    The Ministry of Community Development’s  ICT Development Programme focuses on the  institutional strengthening of the Ministry itself  through ICT-enabled processes and the general  integrating of ICT.  This will include amongst  other things the development of a Strategic ICT  Plan for the Ministry, identification of funding for  its implementation and the development of  internal capacity to manage the success of such  implementation.    The Community Integration Project involves  the development of an electronic portal which  will allow networking, collaboration and the  consolidation of the service delivery capacity  amongst all social development partners, namely:  NGOs, CBOs, Community Associations,  Cooperatives and Family Service Organisations.  The mechanism for the management and  operations of this Portal will need to be  developed so that it benefits all partners equally,  and the communities of interest directly. It will  provide connectivity to other Ministries such as  the Ministries of Agriculture and Tourism. The  development of community level content for   inclusion on the Portal is a useful initiative and  can include the preparation of cultural artefacts  which are of national interest or of interest to the  Diaspora.     5.1.5 Health  The e-Health Programme is designed to facilitate  greater equity in the allocation and use of  healthcare resources by exploiting ICT  mechanisms to promote quality healthcare  delivery and management. The Programme will  encompass technology components such as a  web-enabled Health Information System (HIS) and  the enactment of legislation, protocols and public  education for utilisation of the health information  which will be created. It includes the  introduction of tele-medicine on a larger scale  and improved connectivity amongst health  institutions. It proposes a comprehensive staff  information system and the piloting of the  electronic tagging of patients. The Programmes  builds on current initiatives by expanding on the  computers that have been introduced at the  Ministry, MCMH and the district clinics, and on  the NHIS that is being introduced.  It is recognized that in this context, the HIS will  collect standardized data and facilitate the  retrieval, processing and reporting on the  healthcare delivery system. However, it must  protect patient’s privacy and confidentiality and  must be easy to use. In so doing the HIS must be  robust and protected from disasters and must be  easily accessible to health care providers and  patients. It must improve the continuity of care  and the provision of quality healthcare services  to the population of SVG, and enable greater  equity in the allocation and use of healthcare  resources, given that SVG is a multi-island state  with obvious geographical challenges and  vulnerabilities to disasters. The HIS must also     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 68        provide citizens with access to appropriate yet  comprehensive information that would inform  and guide their health care management.  The HIS will contain a complete medical and  health supply inventory system to manage  inventory and expiration dates. It will provide  information of individual drug items and drug  interaction, track utilization and enable the  management and allocation of limited resources  across health districts.  A policy framework for tele-medicine will be  crafted as part of this programme and which will  enable the managed broad introduction of this  technology into the health system. The enactment  of appropriate legislation to ensure safe and  secure operation will facilitate the use of  telemedicine as a possible export service.  The ICT infrastructure to support the HIS and  telemedicine by providing interconnectivity  between health institutions and to the  international health community will be  developed as part of this Programme.  The  Infrastructure will also enable the  implementation of a comprehensive staff  information system, SIS, which is aimed at  improving the management of personal staff  information, benefits administration, professional  development, succession planning, staffing and  organization management and recruitment.  And finally the electronic tagging of patients will  be piloted as part of this programme, as an  inordinate number of patients abscond from the  hospitals of SVG. Such tagging facilitates the  tracking of patients by using a device or  electronic tag to monitor the location and status  of a patient from a central location. This will   enhance the healthcare system. Attention will  need to be paid to any possible legal issues that  may arise through this initiative.  The e-Health Programme therefore proposes  many related but integrated healthcare projects  which need to be prioritized over the life of the  plan.      5.1.6 Tourism  The work of the Ministry of Tourism and  associated agencies in the development of a one- stop travel Portal for St. Vincent and the  Grenadines is strongly supported by this national  ICT plan. This initiative forms the basis for the  ‘Virtual St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ Project.  This project seeks to maximise the use of ICTs to  attract visitors to the country. It will expand the  proposed Portal to be highly interactive, building  on the SVG’s ‘many islands, different cultural  experiences’ of the cultural gems of Vincy Life  theme. The opportunity exists here to utilise the  private sector to build components of the  required infrastructure such that it can be  exported to the OECS in the medium term and to  other island states in the long term. This portal  will provide virtual tours, booking of flights,  hotel and car rentals, promote tourism packages,   brand SVG as a premier tourist destination, and  maximise the revenue generated from current  and proposed tourism products.  The second major initiative that is proposed  under this sector is the integrated Supply Chain  Management Project.  During the life of this plan,  ICTs will used to integrate all agencies,  organisations and businesses within the tourism  supply chain into a seamless whole. This means  fresh produce from farmers will be available just  in time to support the needs of visitors at the  hotels and guest houses. It means that the SMEs  which support the tourism sector will be able to  obtain work on-line, invoice and receive  payments electronically. This project will  inevitably support the agricultural sector and  because it will encourage all businesses to go on- line, it will grow the demand for ICT  development and support – in effect  strengthening the ICT sector itself.    5.1.7 Legal and Regulatory  Excellent progress has been made with the  development of a robust legislative regime to  support the telecommunications sector and with  the introduction of the Electronic  Transaction Act, the Information and  Communications Technologies Services  Investment Incentives Act & the Small Business  Development Act in 2007. However, as the  country accelerates its ICT agenda, the legal and  regulatory framework needs to be further  strengthened. This will be done under the e- Legislation Programme.                                                          Action Item:    Launch HIS and Connect all  Clinics, Hospitals and Health  Centres to Broadband        Projects and Programmes P a g e | 69       Under this Programme, the work with ECTEL in  enacting the Electronics Communications Bill will  be completed. As more information on citizens  and businesses go on-line and as information   becomes shared across ministries and agencies,  and as health information goes on-line, the need  to strengthen privacy and personal identification  legislation becomes more important. The  potential need for a Data Protection Commissioner  or similar post will need to be considered  carefully. The legislation currently in place will  need to be reviewed to determine if it will fully  provide the protection required for computer  crime, electronic evidence, and increased e- commerce.  This programme will also introduce  training and capacity building requirements for  the judiciary and the legal community.     5.1.8 Education and Human   Resources  The key objective of the Programmes and  Projects in this area of focus is to establish  mechanisms to utilise ICT to facilitate a better  quality of life through life-long learning. It is  intended that through the initiatives in this area  that all persons within and entering the labour  force will have the capacity to utilise ICT in their   daily life through ICT literacy training. It will  ensure that all institutions of learning in St.  Vincent and the Grenadines will be equipped  with the necessary technology and that teachers  will be trained in utilising ICT as part of the  learning process. The cost of technology  necessary to support continuous education will  need to be managed and opportunities for  affording higher levels of training in ICT would  be created.   In essence, ICT will be exploited to the fullest in  enabling the empowerment of the human  resources of the country to be the best that they  can be. Several of the initiatives in this area of   focus are being implemented and are therefore  being brought into the overall National ICT  vision. The Plan recognises the considerable  investments over the last few years in acquiring  hardware and connecting schools to the Internet.  It builds and integrates the considerable  investment in teacher training, modern buildings  with ICT facilities and training of the local labour  force. The Plan recognises that equipping the  people of SVG, particular the children is critical  to successful implementation. ICT which cannot  be harnessed by people will inevitably be a   useless investment. It also recognises the long  term investment that must be made to transform  the country to a knowledge-based society – the  Plan prepares SVG for the social and economic  challenges of the next two decades and that no  child leaves school without basic  computer literacy.  The first Project is AWARE – All Workers  ARe e-Enabled or the ICT Literacy Project,  which will focus on the existing labour force and  on new entrants into the workplace. A critical  element of the ICT strategy is ensuring that  people are equipped to take advantage of the  enabling opportunities that ICT can present. It  recognises that the current training opportunities  in SVG are relatively limited in scope and are  under-funded and centralised. A special focus  will continue to be placed on the training of  public officers so that the e-government  investments can be fully and effectively exploited  for the benefit of all. A catalogue of training  necessary for computer literacy will be created  and training providers will be identified to  deliver the required material. An associated  marketing plan will be developed to ensure that                                                Action Item:     Enact a new converged  Electronic Communication Act to   regulate the ICT Sector and  replace the Telecommunications   Act 2001   Action Item:    Continue training all aspect of   the Human Resources     Establish programs where no  child leaves school without   basic computer literacy   Action Item:     Connect all Schools to  Broadband Using the USF     Establish Computer Labs in all  Schools & Community College     Use ICT in Teaching and   introduce distance learning.     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 70        the needs of the various target groups, including  those in the public service, are met.   The role of the Service Commission Department  will need to be defined in the context of AWARE  which seeks to address the level of ICT literacy  only. Under this Project, the issue of the  challenges faced by the people of SVG in  obtaining ICT at affordable prices will be  identified. Public consultation may be necessary  to determine the nature and extent of the  challenge, and an analysis of the ICT market and  a determination of the strategies necessary to  promote competitive and fair market pricing will  be needed. These outputs will inform government  policy in this regard to enable and support  AWARE and its related projects.    The ICT Infrastructure-in-Education Project  will build the required ICT infrastructure to  provide Computer Based Training (CBT) through  all available channels. The infrastructure will  include computer labs, networks for connecting  facilities, teaching and learning support software,  and access to the Internet. Current training  facilities would need to be reviewed and  upgraded to a consistent sustainable high  standard. Based on best practice research, special  focus will be placed on developing and enabling  ICT leadership and performance evaluation  techniques. Teachers will be trained as part of  their professional development, and a guide will  be developed to ICT standards, professional  development needs, and integration approaches.  It is likely that the integration of ICT into  teaching and learning will need to be  incentivised and that funding will need to be  identified or raised. It is also critical that  teaching and learning resource materials be  localised, and that regional partnerships will  need to be created as a mechanism to manage   cost and to enable regional growth and  development. And finally, there is a need for an  education portal as a mechanism to enable  collaboration in the use and development of  teaching and learning resources, and in enabling  networking between school administrators,  teachers, students and parents.      The Smart People, Smart Worker  Programme is designed to support ICT-enabled  life-long learning. SVG is aiming to be more self- sufficient in managing its ICT development and  on promoting innovation. It is being recognised  that having higher level ICT skills will be valued  and eventually rewarded. This Programme will  therefore build on current initiatives and involve  identifying the set of higher level ICT skills  required to promote the development of SVG and  developing an associated training plan to meet  these needs. Courses will be designed and  incentives will be created and offered to both  training providers and students to encourage  pursuance of higher level ICT skills training to  create Smart People.    For the public service in particular, software  application projects will be developed to sustain  and entrench the use of the higher level ICT skills  being acquired by the public sector worker – the  Smart (Knowledge) Worker. This activity  will be managed through a central body that will  be created to identify and manage projects under  the Smart Worker initiative and which will  identify and engage experts to mentor, develop  and transfer the skills through the experiential  involvement of local professionals. So Smart  Workers will be utilised for the benefits of SVG  in that they would provide the capacity to  provide application software systems and ICT  systems to meet the needs of the public sector  under this plan.    Action Item:    Commence software   development training and  content application creation at  COE    Conduct training of Public  Service Technical Professional  on Government applications        Projects and Programmes P a g e | 71       5.1.9 Industry and ICT Sector (Inc.  Trade and Financial Services)   The initiatives proposed in this area of focus aim  to develop the nascent ICT sector and to facilitate  the utilisation of ICT by the business community  itself. The development of e-Commerce will also  provide an incentive for businesses to go on-line  and to present SVG to the global business  community. And finally the strategic introduction  of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) will be  pursued as a mechanism to develop the ICT sector  itself. These initiatives will be delivered as part  of the e-Industry Programme.  The first initiative will focus on better defining  the use of ICT by the business community and  seek to better define and understand the  capabilities and capacity of the ICT sector itself.  This will require a comprehensive survey of what  ICTs are used by the business community to  support its internal business processes and to  interact with the rest of the world, whether as  part of a supply chain or offering its services via  the Internet. It will seek to determine the  capability of the organisations’ employees to  support an accelerated e-Industry programme.   The ICT businesses will be surveyed to assess  their capability to support the national ICT plan  and to grow and support a profitable ICT sector.  This survey will review the software development  and support capability of the existing sector and  the ability to support modern ICT as well as the  capacity to innovate with technology. The  information derived from this survey will be used  to benchmark SVG with countries such as  Barbados, Malta and Singapore and concrete  recommendations developed to strengthen and  develop both the business community and the ICT  sector to take on the challenges that will arise in  supporting the national ICT agenda. The  information will also be utilised on the   Government Portal or via the proposed ICT Portal  as a Virtual Directory such that the services and  capabilities of the business community of SVG  can be presented and offered to the rest of the  world.  While the National Investment Promotion  Incorporation – SVG has made some progress  with foreign investment in the ICT sector, and the  EU/SFA 2005 Business Skills and e-Business  Incubator Project has sought to improve strategic  alliances to strengthen the ICT sector, much more  needs to be done.  Government is the largest consumer of ICT goods  and services in SVG, and therefore has the  potential to facilitate the growth of the ICT sector  through the strategic outsourcing of some aspects  of ICT development and support. This can be  specific software development projects which  have the potential for export to other Caribbean   countries and the world at large. In this regard,  the opportunities to work collaboratively with  other OECS countries to develop ICT products that  can be shared will be pursued.   In order for this strategic outsourcing  arrangement to work, a clear policy framework  must be developed. During the period of this  Plan, it is expected that the policy framework  will be crafted and approved and at least three  ICT projects which have sharing and export  potential will be distributed under PPPs to the  ICT community. The role of the private sector in  support the e-government agenda, including  government on-line will be defined under this  initiative.  E-Commerce initiatives are being pursued under  the EU/SFA 2005 Project. These initiatives need  to be considered under the ambit of the national  ICT plan. The expansion of the proposed 100  SMEs in the ICT Portal project will be expanded  to the entire SME community. The enabling  policy framework to allow this Portal to grow  and expand to support a thriving business  community will be finalised and implemented.  The Portal will expand to support full business- to-business transactions and support the export  development effort in the long term.    5.2 ICT-ENABLED SMES  The smart use of tools and resources can make  the difference for SMEs to survive and prosper.  However, business owners still have to add a  certain \"X-factor\" to ensure business  success. There is a direct correlation between ICT  adopted by SMEs and its competitiveness. The  implication is that SMEs stand to make their  businesses much more efficient and capable by  taking advantage of the benefits of technology.  Depending on affordability, high speed  connectivity tend facilitate competitiveness; and                                                                   St. Vincent and the Grenadines is now  at a stage where it can leverage  several investment criteria to  intensively promote and attract  greater ICT Investments.   1. Low Competitive  Telecommunication Costs   2. Highly Trained Labour Force in  ICT   3. Suitable locations to  accommodate ICT firms   4. Low Crime and soon easy air  accessibility   5. Progressive Fiscal Incentive  package   6. Assistance provided in identifying  and training suitable human  resources        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 72        the use of support services such as end-user  training, hardware and software sales, Web  development and strategic consulting, and  Internet services (e-mail excluded) also has a  high correlation with competitiveness. Many SME  owners in SVG would like to adopt technology  and services to improve their efficiency but are  financially constrained. This project will propose  mechanism to address the financing challenges  faced by SMEs in obtaining ICT.    5.3 ATTRACTING CUSTOMER CARE   CENTRES  St. Vincent needs to be marketed as a destination  where an ICT Investor has the highest chance of  success. The labour cost is competitive and  people tend to make the Customer Service Sector  a long term career choice. This offers some  organisational stability after expensive training  has been conducted.  There are suitable locations within the Capital  Kingstown or in the suburbs which offer access  to quick transport and communications. The cost  of telecommunications services has fallen  considerably such that it is now competitive with  the USA. For Telemarketing and Inbound  Services, the language and accent is quite neutral  and easily moulded to the targeted marketplace.   The low crime and tropical setting also offer an  ideal distraction for the business executive  compared to other locations at a higher risk for  crime and travel related diseases.  A special focus will be taken and a project  developed to promote SVG as an ideal location of  ICT investments over the long term. It is expected  that FDI improvements will be obtained through  this and related measures.    5.4 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT   PROGRAMME  The adoption of technologies without developing  local human skills and capacities to manage,  integrate and maintain them is not sustainable.   As a workforce ages and trained employees leave  the marketplace or migrate, knowledge gaps  grow and will negatively impact the  implementation of the national ICT action plan.  Successful implementation requires substantial  quantities of trained and highly knowledgeable  people. SVG needs to develop and retain  knowledge to sustain and support ICT-enabled  economic growth and development. It is  therefore important that the country embarks on  a tailored knowledge management programme.  More information and best practices on  knowledge management (KM) is given in  Appendix 5.   Action Item:     Action Item:     Invest Promotion will establish  a brochure which effectively   promotes SVG as an ideal  location for ICT Investments      Six Step Approach to Implementing KM Projects   Step 1 - Identify strategic and operational objectives   What are the general objectives for the organisation?  Consider the business and the environment;    Step 2 - Find functional, structural and business value   Find actual changes in efficiency and effectiveness that will achieve the desired  objectives;  Consider the functional and structural organization;    Step 3 - Finding and using financially valuable knowledge   Knowledge does have an effect on efficiency and effectiveness ;  Consider the process and the individual;    Step 4 - Quantifying and understanding the knowledge   Ensures accurate understanding and codification or personalisation of that resource.  Considers the knowledge itself.    Step 5 - Integrating with information technology guide the infrastructure that supports  the management of  knowledge ;  Considers information and transmission ;    Step 6 - Select knowledge technique and technology   Making the right choice of knowledge management technique and enabling technology  elements of a KM environment is important.            St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan  P a g e | 73       If employees possess valuable knowledge,  government needs to identify this early, define a  capture and knowledge-sharing strategy, and  close the loop to any vulnerability. Therefore  commencing a KM program is a key component  of this five year plan.    5.5 CLOUD COMPUTING  A growing number of private and public  organizations are turning to clouds or  investigating the use of clouds to manage key  applications, including basic word processing  and spreadsheets through Google, CRM tools, ERP  and databases. Many major enterprise application  vendors have adapted or are adapting their  applications to run in the cloud. Cloud computing  is a new technology trend that has potential cost  and other benefits for the government of SVG,  and therefore needs to be investigated further.   The Cloud Computing model is illustrated in  Figure 17 below.   Secure clouds may allow the government of SVG  to create ICT resource pools across WANs, which  can reduce the number of servers needed by the  public sector, boost availability, and improve  disaster recovery. This technology has  revolutionary potential and therefore a technical  team will be established by Government to  evaluate the appropriateness, cost and benefits of  cloud computing and the possibilities of  deployment in St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the  OECS Sub-region or the wider Caribbean.     More details can be obtained in Appendix 7.           5.6 EFFECTIVE INFORMATION   MANAGEMENT   Information is the key to success when  organised, processed, and available to the right  people in a form conducive to rapid accurate  decision making enabling the desired results.  Poorly structured information prevents accuracy  of decision-making. Today, ministries and  agencies in SVG are being challenged by  ineffective information management, and citizens  and businesses are impacted by this shortcoming.  Effective information management requires the  careful and deliberate blend of human skills,  processes and technology. SVG will therefore  begin the process of improving information  management across the public service with the  strategic goal of significantly improving the  quality of decision making at all levels of  employees.            St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 74            This Page left Blank         Summary of Strategies & Actions P a g e | 75                                                   he Strategies and Actions proposed by the  National ICT Plan are now summarised as  this provides an integrated picture of the   task facing SVG in moving forward with its ICT  agenda. The summary is provided in tabular form  as follows in Table 10. The Table also includes  specific actions that will be taken to give effect to  the strategies identified. By construction the Plan  in this manner, the ICT agenda is becomes  implementable.                                                                                                                         T The National ICT Plan prescribes about 65   strategies and 129 actions within the   areas of technical infrastructure,   government, agriculture, community   development, health, tourism, legal and   regulatory, education and human   development, industry and the ICT   sector, and finally, governance and   MTSTI.

However for successful  implementation, based on an evaluation of the  experiences of emerging economies, there are  some recommended steps and actions that the  Government of SVG must take, namely:    Provide effective e-Leadership and  Championing    Put effective governance arrangements in  place    Engage an experienced implementation team   Obtain funding and optimise procurement   Monitor and manage major risks   Implement quick wins to build confidence   and support   Manage the change and transformation   Engage all stakeholders and communicate   effectively   Measure and report progress        7.1  LEADERSHIP  E-Leadership is a proven technique for creating  an environment of speed and flexibility in the  progress towards a digital economy. It will  engage employees in the public and private  sector and allow radical ideas to thrive as only  those enterprises that move fast and innovate  first will reap the financial and social rewards the  digital economy has to offer.  The adoption of technology may represent only a  small percent of the transformation process. The  rest of an enterprise’s metamorphosis  represented by changes in the organisational  behaviour and culture are at the heart of e- Leadership. As an e-Leader, the job is to  transcend the inappropriate staid old culture and  create an environment that encourages and  rewards creativity, imagination, innovation,  collegiality and discipline. History teaches us  that, the societies to which wealth and power  gravitate to, are less likely to be those that in  response to challenges over a long period of time  painstakingly build the enabling governance  systems and institutions such that after it is   finally built, it is obsolete; but rather those either  by historical accident, or by seizing critical and  timely opportunities, or by bold reforms become  readied for the coming wave of change.  The leadership of the Ministry responsible for  telecommunications, Science, Technology and  Innovation and the Government of SVG will  provide strong leadership at the national, sub- regional, regional and global level to adopt ICT  and promote SVG and the Caribbean as a  competitive place.      7.2 GOVERNANCE  The National ICT Plan is ambitious in its scope  and impact. However, based on the experiences  of several small island states, including Malta and  Singapore, it is achievable. But one on the  biggest challenges that has been identified over  the past few years is the issue of governance. The  Plan has many programmes and projects which  will take many years to implement.   Implementation of the Plan will require the  coordination of many ICT initiatives that are   T   MOVING TO  IMPLEMENTATION          St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 86        currently underway in different ministries and  agencies, and which have different funding  bodies and mechanisms, and which have  differing existing governance arrangements.  However, unless synergies are created, resources  are optimised, and all current planned and  proposed ICT initiatives are aligned and  coordinated, St. Vincent and the Grenadines will  not achieve the known benefits of moving to a  knowledge-based society in a reasonable  timeframe.  The key to success is effective governance. There  are several mechanisms proposed to ensure that  the national ICT Plan is executed in a coordinated  and optimised manner. Firstly, there is the need  for a Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister  responsible for Telecommunications, Science and  Technology Innovation. It should include  Ministers from the key ministries who are  impacted by the Plan and who need to support its  implementation, such as Ministers responsible for  education, tourism, agriculture, health and  finance. The Committee should have  representation at the Permanent Secretary level,  including the Permanent Secretary with  responsibility for ICT.   The Ministerial Steering Committee will have the  mandate to ensure the following objectives are  achieved:    The Plan is fully aligned with the national  development goals of the country    It is implemented as a cohesive whole and is  fully integrated    Appropriate funding and other resources are  provided for its successful implementation    The Government On-line and Business  Process Re-design initiatives are  coordinated across Government    The engagement of the private sector and  civil society  is maximised    EGRIP, CKLN, CTU and other regional  initiatives are integrated, aligned and  optimised with the Plan    The initiatives of the proposed ICT Industry  Association are supported    The Plan is monitored and controlled  throughout its life    Risks are monitored and managed in a  proactive manner     As the Plan moves deeper into implementation  and horizontal projects across ministries and  agencies come into focus, the need for a Chief  Information Communication Technology Officer  for Government should be pursued. This Officer  will be responsible for common infrastructure  across the public sector such as the government  backbone, the portal, common policies and  standards, horizontal business applications, e- services, strategic outsourcing, liaising with  bodies such as CARICOM, ECTEL, OECS, CTU and  the ITU on ICT matters, and reporting to the  Steering Committee on implementation of the  National ICT Plan.  The Plan places emphasis on growing the ICT  sector so that it can make a significant  contribution to the economic well-being of SVG.  It also supports greater use of ICT within the  business community to facilitate internal  efficiencies and effectiveness and to optimise the  supply chains, and connectivity to the global  marketplace.  Given the relatively low level of ICT usage in  business, the creation of an ICT Industry  Association is a good mechanism to encourage  collaboration and cohesion across the business  community. This Association should be  implemented and managed by the private sector  with support and encouragement from   Government. Its mandate will be to achieve the  following objectives:    Grow the ICT sector itself   Facilitate the greater use of ICT by the   business community   Organise the business community to support   the national ICT plan, including possible  strategic outsourcing    Encourage and support the use of ICT by  citizens and visitors by going on-line with  products and services    Grow e-commence within SVG      7.3 IMPLEMENTATION TEAM  It is recognised that some of the initiatives  proposed in the Plan are new; some are already  in train, but need to be aligned with the national  ICT vision; and some are in the planning stage.  The resources that are available to execute the  Plan are heavily dependent on what can be  allocated by Government. Given the need for a  dedicated focus on getting the Plan operational,  there is a requirement for a National ICT  Implementation Secretariat to get the  implementation effort started. The  Implementation Secretariat will evolve as the  initiatives of the Plan accelerate, but its  immediate mandate is as follows:    Operationalise the National ICT Plan in the  shortest possible time    Initiate and deliver the Quick Win Projects   Accelerate procurement consistent with the   requirements of funding agencies and  Government    Support the promotion and awareness effort   Begin the coordination process across   government        Moving to Implementation P a g e | 87        Report progress to the focal points, lead   ministry and the Steering & Advisory  Committee   This Secretariat is not expected to have more  than 3 to 5 resources at inception but should be  headed by a senior officer who is well respected  in the ICT community and across government.  Initially the National ICT Implementation  Secretariat (NICTIS) will be centred in the EGRIP  project which has funding for the next 4 years. It  will incorporate two technical persons from the   ITSD and E-Government units as supporting staff  to assist with the monitoring.    It will be directly involved in the  implementation of EGRIP project activities    It will closely monitor and be indirectly  involved in Non-EGRIP project activities by  other agencies.    Monitor the progress of new initiatives and  proposals which arise at different times      The Implementation Secretariat will liaise with  designated ICT Officers (ICTOs), ICT or   communication departments in each ministry and  department and provide coordination of all ICT  Activities.  The National ICT Steering & Advisory Forum will  provide approval of the government ICT policy  and major initiatives and make recommendations  to Cabinet.    The various governance arrangements are  illustrated in Figure 17 which follows.

The  functions of NICTIMS is summarised in Table 11  below, and the various relationships in Figure 18  which follow. Other Government agencies will be   mandated to cooperate with the NICTIS, ITSD and  National ICT SAF to ensure that the objectives of  the National ICT Strategy & Action Plan and the  policies and objectives are achieved.

However it is generally true that international  agencies will support well designed ICT  programmes and that there is often room to  optimise existing resources assigned to ICT  initiatives across government when they are  reviewed as an all-of-government portfolio. The  Steering Advisory Committee (NICTSAF) and the  National ICT Implementation Secretariat (NICTIS)  therefore play critical roles in obtaining funding  for the Plan. It is difficult to determine the cost of  implementing the Plan without considerable  more analysis and doing a more detailed design  of each programme, project, or initiative.  However using a costing by analogy process  based on similar Plans in other island states, the  potential budget for the Plan to 2015 will be in  the order of US$ 25 million. This figure does not  include investments made by the private sector  in its own operations.    7.4.1 Source of Additional Funding or   Cost Savings  Several other avenues for funding will be  investigated and utilised, including the following:  1. Currently the Regulation of the   Telecommunications Sector is fairly well  funded through the collection of spectrum  fees.   2. The regulations of the ICT Sector can also be  funded by similar fees from regulating ICT  services and using the same NTRC / ECTEL  administrative structure.   3. Through the OECS EGRIP, there will be  economies of scale in the regional  procurement of software licenses, the  creation of a regional expert and  applications maintenance team.   4. Leveraging the support of the regional  organisations for attendance at workshops,   ICT industry meetings and advice at:  CARICOM, CTU, ITU, CKLN and CARICAD.   5. Utilize the Taiwan ICT Centre to accelerate  the creation of costly applications and avoid  the cost of some expensive consultants and  technical expertise.   6. Embrace Cloud Computing and Data Services  to reduce costs.   7. Fully establish the Government Backbone to  reduce cost of Government owned Intranet  initiatives    8. Leverage the National ICT Strategy and  Action Plan to obtain funding from donor  organisations   International best practice has also shown that  unless the procurement process within  government is streamlined, the various initiatives  will not align and integrate, and the aggressive  timeline of the implementation will not be  achieved, and ultimately the success of the  integration across government will be stymied. It  is therefore necessary for the National ICT  Implementation Secretariat to work with the  procurement agencies to streamline the processes  within the accepted procurement policies and  laws to ensure that the goods and services  needed for success are procured when required.      7.5  RISK MANAGEMENT  Risk management is about the identification of  the things that can go wrong in the  implementation of the Plan and about designing  plans to manage and mitigate such risks. An  ambitious Plan such as this will be faced with  many risks. These risks vary from lack of  funding, insufficient human resources for  execution, to weak stakeholder support. Some of  the risks as associated mitigated actions are now  considered.   One of the major risks is that of insufficient  funding allocated to the implementation effort.  This risk has been addressed in the process of  development of the Plan to some degree, in that  the SWGs were quite inclusive and therefore  would have generated a degree of awareness and  support for the Plan itself, which will facilitate  the funding effort. The probability of this risk  happening is high, using a high/medium/low  scale. However, its impact is considered medium,  using a high/medium/low scale, as some of these  initiatives are already underway and in some  cases available resources can be re-focussed if  needed. The key mitigation strategies for this  risk is to prioritise and focus on the key  initiatives that best support the national  development effort and to do these projects in  the immediate term.   Additionally, the various funding and  development agencies need to be engaged  immediately as they will often support well  designed and managed initiatives. And finally, a  robust mechanism for submitting budget  requests to Government must be developed and  implemented, which will include monitoring  processes, and detailed reporting on  achievements and on the associated outputs,  impacts and outcomes.  The second challenge that the Plan will face is  the potential loss of momentum between the  completion and approval of this Plan and its  implementation. The probability of the risk is  medium but its impact would be high. The  probability of the risk is medium because the  plan itself is supported by key stakeholders,  including senior public officials. The key  mitigating strategy is to move forward with the  quick win initiatives immediately so that  progress is demonstrated even while the Plan is  being formally approved.        Moving to Implementation P a g e | 91       The scarcity of human resources to implement  the Plan will always pose a serious risk. The Plan  requires a broad range of skills and experience  that may not be present within Government nor  within St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The  probability of this risk is high and the impact  would be high. However, this risk can be  managed by carefully prioritising the initiatives  to enable skills and expertise to be developed  over the implementation period, and to target  the Diaspora for resources as well as  strategically utilising external contracted  resources. It is essential that Implementation  Secretariat be appropriately staffed from  inception.  While there are many other risks that will  need to be reviewed and managed in the  coming years, the final risk that will be  identified is that of lack of coordination and  integration across and within government  itself, leading to a fragmentation of the  implementation effort and unmanageable  competition for the limited human and  financial resources available with the country.  The risk of this happening is considered  medium with the impact on the success of the  plan being high. The risk is considered to   medium because the benefits of ICT across  government is generally well known and well  accepted, and therefore it is expected that once  the Plan is seen to benefit all stakeholders in the  medium term, co-operation will be eventually  facilitated. However, to ensure that this risk is  mitigated, the use of an Executive Sponsor in the  form of a Minister is required. The Minister in  charge of the Steering Committee is the clear   choice or the Prime Minister if deemed necessary.  The use of the Executive Sponsor will also  mitigate any political risks that impact the Plan.       7.6  QUICK WINS  It is important to kick-start the implementation  of the Plan as soon as possible to ensure that  momentum is not lost from the planning effort   and to build on the support created through the  use of the Sector Working Groups.  This can be  achieved by the implementation of some Quick  Win projects (summarised in Table 12 on the  following page) which have the following  characteristics:    They can commence with relatively few  resources that are generally available    They have a high probability of success and  deliver tangible results    They can be completed within 6 to 9  months    They will have high visibility and can  generate significant support amongst a  broad range of stakeholders    They demonstrate Government’s  commitment to the success of the Plan                            About Quick Wins    It is proposed that these quick win  projects will be completed within   six months using existing  resources, while funding is sought  for the larger more medium term   projects and programmes.  However, dedicated resources and  a focussed effort is required if the  various portals are to be created   within this timeframe.

Government will need to develop a change  management strategy which will facilitate and  strengthen the service delivery culture within the  public service and which will encourage the  establishment and measurement of service  delivery standards across all service delivery  channels on a routine and regular basis.      7.8 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND   COMMUNICATIONS  It is almost self-evident that unless stakeholders  buy into the initiatives being implemented on  their behalf that investments in technology will  be of limited value. It is therefore critical that  stakeholder engagement be strengthened so that  the programmes and projects continue to be  shaped to meet their needs. This is important in  the case of industry as they are required to make  investments in ICT and in training their people in  order to derive the benefits of the initiatives  being pursued under the Plan. Citizens and  communities will need to be fully engaged if they  are to grasp the opportunities that will be   presented to them on the educational and  training front and at the community level. The  communications effort will need to be sustained  and focussed, and will therefore required  dedicated resources and appropriate funding over  the life of the Plan.      7.9  MONITORING AND REPORTING  It is generally accepted that what is measured,  monitored and reported gets focussed attention  by the stakeholders who are impacted. It is  important that the outputs, outcomes and  impacts of the implementation of the national ICT  Plan be measured and reported. In many  instances, current measurement systems will  suffice such as the systems in place with NTRC  and ECTEL for the telecommunications sector. In  many cases though, new measurements systems  will have to be put in place to determine the  impact and outcomes of the wide range of ICT  initiatives. This may involve support from the  Central Statistical Office and the commissioning  of other surveys which is critical to the success of  the Plan, and ensuring on-going support of  development and funding agencies.  It is also important that the progress of SVG  against the Plan is routinely reported to  international agencies such as the ITU, World  Economic Forum and other bodies that rank  countries on their e-agenda, so that SVG’s  progress can be properly reflected on the   international stage. The Advisory Committee and  the Implementation Secretariat Committee will  have important roles in ensuring that monitoring  and reporting is appropriate to the requirements  of the Plan.      7.10 ASSESSING AND IMPROVING THE  CORE ICT INDICES  The National ICT Implementation & Monitoring  Secretariat (NICTIMS) will ensure the relevant  national agencies, National Telecommunications  Regulatory Commission (NTRC), National  Statistical Office (NSO) and UNESCO Education  Statistical Secretariat conducts annual surveys in  the five (5) areas of interest. 1. ICT Infrastructure  (NTRC - ITU). 2. House-Hold ICT usage (NSO - ITU)  3. Business usage of ICT (NSO - UNCTAD) 4. ICT  Trade (NSO – UNCTAD and 5. ICT use in Education  (UNESCO).  The ICT Infrastructure will be conducted  quarterly; however, the Household assessment  can only realistically be conducted every 10 years  as part of a census as in 2001 and now in 2011.  The business and Educational surveys will be  conducted for the first time in 2011 and  subsequently on an annual basis.  Several projects, including the Laptop per  Student Project and the use of the USF to improve  connectivity will significantly improve all the  Vincentian indices and is likely to catapult SVG to  an unprecedented top bracket of the global  rankings.              Conclusion P a g e | 95       CONCLUSION  St. Vincent and the Grenadines have commenced  on an exciting new journey of accelerating the  country to a knowledge-based society and  economy through the implementation of a  pragmatic and well-thought our national ICT  strategy and action plan. This re-launch is built  of the good successes of the previous national ICT  strategy, and has been crafted by a large number  of stakeholders.  The Plan recognises the challenges facing its  implementation and the cost to achieve its  strategic outcomes but it is expected that with  exemplary e-leadership at the senior levels, with  good project management, with continued broad  stakeholder involvement and with pride,  enthusiasm and support of citizens and  businesses, then SVG will grow and prosper with  ICT in the coming years. An exciting new future  is being created for the children and the people  of SVG.  The Strategy & Action Plan will be reviewed  annually by the Ministry responsible for  Telecommunications, the National ICT Ministerial  Steering & Advisory Forum (NIMSAF) and  Stakeholders. The grid of current projects and  new ICT initiatives will be upgraded.           St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 96        POLICY REFERENCES     1.

Governments ensure multi  channel service delivery, i.e. the availability  of all communication channels: visit, letter,  phone, e-mail, and Internet.            Transparent Public Sector - As a citizen  I know where to apply for official  information and public services.  Government guaranties one-stop shop  service delivery and acts as one seamless  entity with no wrong doors.               Overview of Rights and Duties - As a  citizen I know which services I am entitled  to under which conditions. Government  ensures that my rights and duties are at all  times transparent.               Personalized Information - As a citizen  I am entitled to information that is        complete, up to date and consistent.  Government supplies appropriate  information tailored to my needs.               Convenient Services - As a citizen I can  choose to provide personal data once and  expect to be served in a proactive way.  Government makes clear what records it  keeps about me and does not use data  without my consent.                Comprehensive Procedures - As a  citizen I can easily get to know how  government works and monitors progress.  Government keeps me informed of  procedures I am involved in by way of  tracking and tracing.                Trust and Reliability - As a citizen I  presume government to be electronically  competent. Government guarantees secure  identity management and reliable storage of        electronic documents.           Considerate Administration - As a  citizen I can file ideas for improvement and  lodge complaints. Government compensates  mistakes and uses feedback information to  improve its products and procedures.              Accountability and Benchmarking -  As a citizen I am able to compare, check  and measure government outcome.  Government actively supplies benchmark  information about its performance.               Engagement and Empowerment - As a  citizen, I am invited to participate in  decision-making and to promote my  interest. Government supports  empowerment and ensures that the  necessary information and instruments are  available.

Cyberspace interconnects our ministries,  industries, health systems and crosses national  borders. Coordinated national action by  government, the private sector, and  citizens/users is required for the prevention of,  preparation for, response to, and recovery from  incidents. Cooperation and coordination with  international partners are also required.     Goals:  1. Create awareness at national policy level   about cyber security and the need for  national action and international  cooperation.   2. Develop a national strategy to enhance  cyber security to reduce the risks and  effects of cyber disruptions.   3. Participate in international efforts for the  prevention of, preparation for, response to,  and recovery from incidents.     Specific Steps to Achieve Goals:  1. Persuade national leaders in government of   the need for national action to address  threats to and vulnerabilities of national  cyber infrastructure through policy level  discussions.   2. 2.  Appoint a lead person and institution for  the overall national effort. Two Computer  Security Incident Response Teams will be        located in the ITSD and the Royal SVG Police  Force with national responsibility (N-CSIRT)  will be established, and identify lead  institutions for each elements of national  strategy.     3. Identify the appropriate experts and policy   makers within government ministries,      4. government, and private sector, and their  roles.   5. Identify Cooperative arrangements for and  among all participants.   6. Establish mechanisms for cooperation  among government and private sector  entities at the national level.   7. Identify international expert counterparts  and foster international efforts to address  cyber security issues, including information  sharing assistance efforts.   8.  Establish an integrated risk management  process for identifying and prioritizing  protective efforts for cyber security.   9. Assess and periodically reassess the current  state of cyber security efforts and develop  program priorities.    10. Identify training requirements and how to  achieve them.     Government-Industry collaboration  Policy: The protection of cyberspace is a shared  responsibility that requires cooperation between  governments at all levels and the private sector,  which owns and operates much of the underlying  infrastructure.     Goals:  1. Develop government-industry collaborations   that work effectively manage cyber risk and  to protect cyberspace.   2. Provide a mechanism for bringing a variety  of perspective, equities, and knowledge  together to reach consensus and move        3. forward together to enhance security at a   national level.    Specific Steps To Achieve Goals:   1. Include industry perspectives in the earliest   stages of development and implementation  of security policy and related efforts.   2. Encourage development of private sector  groups from different critical infrastructure  industries to address common security  interests collaboratively with government.   3. Bring private sector groups and government  together in trusted forums to address  common cyber security challenges.   4. Encourage cooperation among groups from  interdependent industries.   5. Establish cooperative arrangements between  government and the private sector for  incident management.     Deterring Cybercrime  Policy: The protection of cyberspace requires  updating criminal laws, procedures and policy to  address and respond to Cybercrime.     Goals:  1. Assess the current legal authorities for   adequacy. A country should review its  criminal code to determine if it is adequate  to address current (and future) problems.   2. Draft and adopt substantive, procedural and  mutual assistance laws and policies to  address computer related crime.   3. Establish or identify national Cybercrime  units.   4. Develop cooperative relationships with  other elements of the national cyber-    St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 104        security infrastructure and the private  sector.   5. Develop an understanding among  prosecutors, judges, and legislators of  Cybercrime issues.   6. Participate in the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of  Contact Network.     Development of Incident Management  Capabilities  Policy: The protection of cyberspace requires an  organization to serve as the national focal point  for securing cyberspace, whose mission includes  watch, warning, response and recovery efforts  and the facilitation of collaboration between and  among government entities at the national, state  and  local levels; the private sector; academia;  and the international community.    Goals:  1. Develop a coordinated national cyberspace   security response system to prevent, detect,  deter, respond to and recover from cyber  incidents.   2. Establish a focal point for managing cyber  incidents that bring together critical  elements from government (including law  enforcement) and essential elements from  infrastructure operators and vendors to  reduce both the risk and severity of  incidents.    3. Participate in watch, warning and incident  response information sharing mechanisms.   4. Develop, test and exercise emergency  response plans, procedures, and protocols  to ensure that government and non- government collaborators can build trust  and coordinate effectively in a crisis.          Specific Steps To Achieve Goals:  1. Identify or establish a national Computer   Security Incident Response Team (N-CSIRT).  2. Establish mechanisms within government   for coordination among civilian and  government agencies.   3. Establish collaborative relationships with  industry to prepare for, detect, respond to,  and recover from national cyber incidents.   4. Establish point(s) of contact within  government agencies, industry and  international partners to facilitate  consultation, cooperation, and information  exchange with the N-CSIRT.   5. Participate in international cooperative and  information sharing activities.   6. Develop tools and procedures for the  protection of the cyber resources of  government entities.   7. Develop a capability through the N-CSIRT for  coordination of government operations to  respond to and recover from large-scale  cyber attacks.   8. Promote responsible disclosure practices to  protect operations and the integrity of cyber  infrastructure.     Develop A Culture Of Cyber Security  Policy: Because personal computers are becoming  ever more powerful, technologies are converging,  the use of ICTs is becoming more and more  widespread, and connections across national  borders are increasing. All participants who  develop, own, provide, manage, service and use  information networks must understand cyber  security and take action appropriate to their roles  to protect cyberspace. Government must take a  leadership role in bringing about this culture of   cyber security and in supporting the efforts of  other participants.    Goals  1.  Promote a national culture of security   consistent with UNGA Resolutions 57/239  creation of global culture of cyber security,  and 58/199, Creation of a  global culture of  cyber security and the protection of critical  information  infrastructures.   Action Item:     Action Item:  Launch Policy on Cyber security  & Cyber Crimes as part of IPv6   Task Force      Launch campaign on computer  use and misuse in the Public   Service and standards for  equipment        Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 105       Specific Steps To Achieve Goals:  1. Implement a cyber security plan for   government – operated systems.  2. Implement security awareness programs   and initiatives for users of   government systems and networks.   3. Encourage the development of a Culture of  Cyber security in business  enterprises.   4. Support outreach to civil society with  special attention to the needs of   children and individual users.   5. Promote a comprehensive national  awareness program so that all participants  – businesses, the general workforce, and  the general population  – secure their  own parts of cyberspace.    6.  Enhance Science and Technology (S&T) and  Research and Development  (R&D)  activities.   7.  Review existing privacy regime and update  it to the online environment.   8. Develop awareness of cyber risks and  available solutions.         St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 106        4:INTERNET  EXCHANGE POINT  (IXP)            time progresses and the world’s  population continue to increase at an  exponential rate, more and more   strains are placed on the fixed amount of non- renewable resources that are at our disposal.  With the collapse of the banana industry, a  fragile tourism industry, a global economic crisis  and a culture that is consumer based rather than  production based, SVG find itself in a fiscal  dilemma trying to chart a way forward. SVG  therefore has to turn to non-traditional ways of  developing and sustaining the economy.    In a modern, competitive, post colonial Caribbean  civilization, the nature of our continued existence  depend heavily on what we can produce and  market on the international market, but the cost  of interconnecting and doing business is very  expensive. It is imperative that we adapt to new  and existing technologies in order to bring about  solutions to these problems, and one such   strategy is to employ the use of Information  Telecommunication Technology (ICT); and in this  particular case, the establishment of a National  Internet Exchange Point (IXP) as illustrated in  Figure 19 above.    The primary purpose of an IXP is to allow  networks to interconnect directly rather than  through one or more 3rd party networks. The  advantages of the direct interconnection are   numerous, but the primary reasons are cost,  latency, and bandwidth. Traffic passing through  an exchange is typically not billed by any party.  However traffic to an ISP's upstream provider is,  and in our particular case, all our local ISPs buy  bandwidth from a transit provider in the United  States. Moreover, there are quite a number of  other benefits that can be derived directly from  the establishment of a local IXP and these  include:  the establishment of a well-defined  Internet Economy that would keep SVG internet  traffic local, enhance the internet experience of  users, reduce overall cost related to providing  internet services, promote and encourage the  creation of local content, create internet  opportunities, and build technical capacity. It  would include improved connectivity through  fibre optic and high speed wireless (FSO)  connectivity, GSM Operators - GPRS/3G Services,  establishment of  Academic Networks – Providers, E-learning, Local Loop Operators  (LLO's) - Voice/data, Content hosting providers -  e-business, more of Government  including e- government, Multi-media Service providers -  SMS/gaming. In addition, aggregation of demand  makes it more attractive for additional transit  providers to enter the market.        As Figure 19:  Operational Model for IXP   A direct interconnection (often located  in the same country or region) avoids  the need for data to travel to other  countries outside the region to get  from one network to another, thus  reducing latency and the possibility of  attack from cybercrime. The third  advantage, speed, is most noticeable  in areas that have poorly developed  long-distance connections and this is  absolutely critical to our web services,  telemedicine and video conferencing,  etc. ISPs in the Caribbean region  normally pay between 10 or 100 times  more for data transport than ISPs in  North America, Europe or Japan.  Therefore, our ISPs typically have  slower, more limited connections to  the rest of the internet. However, a  connection to a local IXP may allow  them to transfer data without limit,  and without cost, vastly improving the  bandwidth between customers of the  adjacent ISPs.            Appendices 1 – 9  P a g e | 107         At present an email from the Prime Minister to  another member of government sitting across the  hall must travel the route SVG, Barbados,  Antigua, Miami and back before it reaches him.   The case of moving the relevant IXP from Miami  to St Kitts, a reduction from 6,000 miles (round  trip) to perhaps one mile, the decrease in  distance is so dramatic that cost can be  minimized to near zero, while speeds can be  increased from some multiple of STM-1 to 1 GB or  10 GB.     A local IXP would result in a vast increase in the  network capacity (bandwidth) available for sale  to domestic customers, without demanding any  significant corresponding capital or operational  investment. This would make more bandwidth  available for important activities such as video  streaming and telemedicine and increase the  national penetration of Broadband Internet.   An IXP is a prerequisite to the development of  any significant domestic content production,  hosting, or collocation industry. This barrier  must be surpassed before major content  providers like Google, Amazon, Akamai, or  UltraDNS will even consider providing local   services within Caribbean national markets. The  increased demand for these services, and ISPs  ability to supply them at a new lower price-point,  serves to increase both market penetration and  the total revenue-value of the market, relative to  the pre-IXP status-quo.  The maturation of the local network  infrastructure provides a nucleus for education  and retention of the Internet-skilled labour force  that ISPs, central government, schools and the  private sector need in order to continue their  growth and economic progress.  Furthermore, sending sensitive data across  national borders presents a privacy risk to  governments and corporations. By keeping local  traffic local, sensitive data is not subject to  inspection by other governments. Then too, the  having a local IXP will aid in the setting up of a  local certificate authority and web hosting  facility. This will enable more of our businesses  to do ecommerce in a safer and more secure  internet environment.    An IXP enables co-ordination of security,  infrastructure protection, and abuse response  activities. As our society becomes more ICT  oriented and internet dependent, so too will  number of incidents of cyber crime. Internet  crimes are not like traditional crimes and can be  committed across jurisdiction. Having an IXP will  make it easier for us to track and bring these  criminals to justice.  An IXP will, therefore, add more value to projects  like CKLN, EGRIP and the Intranet Backbone It  will also make available a logical place to locate,  and hence attract, other Internet infrastructure  resources. For example top-level name servers,  time servers, performance measurement tools,  research projects.     Action: Establishing The IXP   Communicate with the internet society the   desire to establish the IXP   Form a small working-group of committed-  participant organizations   Determine a neutral location that is   acceptable to all   Define an IXP policy document that   participants agree to abide by   Secure small IPv4 and IPv6 subnets from   ARIN/LACNIC for the peering subnet   Install a Gigabit-Ethernet capable switch   Configure BGP rout- announcement between   peers. Fully include the community in the  process; awareness raising and training  activities may be necessary. Potential  members will need to be familiar with the  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is  used for routing between networks, and  each network will need to have a publicly  registered Autonomous System Number  (ASN) for their exchange communications.  This can be obtained from the relevant  Regional Internet Registry.    Establishment of neutral ISP associations  capable of managing IXPs and other shared  facilities on behalf of their members    The most important features of the IXP  facility are reliable and redundant power  supplies, air conditioning, security, space  for growth, and access to communications  infrastructure. Most important, the facility  should retain a neutral status with its  members. Proximity and accessibility of the  facility are also factors to consider.                    IPV6 also brings with it a number of  benefits such as the quality of service  required for some new applications   like IP telephony, video/audio,  interactive games or ecommerce  which can be delivered over the   network.  This version easily deals  with the avoidance of network traffic,   loss of data or bandwidth.            Appendices 1 – 9  P a g e | 108         Transition to IPv6  With the depletion of IPV4, a new version of the  Internet Protocol was established called IPV6,  also known as IP Next Generation (IPNG). This  version seeks to address the main issue of  exhaustion of addresses to connect computers or  host.  It has a large address space of 128 bits  compared to 32 bits of the version 4. The  introduction of this version means that SVG will   have to take stock of what exists and with its ICT  National Plan see how greater use of the  initiatives can be implemented bearing in mind  IPV6 would soon be adopted around the world.  In a nutshell, IPV6 will offer the following  benefits:  1) Increased address space  2) More efficient routing    3) Reduced management requirement  4) Improved methods to change ISP  5) Better mobility support   6) Multi-homing   7) Security   8) Scoped address: link-local, site-local and  global-address space           The increased number of paths learned  through an IXP improves routing  efficiency and fault-tolerance for   participants and renders participants  far more resilient to international   cable failures.        Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 109       5: KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT    The adoption of technologies without developing  human skills and capacities to manage, integrate  and sustain them. The centralized use of  technologies by national government  departments, without developing and extending  the benefit of technology to intermediary  institutions, such as local government,  parliament, parties, civil society organization and  independent media. A failure to link better  governance to broader and more inclusive  democracy which gives voice to those who cannot  afford technologies, but have needs and ideas to  express. These are all critical lessons learned in  the use of ICT for development.  Historically, the focus has been on building front- end visibility with the citizen. However, while  establishing superior citizen experiences, the  backend must be made capable to ensure such  initiatives are not wasted. Clearly, the quality of  the infrastructure must be continuously managed  and strengthened to ensure maximum citizen  care. Governance frameworks and technology  architectures must integrate the human, financial  and social aspects to guarantee precision and  accuracy of response.    The main advantage of any advance in technology  is to allow more attention to the real goals and  challenges of knowledge management (KM),  which will always concentrate on people and  operational issues.  Improved portal, content  management and collaboration (PCC) facilities  have removed many of the basic technical  impediments to using knowledge assets in  enterprises. KM projects can concentrate on  where to target these efforts and how to manage  them effectively - see Figure 20 below - using the  following steps.   Step 1 - Identify strategic and operational  objectives.   What are the general objectives for the  organisation?  Consider the business and the environment.    Step 2 - Find functional, structural and business  value.   Find actual changes in efficiency and  effectiveness that will achieve the desired  objectives.  Consider the functional and structural  organisation.        Step 3 - Finding and using financially valuable  knowledge.   Knowledge does have an effect on efficiency and  effectiveness.   Consider the process and the individual.                          Step 4 - Quantifying and understanding the  knowledge.   Ensures accurate understanding and codification  or personalisation of that resource.  Consider the knowledge itself.    Step 5 - Integrating with information technology  guide the infrastructure that supports the  management of knowledge.  Consider information and transmission.     Step 6 - Select knowledge technique and  technology.  Making the right choice of knowledge  management technique and enabling technology  elements of a KM environment.    Critical components which should not be ignored  in the development process include:    Security   Infrastructure   Enterprise Applications Integration   People & Learning   Connectivity   Collaboration   Storage   Disaster Protection      Figure20: Six step approach to implementing knowledge management projects     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 110                                                            Table 13:  Knowledge Management Trends          Knowledge Management In Government   It is critical to design a KM program aimed at  knowledge sharing and preservation to ensure no  loss of knowledge occurs as a result of key  employees leaving the organization or retiring or  to maintain strong levels of security - see KM  trends in Table 13 above. If employees possess  valuable knowledge, government needs to  identify this early, define a capture and  knowledge-sharing strategy based on their  personal style, and close the loop to any  vulnerability. If this process is not planned for  disaster it could lead to an imminent crisis. The  exit strategy should be based on risk mitigation.  It's important to note that:    1) The knowledge transfer question is relevant  for all workforce reconfiguration programs,  including those stemming from  reorganization, outsourcing, mergers and  acquisitions and consolidation. Retirement  is quite possibly the only thing on any  organization’s radar screen that it can  anticipate.    2) Determining who has the knowledge is a  process of interaction, interviews and open- ended questions. If stakeholders wait for an  investment in software tools for this, they'll  never capture the knowledge before people  leave.    3) The knowledge transfer process could be  more about how to reconstruct knowledge  than how to replicate or document it.    4) The living, breathing interview process  quickly reveals who are the high-value  members — those people who form the  connective tissue, to whom many people in  multiple constituent groups turn for  information and whose importance in that  role is seldom acknowledged or recognized.   1. Government policies are driving more educators to tailor their instruction to the individual  needs of students   2. Important constituency groups expect to see technology used in the classroom  3. Online learning offers a solution to the challenge of increasing access while maintaining costs  4. Popular support has waned for using technology as a tool to reform education institutions  5. Technology purchases must compete with other priorities for increasingly scarce budgetary   resources and must be targeted and cost-effective  6. Moving to the next level of technology adoption requires significant and difficult behavioural   changes  7. The most appealing solutions must also provide compelling evidence of their effectiveness  8. Seeking the benefits of standardization, lessons learnt and proven benefits, institutions will   migrate from point to enterprise-wide solutions  9. The acceptance of Cloud Computing and other vendor-hosted solutions and other delivery   options will grow in the market  10. The uptake of LMS solutions will expand rapidly in the Caribbean’s higher education market  11. There are four approaches that institutions are likely to take when selecting an LMS solution  12. Institutional preferences for LMS solutions are not monolithic and vary across geographic   regions  13. Lecture capture solutions represent the next horizon for extending the power of LMS   solutions. The deployment of Master Teachers (The best teachers) to teach across the network  will emerge    Action Item:    Examine existing KM projects to   ensure that they address the  trends and best practices of   Table 13.          Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 111       KM In Technical Support  Most ICT managers who want to start their KM  initiatives begin with the ICT department.  Technical support is a good place to start, as it is  an expensive, high-profile function where finding  the right answer quickly is critical.   ICT service and support delivered via a Web  portal is a proven method of increasing customer  satisfaction and significantly lowering costs.  Lowering costs can be the main driver for a self- service Web portal. However, ICT organizations  also look to self-service to improve the  consistency and quality of service support,  reduce the volume of unnecessary status checks,  expand the hours of operations of ICT support,  involve employees more in the process of service  support design, allow employees to solve issues  quicker, offer another avenue for requesting  service, and educate employees on how to resolve  future issues independently.     While ICT can be a good place to start, we find  that extending systems developed here to the rest  of the organization is rarely successful. ICT  employees are generally more receptive to these  techniques, and the systems developed for ICT  generally do not meet the needs of Line-of- Business (LOB) groups.  Several vendors offer  packaged solutions for help desk KM, either as  part of an overall service management package or  standalone. The alternative is to build your own  solution.    KM In A High-Performance Workplace   Justification for position and speed of adoption  Knowledge management first appeared in a Hype  Cycle in 1997, and has since followed a  predictable path through the hype. It has now  left the Trough of Disillusionment and begun to  climb the Slope of Enlightenment. It is expected   that KM will go off the hype cycle, due to its  widespread adoption.   The wide variety of technologies that enable  knowledge management — portals, content  management, collaboration and many others —  are steadily improving their support for the  human and work processes of knowledge  management.                                                                        Action Item:    Sensitize the Public and Private   Sector to benefits of KM   KM governance requires both   top-down and bottom-up efforts,  although much more of the   latter than the former.     Action Item:    Enterprises can use knowledge  management programs to  support individual users, teams  or their entire organization.  But they should concentrate on  teams, as research shows that  this is where the greatest  benefits arise in terms of  productivity and  innovation.       St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 112            This Page left Blank         Appendices 1 - 7 P a g e | 113       6: EFFECTIVE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT        nformation is the key to success when  organised, processed, and available to the  right people in a form conducive to rapid   accurate decision making enabling the desired  results. The burden of poorly structured  information eliminates accuracy of decision- making. Today, organisations in every sector are  experiencing the reality of this perspective as  they strive to maintain a competitive position,  increase effectiveness or offer efficiency, in an  environment shaped by value and quality of  information. The traditional boundaries of the  organisation are becoming increasingly blurred  as business partnerships evolve into complex  interrelationships, customers and citizens expect  rapid access to services and localised operations  feel the impact of globalisation.   Information management no longer represents a  repository but a transactional capability for  simpler, faster, secure collaboration. As with any  transactional environment, tactical investments  in solutions introduce the risk of unmanageable  chaos. The added challenge of effectively  information use requires the careful and  deliberate blend of human skills, processes and  technology. All such tactical investments require  strategy formulation driven ultimately by the  requirements of individuals and groups, as well  as by the objectives of the organisation.    There must be a solid underlying infrastructure  that provides cost effective storage, security, and  business continuity; a management layer to  handle classification, lifecycle management,  integration, and data quality; a services layer to  provide information capture, search, retrieval,  query, and analysis; and a delivery layer to  enable reporting, publishing, customisation, and  collaboration. These capabilities must span  structured and unstructured information,  combine both tangible and intangible sources,  and be abstracted as far as possible from  individual technologies.                                                I     St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 114           This Page left Blank        Appendices 1 - 9 P a g e | 115       7:CLOUD  COMPUTING  CONSIDERATIONS         overnments agencies are finding it  increasingly costly and difficult to  procure, set up, maintain, and secure   traditional computing architectures.  Many  argue that government need not get involved in  the details of buying and maintaining complex  computer systems.  Consequently, Governments  around the world are actively looking into cloud  computing as a means of increasing efficiency  and reducing cost. This Appendix outlines  highlight the value and risk associated with this  new concept. However, before exploring the  merits of Cloud computing it’s important to  understand fundamental concepts including the  definition, characteristics and variation.      Definition  According to the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) “Cloud computing is a  model for enabling convenient, on-demand  network access to a shared pool of configurable  computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,  storage, applications, and services) that can be  rapidly provisioned and released with minimal  management effort or service provider  interaction.”    Characteristics   They also identify five characteristics of cloud  computing - see Figure 21 above:    On demand self-service   Broad Network Access    Resource Pooling   Rapid Elasticity and    Measured Service1    Service Models  The relationship between cloud client and  provider can vary significantly. An organization  can pay an outside cloud provider for data,  applications, operating platforms, raw digital  storage, and/or processing resources: Data as a  Service (DaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS),  Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS), respectively.     Deployment Method  These can be categorised using four services  models – public, private, community and  hybrid.  The public model can be considered  the original model of cloud computing.     In this typical cloud computing scenario  organisations run their applications from a data  centre provided by a third-party – the cloud  provider.     Pros  Figure 22 highlights the Pros of Public Cloud  computing.  A key advantage is that the  provider is responsible for providing the   infrastructure, servers, storage and networking  necessary to ensure the availability and  scalability of the applications. This allows  Government to focus on what matters and  without having to worry about technology side of  things.    Cloud computing allows government to buy in  only wanted services, when wanted, cutting the  upfront capital costs of computers and  peripherals.   Additionally, extra services can be added (or  taken away) at a moment's notice as needs  change without waiting weeks or months for the   new computer (and its software) to arrive.    G   Benefits   Management moves to cloud provider    Reduce costs    Resource sharing is more efficient    Cost based on consumption     Faster time to roll out new services    Dynamic resource availability for   crunch periods    Figure 22: Benefits to Cloud Computing      Figure 21: Cloud Computing        St. Vincent & the Grenadines National ICT Strategy and Action Plan P a g e | 116        No doubt this model also lends itself well to  Government agencies more efficiently, and  effectively sharing resources.    Inhibitors  Despite all heralded pros of Cloud computing  Governments must be sober its adoption of this  concept.   The following questions represent  some of the more popular considerations  requiring resolution before the adoption of cloud  computing within any government - refer to  Figure 23.    Governance Arrangement: Who  owns/accesses/deletes/replicates data in the  cloud?   Legislation, policies and regulations:   The legal  framework must support this concept therefore  Governments must develop the relevant policies  and regulations that would support the proper  implementation and offer protection to all parties  involved.   Analyse Hidden Cost: Instead of purchasing  computers and software, cloud computing means  you buy services, so one-off, upfront capital costs  become ongoing operating costs instead.  Higher  ongoing operating costs. Will cloud computing  work out more expensive?   Lock-in: Governments’ options are limited to  what’s being offered by providers.  Furthermore  the risk of being locked into proprietary or  vendor-recommended systems is very real.  Consideration must be given to the ease of  migration to another system or service provider  if needed to?   Additionally, how interoperable  would one cloud be to another offered by a  different provider?   Need for Robust SLA:   Greater dependency on  service providers requires government to develop  robust SLS to ensure that problems get resolved  quickly?  Availability & Reliability: What happens if  supplier suddenly decides to stop supporting a  product or system you've come to depend on?   Security and Privacy: Potential privacy and  security risks of putting valuable data on  someone else's system in an unknown location?   Where does the data reside and does the location  have legal ramifications.      “Public and private clouds aren’t for every  organization and every situation,” concludes  PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Lobel, “but they will  play a key role in ICT.”A technical team will  evaluate the appropriateness, cost and benefits of  cloud computing and the possibilities of  deployment in St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the  OECS Sub-region or the wider Caribbean.

To assist in  achieving this goal, the indicators must have  associated statistical standards and guidance.  There are currently 46 ICT indicators in the 2010  revised core list and two (2) reference indicators.  In comparison, the 2005 list only contained 41  ICT indicators. The Geneva phase of the World  Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in  2003 highlighted the importance of  benchmarking and measuring progress towards  the Information Society. The 2005 Tunis phase of  WSIS re-iterated the importance and at the  second phase of WSIS, held in Tunis in November  2005 the final list was officially launched. The  2005 core list included 41 core ICT indicators in  several groups: (1) ICT infrastructure and access;  (2) access to, and use of, ICT by households and  individuals; (3) use of ICT by businesses; the ICT  sector; and (4) trade in ICT goods.  The original 41 core list and the revisions it  underwent were based on a supply/demand  conceptual model of the information society.   Feedback on the policy and practical relevance of  the core indicators in 2008 and their particular  relevance resulted in the addition of new  categories in the household and business use  indicators to reflect changes in the nature of ICT  use. They included categories on mobile Internet  access, updates to means of Internet access to  include mobile broadband, more details on   communication using the Internet, new business  Internet activities and the adoption of OECD tariff    basket methodology for measuring mobile  cellular prepaid tariffs.  An important improvement to the first core list  has been the addition of eight new indicators on  measuring ICT in education which were  developed by the UNESCO.  A number of other possible ICT indicators,  including indicators on (1) the economic and  social impacts of ICT, (2) e-government, (3)  barriers to ICT use, (4) ICT expenditure, (5)  investment, (6) trade in ICT services, (7) ICT  security & (7) trust are being developed.  Indicators in these and other areas, such as (8)  use of mobile telephony and (9) digital content,  may be added to the core list in the future, after  more development work.  The core indicators on ICT infrastructure and  access are collected by the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), as part of a  much larger collection of telecommunication  indicators. The ITU data, some of which go back  as far as 1960, are published in the World  Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database (ITU)  and are defined in ITU’s Telecommunication  Indicators Handbook (ITU, 2007).  Data for the indicators come from several  sources, the main one of which is an annual  survey of telecommunication authorities and  some private companies. Other sources include  reports provided by telecommunication  regulatory authorities, ministries and operators.   Because data are collected from providers rather  than users, they are widely available for both  developed and developing economies.  ICT household and educational statistics should  be collected by National Statistical Offices    through household surveys and census. Most  developed economies have been collecting these  statistics for years, using model OECD  questionnaires. Other economies are making  good progress in collecting these indicators using  the core indicators and associated standards.  Most countries do not have good time series of  ICT access and ICT use data and much of the  available data are out-of-date, therefore, less  useful, given the pace of change in adoption of  many technologies.  In St. Vincent & the Grenadines, the National  Telecommunications Regulatory Commission  (NTRC) has been only mandated to collect  infrastructure, traffic, tariff, policy, legislative,  regulatory and infrastructure investment data  which includes the core ICT Infrastructure  Indices and forward it to the ITU. However, the  other core indices (Household access and use,  business, trade and education were not being  collected and forwarded by the National  Statistical Office or any agency. Instead there has  been a reliance on old data from the 2001  National Census which precedes the tremendous  advances in household usage of ICT, the  introduction of one laptop (Net-book) per student  and the Educational Revolution. A new  collaborative approach will ensure this data is  collected, posted on several Web sites (NTRC,  Government and National Statistical Office Web  sites and forwarded to the relevant international  agencies (ITU, UNCTAD and UNESCO).

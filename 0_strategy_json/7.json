This vision cannot be achieved by any organisation in isolation, so I am delighted that the strategy has been developed and endorsed jointly with UK civil nuclear organisations, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the National Cyber Security Centre. I look forward to working together with them to strengthen the cyber security of the UK’s civil nuclear sector. The United Kingdom was the world’s first civil nuclear nation, and nuclear energy has powered homes and businesses in this country for over 60 years. As a source of low carbon power, nuclear energy will play a crucial role in reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in 2050. It is also an important part of accelerating homegrown power for greater energy security. The sector supports 60,000 jobs across the whole nuclear fuel cycle – from enrichment to decommissioning and waste management – and at both a national and regional level. Its importance to the UK’s national security, energy needs, and economy will only continue to grow, so it’s never been more important to ensure that the sector is well-positioned and resilient against cyber threats. The Government published the new National Cyber Strategy at the end of 2021, setting out our vision to maintain the UK’s standing as a leading, responsible and democratic cyber power. Cyber represents a huge opportunity for UK businesses: transforming ways of working, promoting innovation, and increasing productivity and efficiency. However, it also creates opportunities for malicious actors to exploit, attack and disrupt networks in efforts to extort money or valuable intellectual property. We recognise that we have come a long way, but we still have more to do. The 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy sits beneath the national framework and outlines how we will deliver its objectives together within the UK’s civil nuclear sector. As both the cyber threat and digital technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial that we make a step change to stay ahead of the curve. Managing cyber risks requires a whole-of-organisation effort, underpinned by strong regulation, supported by sector-wide collaboration, and a positive security culture. The commitments set out in this strategy seek to collectively deliver that shared ambition, ensuring that the UK’s civil nuclear sector will continue its legacy long into our net zero future. Greg Hands MP Minister of State for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 5 Executive Summary Electricity generated from nuclear power will play a vital role in supporting the UK’s long term energy security, clean energy transition and achieving its net zero carbon emissions target by 2050. As the sector’s strategic importance and size increases, it is more crucial than ever that civil nuclear organisations and their suppliers protect themselves against cyber security threats, and plan effectively for cyber incidents. The 2021 National Cyber Strategy sets the UK ambition to be a leading global cyber power, protecting and promoting the UK’s interests in and through cyberspace. That vision is matched in the civil nuclear sector, with this strategy sitting underneath the national framework and supporting its delivery. Our goal is ‘A UK civil nuclear sector which effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a collaborative and mature manner, is resilient in responding to and recovering from incidents, and ensures an inclusive culture for all’. Cyber security in the sector is on a positive trajectory and cyber maturity has improved over the past five years with the support of this strategy’s predecessor, the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy. However, there is more work to do, and the evolving nature of both the threat and technology means we need to accelerate to keep pace with a changing external environment. Building on a comprehensive understanding of current sector strengths and challenges, this strategy outlines four key objectives which the sector should achieve by 2026: • The sector appropriately prioritises cyber security as part of a holistic risk management approach, underpinned by a common risk understanding, and outcome-focused regulation; • The sector and its supply chain takes proactive action to mitigate cyber risks in the face of evolving threats, legacy challenges and adoption of new technologies; • The sector enhances its resilience by preparing for, and responding collaboratively to cyber incidents, minimising impacts and recovery time; and • The sector collaborates to increase cyber maturity, develop cyber skills and promote a positive security culture. These objectives will be delivered by a range of priority and supporting activities and overseen by a programmatic approach to delivery. Key commitments include: • Rolling out Cyber Adversary Simulation (CyAS) assessments and other threat- informed testing activities across the sector’s critical Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems; • Setting baseline cyber security standards for the civil nuclear supply chain; Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 6 • Delivering a sector-wide live cyber incident response exercise with the National Cyber Security Centre, alongside an exercising programme targeted at senior decision-makers; • Collaborating across the sector on third party and component assurance and management; and • Working with developers of advanced nuclear technologies to support cyber security by design. The nature of cyberspace and the challenges faced mean that this strategy cannot be delivered by any organisation alone, and has therefore been developed jointly with leaders from public and private sector civil nuclear organisations, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, and the National Cyber Security Centre. Its success hinges on joint delivery and continued co- operation across all partners. In recognition of this, the strategy has been endorsed by senior decision-makers across the sector through the Cyber Security Oversight Group, which will take responsibility for its implementation. Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 7 1. Strategic Context 1.1 The Civil Nuclear Sector Nuclear power will play a vital role in meeting the UK’s electricity demands while supporting the clean energy transition, delivering our net zero carbon emissions target and increasing our energy security by 2050. Nuclear energy complements renewable sources in ensuring a low cost, stable and low carbon system, and offers additional resilience to the UK’s energy security by providing a reliable baseload of power that is not fossil fuel, sun or wind dependent. The 2020 Energy White Paper1, the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Revolution2, the 2021 Net Zero Strategy3 and the 2022 British Energy Security Strategy4 all stated the Government’s objective to advance nuclear as a secure and clean energy source through development of both large-scale nuclear and the next generation of small and advanced reactors. Crucial to its successful delivery will also be a well-planned decommissioning and waste management programme. The UK civil nuclear sector is specialist, diverse and highly-skilled, supporting over 60,000 jobs nationwide. Our civil nuclear heritage originates from the 1950s, with Calder Hall in Cumbria being the first nuclear power station in the world to produce electricity for domestic use. Today the UK sector encompasses much of the nuclear fuel cycle process: from fuel enrichment and fabrication; to electricity production; to nuclear waste disposal. We host a world-leading nuclear transport capability; safely and securely transporting nuclear material around the world so it can be utilised and reprocessed effectively; and are home to Sellafield, Europe’s largest nuclear site. The civil nuclear sector is also protected by a dedicated armed police force, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, which is charged with the protection of civil nuclear sites and nuclear materials in England, Scotland and Wales. 1 Energy White Paper: Powering Our Net Zero, December 2020 2 10 Point Plan for Green Industrial Revolution, November 2020 3 Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, October 2021 4 British Energy Security Strategy, April 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 8 Figure 1 – A summary of the nuclear fuel cycle: the industrial processes for nuclear material from mining to disposal Given the importance of the civil nuclear sector to the UK’s energy system, population and environment, the UK remains committed to maintaining and strengthening its nuclear safety and security. In recognition of the UK’s role in the global nuclear regime, we have a duty to continue to uphold ourselves as a responsible nuclear power. This means protecting the UK’s nuclear material, facilities, information, and technology from the threats it faces, as well as facilitating the safe, timely and cost-effective management of our nuclear waste and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Civil nuclear is recognised as one of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure sectors and it is robustly regulated to ensure that safety, security and safeguarding arrangements are effective. This substantive body of nuclear safety, security and safeguards laws and regulations5 is enforced by the sector’s independent regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), working with the Environment Agency, Department for Transport, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, amongst others. 1.2 Cyber Security in Civil Nuclear As the civil nuclear sector’s importance continues to grow, becoming more digitalised and interconnected, it cannot be complacent about keeping pace with the cyber security threats facing UK Critical National Infrastructure. The range of malicious cyber actors, from cyber criminals to hostile state actors, continues to expand, whilst the cyber threat is quickly evolving in terms of capability, new technology, and its global-to-local reach. Impacts can be targeted or indiscriminate, as demonstrated by notable cyber incidents occurring globally and in the UK. At 5 Relevant legislation includes, but is not limited to: the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations (2019), Nuclear Safeguards Act (2018), Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003, The Civil Contingencies Act (2004) and the Nuclear Installations Act (1966) Overview of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE Uranium Mining Ore Processing and Conversion Enrichment Fuel Fabrication Electricity Generation Spent Fuel Storage Nuclear Waste Disposal Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 9 the same time, increasing digital transformation provides significant opportunities for the UK, and its civil nuclear sector, to be world-leading in efficiency, safety, security, and innovation. Good security enables individual organisations and the sector as a whole maximise use of information and technology to achieve their wider goals. In recognition of these evolving cyber threats and opportunities, the Government published the new National Cyber Strategy in December 2021, building on the successes of its predecessor national strategies in 2016 and 20116. The National Cyber Strategy seeks to implement the ambition set out in the 2020 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy for the UK to be a leading democratic cyber power7, through its five key pillars: • Pillar 1: Strengthening the UK cyber ecosystem, investing in our people and skills and deepening the partnership between government, academia and industry; • Pillar 2: Building a resilient and prosperous digital UK, reducing cyber risks so businesses can maximise the economic benefits of digital technology and citizens are more secure online and confident that their data is protected; • Pillar 3: Taking the lead in the technologies vital to cyber power, building in our industrial capability and developing frameworks to secure future technologies; • Pillar 4: Advancing UK global leadership and influence for a more secure, prosperous and open international order, working with government and industry partners and sharing the expertise that underpins UK cyber power; • Pillar 5: Detecting, disrupting and deterring our adversaries to enhance UK security in and through cyberspace, making more integrated creative and routine use of the UK’s full spectrum of levers. The 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy delivers a core element of Pillar 2, seeking to ensure that the civil nuclear sector is prepared for cyber risks and has the capabilities to prevent, respond to, and recover from, incidents when they occur. It also has an important role to play in supporting innovation and harnessing digital technologies, whilst the multinational nature of both the nuclear sector and the cyber threat means our goals can only be achieved by working internationally with bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The UK’s regulatory regime, enforced primarily by the ONR, is world-leading in its outcome- focused approach to managing cyber risk, building on the sector’s strong risk management record. The sector has a mature safety and security culture across its varied organisations and personnel, and good progress has already been made on cyber security, facilitated by growing cross-sector cooperation and governance. Nevertheless, increased prioritisation and collaboration is required to maintain this positive trajectory as cyber risks evolve. The 2020 Trojan attack on software company SolarWinds demonstrated how supply chains are being increasingly exploited to facilitate access to customer organisations. Meanwhile, the 2017 Triton malware attack, the 2020 attack on an 6 UK National Cyber Strategy, December 2021 7 Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, March 2021 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 10 Israeli water facility and 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline show the growing intent and capability to target Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. They are recognised as highly desirable assets, rich with valuable intellectual property and the potential to significantly disrupt operations. Closer to the nuclear sector, the 2020 ransomware attack on the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) illustrated the growing sophistication of cyber- attacks which can go undetected by even the most cyber mature organisations. Figure 2 – A summary of the various sub-sectors within the Civil Nuclear Sector The response to this multi-faceted risk environment must go beyond regulatory compliance towards a holistic risk management approach to cyber; recognising the role of cyber as a business enabler and an organisation-wide responsibility. The scope of this strategy thus looks across the entire civil nuclear sector, and across both regulated and unregulated domains within organisations. Building on the successes of the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy, it strengthens accountability for both regulated and unregulated cyber risks, promotes sector-wide collaboration and information-sharing, supports incident response planning, and delivers a step change in cyber security culture. To embed this holistic risk management picture, each part of the sector must work in close partnership. Government, industry, regulators and the technical authority (the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)) have their own unique responsibilities and capabilities for civil nuclear cyber security. Taking action to manage and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities is primarily the task of the civil nuclear industry itself, who own the operation of the systems and have the expertise to take judgements on risk and appropriate cyber security controls on site. Industry is comprised of a mixture of private and public sector organisations, as well as the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and research and innovation bodies. The civil nuclear supply chain likewise holds responsibility for the security of the services, information and products they provide. Overview of Civil Nuclear Sub-Sectors Fuel Services (including enrichment and fabrication) Civil Nuclear Electricity Generation Decommissioning, Reprocessing and Waste Management Supply Chain Research and Development Transportation of Nuclear Material Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 11 The industry and supply chain are supported by the ONR, which enforces and validates industry practice in line with security regulations, and the NCSC, which provides timely and accurate threat and vulnerability intelligence and advice. The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy’s (BEIS’) role is to set strategic direction and risk appetite through the provision of threat planning assumptions and oversight of the overall regulatory framework, including the ONR’s powers.

This initial strategy described outcomes for the sector to strive towards and set expectations across the sector under four overarching activities for improving the understanding of cyber risks, mitigation of any cyber vulnerabilities identified, resources for cyber and cyber incident response. Figure 4 – A high-level summary of the outcomes and overarching activities of the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy Overview of Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy (2017-21) YEAR 1 OUTCOME (2016/17) YEAR 2-4 OUTCOME (2017-19) YEAR 5 OUTCOME (2020/21) A continuing improvement in capability and capacity through training and exercising (supported by Government financing) with increasing senior executive understanding and ownership of cyber security risk facing their organisation. Successful delivery of the strategy will be demonstrated through regulator assessments and the NCSC assessment of industry exercising An industry with reducing Government support, adapt to a tailored outcome-focussed approach using commercial cyber specialists as appropriate, as part of their holistic cyber (and overall) security stance. An industry with a mature approach to understanding cyber threat and delivering outcome-focussed solutions which are approved by the regulator. 4 Overarching Activities to Support the Outcomes: 1. Delivering a comprehensive understanding of the cyber vulnerabilities across the civil nuclear sector 2. Continuously mitigate identified issues and vulnerabilities 3. Improve the sector’s capability to detect, respond and recover from cyber incidents 4. Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to cyber security and resilience to transform capability in the sector. The 2017 strategy put cyber security on the agenda alongside more traditional physical and personnel security, and safety and environmental risks. It set out the roles and responsibilities for cyber security for key entities across the sector – industry, the supply chain, regulators, and government – that individually and collectively play a role in strengthening the sector’s cyber security posture. Feedback from across the sector conveyed that the strategy was foundational, facilitating a more joined up approach across the sector and ensuring that effective strategies were in place to identify cyber threats and mitigate vulnerabilities. Key achievements under this five-year strategy are set out in Figure 5. Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 13 As the 2017 strategy draws to a close, we recognise the significant progress made in improving the cyber security of the UK civil nuclear sector. However, the changing nature of the threat, greater focus on energy independence, and the evolution of civil nuclear technology and infrastructure mean there is still work to do. As the Government embarks on ambitious plans to bring at least one large-scale nuclear project to the point of Final Investment Decision by the end of this Parliament and develop the next generation of small and advanced reactors, cyber security needs to be embedded right from the design phase of our thinking. At the same time, as the UK’s Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) fleet starts to move into decommissioning this decade, the challenges of our legacy infrastructure and our responsibility to maintain security throughout the entire infrastructure lifecycle remain paramount. Our 2022 strategy seeks to tackle these new challenges in a way that is future-proofed, measurable and flexible to the changing environment.

Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 14 2. What Does Good Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Look Like? To identify where challenges lie and monitor progress over time, we need to agree ‘what good looks like’ for civil nuclear cyber security. This helps us to target resources and priorities where they will have maximum impact. Our goal for civil nuclear cyber security is that: In determining what good looks like, we must take into account the following issues: • Our desired outcomes must be dynamic and adaptive, allowing for rapid changes in priorities, threats and technologies, and recognising that action needs to be taken against both current risks and those that may emerge in the future. Future-proofed outcomes will also enable us to measure progress against these goals over time and in successive strategies. • We must embed cyber security in a wider risk and business growth context, placing it as part of a ‘defence in depth’ approach to organisational security alongside physical and personnel protections. Our goals must recognise that cyber security should be prioritised amongst wider organisational safety, environmental and financial risks, as part of a holistic risk management approach. We must also recognise that cyber should be an enabler and an opportunity for business growth and innovation, rather than a hinderance. • Our assessment must recognise that good cybersecurity is a product of culture rather than a set of isolated controls. Our interconnected services, suppliers and technology mean that cyber security cannot be achieved by security teams alone, or by only part of the sector – it must be organisation-wide and apply over the full nuclear life cycle. Success relies on embedding and sustaining strong cyber security awareness, practices and appropriate investment within and across all organisations (including partners and supply chain). Promoting diversity of thought, avoiding group-think, and promoting a positive culture is a crucial success factor in this process. • It must apply equally to both IT systems (e.g. corporate networks, enterprise equipment, HR and finance systems, whether on premises or in the cloud) and operational technology systems (known as ‘OT’, which encompass the industrial systems, networks and plant equipment necessary to deliver the organisation’s product or service). Our decision to consider cyber and information security in the round reflects the fact that our entire digital footprint could be vulnerable to disruption or compromise by malicious actors. This can result in potentially The UK civil nuclear sector effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a collaborative and mature manner. It is resilient in responding to and recovering from incidents, and promotes a positive security culture. Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 15 significant impacts – from reputational, financial and operational implications, all the way to severe safety and security outcomes. This is increasingly the case as IT and OT systems become more interconnected. • And finally, increasing the sector’s technical maturity alone will not deliver good cyber security: in considering what good looks like the importance of strategic enablers such as leadership, governance and competence must be recognised. As part of this, each partner – industry, ONR, supply chain, the NCSC and BEIS – should take responsibility for those issues where it is uniquely placed to take action. Building on existing frameworks for cyber security maturity such as the ONR’s Security Assessment Principles (SyAPs)8 and the NCSC’s Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)9, we have developed a high-level model of good civil nuclear cyber security. These outcomes outline what we want to achieve across all civil nuclear organisations, domains and systems (Figure 6). In support of this model, a maturity framework was commissioned by BEIS, with the support of funding from the National Cyber Security Programme, to articulate some of these outcomes in more detail, in particular the indicators of good practice in cyber risk mitigation. The maturity framework was designed to be aligned with both the SyAPs and CAF, and outlined measurable goals against the indicators set out in Figure 7. Our intention is to use this framework as an objective assessor of cyber security maturity over time. Over the next five years this strategy will prioritise action and investment where there is a clear priority or gap. However, we recognise that new capabilities and challenges will arise over the life of the strategy. We will therefore regularly monitor and evaluate sector maturity against these indicators, enabling us to measure progress and redirect attention if priorities need to be adjusted.

Sector Maturity and Challenges To assess the gap between current civil nuclear cyber security and our goal, we conducted a comprehensive gap analysis across the sector. This gathered both quantitative and qualitative data from businesses, the nuclear supply chain, the NCSC and the ONR to identify the major challenges and strengths facing the sector currently, and across the next five years. 3.1 Civil Nuclear Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment In 2020/21 BEIS used the maturity framework referred to in Figure 6 to conduct a Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment across the civil nuclear sector. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) responsible for cyber security in nuclear sector organisations assessed themselves across the different criteria, and those results were overlaid by the regulator with their independent regulatory intelligence. This allowed us to look at areas of perceived strength or weakness and aggregate this data from individual organisations to build a sector-wide view. We were also able to compare organisational and regulatory assessments, and look at consistency across the range of scores for individual outcomes. The assessment highlighted variation in maturity across domains, with regulated domains showing greater maturity than those which were unregulated and OT security being comparatively weaker than IT. The summary report outlined 13 recommendations as set out in Figure 8. The Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment provided both a quantitative assessment of sector maturity which can be used to assess strengths and weaknesses, and a baseline for sector maturity to measure progress against. This CAF-aligned framework will be used twice more during the lifetime of this strategy to assess progress, with the second of these iterations inputting into decision-making for future work. Figure 8 – A summary of the recommendations from the Civil Nuclear Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment RECOMMENDATIONS 1 Focus future cyber improvement initiatives on the areas identified for further development by the Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment 2 Further strengthen the approach to information sharing on cyber (e.g. threat intelligence, good practices) and collaboration on cyber security within the sector 3 Continue to support the annual technical cyber exercise programme but also seek to develop a mature cyber incident response exercise programme 4 Support dutyholders to deliver regular, tailored cyber incident response exercises within their organisations in order to drive improvements and strengthen the maturity of their cyber incident response and recovery plans Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 18 5 Ensure the cyber security aspects of key sector assessments, documents and strategies that set out the civil nuclear sector’s security posture accurately reflects the sector’s risk profile and balances cyber security alongside physical and personnel security 6 Support the development of a more mature and holistic approach to supply chain cyber security. An approach where assurance activities are expanded, going beyond the regulated Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI) supply chain and seeks to develop and adopt an effective baseline standard for the wider supply chain 7 Investigate and support the adoption of new, secure information sharing technologies suiting their organisation’s needs to enable greater sharing of sensitive information securely and confidently across dutyholders and their supply chain organisations 8 Further develop the cloud security guidance on cloud adoption so it provides more actionable guidance for dutyholders on how to effectively secure both classified and unclassified information stored in the cloud 9 Learning lessons from the strong safety culture, understand how a strong cyber security culture can be well- embedded within the civil nuclear industry 10 Review whether the security regulations within the civil nuclear sector is still fit-for-purpose in counteracting current and future cyber risks 11 Develop specialist cyber security training to bridge the knowledge gap between safety and cyber security roles as well as raising awareness to the cyber risks facing Operational Technology (OT) systems 12 Encourage collaboration (e.g. sharing learning and good practice) with other sectors who are undoubtedly face similar challenges 13 Support dutyholders to adopt appropriate protective security monitoring and logging solutions for their IT and OT environments to strengthen their cyber security posture, without impacting upon functional safety. 3.2 Sector Engagement As well as the benchmarking framework assessment, BEIS conducted a number of workshops and other engagements with industry, the ONR and the NCSC. The Civil Nuclear CISO Working Group (CISO WG) – an industry-led cyber collaboration forum for civil nuclear – provided invaluable input on the biggest upcoming challenges for the strategy to address. Four key themes on challenges emerged as shown in Figure 9. These included challenges already identified by the Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment, including supply chain risk management, the need to embed cyber security into new technologies, and the challenge of prioritising cyber security investment against other types of nuclear risk mitigation such as safety, physical security and environmental risk. However, the workshops also identified a number of additional areas for improvement, including the need for a stronger cyber security culture across the sector and the challenge of recruiting and retaining skilled and diverse cyber professionals in often remote locations. Participants in our workshops also repeatedly emphasised the value of support and engagement from their organisational Executive and Board in enabling organisations to achieve their cyber security objectives. Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 19 Figure 9 – A summary of the challenges identified through engagements across the sector RISK MANAGEMENT RISK MITIGATION • Risks are not always managed holistically, risking security gaps and sub-optimal decisions, especially between the cyber, physical security and safety domains. • Organisational cyber security strategies are not always clearly articulated, and are often focused on compliance, rather than risk management or cyber as an enabler. • There is a lack of a common shared understanding of threats and risk appetites. This can lead to prescriptive regulatory interventions. • Fast, agile implementation of improvements can be hampered by the significant scale and complexity of legacy operational systems. • The sector is facing significant, novel cyber security challenges as the technology and cyber threat landscape rapidly evolves. • Tackling the challenges of supplier assurance and new technology is difficult and requires cross-sector effort. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT CULTURE, COLLABORATION AND SKILLS • Cyber incident response within and across organisations requires more frequent exercising and executive-level support. • Monitoring of networks and detection of cyber incidents is a key area for improvement. • The specialist nature of the civil nuclear sector and of cyber security can make recruitment and retention of diverse and suitably skilled personnel difficult. The culture can sometimes lack inclusively. • Lack of cyber knowledge amongst key personnel and providers means cyber security is not mainstreamed across organisations 3.3 NCSC Threat Assessment Finally, our gap analysis took into account the likely trends and emerging cyber threats over the lifetime of the strategy. Reflecting the wider UK national picture as set out in the 2021 National Cyber Strategy, the key threats to civil nuclear are likely to be ransomware, Intellectual Property (IP) theft and an attack via the supply chain, as set out in Figure 10. This assessment of threat, along with the view from industry CISOs and the quantitative overview of sector maturity gives us a good picture of the context we should be writing the strategy within. Figure 10 – Threat Assessment for the civil nuclear sector over the next five years RANSOMWARE Ransomware almost certainly represents the most likely disruptive threat to the UK Civil Nuclear Sector. It’s a realistic possibility that current international efforts to combat ransomware will lead to an increase in worldwide attacks in the next 12 months, as ransomware actors seek to maximise their profits before anticipated changes make their operating environment more difficult. Ransomware will almost certainly continue to be opportunistic based on whether threat actors can obtain access to victims’ networks, but within that, favoured target sectors will be chosen based on perceived willingness to pay. Whilst data extortion has become a prominent tactic, the majority of ransomware attacks look Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 20 highly likely to continue relying on encryption to incentivise victims into paying a ransom. IP THEFT IP theft will likely remain a persistent threat to industry as a new generation of nuclear technology is emerging. IP on small modular reactors (SMRs) will be attractive targets as foreign states seek to build their domestic capabilities in low- carbon energy systems. SUPPLY CHAINS Supply chains as an attack vector almost certainly represent a growing threat to the civil nuclear sector. Actors are developing a better understanding of the civil nuclear industry and its relationship with third parties including managed service providers (MSPs), software vendors and regulators. It is highly likely supply chains will continue to grow as a favoured cyber attack vector. Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 21 4. Strategy Themes and Priorities The gap analysis undertaken against our model of good cyber security identified a number of key areas where the civil nuclear sector should prioritise action over the next five years, and BEIS, the ONR, the nuclear sector and the NCSC have worked closely together to articulate our priority objectives (Figure 11): Figure 11 - A summary of the overarching goal and objectives of the 2021 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy Goal The UK civil nuclear sector effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a collaborative and mature manner. It is resilient in responding to and recovering from incidents, and promotes a positive security culture. RISK MANAGEMENT RISK MITIGATION INCIDENT MANAGEMENT CULTURE, SKILLS & COLLABORATION Objectives Sector appropriately prioritises cyber security as part of a holistic risk management approach underpinned by a common risk understanding and outcome-focused regulation. The sector and its supply chain takes proactive action to mitigate cyber risks in the face of evolving threats, legacy challenges and adoption of new technologies. The sector enhances its resilience by preparing for, and responding collaboratively to cyber incidents, minimising impacts and recovery time The sector collaborates to increase cyber maturity, develop cyber skills and promote an inclusive and security-minded culture Supporting the delivery of these five-year objectives are a prioritised set of activities and actions. These activities have been developed jointly by government, nuclear industry organisations, the NCSC and the ONR, and are designed to be owned and delivered across all partners. This joint approach builds on the success of the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy and recognises that the cyber maturity of the civil nuclear sector is a shared responsibility that cannot be delivered by government, or any organisation, alone. The activities identified draw on the powers and remit of each delivery partner to contribute to the overall achievement of the objectives, and each is assigned a clear owner to facilitate implementation and accountability. The strategy is structured so that activities are explicitly linked with and contribute towards the outline objectives and overall goal (Figure 12). As the objectives are themselves based upon the sectors areas of relative weakness, this approach ensures we target those actions that will most impact our overall progress.

This objective focuses on how cyber risks are considered, prioritised and managed across the sector, including the policies and risk decisions taken within organisations, and the requirements and risk appetite set by Government and the regulator. Recognising the need for a dynamic cyber risk posture, it considers how cyber security is funded compared to other nuclear security risks and seeks to ensure that decision-makers at all levels are informed by an appropriate understanding of organisational threats and vulnerabilities. Over the five years of the strategy, we will deliver the following priority and supporting activities on risks management: • Ensure appropriate engagement and accountability at a senior level within organisations across the sector by: explicitly assessing leadership and governance criteria in the ONR regulatory assessments of civil nuclear dutyholders; providing organisational Boards with cyber threat briefings improving Board and Executive Committee cyber awareness and training; and holding senior decision-makers more strongly to account through cross-sector governance. • Support a holistic risk management approach to cyber security and deliver mature governance structures by: driving strategy delivery and accountability through organisational implementation plans; improving risk management and understanding at corporate group level; risk assessing and assuring all networks as appropriate; and strengthening assurance – both through the creation of internal assurance Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 23 functions within organisation, and the increased utilisation of external, independent assurance of policies and plans. • Maintain a shared understanding of cyber threats and vulnerabilities by: repeating the CAF-aligned dutyholder self-assessment to identify strategic vulnerabilities and weaknesses as they arise; proactively utilising NCSC’s annual sector threat assessment; and deploying threat-informed assurance such as the CyAS framework to identify system-level vulnerabilities. BEIS will also review the Design Basis Threat (DBT) – the threat planning assumptions for the civil nuclear sector – to ensure the cyber threat described is kept current and drives appropriate investment decisions. • Ensure a continued proportionate and outcome-focused regulatory approach by: reviewing the implementation of the SyAPs; develop a holistic risk assessment maturity model for regulatory assessments; and explore whether the civil nuclear generating fleet should be regulated to maintain a level of electricity provision to the National Grid, in line with other UK electricity generators.

Under this objective we outline how the sector can mitigate the specific risks posed to the IT and OT environments, including by new technologies and the supply chain. The activities which will help us achieve this objective of the next five years are: • Mitigating cyber risks within and across IT and OT domains, by: sharing and improving approaches to software and equipment assurance across the sector, building on the NCSC’s assurance principles and using appropriate tools (including Active Cyber Defence) as they become available; conducting threat-informed assessment activities through frameworks like CyAs; improving asset management; investigating the development of a sector Centre of Excellence to share knowledge and expertise; and continuing to prioritise investment in Research & Development (R&D). • Ensuring cyber security is embedded into the deployment of new nuclear and digital technologies by: integrating new systems securely onto networks systems; reviewing and better promoting existing Cloud Security guidance; and sharing risk assessments on new technologies. As advanced nuclear technologies continue to develop, we will engage closely with developers of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) on cyber security considerations, and ensure that the ONR’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process, by which the ONR approves new reactor designs, has cyber and information security requirements (including for Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI)) built in. • Effective management of supply chain cyber risk by the nuclear sector by: regular mapping of supply chains; sharing of model third party contracts; working jointly with suppliers and trade associations (including the Defence Industry Security Association, DISA and the Nuclear Industry Association, NIA) to support and encourage their cyber security, promoting international guidance on supply chain security being developed by the IAEA, and utilising existing best practice toolkits such as the supply chain assurance tool developed by BEIS. • Support the nuclear supply chain to take appropriate action to manage their own cyber risk, by: increasing engagement with supply chain industry groups, including provision of cyber threat briefings; and working with trade associations to refresh and promote its guidance for suppliers. Additionally, nuclear organisations will set baseline cyber and information security standards for suppliers; the ONR will benchmark the existing cyber security maturity of holders of SNI; and BEIS will consider the case for regulation of cyber security in the supply chain.

Incident management is an area which we saw a particular increase in maturity during the period of the last strategy, with government response planning and an annual programme of sector-wide technical exercising beginning. This progress should be continued and maintained. However, an area of relative weakness as identified through the Cyber Security Maturity Assessment was active logging and monitoring of systems to ensure abnormal activity and trends are identified and mitigated, and network monitoring is therefore a key objective of this strategy. In the coming strategy period we will: Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 26 • Strengthen exercising programmes by: delivering exercising targeted at senior decision-makers and undertaking an ambitious live exercise in addition to maintaining the sector-wider annual technical exercising programme. Response guidance for the sector will also be reviewed, monitoring tools deployed where appropriate and the NCSC exercising tools promoted. • Improve network monitoring, logging and identification of trends by: further integrating ACD and other tools, and creating a Civil Nuclear Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP): a machine-to-machine information sharing platform for threat intelligence. • Respond and coordinate effectively during cyber incidents by: improving access to secure communications capabilities; ensuring OT specific plans are in place for managing cyber incidents; improving CISO cross-sector engagement and coordination; developing ransomware recovery guidance; and continuing to improve incident coordination between government and the regulator.

With budgetary and personnel resource constraints, this objective is increasingly important for the Civil Nuclear sector’s cyber security maturity. During the five year life of this strategy we aim to: • Collaborate across the sector to tackle common challenges by: increasing information sharing and resources across common platforms; building upon the success of the cross-nuclear CISO WG to develop solutions to common challenges; providing support and resources to new CISOs; creating a lessons learned group on the NCSC’s Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP); and collaborating internationally to develop guidance and best practice. • Improve the skills and experience of nuclear cyber security professionals by: articulating cyber skills required for non-cyber expert roles; promoting and establish mentoring and reverse mentoring programmes; and supporting inter-sector and intra- sector secondments, apprenticeships and graduate schemes as well as the i100 scheme. Promote a positive security culture by: building on the Chilcott Report and other research to track progress towards avoiding group-think and improving diversity of thought; and setting organisational objectives on promoting a diverse and inclusive workforce. • Embedding cyber security training and accountability across organisations by: adopting basic cyber training across all personnel and supporting training in the supply chain; developing a cyber Community of Interest (COI) for engineers and operational technology personnel through a cross-sector training programme; continuing to review cyber security culture in the ONR’s regulatory assessments; and promoting the use of the security culture self-assessment tool10 developed by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), the UK’s national technical authority for physical, personnel and protective security. 10 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 28 Figure 16 – A summary of the Culture, Collaboration and Skills objective and its priorities and supporting activities Objective CULTURE, COLLABORATION AND SKILLS Sub- Objectives Collaboration across sector to tackle shared challenges Improve skills and experience of nuclear cyber professionals and promote a positive security culture Embed cyber security training and accountability across organisations Priority Activities Increase information sharing across common platforms Articulate cyber skills required for non- cyber expert roles Supporting Activities Create CISO resource pack to facilitate information- and best practice- sharing Maximise use of CISO WG network to tackle common challenges and develop cross-sector solutions Build on Chilcott Report and other research to track progress towards avoiding group- think and promoting a positive security culture Continue and extend cyber apprentice graduates and i100 scheme Develop cyber COI for engineering personnel through cross- sector training programme Scrutinise organisational cyber security culture through regulatory activities Collaborate internationally to develop guidance and share practice Create a lessons learned CISP Group Promote / establish mentoring and reserve mentoring programmes Support secondments (cross-sector and beyond nuclear) Adopt basic cyber training across all sector personnel Promote use of CPNI security culture assessment tool Set organisational objectives to promote a diverse and inclusive workforce Drive adoption of cyber security training within supply chain Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 29 5. Implementation and Monitoring To achieve the stated objectives and deliver the activities set out in this strategy, a sector-wide effort and prioritisation is required. Investment, resource and commitment from senior leadership is necessary to drive the required business change: we estimate that nuclear sector organisations would need to dedicate 5-10% of their annual organisational change capacity to cyber to successfully deliver the strategic outcomes. This change capacity is critical as the outcomes cannot be achieved by security teams alone but need active support from all areas of each business. Change capacity will be measured and managed in different ways by different organisations but may include resourcing and staffing, 'airtime' from leadership and communications campaigns, and the proportion and prioritisation of technical change requests and new projects on cyber security improvements as opposed to new business functionality, as well as other measures. 5.1 Priority and Core Activities To achieve the ambition we have set out, implementation of the strategy and delivery of the priority and supporting activities will be monitored and evaluated on an annual basis. 18 priority activities (outlined in Figure 17) have been identified based on their transformative potential and high impact, and/or because they require collective and coordinated action across the sector. These priority actions will be implemented to collectively agreed timelines. Figure 17 – A summary of the priority activities that will be centrally coordinated and implemented Risk Management Scrutinise leadership and governance in regulatory assessments Drive strategy delivery and accountability through organisational strategies / plans Comprehensiv ely review DBT cyber planning assumptions Repeat CAF-aligned sector assessment Explore regulation of continuity of supply Risk Mitigation Realise efficiencies in software/ equipment assurance through CISO WG collaboration Conduct threat informed assessment activities (CyAS or equiv) for both IT and OT systems Integrate new systems securely onto networks Regularly map supply chains at organisational level Influence cross-sector suppliers collaboratively Set baseline standards for suppliers (Cyber Essentials + or equiv Explore extending security regulation of wider supply chain Incident Management Deliver incident response exercise programme targeted at SIRO level Deliver a sector wide government lead exercise with NCSC Further develop and deploy logging and monitoring capability for OT Improve access to secure comms across the sector Culture, Collaboration and Skills Share information across common platforms Articulate cyber skills required for non-cyber expert roles Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 30 The supporting activities will be implemented by each delivery partner in line with its own internal planning and prioritisation. All delivery partners have committed to producing an individual implementation plan or strategy which demonstrates how they will deliver the activities which they own or support. Although in some cases supporting activities may not be relevant to all delivery partners, the following ‘core activities’ are considered either urgent to deliver, or fundamental good cyber security practice which all nuclear sector organisations should prioritise for early implementation if not already in place: • Adopt available Active Cyber Defence (ACD) tools. • Deploy monitoring tools across all relevant operational technology and information systems to identify abnormal activity and trends. • Undertake continuous risk assessment and assurance of all relevant networks. • Ensure incident response plans are in place for cyber-security attacks on operational technology and networks, as well as IT networks. • Develop ransomware recovery guidance and plans to support organisational business recovery following an incident. • Ensure all critical cyber and information assets are identified and managed appropriately. Figure 18 – A summary of the core activities (‘getting the basics right’) to implement during the first 3 years of the 2021 strategy 5.2 Implementation and Monitoring Learning from the 2017 strategy showed that a more directive and demonstratable strategy methodology was required and so this strategy will take a programmatic approach to its delivery. This includes a high-level roadmap for the priority and core activities as set out in Figure 20, which will be supplemented by a range of supporting activities continuing throughout the strategy’s timeline. All activities will be monitored and evaluated against a series of indicators and milestones. Delivery of the strategy will be overseen and monitored by the CSOG, the senior cross-sector forum looking at strategic issues pertaining to the strategy. CSOG will be supported by a CORE ACTIVITIES Adopt or scale- up ACD solutions Deploy monitoring tools across networks as appropriate (OT & IT) Risk assess and assure ALL networks as appropriate Ensure OT- specific cyber incident plans in place Develop ransomware recovery guidance Improve asset management Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022 31 dedicated Delivery Oversight Board (DOB), alongside annual reporting requirements which will assess strategy activity delivery. In addition, the CAF aligned sector Cyber Security Maturity Assessment will be carried out at the mid-point and end-point of the strategy to objectively monitor cyber security improvements, and evaluate whether our programmed activities are having the required impact towards achieving our overall goal. The strategy activities and priorities will be reassessed and baselined at the mid-strategy point if required. This may result from changing threat and context, lessons or vulnerabilities identified from incidents, and/or evaluation of the value the activities are delivering. 5.3 Roles and Responsibilities for Strategy Delivery A clear and shared understanding of the roles and responsibilities for implementing the 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy is crucial for meaningful and timely delivery. Each activity is owned by a designated delivery partner, as set out in Annex A. Figure 19 articulates the summary of the roles and responsibilities for each delivery partner. Figure 19 – A table outlining the roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the strategy DELIVERY PARTNER ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES Industry Nuclear Organisations As owners and operators, industry bear the primary responsibility for managing and continuously improving their organisation’s cyber and information security arrangements. In addition, they are responsible for assuring the security of their supply chain and proactively encouraging them to strengthen their security arrangements. Supply Chain The civil nuclear supply chain is responsible for managing and continuously improving their organisation’s cyber and information security arrangements. ONR As the civil nuclear sector regulator for nuclear safety, security and safeguards, ONR is responsible for monitoring and enforcing regulations to drive individual and sector- wide improvements on cyber and information security. In alignment with ONR’s regulatory priorities, ONR will actively contribute to and support industry in fulfilling the relevant activities set out in this strategy. It will also continue to provide assurances to the government on the overall security of the sector. BEIS As the lead government department for civil nuclear, BEIS will take an enabling role and will set the strategic direction to ensure that the UK’s regulatory framework is proportionate and fit-for-purpose. BEIS will coordinate the monitoring the implementation of the strategy through the DOB and the CSOG governance mechanisms. NCSC As the UK’s technical authority for cyber security, the NCSC will provide specialist advice and support to the sector on cyber security, including timely cyber threat and vulnerability intelligence.

This vision cannot be achieved by any  organisation in isolation, so I am delighted that the strategy has been developed and endorsed  jointly with UK civil nuclear organisations, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the National  Cyber Security Centre. I look forward to working together with them to strengthen the cyber  security of the UK’s civil nuclear sector.    The United Kingdom was the world’s first civil nuclear nation, and nuclear energy has powered  homes and businesses in this country for over 60 years. As a source of low carbon power,  nuclear energy will play a crucial role in reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions to net  zero in 2050. It is also an important part of accelerating homegrown power for greater energy  security. The sector supports 60,000 jobs across the whole nuclear fuel cycle – from  enrichment to decommissioning and waste management – and at both a national and regional  level. Its importance to the UK’s national security, energy needs, and economy will only  continue to grow, so it’s never been more important to ensure that the sector is well-positioned  and resilient against cyber threats.    The Government published the new National Cyber Strategy at the end of 2021, setting out our  vision to maintain the UK’s standing as a leading, responsible and democratic cyber power.  Cyber represents a huge opportunity for UK businesses: transforming ways of working,  promoting innovation, and increasing productivity and efficiency. However, it also creates  opportunities for malicious actors to exploit, attack and disrupt networks in efforts to extort  money or valuable intellectual property. We recognise that we have come a long way, but we  still have more to do. The 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy sits beneath the national  framework and outlines how we will deliver its objectives together within the UK’s civil nuclear  sector.    As both the cyber threat and digital technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial that we make a  step change to stay ahead of the curve. Managing cyber risks requires a whole-of-organisation  effort, underpinned by strong regulation, supported by sector-wide collaboration, and a positive  security culture. The commitments set out in this strategy seek to collectively deliver that  shared ambition, ensuring that the UK’s civil nuclear sector will continue its legacy long into our  net zero future.   Greg Hands MP   Minister of State for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change  Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   5   Executive Summary  Electricity generated from nuclear power will play a vital role in supporting the UK’s long term  energy security, clean energy transition and achieving its net zero carbon emissions target by  2050. As the sector’s strategic importance and size increases, it is more crucial than ever that  civil nuclear organisations and their suppliers protect themselves against cyber security  threats, and plan effectively for cyber incidents.   The 2021 National Cyber Strategy sets the UK ambition to be a leading global cyber power,  protecting and promoting the UK’s interests in and through cyberspace. That vision is matched  in the civil nuclear sector, with this strategy sitting underneath the national framework and  supporting its delivery. Our goal is ‘A UK civil nuclear sector which effectively manages and  mitigates cyber risk in a collaborative and mature manner, is resilient in responding to and  recovering from incidents, and ensures an inclusive culture for all’.   Cyber security in the sector is on a positive trajectory and cyber maturity has improved over  the past five years with the support of this strategy’s predecessor, the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber  Security Strategy. However, there is more work to do, and the evolving nature of both the  threat and technology means we need to accelerate to keep pace with a changing external  environment.    Building on a comprehensive understanding of current sector strengths and challenges, this  strategy outlines four key objectives which the sector should achieve by 2026:   • The sector appropriately prioritises cyber security as part of a holistic risk management approach, underpinned by a common risk understanding, and outcome-focused regulation;  • The sector and its supply chain takes proactive action to mitigate cyber risks in the face of evolving threats, legacy challenges and adoption of new technologies;  • The sector enhances its resilience by preparing for, and responding collaboratively to cyber incidents, minimising impacts and recovery time; and  • The sector collaborates to increase cyber maturity, develop cyber skills and promote a positive security culture.  These objectives will be delivered by a range of priority and supporting activities and overseen  by a programmatic approach to delivery. Key commitments include:   • Rolling out Cyber Adversary Simulation (CyAS) assessments and other threat- informed testing activities across the sector’s critical Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems;  • Setting baseline cyber security standards for the civil nuclear supply chain;    Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022    6   • Delivering a sector-wide live cyber incident response exercise with the National  Cyber Security Centre, alongside an exercising programme targeted at senior  decision-makers;   • Collaborating across the sector on third party and component assurance and  management; and   • Working with developers of advanced nuclear technologies to support cyber  security by design.   The nature of cyberspace and the challenges faced mean that this strategy cannot be  delivered by any organisation alone, and has therefore been developed jointly with leaders  from public and private sector civil nuclear organisations, the Office for Nuclear Regulation,  and the National Cyber Security Centre. Its success hinges on joint delivery and continued co- operation across all partners. In recognition of this, the strategy has been endorsed by senior  decision-makers across the sector through the Cyber Security Oversight Group, which will take  responsibility for its implementation.          Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   7   1. Strategic Context  1.1 The Civil Nuclear Sector   Nuclear power will play a vital role in meeting the UK’s electricity demands while supporting the  clean energy transition, delivering our net zero carbon emissions target and increasing our  energy security by 2050. Nuclear energy complements renewable sources in ensuring a low  cost, stable and low carbon system, and offers additional resilience to the UK’s energy security  by providing a reliable baseload of power that is not fossil fuel, sun or wind dependent. The  2020 Energy White Paper1, the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Revolution2, the  2021 Net Zero Strategy3 and the 2022 British Energy Security Strategy4 all stated the  Government’s objective to advance nuclear as a secure and clean energy source through  development of both large-scale nuclear and the next generation of small and advanced  reactors. Crucial to its successful delivery will also be a well-planned decommissioning and  waste management programme.   The UK civil nuclear sector is specialist, diverse and highly-skilled, supporting over 60,000 jobs  nationwide. Our civil nuclear heritage originates from the 1950s, with Calder Hall in Cumbria  being the first nuclear power station in the world to produce electricity for domestic use. Today  the UK sector encompasses much of the nuclear fuel cycle process: from fuel enrichment and  fabrication; to electricity production; to nuclear waste disposal. We host a world-leading nuclear  transport capability; safely and securely transporting nuclear material around the world so it  can be utilised and reprocessed effectively; and are home to Sellafield, Europe’s largest  nuclear site. The civil nuclear sector is also protected by a dedicated armed police force, the  Civil Nuclear Constabulary, which is charged with the protection of civil nuclear sites and  nuclear materials in England, Scotland and Wales.  1 Energy White Paper: Powering Our Net Zero, December 2020  2 10 Point Plan for Green Industrial Revolution, November 2020  3 Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, October 2021  4 British Energy Security Strategy, April 2022   https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-white-paper-powering-our-net-zero-future https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-energy-security-strategy#:%7E:text=The%20'British%20energy%20security%20strategy,as%20Russia's%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine.   Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   8   Figure 1 – A summary of the nuclear fuel cycle: the industrial processes for nuclear  material from mining to disposal   Given the importance of the civil nuclear sector to the UK’s energy system, population and  environment, the UK remains committed to maintaining and strengthening its nuclear safety  and security. In recognition of the UK’s role in the global nuclear regime, we have a duty to  continue to uphold ourselves as a responsible nuclear power. This means protecting the UK’s  nuclear material, facilities, information, and technology from the threats it faces, as well as  facilitating the safe, timely and cost-effective management of our nuclear waste and  decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Civil nuclear is recognised as one of the UK’s Critical  National Infrastructure sectors and it is robustly regulated to ensure that safety, security and  safeguarding arrangements are effective. This substantive body of nuclear safety, security and  safeguards laws and regulations5 is enforced by the sector’s independent regulator, the Office  for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), working with the Environment Agency, Department for  Transport, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, amongst others.    1.2 Cyber Security in Civil Nuclear   As the civil nuclear sector’s importance continues to grow, becoming more digitalised and  interconnected, it cannot be complacent about keeping pace with the cyber security threats  facing UK Critical National Infrastructure. The range of malicious cyber actors, from cyber  criminals to hostile state actors, continues to expand, whilst the cyber threat is quickly evolving  in terms of capability, new technology, and its global-to-local reach. Impacts can be targeted or  indiscriminate, as demonstrated by notable cyber incidents occurring globally and in the UK. At   5 Relevant legislation includes, but is not limited to: the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information)  Regulations (2019), Nuclear Safeguards Act (2018), Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003, The Civil  Contingencies Act (2004) and the Nuclear Installations Act (1966)   Overview of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle   NUCLEAR  FUEL   CYCLE   Uranium Mining   Ore Processing  and Conversion   Enrichment   Fuel Fabrication Electricity Generation   Spent Fuel  Storage   Nuclear Waste  Disposal     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   9   the same time, increasing digital transformation provides significant opportunities for the UK,  and its civil nuclear sector, to be world-leading in efficiency, safety, security, and innovation.  Good security enables individual organisations and the sector as a whole maximise use of  information and technology to achieve their wider goals.   In recognition of these evolving cyber threats and opportunities, the Government published the  new National Cyber Strategy in December 2021, building on the successes of its predecessor  national strategies in 2016 and 20116. The National Cyber Strategy seeks to implement the  ambition set out in the 2020 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign  Policy for the UK to be a leading democratic cyber power7, through its five key pillars:   • Pillar 1: Strengthening the UK cyber ecosystem, investing in our people and skills and deepening the partnership between government, academia and industry;  • Pillar 2: Building a resilient and prosperous digital UK, reducing cyber risks so businesses can maximise the economic benefits of digital technology and citizens are more secure online and confident that their data is protected;  • Pillar 3: Taking the lead in the technologies vital to cyber power, building in our industrial capability and developing frameworks to secure future technologies;  • Pillar 4: Advancing UK global leadership and influence for a more secure, prosperous and open international order, working with government and industry partners and sharing the expertise that underpins UK cyber power;  • Pillar 5: Detecting, disrupting and deterring our adversaries to enhance UK security in and through cyberspace, making more integrated creative and routine use of the UK’s full spectrum of levers.  The 2022 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy delivers a core element of Pillar 2, seeking to  ensure that the civil nuclear sector is prepared for cyber risks and has the capabilities to  prevent, respond to, and recover from, incidents when they occur. It also has an important role  to play in supporting innovation and harnessing digital technologies, whilst the multinational  nature of both the nuclear sector and the cyber threat means our goals can only be achieved  by working internationally with bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).   The UK’s regulatory regime, enforced primarily by the ONR, is world-leading in its outcome- focused approach to managing cyber risk, building on the sector’s strong risk management  record. The sector has a mature safety and security culture across its varied organisations and  personnel, and good progress has already been made on cyber security, facilitated by growing  cross-sector cooperation and governance.   Nevertheless, increased prioritisation and collaboration is required to maintain this positive  trajectory as cyber risks evolve. The 2020 Trojan attack on software company SolarWinds  demonstrated how supply chains are being increasingly exploited to facilitate access to  customer organisations. Meanwhile, the 2017 Triton malware attack, the 2020 attack on an   6 UK National Cyber Strategy, December 2021  7 Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy,  March 2021   https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy   Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   10   Israeli water facility and 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline show the growing intent and  capability to target Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. They are recognised as  highly desirable assets, rich with valuable intellectual property and the potential to significantly  disrupt operations. Closer to the nuclear sector, the 2020 ransomware attack on the Scottish  Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) illustrated the growing sophistication of cyber- attacks which can go undetected by even the most cyber mature organisations.  Figure 2 – A summary of the various sub-sectors within the Civil Nuclear Sector   The response to this multi-faceted risk environment must go beyond regulatory compliance  towards a holistic risk management approach to cyber; recognising the role of cyber as a  business enabler and an organisation-wide responsibility. The scope of this strategy thus looks  across the entire civil nuclear sector, and across both regulated and unregulated domains  within organisations. Building on the successes of the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security  Strategy, it strengthens accountability for both regulated and unregulated cyber risks, promotes  sector-wide collaboration and information-sharing, supports incident response planning, and  delivers a step change in cyber security culture.    To embed this holistic risk management picture, each part of the sector must work in close  partnership. Government, industry, regulators and the technical authority (the National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC)) have their own unique responsibilities and capabilities for civil nuclear  cyber security. Taking action to manage and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities is primarily the task  of the civil nuclear industry itself, who own the operation of the systems and have the expertise  to take judgements on risk and appropriate cyber security controls on site. Industry is  comprised of a mixture of private and public sector organisations, as well as the Civil Nuclear  Constabulary and research and innovation bodies. The civil nuclear supply chain likewise  holds responsibility for the security of the services, information and products they provide.

This initial strategy described outcomes for the sector to strive towards and set expectations  across the sector under four overarching activities for improving the understanding of cyber risks,  mitigation of any cyber vulnerabilities identified, resources for cyber and cyber incident response.   Figure 4 – A high-level summary of the outcomes and overarching activities of the 2017  Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy   Overview of Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy (2017-21)  YEAR 1 OUTCOME (2016/17) YEAR 2-4 OUTCOME (2017-19) YEAR 5 OUTCOME (2020/21)   A continuing improvement in  capability and capacity through   training and exercising (supported by  Government financing) with  increasing senior executive   understanding and ownership of  cyber security risk facing their   organisation.

An industry with a mature approach to  understanding cyber threat and  delivering outcome-focussed   solutions which are approved by the  regulator.   4 Overarching Activities to Support the Outcomes:   1. Delivering a comprehensive understanding of the cyber vulnerabilities across the civil nuclear sector 2. Continuously mitigate identified issues and vulnerabilities 3. Improve the sector’s capability to detect, respond and recover from cyber incidents 4. Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to cyber security and resilience to transform capability in the sector.  The 2017 strategy put cyber security on the agenda alongside more traditional physical and  personnel security, and safety and environmental risks. It set out the roles and responsibilities  for cyber security for key entities across the sector – industry, the supply chain, regulators, and  government – that individually and collectively play a role in strengthening the sector’s cyber  security posture. Feedback from across the sector conveyed that the strategy was  foundational, facilitating a more joined up approach across the sector and ensuring that  effective strategies were in place to identify cyber threats and mitigate vulnerabilities. Key  achievements under this five-year strategy are set out in Figure 5.     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   13   As the 2017 strategy draws to a close, we recognise the significant progress made in  improving the cyber security of the UK civil nuclear sector. However, the changing nature of  the threat, greater focus on energy independence, and the evolution of civil nuclear technology  and infrastructure mean there is still work to do. As the Government embarks on ambitious  plans to bring at least one large-scale nuclear project to the point of Final Investment Decision  by the end of this Parliament and develop the next generation of small and advanced reactors,  cyber security needs to be embedded right from the design phase of our thinking. At the same  time, as the UK’s Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) fleet starts to move into  decommissioning this decade, the challenges of our legacy infrastructure and our responsibility  to maintain security throughout the entire infrastructure lifecycle remain paramount. Our 2022  strategy seeks to tackle these new challenges in a way that is future-proofed, measurable and  flexible to the changing environment.

Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   14   2. What Does Good Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Look Like? To identify where challenges lie and monitor progress over time, we need to agree ‘what good  looks like’ for civil nuclear cyber security. This helps us to target resources and priorities where  they will have maximum impact.    Our goal for civil nuclear cyber security is that:   In determining what good looks like, we must take into account the following issues:   • Our desired outcomes must be dynamic and adaptive, allowing for rapid changes in priorities, threats and technologies, and recognising that action needs to be taken against both current risks and those that may emerge in the future. Future-proofed outcomes will also enable us to measure progress against these goals over time and in successive strategies.  • We must embed cyber security in a wider risk and business growth context, placing it as part of a ‘defence in depth’ approach to organisational security alongside physical and personnel protections. Our goals must recognise that cyber security should be prioritised amongst wider organisational safety, environmental and financial risks, as part of a holistic risk management approach. We must also recognise that cyber should be an enabler and an opportunity for business growth and innovation, rather than a hinderance.  • Our assessment must recognise that good cybersecurity is a product of culture rather than a set of isolated controls. Our interconnected services, suppliers and technology mean that cyber security cannot be achieved by security teams alone, or by only part of the sector – it must be organisation-wide and apply over the full nuclear life cycle. Success relies on embedding and sustaining strong cyber security awareness, practices and appropriate investment within and across all organisations (including partners and supply chain). Promoting diversity of thought, avoiding group-think, and promoting a positive culture is a crucial success factor in this process.  • It must apply equally to both IT systems (e.g. corporate networks, enterprise equipment, HR and finance systems, whether on premises or in the cloud) and operational technology systems (known as ‘OT’, which encompass the industrial systems, networks and plant equipment necessary to deliver the organisation’s product or service). Our decision to consider cyber and information security in the round reflects the fact that our entire digital footprint could be vulnerable to disruption or compromise by malicious actors. This can result in potentially  The UK civil nuclear sector effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a  collaborative and mature manner. It is resilient in responding to and recovering from   incidents, and promotes a positive security culture.     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   15   significant impacts – from reputational, financial and operational implications, all the  way to severe safety and security outcomes. This is increasingly the case as IT and  OT systems become more interconnected.   • And finally, increasing the sector’s technical maturity alone will not deliver good cyber security: in considering what good looks like the importance of strategic enablers such as leadership, governance and competence must be recognised. As part of this, each partner – industry, ONR, supply chain, the NCSC and BEIS – should take responsibility for those issues where it is uniquely placed to take action.  Building on existing frameworks for cyber security maturity such as the ONR’s Security  Assessment Principles (SyAPs)8 and the NCSC’s Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)9, we  have developed a high-level model of good civil nuclear cyber security. These outcomes  outline what we want to achieve across all civil nuclear organisations, domains and systems  (Figure 6).   In support of this model, a maturity framework was commissioned by BEIS, with the support of  funding from the National Cyber Security Programme, to articulate some of these outcomes in  more detail, in particular the indicators of good practice in cyber risk mitigation. The maturity  framework was designed to be aligned with both the SyAPs and CAF, and outlined measurable  goals against the indicators set out in Figure 7. Our intention is to use this framework as an  objective assessor of cyber security maturity over time. Over the next five years this strategy  will prioritise action and investment where there is a clear priority or gap. However, we  recognise that new capabilities and challenges will arise over the life of the strategy. We will  therefore regularly monitor and evaluate sector maturity against these indicators, enabling us  to measure progress and redirect attention if priorities need to be adjusted.

Sector Maturity and Challenges To assess the gap between current civil nuclear cyber security and our goal, we conducted a  comprehensive gap analysis across the sector. This gathered both quantitative and qualitative  data from businesses, the nuclear supply chain, the NCSC and the ONR to identify the major  challenges and strengths facing the sector currently, and across the next five years.    3.1 Civil Nuclear Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment   In 2020/21 BEIS used the maturity framework referred to in Figure 6 to conduct a Cyber  Maturity Benchmarking Assessment across the civil nuclear sector. Chief Information Security  Officers (CISOs) responsible for cyber security in nuclear sector organisations assessed  themselves across the different criteria, and those results were overlaid by the regulator with  their independent regulatory intelligence. This allowed us to look at areas of perceived strength  or weakness and aggregate this data from individual organisations to build a sector-wide view.  We were also able to compare organisational and regulatory assessments, and look at  consistency across the range of scores for individual outcomes.    The assessment highlighted variation in maturity across domains, with regulated domains  showing greater maturity than those which were unregulated and OT security being  comparatively weaker than IT. The summary report outlined 13 recommendations as set out in  Figure 8.   The Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment provided both a quantitative assessment of  sector maturity which can be used to assess strengths and weaknesses, and a baseline for  sector maturity to measure progress against. This CAF-aligned framework will be used twice  more during the lifetime of this strategy to assess progress, with the second of these iterations  inputting into decision-making for future work.   Figure 8 – A summary of the recommendations from the Civil Nuclear Cyber Maturity  Benchmarking Assessment   RECOMMENDATIONS   1 Focus future cyber improvement initiatives on the areas identified for further development by the Cyber Maturity  Benchmarking Assessment   2 Further strengthen the approach to information sharing on cyber (e.g. threat intelligence, good practices) and  collaboration on cyber security within the sector   3 Continue to support the annual technical cyber exercise programme but also seek to develop a mature cyber  incident response exercise programme   4 Support dutyholders to deliver regular, tailored cyber incident response exercises within their organisations in  order to drive improvements and strengthen the maturity of their cyber incident response and recovery plans     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   18   5  Ensure the cyber security aspects of key sector assessments, documents and strategies that set out the civil  nuclear sector’s security posture accurately reflects the sector’s risk profile and balances cyber security alongside  physical and personnel security   6  Support the development of a more mature and holistic approach to supply chain cyber security. An approach  where assurance activities are expanded, going beyond the regulated Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI) supply  chain and seeks to develop and adopt an effective baseline standard for the wider supply chain   7  Investigate and support the adoption of new, secure information sharing technologies suiting their organisation’s  needs to enable greater sharing of sensitive information securely and confidently across dutyholders and their  supply chain organisations   8 Further develop the cloud security guidance on cloud adoption so it provides more actionable guidance for  dutyholders on how to effectively secure both classified and unclassified information stored in the cloud   9 Learning lessons from the strong safety culture, understand how a strong cyber security culture can be well- embedded within the civil nuclear industry   10 Review whether the security regulations within the civil nuclear sector is still fit-for-purpose in counteracting  current and future cyber risks   11  Develop specialist cyber security training to bridge the knowledge gap between safety and cyber security roles as  well as raising awareness to the cyber risks facing Operational Technology (OT) systems   12 Encourage collaboration (e.g. sharing learning and good practice) with other sectors who are undoubtedly face  similar challenges   13 Support dutyholders to adopt appropriate protective security monitoring and logging solutions for their IT and OT  environments to strengthen their cyber security posture, without impacting upon functional safety.   3.2 Sector Engagement   As well as the benchmarking framework assessment, BEIS conducted a number of workshops  and other engagements with industry, the ONR and the NCSC. The Civil Nuclear CISO  Working Group (CISO WG) – an industry-led cyber collaboration forum for civil nuclear –  provided invaluable input on the biggest upcoming challenges for the strategy to address.    Four key themes on challenges emerged as shown in Figure 9. These included challenges  already identified by the Cyber Maturity Benchmarking Assessment, including supply chain risk  management, the need to embed cyber security into new technologies, and the challenge of  prioritising cyber security investment against other types of nuclear risk mitigation such as  safety, physical security and environmental risk. However, the workshops also identified a  number of additional areas for improvement, including the need for a stronger cyber security  culture across the sector and the challenge of recruiting and retaining skilled and diverse cyber  professionals in often remote locations. Participants in our workshops also repeatedly  emphasised the value of support and engagement from their organisational Executive and  Board in enabling organisations to achieve their cyber security objectives.     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022    19   Figure 9 – A summary of the challenges identified through engagements across the  sector   RISK MANAGEMENT RISK MITIGATION     • Risks are not always managed holistically, risking   security gaps and sub-optimal decisions, especially  between the cyber, physical security and safety  domains.   • Organisational cyber security strategies are not  always clearly articulated, and are often focused on  compliance, rather than risk management or cyber  as an enabler.   • There is a lack of a common shared understanding  of threats and risk appetites. This can lead to  prescriptive regulatory interventions.       • Fast, agile implementation of improvements can be   hampered by the significant scale and complexity of  legacy operational systems.   • The sector is facing significant, novel cyber security  challenges as the technology and cyber threat  landscape rapidly evolves.   • Tackling the challenges of supplier assurance and  new technology is difficult and requires cross-sector  effort.   INCIDENT MANAGEMENT CULTURE, COLLABORATION AND SKILLS     • Cyber incident response within and across   organisations requires more frequent exercising  and executive-level support.   • Monitoring of networks and detection of cyber  incidents is a key area for improvement.      • The specialist nature of the civil nuclear sector and   of cyber security can make recruitment and  retention of diverse and suitably skilled personnel  difficult. The culture can sometimes lack  inclusively.   • Lack of cyber knowledge amongst key personnel  and providers means cyber security is not  mainstreamed across organisations        3.3 NCSC Threat Assessment    Finally, our gap analysis took into account the likely trends and emerging cyber threats over  the lifetime of the strategy. Reflecting the wider UK national picture as set out in the 2021  National Cyber Strategy, the key threats to civil nuclear are likely to be ransomware,  Intellectual Property (IP) theft and an attack via the supply chain, as set out in Figure 10. This  assessment of threat, along with the view from industry CISOs and the quantitative overview of  sector maturity gives us a good picture of the context we should be writing the strategy within.   Figure 10 – Threat Assessment for the civil nuclear sector over the next five years   RANSOMWARE   Ransomware almost certainly represents the most likely disruptive threat to the  UK Civil Nuclear Sector. It’s a realistic possibility that current international efforts  to combat ransomware will lead to an increase in worldwide attacks in the next 12  months, as ransomware actors seek to maximise their profits before anticipated  changes make their operating environment more difficult.    Ransomware will almost certainly continue to be opportunistic based on whether  threat actors can obtain access to victims’ networks, but within that, favoured  target sectors will be chosen based on perceived willingness to pay. Whilst data  extortion has become a prominent tactic, the majority of ransomware attacks look     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   20   highly likely to continue relying on encryption to incentivise victims into paying a  ransom.   IP THEFT  IP theft will likely remain a persistent threat to industry as a new generation of  nuclear technology is emerging. IP on small modular reactors (SMRs) will be  attractive targets as foreign states seek to build their domestic capabilities in low- carbon energy systems.   SUPPLY CHAINS   Supply chains as an attack vector almost certainly represent a growing threat to  the civil nuclear sector. Actors are developing a better understanding of the civil  nuclear industry and its relationship with third parties including managed service  providers (MSPs), software vendors and regulators. It is highly likely supply chains  will continue to grow as a favoured cyber attack vector.     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   21   4. Strategy Themes and Priorities The gap analysis undertaken against our model of good cyber security identified a number of  key areas where the civil nuclear sector should prioritise action over the next five years, and  BEIS, the ONR, the nuclear sector and the NCSC have worked closely together to articulate  our priority objectives (Figure 11):   Figure 11 - A summary of the overarching goal and objectives of the 2021 Civil Nuclear  Cyber Security Strategy   Goal  The UK civil nuclear sector effectively manages and mitigates cyber risk in a   collaborative and mature manner. It is resilient in responding to and  recovering from incidents, and promotes a positive security culture.   RISK  MANAGEMENT   RISK MITIGATION  INCIDENT   MANAGEMENT  CULTURE, SKILLS &  COLLABORATION   Objectives   Sector appropriately  prioritises cyber   security as part of a  holistic risk   management  approach   underpinned by a  common risk   understanding and  outcome-focused   regulation.   The sector and its  supply chain takes  proactive action to   mitigate cyber risks  in the face of   evolving threats,  legacy challenges   and adoption of new  technologies.   The sector  enhances its  resilience by   preparing for, and  responding   collaboratively to  cyber incidents,   minimising impacts  and recovery time   The sector  collaborates to  increase cyber   maturity, develop  cyber skills and   promote an inclusive  and security-minded   culture   Supporting the delivery of these five-year objectives are a prioritised set of activities and  actions. These activities have been developed jointly by government, nuclear industry  organisations, the NCSC and the ONR, and are designed to be owned and delivered across all  partners.    This joint approach builds on the success of the 2017 Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy  and recognises that the cyber maturity of the civil nuclear sector is a shared responsibility that  cannot be delivered by government, or any organisation, alone. The activities identified draw  on the powers and remit of each delivery partner to contribute to the overall achievement of the  objectives, and each is assigned a clear owner to facilitate implementation and accountability.    The strategy is structured so that activities are explicitly linked with and contribute towards the  outline objectives and overall goal (Figure 12). As the objectives are themselves based upon  the sectors areas of relative weakness, this approach ensures we target those actions that will  most impact our overall progress.     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   22   Figure 12 – Structure of the Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   GOAL Long term, high-level goal   OBJECTIVES  Medium term results achievable in the   time period of the strategy   SUB-  OBJECTIVES   Short term  results achieved   by activities   SUPPORTING  ACTIVITIES X X X   CORE  ACTIVITIES   Foundational activities which are either urgent to deliver or fundamental good  cyber security practices   4.1 Risk Management   Our objective: The sector appropriately prioritises cyber security as part of a holistic  risk management approach underpinned by a common risk understanding, and  outcome-focused regulation (Figure 13).   This objective focuses on how cyber risks are considered, prioritised and managed across the  sector, including the policies and risk decisions taken within organisations, and the  requirements and risk appetite set by Government and the regulator. Recognising the need for  a dynamic cyber risk posture, it considers how cyber security is funded compared to other  nuclear security risks and seeks to ensure that decision-makers at all levels are informed by an  appropriate understanding of organisational threats and vulnerabilities.    Over the five years of the strategy, we will deliver the following priority and supporting activities  on risks management:   • Ensure appropriate engagement and accountability at a senior level within organisations across the sector by: explicitly assessing leadership and governance criteria in the ONR regulatory assessments of civil nuclear dutyholders; providing organisational Boards with cyber threat briefings improving Board and Executive Committee cyber awareness and training; and holding senior decision-makers more strongly to account through cross-sector governance.  • Support a holistic risk management approach to cyber security and deliver mature governance structures by: driving strategy delivery and accountability through organisational implementation plans; improving risk management and understanding at corporate group level; risk assessing and assuring all networks as appropriate; and strengthening assurance – both through the creation of internal assurance    Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   23   functions within organisation, and the increased utilisation of external, independent  assurance of policies and plans.   • Maintain a shared understanding of cyber threats and vulnerabilities by: repeating the CAF-aligned dutyholder self-assessment to identify strategic vulnerabilities and weaknesses as they arise; proactively utilising NCSC’s annual sector threat assessment; and deploying threat-informed assurance such as the CyAS framework to identify system-level vulnerabilities. BEIS will also review the Design Basis Threat (DBT) – the threat planning assumptions for the civil nuclear sector – to ensure the cyber threat described is kept current and drives appropriate investment decisions.  • Ensure a continued proportionate and outcome-focused regulatory approach by: reviewing the implementation of the SyAPs; develop a holistic risk assessment maturity model for regulatory assessments; and explore whether the civil nuclear generating fleet should be regulated to maintain a level of electricity provision to the National Grid, in line with other UK electricity generators.

Under this objective we outline how the sector can mitigate the specific risks posed to the IT  and OT environments, including by new technologies and the supply chain.   The activities which will help us achieve this objective of the next five years are:   • Mitigating cyber risks within and across IT and OT domains, by: sharing and improving approaches to software and equipment assurance across the sector, building on the NCSC’s assurance principles and using appropriate tools (including Active Cyber Defence) as they become available; conducting threat-informed assessment activities through frameworks like CyAs; improving asset management; investigating the development of a sector Centre of Excellence to share knowledge and expertise; and continuing to prioritise investment in Research & Development (R&D).  • Ensuring cyber security is embedded into the deployment of new nuclear and digital technologies by: integrating new systems securely onto networks systems; reviewing and better promoting existing Cloud Security guidance; and sharing risk assessments on new technologies. As advanced nuclear technologies continue to develop, we will engage closely with developers of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) on cyber security considerations, and ensure that the ONR’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process, by which the ONR approves new reactor designs, has cyber and information security requirements (including for Sensitive Nuclear Information (SNI)) built in.  • Effective management of supply chain cyber risk by the nuclear sector by: regular mapping of supply chains; sharing of model third party contracts; working jointly with suppliers and trade associations (including the Defence Industry Security Association, DISA and the Nuclear Industry Association, NIA) to support and encourage their cyber security, promoting international guidance on supply chain security being developed by the IAEA, and utilising existing best practice toolkits such as the supply chain assurance tool developed by BEIS.  • Support the nuclear supply chain to take appropriate action to manage their own cyber risk, by: increasing engagement with supply chain industry groups, including provision of cyber threat briefings; and working with trade associations to refresh and promote its guidance for suppliers. Additionally, nuclear organisations will set baseline cyber and information security standards for suppliers; the ONR will benchmark the existing cyber security maturity of holders of SNI; and BEIS will consider the case for regulation of cyber security in the supply chain.

Incident management is an area which we saw a particular increase in maturity during the  period of the last strategy, with government response planning and an annual programme of  sector-wide technical exercising beginning. This progress should be continued and maintained.  However, an area of relative weakness as identified through the Cyber Security Maturity  Assessment was active logging and monitoring of systems to ensure abnormal activity and  trends are identified and mitigated, and network monitoring is therefore a key objective of this  strategy.   In the coming strategy period we will:     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   26   • Strengthen exercising programmes by: delivering exercising targeted at senior decision-makers and undertaking an ambitious live exercise in addition to maintaining the sector-wider annual technical exercising programme. Response guidance for the sector will also be reviewed, monitoring tools deployed where appropriate and the NCSC exercising tools promoted.  • Improve network monitoring, logging and identification of trends by: further integrating ACD and other tools, and creating a Civil Nuclear Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP): a machine-to-machine information sharing platform for threat intelligence.  • Respond and coordinate effectively during cyber incidents by: improving access to secure communications capabilities; ensuring OT specific plans are in place for managing cyber incidents; improving CISO cross-sector engagement and coordination; developing ransomware recovery guidance; and continuing to improve incident coordination between government and the regulator.

With budgetary and personnel resource constraints, this objective is increasingly important for  the Civil Nuclear sector’s cyber security maturity. During the five year life of this strategy we  aim to:   • Collaborate across the sector to tackle common challenges by: increasing  information sharing and resources across common platforms; building upon the  success of the cross-nuclear CISO WG to develop solutions to common challenges;  providing support and resources to new CISOs; creating a lessons learned group on  the NCSC’s Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP); and  collaborating internationally to develop guidance and best practice.  • Improve the skills and experience of nuclear cyber security professionals by:  articulating cyber skills required for non-cyber expert roles; promoting and establish  mentoring and reverse mentoring programmes; and supporting inter-sector and intra- sector secondments, apprenticeships and graduate schemes as well as the i100  scheme. Promote a positive security culture by: building on the Chilcott Report  and other research to track progress towards avoiding group-think and improving  diversity of thought; and setting organisational objectives on promoting a diverse and  inclusive workforce.  • Embedding cyber security training and accountability across organisations by:  adopting basic cyber training across all personnel and supporting training in the  supply chain; developing a cyber Community of Interest (COI) for engineers and  operational technology personnel through a cross-sector training programme;  continuing to review cyber security culture in the ONR’s regulatory assessments; and  promoting the use of the security culture self-assessment tool10 developed by the  Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), the UK’s national  technical authority for physical, personnel and protective security.  10 https://www.cpni.gov.uk/secure-4-assessing-security-culture   https://www.cpni.gov.uk/secure-4-assessing-security-culture   Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022   28   Figure 16 – A summary of the Culture, Collaboration and Skills objective and its priorities  and supporting activities    Objective CULTURE, COLLABORATION AND SKILLS   Sub- Objectives   Collaboration across sector to  tackle shared challenges   Improve skills and experience of  nuclear cyber professionals and   promote a positive security culture   Embed cyber security training and  accountability across   organisations   Priority  Activities   Increase information sharing across  common platforms   Articulate cyber skills required for non- cyber expert roles   Supporting  Activities   Create CISO  resource pack to   facilitate  information- and   best practice- sharing   Maximise use  of CISO WG  network to   tackle  common   challenges  and develop  cross-sector   solutions   Build on Chilcott  Report and other  research to track  progress towards  avoiding group-  think and  promoting a   positive security  culture   Continue and  extend cyber  apprentice   graduates and  i100 scheme   Develop cyber  COI for   engineering  personnel   through cross- sector training   programme   Scrutinise  organisational  cyber security  culture through   regulatory  activities   Collaborate  internationally to   develop guidance  and share practice   Create a  lessons   learned CISP  Group   Promote /  establish   mentoring and  reserve mentoring   programmes   Support  secondments   (cross-sector and  beyond nuclear)   Adopt basic  cyber training   across all sector  personnel   Promote use of  CPNI security   culture  assessment tool   Set organisational objectives to promote  a diverse and inclusive workforce   Drive adoption of cyber security  training within supply chain     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022    29   5. Implementation and Monitoring  To achieve the stated objectives and deliver the activities set out in this strategy, a sector-wide  effort and prioritisation is required. Investment, resource and commitment from senior  leadership is necessary to drive the required business change: we estimate that nuclear sector  organisations would need to dedicate 5-10% of their annual organisational change capacity to  cyber to successfully deliver the strategic outcomes. This change capacity is critical as the  outcomes cannot be achieved by security teams alone but need active support from all areas  of each business. Change capacity will be measured and managed in different ways by  different organisations but may include resourcing and staffing, 'airtime' from leadership and  communications campaigns, and the proportion and prioritisation of technical change requests  and new projects on cyber security improvements as opposed to new business functionality, as  well as other measures.   5.1 Priority and Core Activities   To achieve the ambition we have set out, implementation of the strategy and delivery of the  priority and supporting activities will be monitored and evaluated on an annual basis. 18 priority  activities (outlined in Figure 17) have been identified based on their transformative potential  and high impact, and/or because they require collective and coordinated action across the  sector. These priority actions will be implemented to collectively agreed timelines.

All delivery partners have committed to producing an  individual implementation plan or strategy which demonstrates how they will deliver the  activities which they own or support. Although in some cases supporting activities may not be  relevant to all delivery partners, the following ‘core activities’ are considered either urgent to  deliver, or fundamental good cyber security practice which all nuclear sector organisations  should prioritise for early implementation if not already in place:   • Adopt available Active Cyber Defence (ACD) tools.   • Deploy monitoring tools across all relevant operational technology and information  systems to identify abnormal activity and trends.   • Undertake continuous risk assessment and assurance of all relevant networks.   • Ensure incident response plans are in place for cyber-security attacks on operational  technology and networks, as well as IT networks.   • Develop ransomware recovery guidance and plans to support organisational business  recovery following an incident.   • Ensure all critical cyber and information assets are identified and managed  appropriately.      Figure 18 – A summary of the core activities (‘getting the basics right’) to implement during  the first 3 years of the 2021 strategy       5.2 Implementation and Monitoring   Learning from the 2017 strategy showed that a more directive and demonstratable strategy  methodology was required and so this strategy will take a programmatic approach to its  delivery. This includes a high-level roadmap for the priority and core activities as set out in  Figure 20, which will be supplemented by a range of supporting activities continuing throughout  the strategy’s timeline. All activities will be monitored and evaluated against a series of  indicators and milestones.    Delivery of the strategy will be overseen and monitored by the CSOG, the senior cross-sector  forum looking at strategic issues pertaining to the strategy. CSOG will be supported by a   CORE ACTIVITIES    Adopt or scale- up ACD  solutions   Deploy  monitoring tools  across networks  as appropriate   (OT & IT)   Risk assess and  assure ALL  networks as  appropriate   Ensure OT- specific cyber   incident plans in  place   Develop  ransomware   recovery  guidance   Improve asset  management     Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy 2022    31   dedicated Delivery Oversight Board (DOB), alongside annual reporting requirements which will  assess strategy activity delivery.    In addition, the CAF aligned sector Cyber Security Maturity Assessment will be carried out at  the mid-point and end-point of the strategy to objectively monitor cyber security improvements,  and evaluate whether our programmed activities are having the required impact towards  achieving our overall goal. The strategy activities and priorities will be reassessed and  baselined at the mid-strategy point if required. This may result from changing threat and  context, lessons or vulnerabilities identified from incidents, and/or evaluation of the value the  activities are delivering.   5.3 Roles and Responsibilities for Strategy Delivery   A clear and shared understanding of the roles and responsibilities for implementing the 2022  Civil Nuclear Cyber Security Strategy is crucial for meaningful and timely delivery. Each activity  is owned by a designated delivery partner, as set out in Annex A. Figure 19 articulates the  summary of the roles and responsibilities for each delivery partner.    Figure 19 – A table outlining the roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the  strategy    DELIVERY PARTNER ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES      Industry      Nuclear  Organisations   As owners and operators, industry bear the primary responsibility for managing and  continuously improving their organisation’s cyber and information security  arrangements.

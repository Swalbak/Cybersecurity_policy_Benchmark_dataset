However, due to the dynamic nature of these challenges, conventional strategies have been subjected to extreme stress. A more long-term and international perspective is required in order to stabilise this situation. Austria’s ICT Security Strategy therefore has to define its position within a European context as an important reference for further action. It must also give Austria a stronger voice in the concert of EU Member States in the field of ICT security. Hence, Austria’s firm commitment to the sustainable development of this sector in Europe is absolutely essential. Due to general priorities, the “security poverty line” in the SME sector and private sphere is low. As Austria is a country with a particularly high proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is necessary to focus on the requirements of these sectors. Critical information infrastructures and their protection are core objectives of ICT security strategies. On this basis, it is necessary to implement consolidation measures and plotlines ensuring the calculability of risks. Reactive strategies such as cyber security or cyber defence measures are vital and integral elements. However, they cannot be applied effectively unless complemented by proactive strategy elements on a large scale. The latter are usually characterised by a significantly higher cost/effectiveness factor. This fact poses special challenges to formal and non-formal types of education, preparatory phases of labour market reintegration as well as to the media, especially radio and TV. This mandate must go beyond the scope of current incident reports since not even the most fundamental efforts have been made to realise the potential in this area. Interest representations such as chambers are equally challenged to bundle and intensify their existing activities across sectors. To ensure the calculability of risks in all areas, there must be considerably more cooperation between the economy and security research. Highly visible best practices (“lighthouses”) of competent implementation (e.g. integral security in Austria’s e-government system) have to be established in other areas at transnational level in order to ensure the long-term viability of the Austrian economy. The aim of coordinating cooperation with education and research is to respond to dynamic developments, to identify new trends in due course through technology monitoring and to improve resilience. To increase general ICT risk awareness beyond the level of specific incidents, the public administration will not only have to take ICT security seriously within its own purview but also to implement it in a competent manner. Based on the useful approach embodied in the ICT Consolidation Act, there is a need for action in other areas as well. CIIP Action Plans define a common roadmap and establish a comprehensive and logical sequence of steps to be taken on the basis of ICT exercises. In line with these plans, protection profiles will have to be created for technologies used in critical infrastructures within the framework of international cooperation (e.g. by involving ENISA/CEN/ETSI ). It will also be necessary to arrive at a common understanding of examination/certification and monitoring processes. A start has been made by developing a process-oriented approach. On this basis, it will be possible to formulate an overall strategy, to identify the stakeholders and create an institutional framework for the continuing commitment and cooperation of these players with a view to achieving the goals. Reinhard Posch, Chief Information Officer of the Federal Republic of Austria Introduction 4 Summary The development of modern information and communication technologies (ICT)— and above all the Internet—has led to an unprecedented transformation of social and economic life. In Austria about three quarters of the population currently use the Internet regularly, and one in every two persons does so daily. The economy heavily depends on ICT in order to take advantage of e-commerce and ensure the efficiency of internal procedures. For the public administration ICT is indispensable when it comes to making its services available to a broad public through non-traditional channels. Today the general welfare of the state depends to a considerable extent on the availability and proper functioning of cyberspace. While growth rates in Internet usage, e-commerce and e-government are significant and cyber crime (in particular hacking and phishing offences) is on the rise, the Internet and computer skills of the users have remained virtually unchanged. This has led to dramatic disparities between actual ICT usage, increasing IT crime, necessary IT knowledge and risk awareness. Attacks from cyberspace pose a direct threat to our safety and security and to the functioning of the state, the economy and our society, and may therefore severely affect our daily lives. One of Austria’s top priorities is to tackle cyberspace security using every means available at national and international level. A first step is to define a strategy to ensure cyberspace security. The ICT Security Strategy is a proactive concept designed to protect cyberspace and human beings in this virtual space by taking into account their fundamental rights and freedoms. This strategy will not only improve the security and resilience of Austrian infrastructures and services in cyberspace but also create awareness and trust among Austrian citizens. The strategy addresses a wide range of issues—from different aspects of creating ICT security knowledge and ICT security awareness to proactive and reactive cyber incident management. The spectrum covers education, research, sensitisation, case law, technical and organisational issues of Austrian enterprises as well as the protection of strategically important Austrian institutions. ICT security is regarded as a common key challenge. As far as an implementation strategy is concerned, a bottom-up approach has been chosen—with a broad base involving all relevant stakeholders. Hence, the strategic objectives and measures for implementation of the Austrian concept may be divided into five key areas: • Stakeholders and structures • Critical infrastructures • Risk management and status quo • Education and research • Awareness In order to achieve the Austrian goals, the Action Plan described below will increase the effectiveness of both sector-specific and trans-sectoral measures, which will be implemented by taking into account timelines and responsibilities. 5 Stakeholders and structures • Optimising the cyber landscape in Austria • Establishing networks between stakeholders and structures • Enhancing the legal framework for cyber security in Austria • Promoting international cooperation Critical infrastructures • Improving cyber crisis management • Enhancing risk management and information security • Information exchange between public and private stakeholders Risk management and status quo • Identifying core enterprises in the respective sectors • Comprehensive risk and security management across sectors • Ensuring minimum standards and managing risk acceptance in core enterprises • Establishing crisis and emergency management in ICT and non-ICT sectors • Assessment and management of the situation Education and research • Education/training relating to ICT, ICT security and media skills in early grades at school • Compulsory ICT training for all students of teacher training programmes • Increased training of ICT security specialists in the tertiary sector • ICT security as an important element of adult education and training • ICT security research as a basis for national competence • Increased coverage of ICT security topics in applied ICT research • Active theme leadership in international research programmes Awareness • Strengthening Austria’s ICT security culture • Positive positioning of ICT security • Harmonised and coordinated approach • Effectiveness and sustainability of awareness measures • Public cyber partnership – Cyber Security Steering Group – Cyber Crisis Management – Cyber Security Platform • Cyber Situation Centre Cyber competence Standardisation and certification Uniform terminology and common language Information and communications platform for all fields of action and target groups (Cyber Security Platform) Overview Legal framework International cooperation 6 Stakeholders and structures Initial situation A country’s specific approach to cyber security is linked very closely to its existing stakeholders and structures. The term “cyber security” refers to organisations, institutions or persons with a vested interest in cyber security, or particularly severely affected by it. An insight into the present quality of cyber security in Austria was obtained by examining a total of 200 stakeholders and structures and analysing the 80 currently most important ones. By sectors. Actions related to cyber security in Austria focus on the public sector, notably institutions at federal level and publicly financed institutions. The public administration set up specialised institutions with different responsibilities and target groups in several ministries. These institutions have been optimised for their respective sphere of activity and make a substantial contribution to cyber security in Austria. The Länder (federal provinces), cities and municipalities operate on a smaller scale, and have only very few overarching structures. The private sector usually has good cyber structures at corporate level. The larger the enterprise, the greater the possibilities to take preventive and protective measures. Private-sector cyber security interest representations are only now emerging on a broader basis. There are only very few interest representations exclusively geared towards the needs of the citizens, who must resort to the institutions of the public administration. By areas of activity. Stakeholders and structures acting on a trans-sectoral basis are distributed quite evenly over the following areas of activity: sensitisation, research, prevention, emergency and crisis management. The highly specialised areas of public information services and criminal prosecution fall exclusively within the purview of the ministries responsible. However, education sector takes only very little action in the field of cyber security; there are hardly any stakeholders offering cyber security programmes. However, this would be of vital importance for the qualitative (further) development of human resources familiar with cyber security issues—both in enterprises and public authorities. The education sector has huge a potential for the future. By level of customer orientation. The government and business sectors receive an almost equal level of support as the clients of Austrian stakeholders. It must be emphasised that there are only very few citizens’ interest representations (lacking visibility). Another striking fact is that cyber stakeholders show little customer orientation towards the citizens. Cyberspace is an area in which many Austrian structures and stakeholders are active separately and highly independently. Several trans-sectoral organisations exclusively specialised in cyber security are already playing an important role in Austria, e.g. the well-established CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams). However, processes suitable for the control of cyber incidents are implemented predominantly at local level. Overarching cyber security procedures have not been harmonised or defined in detail. While other areas benefit from institutionalised and process-controlled mechanisms to tackle incidents, cyber incident management in Austria relies predominantly on a personal network of contacts. It is remarkable that two essential elements are either lacking completely or are insufficiently developed in the Austrian structures: • a central Situation Centre for Austria; the responsibilities of such a centre are currently exercised by CERTs; • the sector of public administration affected by cyber security; this includes public stakeholders, their specialised institutions and above all processes of cooperation in the framework of a 7 comprehensive cyber security concept. An overarching structure for cyber security management is largely lacking. While Austria’s cyber security landscape has reached an appropriate degree of maturity in some areas, there is an urgent need to catch up in others. Strategic objectives and measures Objective 1: Optimising the landscape of “cyber security stakeholders and structures” in Austria Hypothesis: At first glance, Austria’s current cyber security landscape appears to be tightly knit and comprehensive. Looking at individual sectors more closely, one can identify smoothly functioning structures and others that function less well. While it might be useful to know about the former, the latter pose a risk to our country. A quality-based and comprehensive approach to cyber security management in Austria may be ensured only by means of a dense network of cyber security stakeholders and structures. Strategic objective: A dense network of cyber security stakeholders and structures in Austria must cover all areas, fields of activity and target groups relating to cyber security and must take into account the short innovation cycles of ICT. In order to implement this objective, it will be necessary to consolidate the strengths of Austria’s present cyber security landscape by ensuring a high level of quality, to eliminate its weaknesses on a long-term basis and to optimise existing structures so as to enhance flexibility. Measures Establishing a public cyber partnership: It is impossible for a single body to cover all aspects of cyber security today. A structure is therefore necessary that will bundle Austria’s cyber security activities, promote cooperation, avoid duplication of effort, take advantage of synergies and facilitate initiatives. Since this is a topic of vital national interest, the state and its institutions have to assume responsibility CERT.at education research CI operators sensitisation interest associations Federal Government ISK Platform Digital Austria FüUZ AbwAmt Länder, cities, municipalities HNa C4 SKKM BK BVT GovCERT CIP Coordination CIIP Coordination NSR Austrian Trust Circle energy financy transport health industry . . .

The cyber partnership comprises: – Public Cyber Crisis Management – a Cyber Security Steering Group – an information exchange centre for cyber security Establishing a Cyber Situation Centre: In order to obtain an overview of the cyber situation, the available information will need to be collected, bundled and evaluated on an ongoing basis. In Austria these tasks are to a large extent carried out by different institutions, in particular CERTs. No centrally managed Cyber Situation Centre has been established to date in Austria. Creating structures for standards, certification and quality assessment: The constant availability of reliable ICT systems and components may be ensured by using components (especially in sectors deemed critical for security) subject to certification (“supply chain security”). Austria plans to establish a certification body for cyber security products and cyber security assessors. A centralised body will therefore be established which will be responsible for coordinating the publication of quality standards for cyber security in Austria and of minimum requirements for conducting reviews of cyber security quality standards. The significant structural measures in Austria are described in greater detail below. Public cyber partnership The cyber partnership must extend to crisis-coordinating, strategic-political and advisory-operational level. A central contact for public cyber security matters will be created by establishing the position of a Chief Cyber Security Officer in Austria, who will act in close cooperation with the Chief Information Officer of the Federal Republic. Public Cyber Crisis Management (crisis-coordinating level) A Cyber Security Crisis Management appropriate for all cyber incidents will be defined for Austria by taking into account existing cyber structures (e.g. CERTs). Cyber Crisis Management will consist of representatives of the state and the critical infrastructures. Rules and procedures will have to be agreed upon to facilitate cooperation between public and private crisis centres. In the event of a cyber incident with potentially harmful local effects, institutions of the relevant ministries or private entities will be responsible for crisis management in cooperation with CERTs. These facilities have to be closely geared to the specific requirements of cyber security threats. To be suitably prepared for such emergencies, crisis management bodies and CERTs conduct joint exercises on a regular basis. Crisis management in the event of cyber incidents affecting various sectors and posing a severe threat to the security of supply in Austria is based on existing crisis and civil protection structures (Krisen- und Katastrophenschutzstrukturen/SKKM). Through complementary cooperation with crisis and civil protection structures correlation of cyber security expertise (serving as Austria’s national cyber crisis management) has to be ensured to tackle any cyber issue. In Austria cyber security 9 Federal Government Cyber Security Platform Public cyber partnership Persons liaising with the National Security Council Cyber security experts Permanent representatives of the federal ministries and Länder Emergency organisations and media Representatives of public administration Representatives of critical infrastructure SKKM + Cyber Crisis Management Cyber Security Steering Group Cyber expertise Gov CERT CERTs Cyber Situation Centre ATCs . . . experts act as the National Cyber Crisis Management. Cyber Crisis Management requires a clearly defined line of responsibility for cyber crisis events. Crisis management plans define how crisis management bodies must deal with the most important cyber threats. They must be jointly prepared for all known cyber incidents. In addition, they must be adapted to the latest threat scenarios on an ongoing basis. Special cyber exercises must be organised in order to test cyber crisis management. Crisis management plans are adopted by the Cyber Security Steering Group. Cyber Security Steering Group (strategic-political level) The strategic-political level is the state’s highest level for evaluating and deliberating on cyber security issues. The Steering Group is set up at this Cyber Partnership level as the federal government’s central advisory body for all matters involving Austria’s cyber security. This advisory body focuses on integrated approaches, strategies, crisis management, inter-governmental cooperation and Austria’s active participation in matters involving cyber security.

Cyber Security Strategy, monitors its implementation and takes corrective action if necessary. Organisational underpinning will be provided by the Board of Liaison Officers (responsible for communication with the National Security Council). The top cyber security experts of public administration and the Chief Cyber Security Officer will be members of this Steering Group. Permanent active involvement of the private sector in Austria’s top-level cyber decision- making group is highly recommended. Information exchange on cyber security (advisory-operational level) The ongoing exchange of information between Austria’s public cyber structures and public administration on the one hand, and representatives of the critical infrastructures, business, the cyber experts and private crisis centres on the other, will be institutionalised by launching the Cyber Security Platform (public-private partnership on cyber security). All important public stakeholders will participate on an equal footing. An integrated approach—taking into account all aspects of the Austrian society relating to cyber security—should be pursued. The fundamental values of the Austrian society in dealing with cyber activities will serve as a basis for all activities on the Cyber Security Platform. The relative fundamental values will be defined in a preamble that must be formally adopted at political level. Within the framework of the Cyber Security Platform, regular meetings ensure an exchange of information among all public sectors as well as between public and private sectors. Representatives of education, research and development have to be involved in this exchange to an increasing extent. Working groups and initiatives will tackle current challenges of cyber security in Austria. A web platform serves as a central point of contact for all issues relating to ICT security and the key information and communication base concerning all awareness-raising measures for all target groups in Austria. A Cyber Competence Centre is to be set up to complement the activities of the Cyber Security Platform. Opportunities for the confidential exchange of information outside the publicly accessible Cyber Security Platform open up new vistas of cooperation in the areas of cyber security, cyber crime, cyber defence and cyber diplomacy.

Unfortunately such digital omnipresence also provides a fertile breeding ground for all kinds of criminal wheeling and dealing. The establishment of networks among all stakeholders and cyber structures is essential in order to react fast after the occurrence of harmful incidents, or to disseminate the lessons learned after overcoming harmful incidents. Only by establishing a tightly knit network of contacts between stakeholders will Austria be able to benefit from robust cyber security structures. Strategic objective: Incentives, support measures and a legal basis must be created to promote densely knit networks between Austrian cyber security stakeholders and structures. The aim is to establish an automated cyber networking procedure so as to promote a comprehensive and self-learning cyber security culture in Austria based on information-exchanging control loops. Measures Promoting existing and new networks between stakeholders and structures in Austria: Fostering networking between stakeholders—within cyber activity areas by means of focused expert meetings; beyond the boundaries of activity areas (sensitisation, education, research and development, security prevention, emergency and crisis management, public information and criminal prosecution) and across sectors (public administration, economy, universities, interest representations, citizens). Exchanges between cyber security stakeholders with representatives of sectors with only indirect or no cyber security responsibility must be Cyber Situation Centre The planned Cyber Situation Centre will be responsible for tackling major cyber incidents in the public administration as well as for special crisis and disaster situations at national level. The services of the Austrian Federal Army (Österreichisches Bundesheer/ÖBH) will round off the activities of the Cyber Situation Centre. In “normal operations”, the Cyber Situation Centre prepares public and non- public analyses on network security in Austria and is responsible for simulations and reporting. Early warning is one major task of the Cyber Situation Centre. The capacity for forensic activities will be created to support enterprises on request. It is therefore necessary to monitor the situation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) to ensure that clients, notably critical infrastructures (also usually operating 24/7) obtain the required information on time. The networks of public administration and critical infrastructures are equipped with sensors in order to gather security- relevant information in real time. Networks without such sensor systems will be obliged to report cyber anomalies (to be defined). The legal framework will need to be analysed and adapted as a first step. Legal provisions have to be adopted defining the responsibilities and powers of Cyber Situation Centres, their reporting duties and requirements concerning data disclosure. Stakeholders playing similar roles are to be involved in the organisation of Cyber Situation Centres. Strategic and organisational decisions must be taken jointly by a Situation Council together with the most important public cyber security stakeholders. The involvement of private stakeholders is highly recommended. The main recipients of services provided by Cyber Situation Centres are various bodies of the public administration and critical infrastructure enterprises. 12 intensified. Existing events, congresses and initiatives devoted to cyber security will continue to be supported and promoted. Examining existing control loops to strengthen cyber security competence: Cyber security strategies must be adapted to both constant and unpredictable changes of technologies, applications and markets. They need to update their cyber security competence on an ongoing basis. The exchange of information at national and international level as well as the establishment of control loops supplying one another with new knowledge and findings will prove useful in this context. Studies will have to be carried out in order to comply with the latter mandate. Moreover, the necessary processes (feedback and learning loops) will also have to be initiated. Objective 3: Enhancing the legal framework for cyber security Hypothesis: It is vital to regulate cyberspace so as to give people a feeling of security and confidence when using integrated digital technologies. All types of digital information and communication technology (ICT) existing in Austria must be taken into account. In Austria the legislator reacted at an early stage to the specificities of ICT by laying down rules in different laws. Legislators have been faced with new national and global challenges due to the ICT penetration throughout the world. To keep abreast with fast-moving technological and social processes on the Internet, adjusted processes have to be created to establish legal certainty reflecting the “state of the art”. Strategic objectives: Austria’s legal framework for cyber security must be adapted to or developed in line with the objectives and requirements of the existing Cyber Security Strategy. The aim is to ensure that legislation keeps abreast of the changes in cyberspace to create legal certainty in Austrian cyberspace. Austria’s position is contributed actively to international working groups of lawmakers. Measures Analysing the status quo of current legal provisions relating to cyber security and filling gap in Austrian legislation: All areas of Austrian cyberspace that need to be regulated by issuing ordinances in Austria will be analysed. Which areas are already covered by which laws? Which ordinances governing the same matters complement one another or exist in parallel? Which areas are currently regulated inadequately or not at all? Contradictory provisions in different laws will be eliminated, while new laws will be drafted for relevant issues not previously covered. The enormous responsibility of operators of critical infrastructures must be taken into account in this context. Establishing a flexible structure for legislators of cyber security: All the options for establishing a new and flexible structure for the legislators of cyber security matters must be analysed. The aim will be to set up and promote a legal structure for cyber security that keeps pace with developments in cyberspace. Participating in the development of an international legal framework for cyber security: Austria must actively participate in the discussion and development of international regulations/recommendations on cyber security by forming alliances with other nations so as to contribute fundamental Austrian values to international legal instruments. Objective 4: Promoting international cooperation Hypothesis: The Internet is a global phenomenon—like the threats posed by the Internet. The international dimension of the cyber threat is growing at an alarming rate. A stringent and consistent strategy with an 13 international focus will be required in order to make a national digital society robust. Global networking is a central element of such a cyber security strategy. Today international organisations make intensive efforts to ensure that the fundamental values of our society (such as the right to privacy or the protection of personal data) are also effectively upheld online. It is only through comprehensive and active participation in international processes that Austria will be able to develop the cyber security expertise required to create the necessary trust and safety in using digitally networked structures. Strategic objective: Participation of the public sector in international organisations regarding the subject “cyber security” will be institutionalised and become mandatory. In addition, the participation of private-sector interest representations in international associations will need to be encouraged by means of publics-sector incentive systems. International findings and recommendations will be taken into account in national processes. Measures Active participation of the public administration in international cyber security developments (OSCE, OSCD, EU, NATO, …) Promoting the participation of the private sector in international cyber security events and developments Establishing bilateral and multilateral networks to counter Internet threats: Cyber security partnerships and networks (e.g. CERT networks), intensive networking in the German-speaking area (Germany, Austria and Switzerland, referred to as “DACH”) and bilateral cyber security relations with all neighbouring countries; participating more actively in international organisations to establish cyber security networks. Joint development of international strategies to protect fundamental transnational rights in the use of digital information and communication: Austria’s fundamental values relating to the use of digital information and communication as well as of digital networks (e.g. free, unlimited Internet access and freedom of expression on the Internet) are advocated and implemented in international forums. Active participation in transnational cyber exercises: Austria will be actively involved in planning the most important international cyber exercises and will also take part in them. The experience gained in such international exercises will be applied directly to national exercises. : 14 Critical infrastructure Initial situation The term “critical infrastructure” or “strategic infrastructure” describes those parts of all public or private infrastructures that are of crucial importance for maintaining vital societal functions. Their disruption or destruction has a major impact on the health, security or economic and social wellbeing of the citizens or the effective functioning of state institutions. Today most critical infrastructures increasingly depend on specialised IT systems which are expected to guarantee services as smoothly, reliably and continuously as possible. The ICT sector itself (and its IT and telecommunications networks with their various components and providers) as well as the ICT-based infrastructures of all other sectors not only permit sectoral production, but also keep the trans-sectoral flow of information going. In more general terms, these are also referred to as critical information infrastructures (CII). The protection of critical information infrastructure (CIIP) is therefore not just a task for the ICT sector alone, but has increasingly become a concern of other economic sectors. One particular characteristic of critical information structures is their susceptibility to different types of cyber attacks. This is reflected in the fact that CIIs themselves can be actively abused as “attack channels” against other critical infrastructures. Unlike failures of electricity or water supply, cyber attacks may cause lasting—“sustainable”— damage, e.g. through the targeted destruction or manipulation of machine control data. In Austria cyber security goals pursued to protect critical information infrastructures must be coordinated with the proven Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (APCIP). An overarching objective therefore correlates with this programme as follows: “The APCIP programme must be complemented by cyber security measures within and between the sectors; national capacities to support information security and cope with national crisis and disaster situations have to be built up.” Strategic objectives and measures Objective 1: Cyber crisis management Hypothesis: Cyber crises and disaster situations may have fatal effects on the state, the economy and public life. At international level it has become an established practice to build up special overarching structures for events of this kind to complement existing crisis management structures. Strategic objectives: To further develop reactive tools for a country-wide disaster and crisis management relevant to cyber security (cyber crisis management) to protect the state, economy and public life from harm. National cyber crisis management is an important element of national security. Measures Establishing a structure for national cyber crisis management: The factors distinguishing national cyber security management (“cyber crisis management”) from conventional public disaster and crisis management are, on the one hand, the special requirements and overlapping areas of cyber security, and on the other constant cooperation with programmes protecting critical infrastructures. Another difference between cyber crisis management and conventional public disaster and crisis management is the degree of networking required at national and international level. Cyber crises at a domestic level may be coped with only with the aid of governmental (public) and non-governmental (private) stakeholders and depend on international cooperation in almost all cases. 15 Establishing a Cyber Situation Centre: see chapter ‘takeholders and structures’. Establishing a viable crisis communication system: Communication with the organisations and companies responsible for operating key networks needs to be strengthened. A functioning and properly secured communication system with public and private stakeholders abroad has to be ensured in acute cases. The establishment of an “emergency network” (e.g. with the aid of DVB-T technology) should be guaranteed at any time. Other options of fail-safe communication (e.g. VHF radio) will also have to be taken into consideration. In a crisis situation, it is also essential to verify the identity of participants. A suitable legal basis is required, especially for passing on information. Objective 2: Risk management and information security Hypothesis: One of the most effective methods of promoting cyber security and facilitating day-to-day operations is to encourage self-protection by proactive risk minimisation at the level of the enterprise or organisation (risk management and information security). Strategic objective: To ensure that risk management and information security methods are applied are as far-reaching and differentiated as possible within the critical infrastructures identified. Services of special general interest require a higher level of protection. Measures Promoting risk management within CI: The establishment of ICT-related risk management (generally also referred to as “information security”) is regarded as one of the most important measures which CI operators can take to protect themselves. In the context of national cyber security it is of fundamental importance that all stakeholders responsible take information security or ICT-related risk management measures in their respective sphere of responsibility. The government supports them by providing information on joint risk analysis, accreditation of different risk management methods, harmonisation of training measures as well as technology assessment analyses. Sanctions and incentives promote the use of risk management methods in the private sector. Establishing a Cyber Competence Centre: The Cyber Competence Centre is part of the Cyber Security Platform and is the central point of contact for all operators of critical infrastructure and also for enterprises interested in risk management/information security management (RM/ISM). It provides information on different RM/ISM approaches and accreditation procedures, e.g. based on the Security Manual 2010 or ISO 27000. Together with the Cyber Situation Centre, quantitative information is processed for specific cyber security risk analysis. Protection of critical infrastructure Protection of critical information infrastructures Cyber security Public crisis and civil protection management Facility protection Special cyber situations Cyber crisis management For further information on Cyber crisis management see chapter ‘Stakeholders and structures’. 16 Objective 3: Information exchange of public and private stakeholders Hypothesis: Information exchange is regarded as the most important element of national cyber security. Since the wide diversity of stakeholders coupled with the growing importance of the private sector make a purely public centralised management impracticable, a continuous exchange of information (particularly threat-related) is necessary to strengthen the self-protection of different stakeholders. The major goal in this context is to ensure consistency with the Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (APCIP). Strategic objectives: The exchange of information takes place between governmental stakeholders, between non-governmental stakeholders and between governmental and non- governmental stakeholders. One of the crucial goals of all programmes protecting critical infrastructures is to support public- private partnerships (PPPs) as a general organisational framework for cooperation between governmental and non- governmental stakeholders. The need for information exchange must be reconciled with confidentiality and data protection requirements. Measures Supporting public-private partnerships (PPPs): To an increasing extent, the protection of critical information infrastructures and cyber security is coordinated by “trusted” public-private partnerships (PPPs). Examples of existing PPPs are CERT.at as a “community-based PPP” and the Austrian Trust Circle, which exchanges information between private bodies. Legal certainty with respect to reporting duty: Operators of critical infrastructures have a special responsibility which must receive due consideration whenever See also chapter ‘Education and research’. Maintaining and updating the Information Security Manual to ensure basic protection: The “Austrian Information Security Manual” (Österreichisches Informationssicherheitshandbuch/SIHA) was revised and reorganised in 2012. The Manual describes and supports procedures for the establishment of comprehensive information security management system in enterprises and the public administration. SIHA 2010 has been tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises implementing ISM measures. Complying with international requirements, its structure and content facilitate the implementation of the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards. The internationally recognised manual makes an important contribution to ensuring a minimum level of protection, and is updated on a regular basis. Conducting technology assessments: Radical technology changes are likely to occur every two to three years in the field of cyber security. It is therefore necessary to monitor present and future technology trends, and to assess their possible impact on the social and economic life. Technology assessment must be tackled within the framework of a research programme which may be linked with existing initiatives (e.g. KIRAS). Voluntary registration system: Like voluntary fire services, ICT specialists may sign up via a registration system (of the Cyber Competence Centre), providing information on their technical skills, identity and certificates and/or quality certification (e.g. security screening pursuant to the Security Police Act [Sicherheitspolizeigesetz/ SPG]). Organisations and enterprises have fast and unbureaucratic access to qualified personnel in an emergency with due regard for legal requirements. 17 Initial situation Today’s digital society has led to a high penetration of ICT in all areas and ICT now plays a major role in traditional sectors such as energy supply, transport and industry. Exclusively ICT-based sectors take advantage of networks of extensive services and infrastructures controlled through ICT components and processes. Links between individual sectors resulting from the interdependence of services and products leads to a chain reaction in security-relevant scenarios. Based on these considerations, risk and situation assessments must cover all sectors, although the sectors of information infrastructures, telecommunications, energy, healthcare, transport, monetary transactions and public administration will need to be examined more closely. Each individual sector has a well-developed risk management system. However, the main risks are identified in areas outside the control of individual enterprises. This suggests that the level of interconnectedness among sectors and beyond organisational units is extremely high and that an overarching risk assessment is required. Due to the strong interdependence of sectors, ICT risks are embedded in the context of upstream or downstream risk situations. It is therefore understandable that a considerable number of risks cannot be managed and tackled by an individual enterprise but only collectively or with the support of the state. It is of vital importance that non-ICT risks and scenarios are covered by up-to- date emergency and crisis management plans. This is an important requirement for avoiding overlapping risks and scenarios in interlinked systems. The issue of risk and security management in individual enterprises is another relevant aspect. It will be necessary to resort to best practices in this area, and to create suitable framework conditions. In many cases, it may even become necessary to define minimum standards for these core regulatory measures are taken. On the one hand, CI face increasing regulatory requirements. For example, it is recommended that if possible all CI operators (particularly those responsible for the protection of critical information infrastructure) be legally obliged to take risk management and information security measures. On the other hand, the private sector itself often addresses questions relating to its duty to report cyber attacks, as in many instances CI operators were prevented from “voluntary reporting” for reasons of data protection. Human Sensor Project: ICT system administrators receive gradual ICT security training and are taught to detect anomalies in their ICT systems and report them to their ICT security officers. The data thus obtained are forwarded to the Cyber Situation Centre and the Cyber Competence Centre, where they are processed to gain a more profound insight into the situation. : Risk management and situation assessment 18 infrastructures, which will also require government regulation. Strategic objectives and measures Objective 1: Identification of core enterprises in the sectors Hypothesis: There are risks that can be managed by individual enterprises, and there are risks that need to be addressed collectively or with the support of the government. Assessments of the residual risks to be accepted by an enterprise or of the economic viability of possible counter- measures must take into account the impact on other sectors. Strategic objective: Core sectors and relevant enterprises must be identified. There is a small number of core infrastructures or core enterprises the disruption of which will have an impact significantly beyond the scope of the individual enterprise. These need to be considered in analyses and taken into account in risk assessments. Objective 2: Comprehensive risk and security management across sectors Hypothesis: ICT risks may not be considered separately due to global interconnectedness. Strategic objective: A comprehensive risk and security management system must cover all risks and address all sectors and core enterprises. Minimum standards defining organisational aspects and processes will have to be defined. Measures Consolidating the risk catalogue together with selected sector representatives at expert level. Defining minimum standards for risk and security management taking into account specificities of the sector and standards as well as processes in the area of risk and incident management. Objective 3: Ensuring minimum standards and managing risk acceptance in core enterprises Hypothesis: Due to growing competition, the risk to be accepted by core enterprises is increasingly determined by financial factors. This could have an impact considerably exceeding the scope of the enterprise involved, especially in the case of core enterprises with major knock-on effects; this must be taken into account in any risk assessment. Minimum standards of risk prevention must be ensured if a major impact on other sectors is likely. All sectors Failure of computing centres leads to computing centres are not supplied with diesel for emergency power breakdown of communication and services Telecommunications sector Loss of communication services Transport sector Disruption of supplies Energy sector Comprehensive electricity failure Example of a failure chain 19 Strategic objective: Risk acceptance in core enterprises is determined at a higher level so as to avoid major harmful effects resulting from a lack of risk prevention for financial considerations. In this context, minimum standards will have to be defined and examined. Other options may be explored so as to achieve the desired risk control effect. Measures Discussing risk acceptance in critical core enterprises at a higher level of responsibility and clarifying which is the most appropriate way of defining minimum standards (in laws, directives, standards, etc.), which institution is in charge of verifying compliance, and the extent to which best practices of a specific sector may be applied. Raise this issue at an EU level in order to address matters relating to the distortion of competition. Objective 4: Establishing a crisis and emergency management system in the respective sectors Hypothesis: Due to the high degree of interconnectedness, ICT risks must be examined and assessed comprehensively with a view to identifying strategies for coping with them. Emergency and crisis plans are necessary in ICT-related and non- ICT areas. Strategic objective: to review public crisis and emergency management processes, to identify risks arising from the increasing ICT dependence of many core processes; to ensure the availability of crisis organisations and processes at public and private level, including contacts in enterprises (e.g. crisis and business contact managers) as well as emergency and contact lists. Measure To check whether the government’s crisis and emergency plans as well as their procedures for updating and testing them are up-to-date; to establish a connection to the Situation Centre; to review crisis organisations and processes at a public and private level, to interconnect them and, if required, create other appropriate crisis organisations and processes. Objective 5: Situation assessment and management Hypothesis: All sectors and/or organisational units are currently assessed and appraised individually. A personal network is responsible for trans-sectoral risk evaluation. A permanent institution must be established in order to handle interlinked structures. Strategic objective: to set up a Situation Centre which will optimise collaboration among sectors. Management responsible for reporting will be informed of incidents and pass this information on to enterprises with critical infrastructures. The Situation Centre must never be a “one-way street”, a reciprocal exchange of information is the only way to ensure that information is made available in a timely, comprehensive and targeted manner. The experience gained will be incorporated into long-term awareness measures. Measure Creating a Cyber Situation Centre with appropriate means of situation monitoring, including necessary and relevant processes, e.g. reporting obligation or information requirements of the individual stakeholders. : Furthermore information on the Cyber Situation Centre see chapter ‘Stakeholders and structures’. 20 Education and research Initial situation Education and research are basic requirements for successful implementation of the National ICT Security Strategy. In this context, attention is drawn to two key issues: training in ICT security and media competence and national ICT security competence in teaching and research. Today the use of ICT may be described as the “4th cultural technique” (besides reading, writing and arithmetic). ICT and, closely associated with it, ICT security, and media competence should therefore be covered in early schooling. ICT (security) skills need to be incorporated into courses and curricula of teaching colleges and universities as well as further education and training programmes. ICT security issues often reflect a lack of know-how of the developers involved. As ICT is an area in which knowledge becomes obsolete very rapidly, continuous further training and qualification programmes are a prerequisite for ICT employee retention and productivity, but are also important for target groups in the private sector, sole proprietorships and small and medium-sized enterprises not involved in the technology sector. The training of ICT security specialists in the tertiary education sector is another area of crucial importance; Austria is able to build on existing high-quality study and training programmes. A successful ICT Security Strategy is also reflected in research. On the one hand, research serves as a basis for training at the highest international level of qualification (“research-driven teaching”). On the other hand, the availability of know-how in a country is a prerequisite for sustaining developments important for national needs and preparing decision-making processes in matters of national interest. It is therefore important to increase the number of security research institutes, to intensify networking, and to ensure that ICT security issues are incorporated into applied ICT research to a greater extent. Austria’s advance to become a knowledge and innovation- based society will be supported by the creation of structures complementing existing comprehensive security research programmes such as KIRAS (an Austrian programme promoting security research) as well as active theme leadership in EU research programmes. This will help establish ICT security as an “export product”. Strategic objectives and measures Objective 1: Education in ICT, ICT security and media competence in early school grades Hypothesis: Attacks on ICT infrastructures through inadequately protected private systems as well as the individual’s loss of privacy may be prevented on a long- term basis only if the citizens have a wider understanding of ICT security and ample skills in using the new media. This understanding needs to be developed at school as early as possible. Strategic objective: ICT and ICT security must be incorporated to a greater extent into school curricula and daily teaching practices from primary school level onwards. It is a medium-term goal that each individual’s familiarity with the use of modern media can be taken for granted— this is not only in the interest of the citizens but also the basis for protecting national infrastructures. Measures Incorporating ICT, ICT security and media competence in curricula to a much greater extent: The use of ICT and new media as well as ICT security have to become an integral part of the curricula of all types of schools. These issues must be covered by a compulsory subject to improve media 21 skills in all areas. As children interact with new media at a very young age, this issue must be suitably addressed even at primary school level. The introduction of ICT- focused curricula in specific types of schools (comparable to today’s sport, music or ICT secondary schools) is recommended. Defining educational standards for ICT and ICT security: A meaningful and adequate level of ICT competence must be ensured across all types of schools. Objective 2: Compulsory ICT training for all teacher training students Hypothesis: Schools will not succeed in teaching a creative, safe and critical approach to ICT and new media unless teachers receive adequate training. Strategic objective: It is an important prerequisite for teaching the relevant skills that ICT (security) competence becomes part of the curricula of teacher training colleges and universities. Adequate in-service training programmes for fully-fledged teachers will ensure that ICT training can be implemented fast, effectively and on a sustainable basis. Measures Compulsory ICT training of all students of teacher training (at all pedagogical colleges and universities): All students undergoing teacher training require ICT training to enable them to use new technologies and media safely in their fields. They will also feel more confident using applications and services relevant to their areas of specialisation (e.g. Mathematica, GeoGebra, Google Earth, location-based applications) in daily teaching practice. Particular attention should be paid to the training of teachers in the ICT sector (ICT teacher training studies) as they will be responsible for teaching the general subject “ICT” as well as for the safe and professional use of ICT. It is therefore of vital importance to develop suitable teacher training programmes, and to address the ICT security issue appropriately in these programmes. In-service training of teaching staff: The sustainable ICT competence of teachers must be ensured in programmes offered by teacher training colleges and universities. Further development of training programmes for adults, especially parents: Special programmes have to be developed for parents within the school system which will help them to become a knowledgeable source of advice for their children and to examine their use of new media and the media skills. Objective 3: Improving training structures for ICT security specialists in the tertiary sector Hypothesis: In an area as sensitive as national security, specialised technical know-how and skills must be available in a country. This can be ensured by offering specific education and training programmes at tertiary level. Strategic objective: Existing study and training programmes— offered as a specialisation of general ICT studies as well as specific ICT security studies—will be further developed on a proactive basis. Networking and cooperation between educational organisations will be promoted (e.g. joint courses or interdisciplinary programmes). 22 Measures National know-how in the area of ICT security: Strengthening and establishing national interdisciplinary competence centres in the area of ICT security as well as general, state-of-the art training in this field. Promoting networking among individual educational organisations: Active cooperation among all educational institutions in Austria is of crucial importance. Curricula must be harmonised to achieve synergies and to use resources economically. Special attention has to be paid to the interface between identification of threats and response to system-specific risks. Consideration of security aspects in ICT training: “Security by design”—as a guiding cross-cutting theme—means that security issues should be taken into account in all areas of ICT training. Objective 4: ICT security as an important element of adult education/further training Hypothesis: Today much of specialised knowledge becomes obsolete very rapidly, particularly in the ICT sector. Continuous further training and qualification programmes are therefore an important prerequisite for employee retention and productivity. ICT users, e.g. in small companies or in the private sector, pose a potential threat to the entire ICT infrastructure (discussed under the heading “bot networks”) if they operate poorly secured systems. They must therefore be sensitised to the problem and receive suitable training. Strategic objective: All sectors of the population need to have a basic knowledge of ICT security: programmes must be developed and interlinked for specific target groups. The key target groups include employees of the IT and ICT sectors for whom continuous further training is essential, sole proprietorships as well as small and medium-sized enterprises not active in the technology sector as well as private persons (e.g. the 65+ generation). Measures ICT security in adult education: To enhance the integration and coordination of existing programmes, many of which are excellent. One of the main goals is to reach out to educationally disadvantaged groups. It is recommended to take advantage of resources (rooms, ICT resources) available in schools and local adult education centres. Company premises and public libraries could be used as teaching venues. Standardised training modules, such as ECDL und ECDL Security, should be promoted. Continuous target-group-specific further training programmes: The continuous further training of employees in the ICT sector—and also in other sectors with a strong focus on technology and innovation—requires a variety of measures, e.g. fostering the development of programmes for specific target groups, enhancing self-directed learning skills (“lifelong learning”) as well as taking ICT security issues into consideration as a cross-cutting theme in non-ICT- specific occupations. Networks among adult education organisations have to be enhanced, while further training programmes in the tertiary sector will be increased in cooperation with business and industry (study programmes and courses for working people, specific company-related training programmes, etc.). 23 Objective 5: ICT security research as a basis of national competence Hypothesis: State-of-the-art competence must be ensured in the sensitive area of ICT security at national level to prepare decision-making processes and consequently to engage in development. Strategic objective: to promote the establishment of security research institutes as well as to strengthen networking among research organisations. Measures National know-how in ICT security research: to strengthen national competence centres active in ICT security research, to establish new ones, to create facilities complementing comprehensive security research programmes such as KIRAS (with a “communication and information” research sector) with a view to optimising resources; to promote a broad approach to security research and foster measures enhancing the national thematic priority of “protection of critical infrastructures”; to establish new research topics (e.g. development of robust applications and systems, improvement of network resilience as well as social and political resilience in the event of ICT-based attacks); to develop “common terms of reference” jointly with standardisation initiatives. Promoting networking between individual research organisations: to make greater use of existing networking instruments, e.g. Security Research Map or KIRAS Innovation Platforms. Coordination and exchange of experience between ICT security research stakeholders to bundle the measures required to implement the findings of security research. Objective 6: Covering ICT security to a greater extent in applied ICT research Hypothesis: ICT security is an integral part of IT products, systems and solutions. Security aspects must therefore also become an integral part of ICT research projects. On the other hand, findings of other scientific disciplines (e.g. biology or psychology) should be taken into account in ICT security research to a greater extent than in the past. Strategic objective: Applied ICT research as well as other research areas should increasingly cover ICT security issues; this will strengthen ties with other scientific disciplines and promote practical application. Measures Security aspects in applied ICT research: to examine, if possible, in all ICT research projects which aspects relevant to ICT security have to be taken into account, e.g. by establishing additional evaluation criteria (similar to gender aspects, aspects of humanities, social and cultural sciences in KIRAS projects or security considerations involving RFCs). Cooperation between political decision-makers and research institutions active in technology assessment may be institutionalised, similarly to TAB in Germany or POST in England. Promoting interdisciplinary approaches in security research and practical implementation: Findings and technologies from other areas (e.g. biology) are applied to ICT security research. To develop creative solutions to security problems, a research line on ICT security should be established in which other research disciplines participate on a mandatory basis. An institution responsible for evaluating and implementing findings of security research projects must be set up. Measures must be taken to improve the implementation of findings from security research in industry as well as in concrete projects. An “incentive system” (based on the model of the “Innovation 24 Cheque”) is to encourage the development of ideas. Objective 7: Active theme leadership in international research programmes Hypothesis: In order to position Austria’s strengths more effectively, Austrian delegates should increasingly address security research issues of national interest in European and international programmes. Strategic objectives: Austria strives for active theme leadership in EU research programmes. Measures Contributing themes considered important by Austria to research programmes: Austria should continue its efforts to contribute security research themes to European and international programmes (SECURITY, ICT, HORIZON 2020) with a view to highlighting the country’s strengths. Austrian programme delegates should be involved in a timely manner as this will increase the likelihood of their being able to successfully contribute security research topics. Accompanying measures Firmer commitment to international standardisation and certification activities: In some selected standardisation areas such as the further development of ISO/ IEC 27001 Austria is playing an active role. However, it should also participate more actively in other ICT security areas, e.g. ISO/IEC JTC1 WG 27 and CEN, the Common Criteria and European standardisation initiatives in the field of security research (Mandate M/487 to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, etc.). Maintaining and updating the Austrian Information Security Manual: The Austrian Information Security Manual supports efforts to ensure a uniform terminology and approach in establishing ICT security— both in public administration and business. Serving as a strategic framework for ICT security in Austria, the Manual is updated on an ongoing basis to meet constantly changing technical requirements and to respond to new developments in international standardisation. : 25 Awareness Initial situation Security studies and situation reports on ICT security illustrate very clearly that human error facilitates or even causes a substantial proportion of all security-related incidents. Though incomprehensible at first glance, many issues can be explained when ICT security is examined more closely. It is based on three key pillars: technology, organisation and the human factor. Human factor: Despite security-related progress and organisational rules which emerged in the industry and as a result of standardisation in the past few years, the human factor is still an important— probably the most important pillar—of ICT security. Ultimately, all technical and organisational security measures taken must be accepted and supported by human beings. After all it is the individual—the ICT user—who should be at the centre of all activities. ICT security culture: A future-oriented ICT security approach must therefore be human-centred and based on strengthening ICT security culture. The ICT security culture will determine the perception, understanding, personal attitude and knowledge necessary for security-conscious action. Despite all technical and organisational security measures available, sensitisation and awareness-raising as well as the knowledge of all target groups are crucial requirements determining the benefits and success of ICT security. Three main goals of awareness-related measures: • to strengthen the perception of ICT security as an important issue, to arouse personal interest in and attract attention to ICT security (sensitisation of the target group), • to create positive personal attitudes and develop an understanding of the need for ICT security (raising awareness at different levels) and • to promote knowledge about security- conscious action and the responsible use of information and ICT through concrete and specific recommendations for action for each target group. Awareness-related measures have to be differentiated on the basis of action fields (such as citizens, economy, administration, education and research, CI) and target groups (in any case users, developers and operators of ICT). Human factor (ICT security culture) Technology Organisation ICT security Pillars of ICT security 26 Strategic objectives and measures Objective 1: Strengthening ICT security culture in Austria Hypothesis: Many ICT users, customers and service providers (in trade, development and at operational level) are not aware of the threats arising in the context of ICT. They often lack the understanding and knowledge required for security-conscious action in cyberspace. Strategic objective: Well-aimed awareness measures in all relevant target groups and fields of action will promote and strengthen ICT security culture in Austria. ICT security culture ensures that the people involved act by giving due consideration to the threat situation in each case. As the third pillar of effective ICT security, ICT security culture ensures that the activities of all persons involved will be security-conscious and commensurate with the threat situation in each case. Objective 2: Positive positioning of ICT security Hypothesis: People often perceive the negative aspects of ICT security, e.g. additional workload, extra costs and restrictions on users, developers and operators. If no information is provided about the extent to which ICT security measures are necessary and/or appropriate, this will produce generally negative attitudes. Emphasis must be placed on positive aspects such as compliance with legal and contractual provisions and requirements, confidentiality, integrity, Awareness measures Aufm erk sa mke it d er IKT-A nw en de r Bere its ch aft zu ha nd eln Aufmerksamkeit der IKT-Auftraggeber und Dienstleister Bereitschaft zu handeln Sensibilisierung und Bewusstseinsbildung von IKT-Anwendern (Endverbraucher) Sensibilisierung und Bewusstseinsbildung von IKT-Auftraggebern und Dienstleistern (Handel, Entwicklung und Betrieb) Sicherheits-hinweiseBetreiber von Online-Verfahren Beratungsprogramme (Stärkung und Ausbau) Awareness-Kampagne (Medien- und PPP-Kampagnen) IKT-Sicherheitsportal (zentrale Webplattform) IKT-Sicherheitsportal (zentrale Webplattform) Awareness-Kampagne (Wirtschaft und öffentl.

Strategic objective: Within the framework of awareness campaigns, accompanying marketing measures ensure the positive positioning of ICT security and the initiatives of the National ICT Security Strategy. In the future the relevant target groups will perceive ICT security as a positive and necessary added value. Objective 3: Harmonised and coordinated approach Hypothesis: There are already some awareness initiatives in Austria. However, the various stakeholders coordinate them only to a limited extent. Various stakeholders have to collaborate in different fields of action in order to implement planned awareness measures within the framework of the National ICT Security Strategy. Strategic objective: The awareness measures planned in the framework of the National ICT Security Strategy are implemented on the basis of an approach developed jointly by the respective stakeholders. This ensures the necessary transparency, optimal use of synergy potential and maximum efficiency of initiatives. Objective 4: Effectiveness and sustainability of awareness-raising measures Hypothesis: Various statistical databases and studies provide sufficient data on the acceptance and use of ICT in Austria. There is, however, only rudimentary information on the present ICT security culture (sensitisation, awareness, knowledge and security-conscious action) as well as security incidents that really occurred (including causes and damage). Strategic objective: To ensure sustainability, Austria will in the future apply a measuring tool to evaluate the effectiveness of awareness measures on a regular basis. Moreover, it will be used to examine the effect of these measures on reducing security incidents. If required, operational measures will be taken to make the necessary readjustments. Measures to achieve strategic objectives The existing concept for achieving the strategic objectives focuses on targeted awareness measures to strengthen ICT security culture in Austria. To advance from sensitisation and awareness building to truly security-conscious action, information and communication should preferably take place when the individual’s attention is high. A multi-tier information and communication concept is therefore required that reaches different target groups in different life situations and uses different media and channels for this purpose. Setting up an ICT security portal: Designed as a web platform, the ICT security portal serves as the central point of contact for all target groups in ICT security issues and as a fundamental basis for information and communication for all awareness measures. The target groups comprise ICT users on the one hand and ICT customers and ICT service providers (trade, development and operations) on the other. Awareness campaigns: Active information and communication is to enhance Austria’s ICT security culture. Taking existing campaigns and initiatives into account, theme and target specific campaigns will be developed, coordinated and implemented together with stakeholders. ICT security is examined from different perspectives, relevant threats are pointed out, possible effects and damages highlighted and appropriate and meaningful security measures recommended. These recommendations have to be appropriate 28 ICT security portal The central web platform for all target groups and describe the benefits of ICT security based on different motivations for individual target groups (personal, economic and legal aspects). Such awareness campaigns include: articles/documentaries in existing formats (to fulfil an educational mandate) as well as information and communication by PP partners in the area of public administration, interest representations and the business sector. The campaigns will be complemented by e-learning programmes. The following themes have been proposed for campaigns: ICT security in private households, data protection for persons affected, data protection for young people, safe online banking, Internet guide for senior citizens, safe use of social media and networks, social media guide for parents, Warning: Internet Fraud!, consumer protection on the Internet, data protection provisions for customers, data protection provisions for service providers, Austrian Trust Circle, IT emergency management in enterprises, ICT security in enterprises, developing and operating safe online procedures, Attention: Industrial Espionage, ICT security compliance (check) in enterprises. Consulting programmes: More profound and customised consultation by PP partners for different target groups, if required: citizens and private consumers, enterprises and start-ups, ICT service providers, organisations in the area of public administration as well as enterprises with critical infrastructure. The existing range of services is to be increased and expanded.

In accordance with different threat potentials, minimum security standards at different levels must be defined, e.g. based on company size and sector. The development of standards will be based on the Information Security Manual and take into account other existing norms, standards, frameworks and manuals. Voluntary security peer review programmes by recognised Austrian universities and research institutions have to be set up and promoted. In evaluating the quality and security of their ICT services and ICT products, Austrian enterprises and organisations may be supported by external quality testing procedures. Such a certificate will allow them to demonstrate (competitive advantage) and prove (tender procedures) to the public (their customers) that their ICT security has been tested and conforms to security standards. The participating (recognised) institutions of the security peer review programmes will be published on the ICT security portal. micro- entrepreneurs mid-sized enterprises small enterprises large enterprises authorities / public administration critical information infrastructures secure web applications (online banking, e-government) Minimum security standards for ICT security and data protection Existing norms, standards and manuals (ISO/IEC 27001 et seq., “Austrian Security Manual”, “IT Security Manual for SMEs”, “IT Security Manual for Employees”, etc. Minimum security standards for ICT security and data protection Awareness campaigns • Articles/documentaries (educational mandate) in existing formats (e.g. Newton, Thema, Konkret das Servicemagazin, ATV report, etc.) – broadcasting (e.g. ORF and ATV channels) as well as print and online media • Information and communication (active reference to the theme ICT security, distribution of brochures and providing information on websites) by – PP partners in the public administration with office hours for the public (police services, Advisory Service of Criminal Police, finance and customs offices, federal army, regional administration, district commissions, schools, municipal offices, etc.) – PP partners in the area of interest representations (WKO, AK, VKI, etc.) – PP partners in the business sector with customer service points (banks, Internet service providers, ICT retail store chains, ICT service providers, etc.) Examples of using existing structures and synergy potential 30 Security instructions: ICT users are highly aware of ICT security issues when registering and using online applications. This is relevant to ICT customers when purchasing ICT products and ICT services, awarding contracts for developing products or services or operating ICT applications or ICT infrastructure. To this end, compliance with security instructions is to become compulsory for operators of online applications and ICT service providers (trade, development and operations). Clearly structured and comprehensive security instructions will be developed, coordinated and made available to operators of online applications as well ICT service providers—in cooperation with interest representations and taking national and European legislation into account. The ultimate goal of the security instructions is to protect ICT users and ICT customers. Accompanying measures ICT Security Encyclopaedia: Finding a common language. As a first step, the ICT Security Encyclopaedia will explain the technical terms used in the context of the ICT Security Strategy. It has to be revised and updated on a regular basis. Developing and implementing a marketing concept: In the framework of a marketing and media concept, the brand and a style guide will be developed to ensure the positive positioning of ICT security, professional presentation as well as the highest possible level of awareness and recognition. Establishing public-private partnerships: Different media and, in particular, different communication channels are required to implement the planned awareness campaigns. Multipliers for the information and communication required will be found by establishing public-private partnerships with other stakeholders in Austria. These stakeholders will be published as PP partners on the ICT security portal. Establishing a coordination structure: An appropriate coordination structure covering all stakeholders involved must be developed so as to ensure a harmonised and coordinated approach (management and control) within the framework of comprehensive awareness measures. Coordination and communication channels have to be established between individual stakeholders, the responsible points of contact as well as implementation plans. Developing and implementing monitoring measures: Monitoring measures must be developed and used regularly with a view to ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of the measures taken. To this end, suitable monitoring measures and responsible stakeholders have to be defined. Existing instruments and structures must be used, and suitable projects should be continued or extended. : Consulting programmes • Advisory services for citizens and private consumers (e.g. by .BK, Advisory Service of Criminal Police, AK, VKI, OCG, etc.) • Consulting of enterprises and start-ups as well as customised consulting and training programmes (including possible certification services) for ICT service providers in the framework of the WKO’s special association for “consultancy and IT” (UBIT) (e.g. by the start-up service of the WKO, .BK, BMWFJ, A-SIT, etc.) • Consulting of organisations in the field of public administration (e.g. by PDÖ, A-SIT) • Specific consulting services on critical infrastructure to enterprises (e.g. by .BK, WKO, BMWFJ, A-SIT, etc.) Examples of using existing structures and synergy potential 31 ATC Austrian Trust Circle, sector-specific network of critical information structures in Austria CERT Computer Emergency Response Team, e.g. GovCERT Austria’s Government Computer Emergency Response Team, SKKM Staatliches Krisen und Katastrophenschutzmanagements / Governmental crisis and civil protection management, mehr_zum_thema/SKKM.aspx OSCE Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, aussenministerium/aussenpolitik/europa/osze. html OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, KIRAS Nationales Programm zur Förderung österreichischer Sicherheitsforschung / National Security Research Promotion Programme , coordinated by BMVIT, TAB Büro für Technikfolgenabschätzung / Office for Technology Assessment in Germany, HORIZON 2020 New Framework Programme for Research and Innovation of the EU, horizon2020.htm ISO International Organisation for Standardisation, IEC International Electrotechnical Commission, CENELEC European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation, CEN European Committee for Standardisation, ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute, SIHA Österreichisches Informationssicherheitshandbuch / Austrian Information Security Manual, downloads/Sicherheitshandbuch%20V3-1-001. pdf CIP Critical Infrastructure Protection, division of the Federal Chancellery and the BM.I ensuring the comprehensive protection of Austria’s strategic infrastructures CIIP Critical Information-Infrastructure Protection, coordination of the strategic information infrastructures of Austria ISK Information Security Commission, division of the Federal Chancellery, National Security Authority in Austria FüUZ Führungsuntertützungszentrum / Joint Mission Support Command, department of the Austrian Federal Army AbwAmt Abwehramt / Military Counter-Intelligence Office, department of the Austrian Federal Army HNa Heeresnachrichtendienst / Army Intelligence Office, department of the Austrian Federal Army BVT Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz und Terrorismusbekämpfung / Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter- Terrorism, department of the BM.I, protects state institutions and their ability to act BK Bundeskriminalamt / Federal Criminal Police Office, department of the BM.I, countrywide combat of penal offences C4 Cyber Crime Competence Centre, department of the BM.I, coordination and reporting centre for cyber crime of the BM.I Abbreviations and glossary 32 Acknowledgements This paper has been prepared by experts within the framework of five working groups.

However, due to the dynamic  nature of these challenges, conventional  strategies have been subjected to extreme  stress. A more long-term and international  perspective is required in order to stabilise  this situation.  Austria’s ICT Security Strategy  therefore has to define its position within a  European context as an important reference  for further action. It must also give Austria  a stronger voice in the concert of EU  Member States in the field of ICT security.  Hence, Austria’s firm commitment to the  sustainable development of this sector in  Europe is absolutely essential.  Due to general priorities, the “security  poverty line” in the SME sector and private  sphere is low. As Austria is a country with  a particularly high proportion of small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is  necessary to focus on the requirements of  these sectors.  Critical information infrastructures  and their protection are core objectives of  ICT security strategies. On this basis, it  is necessary to implement consolidation  measures and plotlines ensuring the  calculability of risks.  Reactive strategies such as cyber  security or cyber defence measures are vital  and integral elements. However, they cannot  be applied effectively unless complemented  by proactive strategy elements on a large  scale. The latter are usually characterised  by a significantly higher cost/effectiveness  factor.  This fact poses special challenges to  formal and non-formal types of education,  preparatory phases of labour market  reintegration as well as to the media,  especially radio and TV. This mandate  must go beyond the scope of current  incident reports since not even the most  fundamental efforts have been made to  realise the potential in this area. Interest  representations such as chambers are   equally challenged to bundle and intensify  their existing activities across sectors.  To ensure the calculability of risks  in all areas, there must be considerably  more cooperation between the economy  and security research. Highly visible best  practices (“lighthouses”) of competent  implementation (e.g. integral security in  Austria’s e-government system) have to be  established in other areas at transnational  level in order to ensure the long-term  viability of the Austrian economy. The aim  of coordinating cooperation with education  and research is to respond to dynamic  developments, to identify new trends in due  course through technology monitoring and  to improve resilience.  To increase general ICT risk awareness  beyond the level of specific incidents, the  public administration will not only have  to take ICT security seriously within its  own purview but also to implement it  in a competent manner. Based on the  useful approach embodied in the ICT  Consolidation Act, there is a need for action  in other areas as well.  CIIP Action Plans define a common  roadmap and establish a comprehensive  and logical sequence of steps to be taken  on the basis of ICT exercises. In line with  these plans, protection profiles will have to  be created for technologies used in critical  infrastructures within the framework  of international cooperation (e.g. by  involving ENISA/CEN/ETSI ...). It will  also be necessary to arrive at a common  understanding of examination/certification  and monitoring processes.  A start has been made by developing a  process-oriented approach. On this basis,  it will be possible to formulate an overall  strategy, to identify the stakeholders and  create an institutional framework for the  continuing commitment and cooperation of  these players with a view to achieving the  goals.  Reinhard Posch,   Chief Information Officer of the Federal  Republic of Austria  Introduction    4  Summary  The development of modern information  and communication technologies (ICT)— and above all the Internet—has led to an  unprecedented transformation of social  and economic life. In Austria about three  quarters of the population currently use  the Internet regularly, and one in every two  persons does so daily. The economy heavily  depends on ICT in order to take advantage  of e-commerce and ensure the efficiency  of internal procedures. For the public  administration ICT is indispensable when  it comes to making its services available  to a broad public through non-traditional  channels.  Today the general welfare of the state  depends to a considerable extent on the  availability and proper functioning of  cyberspace. While growth rates in Internet  usage, e-commerce and e-government are  significant and cyber crime (in particular  hacking and phishing offences) is on the rise,  the Internet and computer skills of the users  have remained virtually unchanged. This has  led to dramatic disparities between actual  ICT usage, increasing IT crime, necessary IT  knowledge and risk awareness.   Attacks from cyberspace pose a direct  threat to our safety and security and to the  functioning of the state, the economy and  our society, and may therefore severely  affect our daily lives. One of Austria’s top  priorities is to tackle cyberspace security  using every means available at national and  international level. A first step is to define a  strategy to ensure cyberspace security.   The ICT Security Strategy is a  proactive concept designed to  protect cyberspace and human  beings in this virtual space  by taking into account their  fundamental rights and freedoms.  This strategy will not only improve  the security and resilience of  Austrian infrastructures and  services in cyberspace but also  create awareness and trust among  Austrian citizens.   The strategy addresses a wide range of  issues—from different aspects of creating  ICT security knowledge and ICT security  awareness to proactive and reactive cyber  incident management. The spectrum  covers education, research, sensitisation,  case law, technical and organisational  issues of Austrian enterprises as well as  the protection of strategically important  Austrian institutions.   ICT security is regarded as a common  key challenge. As far as an implementation  strategy is concerned, a bottom-up  approach has been chosen—with a broad  base involving all relevant stakeholders.  Hence, the strategic objectives and measures  for implementation of the Austrian concept  may be divided into five key areas:   • Stakeholders and structures  • Critical infrastructures  • Risk management and status quo  • Education and research  • Awareness   In order to achieve the Austrian goals, the  Action Plan described below will increase  the effectiveness of both sector-specific  and trans-sectoral measures, which will  be implemented by taking into account  timelines and responsibilities.     5  Stakeholders and structures  • Optimising the cyber landscape in Austria  • Establishing networks between stakeholders and structures   • Enhancing the legal framework for cyber security in Austria  • Promoting international cooperation  Critical infrastructures  • Improving cyber crisis management   • Enhancing risk management and information security  • Information exchange between public and private stakeholders  Risk management and status quo  • Identifying core enterprises in the respective sectors  • Comprehensive risk and security management across sectors  • Ensuring minimum standards and managing risk acceptance in core enterprises  • Establishing crisis and emergency management in ICT and non-ICT sectors  • Assessment and management of the situation  Education and research  • Education/training relating to ICT, ICT security and media skills in early grades at   school  • Compulsory ICT training for all students of teacher training programmes  • Increased training of ICT security specialists in the tertiary sector  • ICT security as an important element of adult education and training  • ICT security research as a basis for national competence  • Increased coverage of ICT security topics in applied ICT research   • Active theme leadership in international research programmes  Awareness   • Strengthening Austria’s ICT security culture   • Positive positioning of ICT security   • Harmonised and coordinated approach  • Effectiveness and sustainability of awareness measures   • Public cyber partnership   – Cyber Security Steering Group  – Cyber Crisis Management  – Cyber Security Platform   • Cyber Situation Centre Cyber   competence  Standardisation and   certification  Uniform terminology and  common language  Information and   communications platform for  all fields of action and target  groups (Cyber Security   Platform)   Overview  Legal   framework  International   cooperation    6  Stakeholders and structures  Initial situation  A country’s specific approach to cyber  security is linked very closely to its existing  stakeholders and structures. The term  “cyber security” refers to organisations,  institutions or persons with a vested interest  in cyber security, or particularly severely  affected by it.   An insight into the present quality of  cyber security in Austria was obtained by  examining a total of 200 stakeholders and  structures and analysing the 80 currently  most important ones.  By sectors. Actions related to cyber  security in Austria focus on the public  sector, notably institutions at federal level  and publicly financed institutions. The  public administration set up specialised  institutions with different responsibilities  and target groups in several ministries.  These institutions have been optimised for  their respective sphere of activity and make  a substantial contribution to cyber security  in Austria.  The Länder (federal provinces), cities  and municipalities operate on a smaller  scale, and have only very few overarching  structures. The private sector usually has  good cyber structures at corporate level.  The larger the enterprise, the greater  the possibilities to take preventive and  protective measures. Private-sector cyber  security interest representations are only  now emerging on a broader basis. There  are only very few interest representations  exclusively geared towards the needs of the  citizens, who must resort to the institutions  of the public administration.   By areas of activity. Stakeholders and  structures acting on a trans-sectoral basis  are distributed quite evenly over the  following areas of activity: sensitisation,  research, prevention, emergency and  crisis management. The highly specialised  areas of public information services and  criminal prosecution fall exclusively within  the purview of the ministries responsible.   However, education sector takes only very  little action in the field of cyber security;  there are hardly any stakeholders offering  cyber security programmes. However,  this would be of vital importance for the  qualitative (further) development of human  resources familiar with cyber security  issues—both in enterprises and public  authorities. The education sector has huge a  potential for the future.   By level of customer orientation. The  government and business sectors receive  an almost equal level of support as the  clients of Austrian stakeholders. It must  be emphasised that there are only very few  citizens’ interest representations (lacking  visibility). Another striking fact is that  cyber stakeholders show little customer  orientation towards the citizens.  Cyberspace is an area in which many  Austrian structures and stakeholders are  active separately and highly independently.  Several trans-sectoral organisations  exclusively specialised in cyber security  are already playing an important role in  Austria, e.g. the well-established CERTs  (Computer Emergency Response Teams).  However, processes suitable for the  control of cyber incidents are implemented  predominantly at local level. Overarching  cyber security procedures have not been  harmonised or defined in detail. While other  areas benefit from institutionalised and  process-controlled mechanisms to tackle  incidents, cyber incident management in  Austria relies predominantly on a personal  network of contacts.  It is remarkable that two essential  elements are either lacking completely or  are insufficiently developed in the Austrian  structures:  • a central Situation Centre for Austria;   the responsibilities of such a centre are  currently exercised by CERTs;   • the sector of public administration  affected by cyber security; this includes  public stakeholders, their specialised  institutions and above all processes of  cooperation in the framework of a     7  comprehensive cyber security concept.  An overarching structure for cyber  security management is largely lacking.  While Austria’s cyber security landscape has  reached an appropriate degree of maturity  in some areas, there is an urgent need to  catch up in others.  Strategic objectives and measures  Objective 1: Optimising the landscape  of “cyber security stakeholders and  structures” in Austria  Hypothesis: At first glance, Austria’s current  cyber security landscape appears to be  tightly knit and comprehensive. Looking  at individual sectors more closely, one can  identify smoothly functioning structures  and others that function less well. While it  might be useful to know about the former,  the latter pose a risk to our country. A  quality-based and comprehensive approach  to cyber security management in Austria  may be ensured only by means of a dense   network of cyber security stakeholders and  structures.   Strategic objective:  A dense network of cyber security  stakeholders and structures in Austria must  cover all areas, fields of activity and target  groups relating to cyber security and must  take into account the short innovation  cycles of ICT. In order to implement this  objective, it will be necessary to consolidate  the strengths of Austria’s present cyber  security landscape by ensuring a high level  of quality, to eliminate its weaknesses on  a long-term basis and to optimise existing  structures so as to enhance flexibility.  Measures  Establishing a public cyber partnership:  It is impossible for a single body to cover  all aspects of cyber security today. A  structure is therefore necessary that will  bundle Austria’s cyber security activities,  promote cooperation, avoid duplication  of effort, take advantage of synergies and  facilitate initiatives. Since this is a topic  of vital national interest, the state and its  institutions have to assume responsibility   CERT.at  education  research CI operators  sensitisation interest  associations  Federal  Government  ISK  Platform Digital  Austria   FüUZ  AbwAmt  Länder, cities,  municipalities  HNa  C4  SKKM  BK BVT  GovCERT  CIP Coordination  CIIP Coordination NSR  Austrian Trust Circle  energy  financy  transport  health  industry  . . .

The cyber  partnership comprises:   – Public Cyber Crisis Management   – a Cyber Security Steering Group   – an information exchange centre for   cyber security   Establishing a Cyber Situation Centre: In  order to obtain an overview of the cyber  situation, the available information will  need to be collected, bundled and evaluated  on an ongoing basis. In Austria these tasks  are to a large extent carried out by different  institutions, in particular CERTs. No  centrally managed Cyber Situation Centre  has been established to date in Austria.  Creating structures for standards,  certification and quality assessment: The  constant availability of reliable ICT systems  and components may be ensured by using  components (especially in sectors deemed  critical for security) subject to certification  (“supply chain security”). Austria plans  to establish a certification body for cyber  security products and cyber security  assessors. A centralised body will therefore  be established which will be responsible  for coordinating the publication of quality  standards for cyber security in Austria and  of minimum requirements for conducting  reviews of cyber security quality standards.   The significant structural measures in  Austria are described in greater detail below.   Public cyber partnership The cyber partnership must extend to  crisis-coordinating, strategic-political  and advisory-operational level. A central  contact for public cyber security matters  will be created by establishing the position  of a Chief Cyber Security Officer in  Austria, who will act in close cooperation  with the Chief Information Officer of the  Federal Republic.  Public Cyber Crisis Management  (crisis-coordinating level) A Cyber Security Crisis Management  appropriate for all cyber incidents will be  defined for Austria by taking into account  existing cyber structures (e.g. CERTs).  Cyber Crisis Management will  consist of representatives of the state  and the critical infrastructures. Rules and  procedures will have to be agreed upon to  facilitate cooperation between public and  private crisis centres.  In the event of a cyber incident  with potentially harmful local effects,  institutions of the relevant ministries or  private entities will be responsible for crisis  management in cooperation with CERTs.  These facilities have to be closely geared  to the specific requirements of cyber  security threats. To be suitably prepared  for such emergencies, crisis management  bodies and CERTs conduct joint exercises  on a regular basis.  Crisis management in the event  of cyber incidents affecting various  sectors and posing a severe threat  to the security of supply in Austria  is based on existing crisis and civil  protection structures (Krisen- und  Katastrophenschutzstrukturen/SKKM).  Through complementary cooperation  with crisis and civil protection structures  correlation of cyber security expertise  (serving as Austria’s national cyber crisis  management) has to be ensured to tackle  any cyber issue.

Cyber Crisis Management requires  a clearly defined line of responsibility for  cyber crisis events. Crisis management  plans define how crisis management  bodies must deal with the most important  cyber threats. They must be jointly  prepared for all known cyber incidents. In  addition, they must be adapted to the latest  threat scenarios on an ongoing basis.  Special cyber exercises must be organised  in order to test cyber crisis management.  Crisis management plans are adopted by  the Cyber Security Steering Group.   Cyber Security Steering Group  (strategic-political level) The strategic-political level is the  state’s highest level for evaluating and  deliberating on cyber security issues.  The Steering Group is set up at this  Cyber Partnership level as the federal  government’s central advisory body for all  matters involving Austria’s cyber security.   This advisory body focuses on  integrated approaches, strategies,  crisis management, inter-governmental  cooperation and Austria’s active  participation in matters involving cyber  security.

Cyber Security Strategy, monitors its  implementation and takes corrective action  if necessary.  Organisational underpinning will be  provided by the Board of Liaison Officers  (responsible for communication with the  National Security Council). The top cyber  security experts of public administration  and the Chief Cyber Security Officer  will be members of this Steering Group.  Permanent active involvement of the private  sector in Austria’s top-level cyber decision- making group is highly recommended.  Information exchange on cyber security  (advisory-operational level) The ongoing exchange of information  between Austria’s public cyber structures  and public administration on the one  hand, and representatives of the critical  infrastructures, business, the cyber experts  and private crisis centres on the other,  will be institutionalised by launching the  Cyber Security Platform (public-private  partnership on cyber security).  All important public stakeholders  will participate on an equal footing. An  integrated approach—taking into account  all aspects of the Austrian society relating  to cyber security—should be pursued. The  fundamental values of the Austrian society  in dealing with cyber activities will serve   as a basis for all activities on the Cyber  Security Platform. The relative fundamental  values will be defined in a preamble that  must be formally adopted at political level.  Within the framework of the Cyber  Security Platform, regular meetings ensure  an exchange of information among all  public sectors as well as between public  and private sectors. Representatives of  education, research and development  have to be involved in this exchange to  an increasing extent. Working groups and  initiatives will tackle current challenges of  cyber security in Austria.   A web platform serves as a central  point of contact for all issues relating  to ICT security and the key information  and communication base concerning all  awareness-raising measures for all target  groups in Austria.   A Cyber Competence Centre is to be  set up to complement the activities of the  Cyber Security Platform.   Opportunities for the confidential  exchange of information outside the  publicly accessible Cyber Security Platform  open up new vistas of cooperation in the  areas of cyber security, cyber crime, cyber  defence and cyber diplomacy.

Unfortunately such  digital omnipresence also provides a fertile  breeding ground for all kinds of criminal  wheeling and dealing. The establishment of  networks among all stakeholders and cyber  structures is essential in order to react fast  after the occurrence of harmful incidents,  or to disseminate the lessons learned after  overcoming harmful incidents. Only by  establishing a tightly knit network of  contacts between stakeholders will Austria  be able to benefit from robust cyber security  structures.   Strategic objective:  Incentives, support measures and a legal  basis must be created to promote densely  knit networks between Austrian cyber  security stakeholders and structures. The  aim is to establish an automated cyber  networking procedure so as to promote  a comprehensive and self-learning cyber  security culture in Austria based on  information-exchanging control loops.  Measures  Promoting existing and new networks  between stakeholders and structures in  Austria: Fostering networking between  stakeholders—within cyber activity areas  by means of focused expert meetings;  beyond the boundaries of activity areas  (sensitisation, education, research and  development, security prevention,  emergency and crisis management,  public information and criminal  prosecution) and across sectors (public  administration, economy, universities,  interest representations, citizens). Exchanges  between cyber security stakeholders with  representatives of sectors with only indirect  or no cyber security responsibility must be   Cyber Situation Centre The planned Cyber Situation Centre will  be responsible for tackling major cyber  incidents in the public administration  as well as for special crisis and disaster  situations at national level. The services of  the Austrian Federal Army (Österreichisches  Bundesheer/ÖBH) will round off the  activities of the Cyber Situation Centre.   In “normal operations”, the Cyber  Situation Centre prepares public and non- public analyses on network security in  Austria and is responsible for simulations  and reporting. Early warning is one major  task of the Cyber Situation Centre. The  capacity for forensic activities will be  created to support enterprises on request.  It is therefore necessary to monitor the  situation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week  (24/7) to ensure that clients, notably critical  infrastructures (also usually operating 24/7)  obtain the required information on time.   The networks of public administration  and critical infrastructures are equipped  with sensors in order to gather security- relevant information in real time. Networks  without such sensor systems will be obliged  to report cyber anomalies (to be defined).   The legal framework will need to be  analysed and adapted as a first step. Legal  provisions have to be adopted defining  the responsibilities and powers of Cyber  Situation Centres, their reporting duties and  requirements concerning data disclosure.   Stakeholders playing similar roles  are to be involved in the organisation of  Cyber Situation Centres. Strategic and  organisational decisions must be taken  jointly by a Situation Council together with  the most important public cyber security  stakeholders. The involvement of private  stakeholders is highly recommended.   The main recipients of services  provided by Cyber Situation Centres are  various bodies of the public administration  and critical infrastructure enterprises.     12  intensified. Existing events, congresses and  initiatives devoted to cyber security will  continue to be supported and promoted.   Examining existing control loops to  strengthen cyber security competence:  Cyber security strategies must be adapted  to both constant and unpredictable  changes of technologies, applications and  markets. They need to update their cyber  security competence on an ongoing basis.  The exchange of information at national  and international level as well as the  establishment of control loops supplying  one another with new knowledge and  findings will prove useful in this context.  Studies will have to be carried out in  order to comply with the latter mandate.  Moreover, the necessary processes (feedback  and learning loops) will also have to be  initiated.   Objective 3: Enhancing the legal  framework for cyber security  Hypothesis: It is vital to regulate cyberspace  so as to give people a feeling of security  and confidence when using integrated  digital technologies. All types of digital  information and communication technology  (ICT) existing in Austria must be taken  into account. In Austria the legislator  reacted at an early stage to the specificities  of ICT by laying down rules in different  laws. Legislators have been faced with new  national and global challenges due to the  ICT penetration throughout the world. To  keep abreast with fast-moving technological  and social processes on the Internet,  adjusted processes have to be created to  establish legal certainty reflecting the “state  of the art”.   Strategic objectives:  Austria’s legal framework for cyber security  must be adapted to or developed in line  with the objectives and requirements of the  existing Cyber Security Strategy. The aim  is to ensure that legislation keeps abreast  of the changes in cyberspace to create   legal certainty in Austrian cyberspace.  Austria’s position is contributed actively to  international working groups of lawmakers.  Measures  Analysing the status quo of current legal  provisions relating to cyber security and  filling gap in Austrian legislation: All areas  of Austrian cyberspace that need to be  regulated by issuing ordinances in Austria  will be analysed. Which areas are already  covered by which laws? Which ordinances  governing the same matters complement one  another or exist in parallel? Which areas  are currently regulated inadequately or not  at all? Contradictory provisions in different  laws will be eliminated, while new laws will  be drafted for relevant issues not previously  covered. The enormous responsibility of  operators of critical infrastructures must be  taken into account in this context.  Establishing a flexible structure for  legislators of cyber security: All the options  for establishing a new and flexible structure  for the legislators of cyber security matters  must be analysed. The aim will be to set  up and promote a legal structure for cyber  security that keeps pace with developments  in cyberspace.  Participating in the development of an  international legal framework for cyber  security: Austria must actively participate  in the discussion and development of  international regulations/recommendations  on cyber security by forming alliances  with other nations so as to contribute  fundamental Austrian values to  international legal instruments.  Objective 4: Promoting international  cooperation  Hypothesis: The Internet is a global  phenomenon—like the threats posed by the  Internet. The international dimension of the  cyber threat is growing at an alarming rate.  A stringent and consistent strategy with an     13  international focus will be required in order  to make a national digital society robust.  Global networking is a central element  of such a cyber security strategy. Today  international organisations make intensive  efforts to ensure that the fundamental values  of our society (such as the right to privacy  or the protection of personal data) are also  effectively upheld online. It is only through  comprehensive and active participation  in international processes that Austria  will be able to develop the cyber security  expertise required to create the necessary  trust and safety in using digitally networked  structures.   Strategic objective:  Participation of the public sector in  international organisations regarding  the subject “cyber security” will be  institutionalised and become mandatory. In  addition, the participation of private-sector  interest representations in international  associations will need to be encouraged by  means of publics-sector incentive systems.  International findings and recommendations  will be taken into account in national  processes.  Measures  Active participation of the public  administration in international cyber  security developments (OSCE, OSCD, EU,  NATO, …)  Promoting the participation of the private  sector in international cyber security events  and developments   Establishing bilateral and multilateral  networks to counter Internet threats: Cyber  security partnerships and networks (e.g.  CERT networks), intensive networking  in the German-speaking area (Germany,  Austria and Switzerland, referred to as  “DACH”) and bilateral cyber security  relations with all neighbouring countries;  participating more actively in international  organisations to establish cyber security  networks.  Joint development of international strategies  to protect fundamental transnational  rights in the use of digital information and  communication: Austria’s fundamental  values relating to the use of digital  information and communication as well  as of digital networks (e.g. free, unlimited  Internet access and freedom of expression  on the Internet) are advocated and  implemented in international forums.   Active participation in transnational  cyber exercises: Austria will be actively  involved in planning the most important  international cyber exercises and will also  take part in them. The experience gained in  such international exercises will be applied  directly to national exercises. :    14  Critical infrastructure  Initial situation  The term “critical infrastructure” or  “strategic infrastructure” describes those  parts of all public or private infrastructures  that are of crucial importance for  maintaining vital societal functions. Their  disruption or destruction has a major  impact on the health, security or economic  and social wellbeing of the citizens or the  effective functioning of state institutions.  Today most critical infrastructures  increasingly depend on specialised IT  systems which are expected to guarantee  services as smoothly, reliably and  continuously as possible. The ICT sector  itself (and its IT and telecommunications  networks with their various components  and providers) as well as the ICT-based  infrastructures of all other sectors not  only permit sectoral production, but also  keep the trans-sectoral flow of information  going. In more general terms, these are  also referred to as critical information  infrastructures (CII). The protection of  critical information infrastructure (CIIP)  is therefore not just a task for the ICT  sector alone, but has increasingly become a  concern of other economic sectors.  One particular characteristic of critical  information structures is their susceptibility  to different types of cyber attacks. This is  reflected in the fact that CIIs themselves  can be actively abused as “attack channels”  against other critical infrastructures. Unlike  failures of electricity or water supply, cyber  attacks may cause lasting—“sustainable”— damage, e.g. through the targeted  destruction or manipulation of machine  control data.  In Austria cyber security goals  pursued to protect critical information  infrastructures must be coordinated with  the proven Austrian Programme for Critical  Infrastructure Protection (APCIP). An  overarching objective therefore correlates  with this programme as follows:  “The APCIP programme must be  complemented by cyber security measures  within and between the sectors; national   capacities to support information security  and cope with national crisis and disaster  situations have to be built up.”  Strategic objectives and measures  Objective 1: Cyber crisis management   Hypothesis: Cyber crises and disaster  situations may have fatal effects on the  state, the economy and public life. At  international level it has become an  established practice to build up special  overarching structures for events of  this kind to complement existing crisis  management structures.  Strategic objectives:  To further develop reactive tools for  a country-wide disaster and crisis  management relevant to cyber security  (cyber crisis management) to protect the  state, economy and public life from harm.  National cyber crisis management is an  important element of national security.  Measures  Establishing a structure for national  cyber crisis management: The factors  distinguishing national cyber security  management (“cyber crisis management”)  from conventional public disaster and  crisis management are, on the one hand,  the special requirements and overlapping  areas of cyber security, and on the other  constant cooperation with programmes  protecting critical infrastructures.  Another difference between cyber crisis  management and conventional public  disaster and crisis management is the  degree of networking required at national  and international level. Cyber crises at a  domestic level may be coped with only  with the aid of governmental (public) and  non-governmental (private) stakeholders  and depend on international cooperation in  almost all cases.     15  Establishing a Cyber Situation Centre: see  chapter ‘takeholders and structures’.   Establishing a viable crisis communication  system: Communication with the  organisations and companies responsible  for operating key networks needs to be  strengthened. A functioning and properly  secured communication system with public  and private stakeholders abroad has to be  ensured in acute cases. The establishment of  an “emergency network” (e.g. with the aid  of DVB-T technology) should be guaranteed  at any time. Other options of fail-safe  communication (e.g. VHF radio) will also  have to be taken into consideration. In a  crisis situation, it is also essential to verify  the identity of participants. A suitable legal  basis is required, especially for passing on  information.   Objective 2: Risk management and  information security  Hypothesis: One of the most effective  methods of promoting cyber security and  facilitating day-to-day operations is to  encourage self-protection by proactive risk  minimisation at the level of the enterprise  or organisation (risk management and  information security).  Strategic objective:  To ensure that risk management and  information security methods are applied  are as far-reaching and differentiated as  possible within the critical infrastructures  identified. Services of special general interest  require a higher level of protection.  Measures  Promoting risk management within CI:  The establishment of ICT-related risk  management (generally also referred to as  “information security”) is regarded as one  of the most important measures which CI  operators can take to protect themselves.  In the context of national cyber security  it is of fundamental importance that all   stakeholders responsible take information  security or ICT-related risk management  measures in their respective sphere of  responsibility. The government supports  them by providing information on joint  risk analysis, accreditation of different risk  management methods, harmonisation of  training measures as well as technology  assessment analyses. Sanctions and  incentives promote the use of risk  management methods in the private sector.  Establishing a Cyber Competence Centre:  The Cyber Competence Centre is part of the  Cyber Security Platform and is the central  point of contact for all operators of critical  infrastructure and also for enterprises  interested in risk management/information  security management (RM/ISM). It  provides information on different RM/ISM  approaches and accreditation procedures,  e.g. based on the Security Manual 2010  or ISO 27000. Together with the Cyber  Situation Centre, quantitative information  is processed for specific cyber security risk  analysis.   Protection  of critical   infrastructure  Protection  of critical   information  infrastructures Cyber  security  Public crisis  and civil protection management  Facility  protection  Special  cyber   situations  Cyber crisis   management  For further information on  Cyber crisis management see  chapter ‘Stakeholders and  structures’.    16  Objective 3: Information exchange of  public and private stakeholders  Hypothesis: Information exchange is  regarded as the most important element  of national cyber security. Since the wide  diversity of stakeholders coupled with  the growing importance of the private  sector make a purely public centralised  management impracticable, a continuous  exchange of information (particularly  threat-related) is necessary to strengthen  the self-protection of different stakeholders.  The major goal in this context is to ensure  consistency with the Austrian Programme  for Critical Infrastructure Protection  (APCIP).   Strategic objectives:  The exchange of information takes place  between governmental stakeholders,  between non-governmental stakeholders  and between governmental and non- governmental stakeholders. One of the  crucial goals of all programmes protecting  critical infrastructures is to support public- private partnerships (PPPs) as a general  organisational framework for cooperation  between governmental and non- governmental stakeholders. The need for  information exchange must be reconciled  with confidentiality and data protection  requirements.   Measures  Supporting public-private partnerships  (PPPs): To an increasing extent, the  protection of critical information  infrastructures and cyber security is  coordinated by “trusted” public-private  partnerships (PPPs). Examples of existing  PPPs are CERT.at as a “community-based  PPP” and the Austrian Trust Circle, which  exchanges information between private  bodies.   Legal certainty with respect to reporting  duty: Operators of critical infrastructures  have a special responsibility which must  receive due consideration whenever   See also chapter ‘Education  and research’.  Maintaining and updating the Information  Security Manual to ensure basic  protection: The “Austrian Information  Security Manual” (Österreichisches  Informationssicherheitshandbuch/SIHA)  was revised and reorganised in 2012. The  Manual describes and supports procedures  for the establishment of comprehensive  information security management system in  enterprises and the public administration.  SIHA 2010 has been tailored to the needs  of small and medium-sized enterprises  implementing ISM measures. Complying  with international requirements, its  structure and content facilitate the  implementation of the ISO/IEC 27000 series  of standards. The internationally recognised  manual makes an important contribution to  ensuring a minimum level of protection, and  is updated on a regular basis.   Conducting technology assessments: Radical  technology changes are likely to occur  every two to three years in the field of cyber  security. It is therefore necessary to monitor  present and future technology trends, and  to assess their possible impact on the social  and economic life. Technology assessment  must be tackled within the framework of a  research programme which may be linked  with existing initiatives (e.g. KIRAS).   Voluntary registration system: Like  voluntary fire services, ICT specialists  may sign up via a registration system (of  the Cyber Competence Centre), providing  information on their technical skills, identity  and certificates and/or quality certification  (e.g. security screening pursuant to the  Security Police Act [Sicherheitspolizeigesetz/ SPG]). Organisations and enterprises have  fast and unbureaucratic access to qualified  personnel in an emergency with due regard  for legal requirements.    17  Initial situation   Today’s digital society has led to a high  penetration of ICT in all areas and ICT  now plays a major role in traditional  sectors such as energy supply, transport and  industry. Exclusively ICT-based sectors take  advantage of networks of extensive services  and infrastructures controlled through ICT  components and processes. Links between  individual sectors resulting from the  interdependence of services and products  leads to a chain reaction in security-relevant  scenarios.   Based on these considerations, risk  and situation assessments must cover all  sectors, although the sectors of information  infrastructures, telecommunications,  energy, healthcare, transport, monetary  transactions and public administration will  need to be examined more closely. Each  individual sector has a well-developed  risk management system. However, the  main risks are identified in areas outside  the control of individual enterprises. This  suggests that the level of interconnectedness  among sectors and beyond organisational  units is extremely high and that an  overarching risk assessment is required.   Due to the strong interdependence  of sectors, ICT risks are embedded in the  context of upstream or downstream risk  situations. It is therefore understandable  that a considerable number of risks cannot  be managed and tackled by an individual  enterprise but only collectively or with the  support of the state.   It is of vital importance that non-ICT  risks and scenarios are covered by up-to- date emergency and crisis management  plans. This is an important requirement for  avoiding overlapping risks and scenarios in  interlinked systems.   The issue of risk and security  management in individual enterprises is  another relevant aspect. It will be necessary  to resort to best practices in this area, and  to create suitable framework conditions. In  many cases, it may even become necessary  to define minimum standards for these core   regulatory measures are taken. On  the one hand, CI face increasing  regulatory requirements. For example,  it is recommended that if possible all CI  operators (particularly those responsible  for the protection of critical information  infrastructure) be legally obliged to take  risk management and information security  measures. On the other hand, the private  sector itself often addresses questions  relating to its duty to report cyber attacks,  as in many instances CI operators were  prevented from “voluntary reporting” for  reasons of data protection.  Human Sensor Project: ICT system  administrators receive gradual ICT security  training and are taught to detect anomalies  in their ICT systems and report them to  their ICT security officers. The data thus  obtained are forwarded to the Cyber  Situation Centre and the Cyber Competence  Centre, where they are processed to gain a  more profound insight into the situation. :  Risk management and   situation assessment    18  infrastructures, which will also require  government regulation.   Strategic objectives and measures  Objective 1: Identification of core  enterprises in the sectors  Hypothesis: There are risks that can be  managed by individual enterprises, and  there are risks that need to be addressed  collectively or with the support of the  government. Assessments of the residual  risks to be accepted by an enterprise or of  the economic viability of possible counter- measures must take into account the impact  on other sectors.   Strategic objective:  Core sectors and relevant enterprises must  be identified. There is a small number of  core infrastructures or core enterprises   the disruption of which will have an  impact significantly beyond the scope of  the individual enterprise. These need to  be considered in analyses and taken into  account in risk assessments.   Objective 2: Comprehensive risk and  security management across sectors  Hypothesis: ICT risks may not be  considered separately due to global  interconnectedness.   Strategic objective:  A comprehensive risk and security  management system must cover all risks  and address all sectors and core enterprises.  Minimum standards defining organisational  aspects and processes will have to be  defined.  Measures  Consolidating the risk catalogue together  with selected sector representatives at expert  level.  Defining minimum standards for risk and  security management taking into account  specificities of the sector and standards as  well as processes in the area of risk and  incident management.   Objective 3: Ensuring minimum standards  and managing risk acceptance in core  enterprises   Hypothesis: Due to growing competition,  the risk to be accepted by core enterprises is  increasingly determined by financial factors.  This could have an impact considerably  exceeding the scope of the enterprise  involved, especially in the case of core  enterprises with major knock-on effects;  this must be taken into account in any  risk assessment. Minimum standards of  risk prevention must be ensured if a major  impact on other sectors is likely.   All sectors Failure of   computing centres  leads to  computing centres are  not supplied with diesel  for emergency power    breakdown of  communication and   services  Telecommunications  sector Loss of   communication services  Transport sector Disruption of supplies  Energy sector Comprehensive  electricity failure  Example of a failure chain    19  Strategic objective:  Risk acceptance in core enterprises is  determined at a higher level so as to avoid  major harmful effects resulting from  a lack of risk prevention for financial  considerations. In this context, minimum  standards will have to be defined and  examined. Other options may be explored  so as to achieve the desired risk control  effect.   Measures  Discussing risk acceptance in critical core  enterprises at a higher level of responsibility  and clarifying which is the most appropriate  way of defining minimum standards (in  laws, directives, standards, etc.), which  institution is in charge of verifying  compliance, and the extent to which best  practices of a specific sector may be applied.  Raise this issue at an EU level in order to  address matters relating to the distortion of  competition.   Objective 4: Establishing a crisis and  emergency management system in the  respective sectors  Hypothesis: Due to the high degree of  interconnectedness, ICT risks must be  examined and assessed comprehensively  with a view to identifying strategies for  coping with them. Emergency and crisis  plans are necessary in ICT-related and non- ICT areas.  Strategic objective:  to review public crisis and emergency  management processes, to identify risks  arising from the increasing ICT dependence  of many core processes; to ensure the  availability of crisis organisations and  processes at public and private level,  including contacts in enterprises (e.g. crisis  and business contact managers) as well as  emergency and contact lists.  Measure  To check whether the government’s crisis  and emergency plans as well as their  procedures for updating and testing them  are up-to-date; to establish a connection  to the Situation Centre; to review crisis  organisations and processes at a public and  private level, to interconnect them and, if  required, create other appropriate crisis  organisations and processes.   Objective 5: Situation assessment and  management  Hypothesis: All sectors and/or  organisational units are currently assessed  and appraised individually. A personal  network is responsible for trans-sectoral risk  evaluation. A permanent institution must  be established in order to handle interlinked  structures.  Strategic objective:  to set up a Situation Centre which will  optimise collaboration among sectors.  Management responsible for reporting  will be informed of incidents and pass this  information on to enterprises with critical  infrastructures. The Situation Centre must  never be a “one-way street”, a reciprocal  exchange of information is the only way to  ensure that information is made available  in a timely, comprehensive and targeted  manner. The experience gained will be  incorporated into long-term awareness  measures.  Measure  Creating a Cyber Situation Centre with  appropriate means of situation monitoring,  including necessary and relevant processes,  e.g. reporting obligation or information  requirements of the individual   stakeholders. :  Furthermore information on  the Cyber Situation Centre  see chapter ‘Stakeholders and  structures’.    20  Education and research  Initial situation  Education and research are basic  requirements for successful implementation  of the National ICT Security Strategy. In  this context, attention is drawn to two key  issues: training in ICT security and media  competence and national ICT security  competence in teaching and research.  Today the use of ICT may be described  as the “4th cultural technique” (besides  reading, writing and arithmetic). ICT and,  closely associated with it, ICT security,  and media competence should therefore be  covered in early schooling. ICT (security)  skills need to be incorporated into courses  and curricula of teaching colleges and  universities as well as further education and  training programmes.   ICT security issues often reflect a lack  of know-how of the developers involved. As  ICT is an area in which knowledge becomes  obsolete very rapidly, continuous further  training and qualification programmes are  a prerequisite for ICT employee retention  and productivity, but are also important  for target groups in the private sector, sole  proprietorships and small and medium-sized  enterprises not involved in the technology  sector. The training of ICT security  specialists in the tertiary education sector is  another area of crucial importance; Austria  is able to build on existing high-quality  study and training programmes.  A successful ICT Security Strategy is also  reflected in research. On the one hand,  research serves as a basis for training at the  highest international level of qualification  (“research-driven teaching”). On the other  hand, the availability of know-how in a  country is a prerequisite for sustaining  developments important for national needs  and preparing decision-making processes in  matters of national interest. It is therefore  important to increase the number of security  research institutes, to intensify networking,  and to ensure that ICT security issues are  incorporated into applied ICT research   to a greater extent. Austria’s advance to  become a knowledge and innovation- based society will be supported by the  creation of structures complementing  existing comprehensive security research  programmes such as KIRAS (an Austrian  programme promoting security research)  as well as active theme leadership in EU  research programmes. This will help  establish ICT security as an “export  product”.   Strategic objectives and measures  Objective 1: Education in ICT, ICT security  and media competence in early school  grades  Hypothesis: Attacks on ICT infrastructures  through inadequately protected private  systems as well as the individual’s loss  of privacy may be prevented on a long- term basis only if the citizens have a  wider understanding of ICT security and  ample skills in using the new media. This  understanding needs to be developed at  school as early as possible.   Strategic objective:  ICT and ICT security must be incorporated  to a greater extent into school curricula and  daily teaching practices from primary school  level onwards. It is a medium-term goal that  each individual’s familiarity with the use of  modern media can be taken for granted— this is not only in the interest of the citizens  but also the basis for protecting national  infrastructures.  Measures  Incorporating ICT, ICT security and media  competence in curricula to a much greater  extent: The use of ICT and new media as  well as ICT security have to become an  integral part of the curricula of all types  of schools. These issues must be covered  by a compulsory subject to improve media     21  skills in all areas. As children interact with  new media at a very young age, this issue  must be suitably addressed even at primary  school level. The introduction of ICT- focused curricula in specific types of schools  (comparable to today’s sport, music or ICT  secondary schools) is recommended.  Defining educational standards for ICT and  ICT security: A meaningful and adequate  level of ICT competence must be ensured  across all types of schools.  Objective 2: Compulsory ICT training for  all teacher training students   Hypothesis: Schools will not succeed  in teaching a creative, safe and critical  approach to ICT and new media unless  teachers receive adequate training.   Strategic objective:  It is an important prerequisite for teaching  the relevant skills that ICT (security)  competence becomes part of the curricula  of teacher training colleges and universities.  Adequate in-service training programmes  for fully-fledged teachers will ensure that  ICT training can be implemented fast,  effectively and on a sustainable basis.   Measures  Compulsory ICT training of all students  of teacher training (at all pedagogical  colleges and universities): All students  undergoing teacher training require  ICT training to enable them to use new  technologies and media safely in their fields.  They will also feel more confident using  applications and services relevant to their  areas of specialisation (e.g. Mathematica,  GeoGebra, Google Earth, location-based  applications) in daily teaching practice.  Particular attention should be paid to  the training of teachers in the ICT sector  (ICT teacher training studies) as they will  be responsible for teaching the general  subject “ICT” as well as for the safe and  professional use of ICT. It is therefore of   vital importance to develop suitable teacher  training programmes, and to address the  ICT security issue appropriately in these  programmes.  In-service training of teaching staff: The  sustainable ICT competence of teachers  must be ensured in programmes offered by  teacher training colleges and universities.  Further development of training  programmes for adults, especially parents:  Special programmes have to be developed  for parents within the school system which  will help them to become a knowledgeable  source of advice for their children and to  examine their use of new media and the  media skills.   Objective 3: Improving training structures  for ICT security specialists in the tertiary  sector  Hypothesis: In an area as sensitive as  national security, specialised technical  know-how and skills must be available in  a country. This can be ensured by offering  specific education and training programmes  at tertiary level.   Strategic objective:  Existing study and training programmes— offered as a specialisation of general ICT  studies as well as specific ICT security  studies—will be further developed  on a proactive basis. Networking  and cooperation between educational  organisations will be promoted (e.g. joint  courses or interdisciplinary programmes).    22  Measures  National know-how in the area of ICT  security: Strengthening and establishing  national interdisciplinary competence  centres in the area of ICT security as well as  general, state-of-the art training in this field.  Promoting networking among individual  educational organisations: Active  cooperation among all educational  institutions in Austria is of crucial  importance. Curricula must be harmonised  to achieve synergies and to use resources  economically. Special attention has to be  paid to the interface between identification  of threats and response to system-specific  risks.  Consideration of security aspects in ICT  training: “Security by design”—as a guiding  cross-cutting theme—means that security  issues should be taken into account in all  areas of ICT training.  Objective 4: ICT security as an important  element of adult education/further  training  Hypothesis: Today much of specialised  knowledge becomes obsolete very rapidly,  particularly in the ICT sector. Continuous  further training and qualification  programmes are therefore an important  prerequisite for employee retention and  productivity. ICT users, e.g. in small  companies or in the private sector, pose  a potential threat to the entire ICT  infrastructure (discussed under the heading  “bot networks”) if they operate poorly  secured systems. They must therefore  be sensitised to the problem and receive  suitable training.   Strategic objective:  All sectors of the population need to  have a basic knowledge of ICT security:  programmes must be developed and  interlinked for specific target groups.  The key target groups include employees   of the IT and ICT sectors for whom  continuous further training is essential,  sole proprietorships as well as small and  medium-sized enterprises not active in the  technology sector as well as private persons  (e.g. the 65+ generation).  Measures  ICT security in adult education: To enhance  the integration and coordination of existing  programmes, many of which are excellent.  One of the main goals is to reach out to  educationally disadvantaged groups. It  is recommended to take advantage of  resources (rooms, ICT resources) available  in schools and local adult education  centres. Company premises and public  libraries could be used as teaching venues.  Standardised training modules, such as  ECDL und ECDL Security, should be  promoted.   Continuous target-group-specific further  training programmes: The continuous  further training of employees in the  ICT sector—and also in other sectors  with a strong focus on technology  and innovation—requires a variety of  measures, e.g. fostering the development  of programmes for specific target groups,  enhancing self-directed learning skills  (“lifelong learning”) as well as taking  ICT security issues into consideration  as a cross-cutting theme in non-ICT- specific occupations. Networks among  adult education organisations have to  be enhanced, while further training  programmes in the tertiary sector will be  increased in cooperation with business and  industry (study programmes and courses for  working people, specific company-related  training programmes, etc.).     23  Objective 5: ICT security research as a  basis of national competence   Hypothesis: State-of-the-art competence  must be ensured in the sensitive area of  ICT security at national level to prepare  decision-making processes and consequently  to engage in development.  Strategic objective:  to promote the establishment of security  research institutes as well as to strengthen  networking among research organisations.  Measures  National know-how in ICT security  research: to strengthen national competence  centres active in ICT security research,  to establish new ones, to create facilities  complementing comprehensive security  research programmes such as KIRAS (with a  “communication and information” research  sector) with a view to optimising resources;  to promote a broad approach to security  research and foster measures enhancing the  national thematic priority of “protection  of critical infrastructures”; to establish new  research topics (e.g. development of robust  applications and systems, improvement  of network resilience as well as social and  political resilience in the event of ICT-based  attacks); to develop “common terms of  reference” jointly with standardisation  initiatives.  Promoting networking between individual  research organisations: to make greater  use of existing networking instruments,  e.g. Security Research Map or KIRAS  Innovation Platforms. Coordination and  exchange of experience between ICT  security research stakeholders to bundle the  measures required to implement the findings  of security research.  Objective 6: Covering ICT security to a  greater extent in applied ICT research  Hypothesis: ICT security is an integral  part of IT products, systems and solutions.  Security aspects must therefore also become  an integral part of ICT research projects. On  the other hand, findings of other scientific  disciplines (e.g. biology or psychology)  should be taken into account in ICT security  research to a greater extent than in the past.   Strategic objective:  Applied ICT research as well as other  research areas should increasingly cover  ICT security issues; this will strengthen ties  with other scientific disciplines and promote  practical application.  Measures  Security aspects in applied ICT research:  to examine, if possible, in all ICT research  projects which aspects relevant to ICT  security have to be taken into account,  e.g. by establishing additional evaluation  criteria (similar to gender aspects, aspects of  humanities, social and cultural sciences in  KIRAS projects or security considerations  involving RFCs). Cooperation between  political decision-makers and research  institutions active in technology assessment  may be institutionalised, similarly to TAB in  Germany or POST in England.   Promoting interdisciplinary approaches  in security research and practical  implementation: Findings and technologies  from other areas (e.g. biology) are applied  to ICT security research. To develop creative  solutions to security problems, a research  line on ICT security should be established in  which other research disciplines participate  on a mandatory basis. An institution  responsible for evaluating and implementing  findings of security research projects must  be set up. Measures must be taken to  improve the implementation of findings  from security research in industry as well as  in concrete projects. An “incentive system”  (based on the model of the “Innovation     24  Cheque”) is to encourage the development  of ideas.  Objective 7: Active theme leadership in  international research programmes  Hypothesis: In order to position Austria’s  strengths more effectively, Austrian  delegates should increasingly address  security research issues of national interest  in European and international programmes.  Strategic objectives:  Austria strives for active theme leadership in  EU research programmes.  Measures  Contributing themes considered important  by Austria to research programmes: Austria  should continue its efforts to contribute  security research themes to European and  international programmes (SECURITY,  ICT, HORIZON 2020) with a view to  highlighting the country’s strengths.  Austrian programme delegates should be  involved in a timely manner as this will  increase the likelihood of their being able  to successfully contribute security research  topics.  Accompanying measures  Firmer commitment to international  standardisation and certification activities:  In some selected standardisation areas  such as the further development of ISO/ IEC 27001 Austria is playing an active  role. However, it should also participate  more actively in other ICT security areas,  e.g. ISO/IEC JTC1 WG 27 and CEN,  the Common Criteria and European  standardisation initiatives in the field of  security research (Mandate M/487 to CEN,  CENELEC and ETSI, etc.).  Maintaining and updating the Austrian  Information Security Manual: The Austrian  Information Security Manual supports   efforts to ensure a uniform terminology and  approach in establishing ICT security— both in public administration and business.  Serving as a strategic framework for  ICT security in Austria, the Manual is  updated on an ongoing basis to meet  constantly changing technical requirements  and to respond to new developments in  international standardisation. :    25  Awareness   Initial situation  Security studies and situation reports on  ICT security illustrate very clearly that  human error facilitates or even causes a  substantial proportion of all security-related  incidents. Though incomprehensible at first  glance, many issues can be explained when  ICT security is examined more closely. It  is based on three key pillars: technology,  organisation and the human factor.  Human factor: Despite security-related  progress and organisational rules which  emerged in the industry and as a result  of standardisation in the past few years,  the human factor is still an important— probably the most important pillar—of  ICT security. Ultimately, all technical and  organisational security measures taken  must be accepted and supported by human  beings. After all it is the individual—the  ICT user—who should be at the centre of  all activities.   ICT security culture: A future-oriented  ICT security approach must therefore be  human-centred and based on strengthening  ICT security culture. The ICT security  culture will determine the perception,  understanding, personal attitude and  knowledge necessary for security-conscious  action.  Despite all technical and organisational  security measures available, sensitisation  and awareness-raising as well as the  knowledge of all target groups are crucial  requirements determining the benefits and  success of ICT security.   Three main goals of awareness-related  measures:   • to strengthen the perception of ICT   security as an important issue, to  arouse personal interest in and attract  attention to ICT security (sensitisation  of the target group),    • to create positive personal attitudes and  develop an understanding of the need  for ICT security (raising awareness at  different levels) and    • to promote knowledge about security- conscious action and the responsible  use of information and ICT through  concrete and specific recommendations  for action for each target group.   Awareness-related measures have to be  differentiated on the basis of action fields  (such as citizens, economy, administration,  education and research, CI) and target  groups (in any case users, developers and  operators of ICT).   Human factor  (ICT security culture) Technology Organisation  ICT security  Pillars of ICT security    26  Strategic objectives and measures  Objective 1: Strengthening ICT security  culture in Austria  Hypothesis: Many ICT users, customers and  service providers (in trade, development and  at operational level) are not aware of the  threats arising in the context of ICT. They  often lack the understanding and knowledge  required for security-conscious action in  cyberspace.  Strategic objective:  Well-aimed awareness measures in all  relevant target groups and fields of action  will promote and strengthen ICT security  culture in Austria. ICT security culture  ensures that the people involved act by  giving due consideration to the threat   situation in each case. As the third pillar of  effective ICT security, ICT security culture  ensures that the activities of all persons  involved will be security-conscious and  commensurate with the threat situation in  each case.  Objective 2: Positive positioning of ICT  security  Hypothesis: People often perceive the  negative aspects of ICT security, e.g.  additional workload, extra costs and  restrictions on users, developers and  operators. If no information is provided  about the extent to which ICT security  measures are necessary and/or appropriate,  this will produce generally negative  attitudes. Emphasis must be placed on  positive aspects such as compliance with  legal and contractual provisions and  requirements, confidentiality, integrity,   Awareness measures  Aufm erk  sa mke  it d er   IKT-A nw  en de  r  Bere its  ch aft   zu  ha  nd eln  Aufmerksamkeit der IKT-Auftraggeber und Dienstleister  Bereitschaft zu handeln  Sensibilisierung und Bewusstseinsbildung  von IKT-Anwendern (Endverbraucher) Sensibilisierung und Bewusstseinsbildung  von IKT-Auftraggebern und Dienstleistern   (Handel, Entwicklung und Betrieb)  Sicherheits-hinweiseBetreiber von Online-Verfahren  Beratungsprogramme (Stärkung und Ausbau)  Awareness-Kampagne  (Medien- und PPP-Kampagnen)  IKT-Sicherheitsportal  (zentrale Webplattform) IKT-Sicherheitsportal  (zentrale Webplattform)  Awareness-Kampagne  (Wirtschaft und öffentl.

Strategic objective:  Within the framework of awareness  campaigns, accompanying marketing  measures ensure the positive positioning  of ICT security and the initiatives of the  National ICT Security Strategy. In the future  the relevant target groups will perceive ICT  security as a positive and necessary added  value.  Objective 3: Harmonised and coordinated  approach  Hypothesis: There are already some  awareness initiatives in Austria. However,  the various stakeholders coordinate  them only to a limited extent. Various  stakeholders have to collaborate in different  fields of action in order to implement  planned awareness measures within the  framework of the National ICT Security  Strategy.   Strategic objective:  The awareness measures planned in the  framework of the National ICT Security  Strategy are implemented on the basis  of an approach developed jointly by the  respective stakeholders. This ensures the  necessary transparency, optimal use of  synergy potential and maximum efficiency  of initiatives.  Objective 4: Effectiveness and  sustainability of awareness-raising  measures  Hypothesis: Various statistical databases  and studies provide sufficient data on the  acceptance and use of ICT in Austria. There  is, however, only rudimentary information  on the present ICT security culture  (sensitisation, awareness, knowledge and  security-conscious action) as well as security  incidents that really occurred (including  causes and damage).  Strategic objective:  To ensure sustainability, Austria will in the  future apply a measuring tool to evaluate  the effectiveness of awareness measures on  a regular basis. Moreover, it will be used  to examine the effect of these measures on  reducing security incidents. If required,  operational measures will be taken to make  the necessary readjustments.  Measures to achieve strategic objectives  The existing concept for achieving the  strategic objectives focuses on targeted  awareness measures to strengthen ICT  security culture in Austria. To advance from  sensitisation and awareness building to truly  security-conscious action, information and  communication should preferably take place  when the individual’s attention is high. A  multi-tier information and communication  concept is therefore required that reaches  different target groups in different life  situations and uses different media and  channels for this purpose.  Setting up an ICT security portal: Designed  as a web platform, the ICT security portal  serves as the central point of contact for all  target groups in ICT security issues and as  a fundamental basis for information and  communication for all awareness measures.  The target groups comprise ICT users on  the one hand and ICT customers and ICT  service providers (trade, development and  operations) on the other.   Awareness campaigns: Active information  and communication is to enhance Austria’s  ICT security culture. Taking existing  campaigns and initiatives into account,  theme and target specific campaigns  will be developed, coordinated and  implemented together with stakeholders.  ICT security is examined from different  perspectives, relevant threats are pointed  out, possible effects and damages  highlighted and appropriate and meaningful  security measures recommended. These  recommendations have to be appropriate     28  ICT security portal   The central web platform for  all target groups  and describe the benefits of ICT security  based on different motivations for individual  target groups (personal, economic and  legal aspects). Such awareness campaigns  include: articles/documentaries in existing  formats (to fulfil an educational mandate)  as well as information and communication  by PP partners in the area of public  administration, interest representations  and the business sector. The campaigns  will be complemented by e-learning  programmes. The following themes have  been proposed for campaigns: ICT security  in private households, data protection  for persons affected, data protection for  young people, safe online banking, Internet  guide for senior citizens, safe use of social  media and networks, social media guide  for parents, Warning: Internet Fraud!,  consumer protection on the Internet, data  protection provisions for customers, data   protection provisions for service providers,  Austrian Trust Circle, IT emergency  management in enterprises, ICT security in  enterprises, developing and operating safe  online procedures, Attention: Industrial  Espionage, ICT security compliance (check)  in enterprises.  Consulting programmes: More profound  and customised consultation by PP partners  for different target groups, if required:  citizens and private consumers, enterprises  and start-ups, ICT service providers,  organisations in the area of public  administration as well as enterprises with  critical infrastructure. The existing range of  services is to be increased and expanded.

In accordance with different threat  potentials, minimum security standards  at different levels must be defined, e.g.  based on company size and sector. The  development of standards will be based  on the Information Security Manual and  take into account other existing norms,  standards, frameworks and manuals.  Voluntary security peer review programmes   by recognised Austrian universities and  research institutions have to be set up  and promoted. In evaluating the quality  and security of their ICT services and  ICT products, Austrian enterprises and  organisations may be supported by external  quality testing procedures. Such a certificate  will allow them to demonstrate (competitive  advantage) and prove (tender procedures)  to the public (their customers) that their  ICT security has been tested and conforms  to security standards. The participating  (recognised) institutions of the security peer  review programmes will be published on the  ICT security portal.   micro- entrepreneurs  mid-sized  enterprises  small  enterprises  large  enterprises  authorities / public   administration  critical  information   infrastructures  secure web  applications  (online banking,  e-government)  Minimum security standards  for   ICT security and data protection  Existing norms, standards and manuals  (ISO/IEC 27001 et seq., “Austrian Security Manual”,  “IT Security Manual for SMEs”, “IT Security Manual for Employees”, etc. Minimum security standards   for ICT security and data  protection  Awareness campaigns  • Articles/documentaries (educational mandate) in existing formats (e.g. Newton,   Thema, Konkret das Servicemagazin, ATV report, etc.)   – broadcasting (e.g. ORF and ATV channels) as well as print and online media   • Information and communication (active reference to the theme ICT security,  distribution of brochures and providing information on websites) by    – PP partners in the public administration with office hours for the public (police  services, Advisory Service of Criminal Police, finance and customs offices,  federal army, regional administration, district commissions, schools, municipal  offices, etc.)   – PP partners in the area of interest representations (WKO, AK, VKI, etc.)  – PP partners in the business sector with customer service points (banks, Internet   service providers, ICT retail store chains, ICT service providers, etc.)  Examples of using existing  structures and synergy  potential    30  Security instructions: ICT users are  highly aware of ICT security issues when  registering and using online applications.  This is relevant to ICT customers when  purchasing ICT products and ICT services,  awarding contracts for developing  products or services or operating ICT  applications or ICT infrastructure.  To this end, compliance with security  instructions is to become compulsory for  operators of online applications and ICT  service providers (trade, development  and operations). Clearly structured and  comprehensive security instructions will be  developed, coordinated and made available  to operators of online applications as well  ICT service providers—in cooperation with  interest representations and taking national  and European legislation into account. The  ultimate goal of the security instructions is  to protect ICT users and ICT customers.   Accompanying measures  ICT Security Encyclopaedia: Finding a  common language. As a first step, the ICT  Security Encyclopaedia will explain the  technical terms used in the context of the  ICT Security Strategy. It has to be revised  and updated on a regular basis.   Developing and implementing a marketing  concept: In the framework of a marketing  and media concept, the brand and a  style guide will be developed to ensure  the positive positioning of ICT security,  professional presentation as well as the   highest possible level of awareness and  recognition.  Establishing public-private partnerships:  Different media and, in particular, different  communication channels are required  to implement the planned awareness  campaigns. Multipliers for the information  and communication required will be found  by establishing public-private partnerships  with other stakeholders in Austria. These  stakeholders will be published as PP  partners on the ICT security portal.   Establishing a coordination structure:  An appropriate coordination structure  covering all stakeholders involved must be  developed so as to ensure a harmonised  and coordinated approach (management  and control) within the framework of  comprehensive awareness measures.  Coordination and communication channels  have to be established between individual  stakeholders, the responsible points of  contact as well as implementation plans.  Developing and implementing monitoring  measures: Monitoring measures must be  developed and used regularly with a view to  ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability  of the measures taken. To this end, suitable  monitoring measures and responsible  stakeholders have to be defined. Existing  instruments and structures must be used,  and suitable projects should be continued or  extended. :  Consulting programmes  • Advisory services for citizens and private consumers (e.g. by .BK, Advisory Service of   Criminal Police, AK, VKI, OCG, etc.)  • Consulting of enterprises and start-ups as well as customised consulting and training   programmes (including possible certification services) for ICT service providers in the  framework of the WKO’s special association for “consultancy and IT” (UBIT) (e.g. by  the start-up service of the WKO, .BK, BMWFJ, A-SIT, etc.)   • Consulting of organisations in the field of public administration (e.g. by PDÖ, A-SIT)  • Specific consulting services on critical infrastructure to enterprises (e.g. by .BK, WKO,   BMWFJ, A-SIT, etc.)  Examples of using existing  structures and synergy  potential    31  ATC   Austrian Trust Circle, sector-specific network of  critical information structures in Austria   CERT   Computer Emergency Response Team, e.g.   http://www.cert.at/   GovCERT   Austria’s Government Computer Emergency  Response Team,   http://www.govcert.gv.at/   SKKM   Staatliches Krisen und  Katastrophenschutzmanagements / Governmental  crisis and civil protection management,   http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_Zivilschutz/ mehr_zum_thema/SKKM.aspx   OSCE   Organisation for Security and Cooperation  in Europe, http://www.bmeia.gv.at/ aussenministerium/aussenpolitik/europa/osze. html   OECD   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development, http://www.oecd.org/home/   KIRAS   Nationales Programm zur Förderung  österreichischer Sicherheitsforschung / National  Security Research Promotion Programme ,  coordinated by BMVIT, http://www.kiras.at/   TAB Büro für Technikfolgenabschätzung / Office for  Technology Assessment in Germany,   http://www.tab-beim-bundestag.de/de/index.html   HORIZON 2020   New Framework Programme for Research and  Innovation of the EU,   http://forschungsrahmenprogramm.de/ horizon2020.htm   ISO   International Organisation for Standardisation,  http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm   IEC   International Electrotechnical Commission,  http://www.iec.ch/   CENELEC   European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation,   http://www.cenelec.eu/   CEN   European Committee for Standardisation,   http://www.cen.eu/   ETSI   European Telecommunications Standards  Institute, http://www.etsi.org/   SIHA   Österreichisches  Informationssicherheitshandbuch / Austrian  Information Security Manual,   https://www.sicherheitshandbuch.gv.at/ downloads/Sicherheitshandbuch%20V3-1-001. pdf   CIP   Critical Infrastructure Protection, division of the  Federal Chancellery and the BM.I ensuring the  comprehensive protection of Austria’s strategic  infrastructures  CIIP   Critical Information-Infrastructure Protection,  coordination of the strategic information  infrastructures of Austria  ISK   Information Security Commission, division of the  Federal Chancellery, National Security Authority  in Austria  FüUZ   Führungsuntertützungszentrum / Joint Mission  Support Command, department of the Austrian  Federal Army  AbwAmt   Abwehramt / Military Counter-Intelligence  Office, department of the Austrian Federal Army  HNa   Heeresnachrichtendienst / Army Intelligence  Office, department of the Austrian Federal Army  BVT   Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz und  Terrorismusbekämpfung / Federal Office for  the Protection of the Constitution and Counter- Terrorism, department of the BM.I, protects state  institutions and their ability to act  BK   Bundeskriminalamt / Federal Criminal Police  Office, department of the BM.I, countrywide  combat of penal offences   http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BK/   C4   Cyber Crime Competence Centre, department of  the BM.I, coordination and reporting centre for  cyber crime of the BM.I   Abbreviations and glossary    32  Acknowledgements This paper has been prepared by experts within the framework of five working groups.

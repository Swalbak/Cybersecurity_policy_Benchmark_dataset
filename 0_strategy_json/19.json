With over 240 activities, underpinned by 86 strategic objectives to achieve four main goals, these planned strategies and activities is the collective work of the senior management team from the MICTTD Divisions and SOEs that covers the four years from 2021 to 2024. The plan was designed to align with the Kiribati Vision for 20 years (KV20), the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP), and Te Motinnano (Government Manifesto), to guide these activities, but most importantly to bring changes and the needed development to meet the growing demand of the Kiribati people. The vision and mission of this plan recognises the importance of an enhanced productivity and sustainable connectivity. In order for our people and Kiribati to prosper and grow economically, we must therefore enhance all services to become efficient and effective, our human resources to be productive, and to develop infrastructure to boost economic growth. This strategic plan focuses our effort on these four main goals: • Develop and strengthen sustainable Tourism development; • Strengthen air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures; • Improve access to Communication technologies and access to quality information and services; and • To strengthen supporting services from the Ministry and SOEs. Our objectives recognise our roles and expertise, however there are always challenges along the path to development. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions which has caused many activities from last year to be delayed, or the lack of infrastructure that remain to be the problem, are just a few from them. We should embrace these challenges, stay connected, learn from the lessons, and continue to strive forward to grow. This Strategic Plan sets the compass for every activity that could deliver our goals. I urge the commitment of all staff of the MICTTD and SOEs to participate in the implementation of this plan, and our development partners to continue their support, because through everybody’s cooperation, action and determination, I am confident that we will achieve these targets and goals.

Implementation Plan for Strategic Actions  28 1 1. Executive Summary This medium-term Strategic Plan sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOEs over the next four years. It identifies a Vision, Mission, Goals, and Guiding Principles, and Strategic Objectives that the Ministry with its SOEs envisage to achieve in the medium term. The MICTTD aims to achieve its targets set in this plan but also intends to take into account lessons learnt, to find more efficient ways to address challenges identified in the last MSP monitored progress for 2020. It is able to do this by understanding these key challenges faced by MICTTD and its SOEs. This plan identifies strategic actions and indicators that could be used to measure each activity progress. It also signals the need for a stronger multi-sector coordination in order to effectively implement the Strategic Plan and the need to build the right infrastructure to accommodate these development activities. The MICTTD recognises that the major hurdle in carrying out some of the major activities have been the lack or the absence of proper infrastructure. Infrastructure projects are main targets for the MICTTD in this plan, it aims to provide the basic foundation of development through improving connectivity, and so the focus is in these capital investment projects, or the key drivers for development. MICTTD believes that without these infrastructure and capital investments put in place, and without proper mitigation of risks, it will be difficult to achieve the needed development that will meet the growing population demand and for our future generations. The sections of the Strategic Plan outlines its scope, the strategic context, key challenges and achievements from the last MSP, and overviews of the Divisions and SOEs under the Ministry portfolio. It summarises the population need for better access to sustainable communication, the increasing demand for better infrastructure, and the Ministry’s goals to address these issues and the activities planned for the four years. The Strategic Objectives and their associated strategic actions are based on the Guiding Principles, Indicators and the Targets. The activities are listed in the annex – strategies matrix. Altogether, the activity matrix describe what the Ministry wants to do (the targeted results), how it will do it (the activities to implement), how to measure for their progress (KPIs), and when to achieve the needed results (time-frame). The Implementation Plan can be used as a basis for further planning, for instance it can guide SOEs on their statement of intent (SOI), or be used as a tool for annual Divisions’ MOPs. It can also be used by the Ministry to record and monitor for results the SOEs progress on their business plans (SOIs). The baseline in the matrix indicates where and how much the activities have been achieved, mostly those activities that were brought forward from the previous MSP 2020, that still form part of the strategies/activities in this MSP 2021. Lastly, the Strategic Plan emphasises the importance of relationships, partnerships and inter- sectoral coordination and collaboration for an effective delivery of the plan. This includes relationships with domestic partners, including other Kiribati Government Ministries and departments, agencies, NGOs and community-based groups. It promotes partnership and aims to build good relationships with international development partners. The Ministry also recognises the need to have the MICTTD’s Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) which will be an effective mechanism to support planning, implementation, and monitoring of this Strategic Plan. Similar to the Secretary level Coordinating Committee (DCC), the MDCC will ensure that project documents including plans are set out and more accurate analysis of cost and benefits are presented well before the next stage. 2 Hon Minister Secretary ICT Director Staff Marine Director Staff Postal Director Staff Printery GP Staff Planning Director Staff Admin DS SAS AS Account Registry HRO SIO CUSTOMER SERVICE Board and Commisioners AKL CEO Staff AKA CEO Staff BNL CEO Staff KLTA CEO Staff AVIATION Director Staff TAK CEO Staff KPA CEO Staff CCK CEO Staff BPA CEO Staff KNSL CEO Staff 2. MICTTD’s organizational structure MICTTD Organizational Structure 2021 The MICTTD Organizational Structure shows that several of its core departments have been transformed into commercial entities, companies, or regulator. A total of ten entities form the core sectors of the Ministry of Communication: Land, Air and Sea, including the support service units which sits within the divisions of the Ministry. 3 3. Introduction The Ministry Strategic Plan (MSP) 2021-2024 sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOE’s for the period from 2021-2024. It identifies the objectives and goals that MICTTD with its SOEs want to achieve in the four years, and the collective actions to carry out those objectives. In order to achieve the needed results (from strategic actions), key performance indicators (KPIs) are identified for each activity, including the time-frame and its financial implication or estimated budget, this way it is possible to measure and monitor the progress of that activity. The Strategic Plan is informed by the KV20, the KDP 2020-2023, and the Motinnano 2020 (Manifesto), which examines the Government’s resource and the ability of the systems in place to respond to the people’s needs. The alignment of the activities in the MSP by the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs to the national policies are imperative (figure below shows this linkage) - therefore activities are all geared towards those targets in the longer-term plan. The MICTTD follows this path and draws activities based on the targets from the national policies, but also important are the Motinnano (Manifesto) that aims to deliver immediate needs for the public. The Ministry Senior Management Team (SMT) which consists of Heads of Departments and Heads of SOEs all participated in the development of the Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan sets the overall framework of actions on the objectives. A more practical approach (outcome oriented) is needed to deliver these outputs, so the aim of this plan is to paint a clear picture of what each department or entity is programmed to do within the four-years - that these strategies or activities are within the guiding principles, or the emphasis that these activities will be sustainable and realistic. Also, the plan aims to focus on the outcome, and mechanisms to solve issues and problems. 4 3.1 Vision Enhanced productivity and achieved economic prosperity through infrastructure development and sustainable connectivity. 3.2 Mission To provide an innovative and integrated sustainable connectivity through an enhanced transportation, communication, tourism, support service, and infrastructure that are safe, efficient, affordable and accessible to all I-Kiribati. 3.3 Guiding Principles The Strategic Plan is based on seven guiding principles. Together with the National policy declarations like the KV20, KDP, and Motinnano, the following guiding principles need to be reflected in all the strategic actions to be developed and implemented. Guiding Principles Relevant and appropriate Do the proposed strategies and activities reflect the people and the Government’s needs and will the activities undertaken meet those needs? Sustainable Are the proposed strategies and activities sustainable in Kiribati? Effective Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be effective in Kiribati? Efficient Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be efficient in Kiribati? Outcome oriented Do the strategies and activities have clear links to the Mission and Vision of the Ministry? Realistic Are the outcomes and targets realistic? Coordinated Are the proposed strategies and activities well-coordinated with relevant stakeholders and partners? They can also be used to guide decisions on implementation priorities. The important aspect of the guiding principle is getting the most realistic, effective and efficient outcome for the set of objectives/activities from each division and SOE under the MICTTD. These seven questions as guiding principles guide the planned activities in the MSP. 5 4. Strategic Context The pillars of the KV20, the National Focus Areas (NFA) of the KDP 2020-2023, and the Motinnano 2020 (Manifesto), forms the foundation of the planned activities. The Ministry has identified activities that will target these focus areas in the medium term. The Ministry and its SOEs aim to provide complete and collective strategies to improve and address the issues identified under the pillars and the targets of the KV20 and the KDP 2020- 2023. These coping strategies are geared to improving services and infrastructure, but overall, the main goal is to address the issues faced by the public and constraints to developments, such as the lack of infrastructure. There is also great emphasis on improving contracts and agreements that Government can benefit more from, for instance, the establishment of an agreement to take back Kiribati upper air space and to extend our air space boundary so we can maximize revenue, or to review existing air-service agreements. All these strategies and several more are explained in the activity matrix annex, however the focus is not only to maximize revenue, the aim is also to have a sustainable source of revenue for years and decades to come. The Motinnano is fundamental and is used in identifying activities in the MSP, it plays an important role to set targets for the Divisions and SOEs to address the increasing demand of the public for needed services, and also for generating income for Kiribati. The focus on Tourism has been popular from the previous Motinnano (2016). The targets and planned activities set by the new Motinnano 2020 including the ongoing activities from the last Motinnano (2016) have been listed also in the activity matrix annex. The baseline column in the strategy matrix will show how much these activities from the last MSP have progressed from last year. KDP 2020-2023 KV20 KDP NFA 1: Harnessing our Human Wealth KV20 Pillar 1: Wealth (Natural Capital; Human Capital; Cultural Capital) KDP NFA 2: Growing our Economic Wealth and Leaving no one behind KV20 Pillar 2: Peace and Security KDP NFA 3: Improving our Health KV20 Pillar 3: Infrastructure for Development KDP NFA 4: Protecting our Environment and Mitigating Climate Change KV20 Pillar 4: Governance KDP NFA 5: Good Governance KDP NFA 6: Infrastructure 6 5. Situational Analysis The MICTTD is the most diverse Ministry in Kiribati administering six divisions and ten SOEs. It is also the main contributor to Pillar 1 (Wealth) and Pillar 3 (Infrastructure) of the KV20 and KDP. The recurrent budget for the Ministry on average is $3.9M for the four years 2018-2021. Recurrent Budget, MICTTD Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 Budget $ 4,265,844.00 $ 4,519,930.58 $ 3,391,423.30 $ 3,418,721.00 The 2021 Development budget, similar to previous years, the budget for infrastructure takes up the majority of the $11 Million for Development budget, $10.2M is allocated for infrastructure development. In 2019, the Government purchased the first of the two Embraer jets, which raised the amount for development budget for that year significantly. The MICTTD MSP progress is monitored on a quarterly basis. The Research & Planning Unit at the Ministry will send out Monitoring sheets and templates to Divisions and SOEs every three months from the last progress report, to collect data, updates and progress. The activities are monitored and reported by their percentage progress, whereby these data and updates are analysed and reported to the MICTTD Secretary. 5.1 Achievements in 2020 The last MSP progress reports that 61% of the overall average progress on all activities planned for Divisions and SOEs of the MICTTD for the year 2020 (Jan-Dec, 2020) were complete, and therefore the remaining 39% were incomplete or pending, this is due to several factors and challenges that will be discussed in the next section. 1% 6% 93% MICTTD DEV BUDGET 2021 Economic Growth Development Governance Infrastruture Year Dev Budget 2018 $ 5,246,457.00 2019 $64,654,746.45 2020 $ 5,777,433.18 2021 $11,065,475.00 7 5.2 Key Challenges in 2020 The overall achievement therefore signals major factors to consider - factors and circumstances that affects the progress of the Ministry and SOEs planned activities. The following are major factors impacting on the progress of the activities in 2020, from the MSP progress report. 1. Covid-19 pandemic: Border closure and travel restrictions has great impact on overseas trainings; Technical Advisors & consultants needed from overseas; overseas purchases or procurement, etc. 2. Inadequate resource and lack of funding for projects e.g: costly projects, lack/or not enough capital investments, and budget allocations. 3. Lack of infrastructure, channels, sea ports and airports, roads, etc 4. Staff turnover, and when responsibilities of staff were not clear. 5.3 Sustainable Tourism The Pillar 1 of the KV20 has endorsed that sustainable tourism will contribute to economic development, if this is developed and managed properly to provide employment, generate income, as well as supporting the retention of cultural traditions, sustainable management of national environmental assets and wider contributions towards social–economic benefits. The sector can support the development of other sectors like agriculture through forward and backward linkages. Tourism is currently approximately 3.6% of the country’s GDP, however the Ministry believes that Tourism can become a major contributor to the economy if the right approach is adopted. Some of the economic benefits have been seen on Kiritimati Island. Tarawa also obtain significant income but mostly from business travellers. 61% 39% Overall Av. Progress Jan to Dec 2020 Overall Av.

Although the number of visitors increases, there is great potential for more, it can be improved by better tourism products and services. The number of holiday visitors has been increasing moderately, in 2019 it was 7,917 recorded visitors. This shows an increase of more than 50% from the 2015 figure. It is estimated that the increase will continue and therefore Government will need to improve on infrastructure for tourism to meet the increasing demand. The Tourism Authority of Kiribati (TAK) was established on 10 June 2019 and is governed by the Kiribati Tourism Act 2018. TAK is mandated by the Government of Kiribati (GoK) to lead the country’s tourism development and promotional programme. These include tourism investment promotion, product development, licensing and standards regulation, training and development, research and statistics and tourism marketing and promotions. The Phoenix Islands protected area (PIPA) remains unexploited, with pristine lagoons and beaches, the isolated islands are an ideal vacation location for tourists. The TAK and the PIO are finding ways to develop PIPA into a niche tourism product adopting the Bhutan tourism model which is a controlled and restricted visitor destination, but a major contributor to their economy. This approach will require the TAK to improve on its marketing and promotion, and to engage more on e-marketing as social media is currently trendy, free and more effective approach to promoting destinations to visitors and tourists. The tourism industry is driven by Government initiatives. In order to incorporate the Public and Private sector in the Government-led programs, first TAK had to help the locals understand what tourism can do for them, and to also inform the private sector to come onboard. That’s key to TAK’s role – to provide that linkage between the public and the private sectors. By way of response to the Government, TAK has put in place it’s plans for multiple activities towards its objectives. A surfer on a Tabuaeran (Fanning Is) wave Island dancers garlanding 9 However, the major challenges affecting TAK overall progress in 2020 were due to the lack of finance and the Covid-19 pandemic which affects travelling worldwide, hence tourists arrival. The progress from TAK’s MSP 2020 activities, despite the travel restrictions for covid-19, was about 87% overall for year 2020 activities. This shows a promising sector which will thrive especially when borders reopen. In 2021, TAK will develop the Kiribati Sustainable Policy and the Kiribati Tourism Investment Policy which will be conducive to sustainable tourism development in Kiribati. This will need Government for financial support for the tourism developments. TAK will also look into establishing the tourism zones in the Linnix and Gilbert groups, developing hotels in Kanton and selected islands in Linnix and Gilbert groups, making Tabuaeran a major surfing destination, and developing mandatory Tourism and Hospitality operational and standards for all tourism business operators that will incorporate Covid-19 protocols. TAK also recognises that it is mostly about improving its tourism product and the quality of its services, before it is able to establish a tourism brand with PIPA. If the product is well established, and of good quality and promoted properly with a good marketing approach (online), it could build a good and trusted brand for tourists Game fishing is one area that tourism is looking to develop and promote in the Gilbert Islands. This tourism activity has vast potential and travellers from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Europe are visiting our shores for game fishing. 5.4 Air, Sea and Land transportation and Infrastructure The KV20 identifies transportation and its infrastructure to be key complementary drivers to economic development. These are expensive investments but if these investments are properly analysed and monitored, they will be very beneficial to the public and the future generation. Government has committed to these projects, and seeing that some will not immediately reap benefits, however Government believes that in the future these investments will eventually grow the economy. For instance, the cost and benefit analysis on the Embraer jet shows that the financial and social benefit of having and operating the jet will surpass its costs in five to seven years of operation. Expansion of these services and infrastructure will also pose risks and therefore an effective monitoring and risk assessment mechanism is necessary. Clear blue waters at one of the resorts in Kiribati Game fishing in Kiritimati Island 10 The airport will stimulate economic activity, there are only two international airports in Kiribati; one on South Tarawa and one on Kiritimati Island. In addition, there are 19 airports in the outer islands which are used for domestic services, mostly made of reef-mud and require upgrading and additional maintenance work to improve the deteriorating runway surface conditions, to support frequent air operations and to meet the traveling demand. The Airport Act, was passed in 2018 and became an Airport Authority in April 2019. The AKA (Airport Kiribati Authority) aims to enable Kiribati to upgrade air transport standards and venture into jet operations for an improved international route for AKL. So a major project for the AKA to support the Embraer operation is the upgrading of the KANTON Airport to an EDTO alternate airport. This is for the Embraer to operate between Tarawa and Kiritimati Island. Air Kiribati Ltd (AKL) is a 100% government owned airline and the only domestic air operations provider in Kiribati. AKL is dedicated to providing affordable transportation to and from Tarawa to the outer islands, including operations in Kiritimati. AKL's key objectives includes improving safety and compliance, with AOC certification - which is a requirement for full safety compliance. AKL will satisfy all key requirements for safety and compliance in terms of nominated persons, systems, proper finances, and accepted manual exposition set-in place. Also, to improve reliability and capability of the airline to meet the growing public demand for air transportation in Kiribati with more efficient service, and with modern airplanes and infrastructure development. AKL also aims to improve financial viability to minimise government subsidy (CSO) to the company. Major plans for developments in domestic and international operations have been analysed, findings suggested that the international operation will make good profits. Similarly, domestic operations with a new domestic fleet will serve the right flight schedule that meets the public increasing demand for air flights but also generate good profits, hence government subsidy will be less needed in the future, and AKL will be a profitable company. AKL will also cease loss-making activities. Bonriki Airport in South Tarawa Air Kiribati Embraer Jet Bonriki International Airport, South Tarawa Dash-8, AKL 11 AKL had conducted aircraft study to identify the best option for an aircraft type for its domestic fleet. The TECNAM 2012 Traveller will cost $28M for seven aircrafts, these airplanes are the right fit for Kiribati for their size and capacity, and costs saving features. The nine seater TECNAM airplane will also guarantee more flight services and will operate at a profit compared to a higher number of passengers for a larger airplane like the twin otter to breakeven. One of AKL’s main obstacle is the high cost of fuel which has greatly affect the company’s ability to make large marginal profits. Because of this, Government is subsidizing AKL to sustain the domestic air travels, however with the introduction of the TECNAM to replace the domestic fleet, AKL could make profits and therefore will need less of Government subsidy. AKL will offer international air service with the Embraer jets, although this project has stalled because of the Covid-19 pandemic, however the plan to set up international operations is still a possible endeavour, activities are in-line, including setting up office in Brisbane. It also includes using the jet to service the route Tarawa/Kiritimati Island, which will need a EDTO alternate in Kanton Island. This requires the Kanton Airport to be upgraded. The AKA project in remediating and upgrading the Kanton Airport will complement this Government venture for AKL to service this route. Tourism in Kanton will also be the next target to develop when the airport is set up and running. AKL also plans to build prefab office buildings as the existing ones have been condemned by structural survey. A hangar is also required to house airplanes and assets, which will require an environmental assessment on the construction site. Further, AKL will also establish a nationalised training academy or a training centre to help develop local talent and provide long-term career path options at Air Kiribati. Furthermore, AKL aims to achieve its goals and improve financial viability (and CSO independent) by reducing costs and increasing revenue. These planned activities for AKL not only are realistic for the four years, they paint a brighter future in flying and air transportation for the public and the nation. The majority of the projects may depend greatly on capital investments that Government will put into, however good analyses and projections are in place to guarantee their successes. Underpinning the success of an aviation industry in Kiribati is an effective regulator. The Civil Aviation Authority of Kiribati (CAAK) was first established as a corporate body in 2015 under the Civil Aviation Act that aims to achieve a cohesive, safe, responsive, and sustainable regulatory system for air transportation in Kiribati, its focus is to establish a safe and secure skies for I-Kiribati and tourists. In an evolving aviation industry, the CAAK is facing challenges as it continues to respond to an increased need for the regulatory and security services to keep people safe and secure. The major changes and challenges ahead for CAAK in Keeping people safe, is keeping up with a complex security environment combined with a growing aviation environment (post Covid-19); Ensuring that people feel safe as new technology is adopted – as well as ensuring that people are able to participate in the aviation system without unnecessary obstacles; and also ensuring that CAAK’s regulations keep people safe by better managing risks in the system, along with a focus on performance and outcome rather than just ‘ticking the boxes’. Bonriki Airport terminal and AKL’s hangar 12 With technological advancements, the Kiribati Aviation System has been challenged continuously and therefore the CAAK is working hard to adapt and respond to new technology, to ensure there are no unnecessary barriers to entering the system, while ensuring safety. This requires that the CAAK effectively identifies and manages emerging risks, and also considering other factors besides safety into the decision making – for example, on climate change. As part of the CAAK’s regulatory responsibility an inspection and audit to service providers, such as Air Kiribati Limited, Airport Kiribati Authority and other aviation participants, is being conducted on a regular basis to ensure compliance to the requirements. For ICAO compliance, Kiribati is operating in accordance with the Standards and recommended practices, an audit has to be conducted to ensure safety regulation is effective. Capacity building is also on the top of the list for CAAK personnel to get the required training to improve their knowledge and skills for effective performance of duties and responsibilities and be able to support a safe and reliable air service. In addition to its regulatory functions, the CAAK is currently working on the delineation of Kiribati Airspace which has been placed under the Nadi, Oakland and Tahiti FIR during the Colonial times. This is one crucial assignment to expand Kiribati Sovereignty rights of its upper airspace boundary and to explore the best service provider to manage Kiribati upper airspace with the most viable financial arrangement. The proceeds from this can assist to fund other activities to improve Kiribati aviation facilities, infrastructure, and air navigation services. Access to the Outer Islands from the Capital (South Tarawa) is challenging due to inadequate infrastructure: wharves, ramps, piers and ports, boat channels, passages and Aids to Navigation (AToNs). The Marine Division continually plays its roles to maintain its functions as a Maritime Administration of Kiribati. It oversees its mission to provide professional, quality advice and services to the shipping industry and the maritime training organization in compliance with IMO convention, and it endeavours to continue targeting its main priorities in the development of the maritime sector within the territorial waters surrounding the largest 200 nautical mile EEZ in the Pacific region, consisting of the Gilbert Group and Banaba, the Phoenix Group and the Line Group further in the east. The Marine Division is responsible for all maritime regulations in Kiribati, Aids to Navigation, Marine Guard (Tarawa and Kiritimati), Search and Rescue (SAR), Ship and vessel registration, Seafarer Licensing, Marine Pollution and Registry; Hydrography to ensure boat passages are safe and navigable (under SOLAS); providing safety and navigational warnings to the general public; and including all other maritime matters that are relevant to the safety of life, marine environment and to Kiribati. It operates with strict guidance of its Quality Management System to meet its obligations under certain IMO requirements and subjects to undergo regular impartial audits to maintain eminence and to function as a Maritime Administration for Kiribati as a member state. The Marine Division also provides a 24/7 radio watch for the safety of maritime traffic, and also provide the needed search and rescue services to prevent loss of lives at sea. 13 The Marine Division works closely with national stakeholders and regional communities to deliver the best services through safe, secure and efficient shipping. However, there are still challenges for the Marine Division that requires full commitment and funding. Among others, for instance, there is an ongoing need to provide safe passages for boats to reach the shores of islands with no lagoons, or islands without easy access to land, this will cost the government a total of $100 Million dollars to cover all the islands of Kiribati. Also, to establish and improve wharfs/jetties and ramps for domestic travel and cargo shipments will cost $167 Million. Aid to Navigation which is a mandatory requirement, and boat ramps which will allow easy reach of landing crafts to shores for quick handling of cargoes, vehicles, etc also need regular maintenance and repair. The Kiribati Port Authority (KPA) operates the two main ports of entry; Betio port in Tarawa island and the other in Kiritimati island. The primary function of the KPA is to facilitate safe passage of cargo, and people from overseas vessels through the port and facilitate border control and statutory processing. The KPA intends to improve the performance and delivery of this function over the coming years through ongoing performance of operational structure towards a more cost efficient and energy saving approach, ongoing maintenance of existing facilities and equipment, development of new systems and facilities, and the acquisition of new equipment considered necessary to promote efficient service and to replace those considered to be beyond repair. KPA depends heavily on machines to produce efficient service but procuring these machines are expensive. Despite this difficulty, the KPA endeavours to maintain a profitable operation in order to replace out of date equipment or to procure new machinery when required. Some major projects for the KPA are; the port expansion, Betio and Bairiki wharf rehabilitation, these projects will need major funding that the Government and Development Partners may assist with especially for projects that are costly and beyond the KPA’s capability and resources. The lack of funding and resource was one of the major challenges encountered by the KPA in the 2020 MSP progress rating, achieving 63% progress in all activities for 2020. Several of KPA’s major plans in the next four years, is to purchase more new machineries to improve cartage of containers, expect completion of pavement of the container yard in the year 2022, and commence Shipping containers arriving KPA 14 work on the port expansion – construction of new berth sites near the “Korekorea” corner, to rehabilitate the Bairiki wharf, and to also construct the new KPA office in Kiritimati Island. The Kiribati National Shipping Line (KNSL) is the only Government owned shipping company that provide shipping service in Kiribati prior to the entry of the private sector. It currently focuses on providing shipping services on a monthly shipping service to all islands in the Gilbert Group. KNSL which was re-organised in 2018, have an important role and responsibility as an arm of Government to provide a responsive and appropriate shipping service to the people of Kiribati by supporting and implementing relevant national socio-economic policies and programmes. In establishing a safer, reliable, and efficient shipping line, the KNSL adopted a mission to ‘Serve the People with safe, efficient and affordable shipping’. This is in line with the KNSL vision to create an ‘Unparalleled sea transport service and leading maritime solution provider that enables socio-economic development in Kiribati.’ Given the high demand for goods shipping and on-time cargo delivery, the two operational vessels are not enough to meet all shipping transport needs, particularly, at shipping peak times. Therefore, a great need to acquire more vessels for the Company to maximise the Company’s profits. In previous years, KNSL has been working closely with MICTTD on the procurement of additional vessels to complete the KNSL fleet; this includes acquiring the tug-and-barge (thanks to PRC who has agreed to provide the tug & barge vessel for KNSL), Landing craft for the Line and Phoenix Islands, and the multi-purpose vessel (to replace MV Matangare). Land transportation and infrastructure are equally vital for economic development. Nonetheless, the South Tarawa road network is the only and recently improved road in the entire nation. The Kiribati Land Transport Authority (KLTA) is a corporate entity responsible for the administration and regulatory of vehicle licenses, driving licenses, and all activities that are within the premises of the highway, including road blocks and feeder roads. LC-Aratoba loading cargoes KNSL’s LC-Aratoba KNSL’s LC-Linnix 15 The mission of the KLTA is “Endeavour to become a professional, effective, and efficient land transport authority founded on safety with a focus on customer satisfaction”. Its Vision is “Moving Kiribati Safely”. KLTA is planning to reach out to the outer islands and Kiritimati island and in the four years, this will progress through to complement the road construction project in all of the outer islands. Under the new regulations for the KLTA many changes have emerged, policies and regulations have been improved, however some challenges remain, such as lack of resource to maintain and repair the roads - the need for machineries and operators of the machines, which have been identified to be costly projects and therefore the KLTA is planning to approach development partners for financial support. Furthermore, the KLTA is strictly controlling imported vehicles to Kiribati by the 10-year import vehicle policy, as second-hand vehicles pour in from Japan. This is an alarming issue that should be controlled as early as possible before road congestions, space for vehicle parking, and vehicle wrecks will be difficult to manage in the future. 5.5 Access to communication technologies and quality information and services The ICT Policy and Development Division of MICTTD is responsible for advising the Government on ICT related matters, coordinating the development of national ICT related Policies such as the National ICT Policy, coordination of ICT projects throughout Kiribati, promoting the use of ICT in the country, responsible for cyber security advice and awareness programs for the general public. Recently the Division was responsible for leading the development of the eGovernment Roadmap which sets a high-level plan for e-Government in Kiribati. The overall progress on all activities for the ICT at the end of the year 2020 was 79%. One major factor contributing to the overall progress for the ICT last year was budget constraint, most of its core activities/projects require huge funding, for instance, the e-Government project to improve efficiency and effectiveness of services, and overseas trainings for capacity building of ICT officers to support other sectors. Also the closure of the borders in respect to Covid-19 pandemic have affected most of ICT’s progress in the last year. The ICT’s GWAN (Government wide-area network) project will connect all Ministries to a one- stop source for access into public sector information and electronic services. This will improve efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery and also promote transparency and openness for Government processes and procedures. The Cyber Crime Bill will be enacted to strengthen the National Cyber security capacity, to protect the public from cyber threats. The ICT will also upgrade the MICTTD website and update all MICTTD computers with updated antivirus. The other major ICT on-going projects is the Mobile rollout project in the outer islands for the JSS students on the road after school Enforcement officer on patrol motor cycle next to Patrol vehicle 16 remaining islands Teraina and Tabuaeran. Also, improvement of mobile coverage to the islands of Makin, Butaritari, Abemama, Tab North and Onotoa are targeted in 2021. CCK is a regulator for the telecom service, one of its core purpose is to address the issue of barriers to entry and encourage fair competition in the telecom industry, the successful arrangement with both the telecom companies being able to connect their services, where the public can now exchange calls and receive messages between both networks ATHKL (now Vodafone) and Ocean- link (OLL) was one of the milestones achieved. Telecom wide coverage that reaches the more remote communities and the outer islands and are key objectives, which also aims to reach groups of people like the disabled and handicapped persons, and also to provide services for disaster and emergency cases. In 2021, one new initiative of the CCK is to conduct surveys to identify the needs of disabled persons in the ICT products and services and provide at least 10 products that serve their needs in ICT - no one is left behind. The BPA is a radio broadcasting and newspaper company formally established in 1979. Its core function is to provide local and international media and dissemination of accurate news - informational and educational media, and entertainment to the national public through the Kiribati radio and the national newspaper “Te Uekera” and other authorized publications. In this medium-term plan, BPA aims to improve and develop its core services especially on radio broadcasting, newsprint services and to also introduce video production and TV servicee. It targets to acquire two upgraded radio transmitters for South Tarawa and for Kiritimati Island by 2022. BPA also looks at developing its infrastructure and buildings as the current building is old and needs a major repair. It plans to purchase a new printing machine for its Uekera newspaper in 2021 and to develop the TV service system over the four years. BPA also plans to design a more competitive strategy, to establish a better market share for each of its production segments, this way BPA can generate more revenue and reach out to more customers in the outer islands. BPA’s ambitious plan for the future is to connect all the islands of Kiribati, to enable all I-Kiribati to access good quality radio service, newspaper, and TV service wherever they are. BwebwerikiNet Ltd (BNL) is an SOE, under the MICTTD and represents the Government’s interest to support and improve voice and data telecommunications network in the Outer Islands, an international submarine cable venture with government entities from Nauru and FSM, the East Micronesia Cable System, and also provides needed support to the establishment of an international submarine cable venture with Southern Cross, the Southern Cross (NEXT). The current internet connection across Kiribati uses satellite technology. Government in partnership with the World Bank and the ADB are jointly funding the submarine cable project. Construction Work at the new Kiritimati Island SX NEXT Cable Landing Station 17 This will connect Tarawa with the East Micronesia Cable, and Kiritimati with SX-NEXT Cable Network. The fibre optic cable network will provide more speed and cheaper internet for the public. The system will connect Kiribati to FSM and onwards to Guam for global access. The Kiritimati cable network is expected to operate in January 2022 and for Tarawa in 2023. BNL is also responsible for operating and maintaining the Outer Island Network and is working at refurbishing the infrastructure to ensure quality service is maintained all throughout the islands of Kiribati. 18 5.6 Support Services The Ministry administered supporting services that are vital for its office and operational functions to provide quality service to the public. Human resource capacity building is an ongoing need for the Ministry to meet demands from the evolving and regulatory needs from its highly specialized departments. As tourism, air, sea, ports and land transportations are expanding, so does the need to meet the required skills. A lot of these skill-sets are dictated by international regulatory bodies and audits to meet the required standards set mostly for functionality and safety for instance on civil aviation and the airline. Hence, there is a great need to meet and comply with all the required international standards, which means better and safer for the people. The Admin Division’s objective is improving work performance and productivity, encourage openness and transparency, and accountability. Several of their major plans in achieving these goals were the introduction of an award system for staff to encourage productivity, establish monitoring and evaluation of staff performance, and capacity building which remain one of the top priorities that aims to ensure better work quality and output from the Ministry staff. The Postal Division is the national and only postal service provider in the country, providing universal postal services to the government and people under the Postal Services Act (Cap 74 of Kiribati Law) and Universal Postal Service regulations. It is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The core function of Postal is to provide efficient delivery of mails and money transfer services and produce high quality philatelic products. With a substantial increase of parcel mails volume there is a significant need to improve International Postal System (IPS.POST) and Express Mail Service (EMS) for fast and efficient mail delivery. Further, Postal provide tele-money transfer and this is the only money transfer service that is widely used by the people on the outer Islands, however the current system is time consuming and old-fashion. The introduction of a fast-tele-money system is underway. With a high demand for international money transfer service and high-quality philatelic products, there is a need to expand the money transfer service and maintain the high quality of philatelic products. The Government Printery (GP) is established to provide central printing services to government ministries. It manages and is responsible for the production of standard forms, documents, secured stationeries and publications for government. The other important and very specific role is the printing of seamen discharge books and other maritime booklets. There is significant need to improve government printing capacity and quality of the printed materials, with state-of-the-art machineries to meet the demand of government ministries and some of the general public that cannot be taken up by private firms. In the centre of the Ministry and SOE’s business, there is always the need to maintain effective and efficient registry, account and customer services systems. The provision of service required from the counter to office and to elsewhere is essential, without much focus on the necessary and quality service delivery, it can lead to a dysfunctional Ministry and its SOEs. The approach that MICTTD has identified for effective development is having enough regulation to support better service, but another is to also produce more autonomous bureaus, that can support their own operations financially and sustainably. This strategy is aimed to address the Ministry’s diverse nature, and to give that specialized function to the new Authority or SOE to run and operate on itself with less financial assistance and tension from the Ministry. This will allow the Ministry to focus on its core functions as a Ministry - administrator and caretaker of its divisions and SOEs. 19 6. Goals, Objectives, and Strategic Actions The main goal for the Ministry and SOEs in this plan is “To improve transportation, communication, information technology, postal and printery through infrastructure development, continuous improvement, efficient and effective service to support Government and the people, and to contribute to the economic development.” Based on the KV20, KDP, and the Motinnano 2020. It has identified four goals to be relevant to the responsibilities and objectives of the Ministry and its SOEs. Strategies have been drawn from these goals, the Motinnano also plays a pivotal role to inform these strategies to deliver what Government has promised the public for better access, more benefits and leaving no one behind.

Ministry Operational Plan and SOE’s Sector plans The KPIs in the KDP reflects international and regional conventions, and government policies. It also includes a set of indicators to enable progress in each KPI to be monitored and evaluated. Future MOPs (short-term year plans for Ministry Divisions) and the SOE’s plans (SOIs) are to be aligned with the key objectives and action strategies stated in this strategic plan. Therefore, the MSP2021-2024 is a guide for Divisions and SOEs to develop their annual or semi- annual plans and to inform management and the Boards way-forward on what has been planned for the medium-term (four years), however this will not restrict for new plans or modified plans, changes are considered for the next review of this medium-term plan. It is a live work-plan and is subject to change following changed situations, although all the activities in this plan will be monitored every quarter of the year. 7.1 Result management The importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration is apparent in many of the strategic actions in this Strategic Plan, there are mostly infrastructure projects that are costly, and development partners are involved in. For instance, the fibre optics cable (submarine cable) project, or the purchase of a tug & barge that PRC (China) has shown interest in purchasing for the KNSL, the purchase of the AKL domestic fleet, etc. A results management is key for monitoring and evaluation and this will need the support of our counterparts from other GOK departments and our development partners. 7.2 Domestic coordination In working towards the objectives in this Strategic Plan, there are opportunities for strengthening coordination between the MICTTD, SOEs and other GOK departments and agencies, and with NGOs and community-based groups. This includes collaborating on issues, such as with the Public Service Office (PSO) on objectives relating to workforce planning and human resource development, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) on investigating alternative sources of financing and analysis of investments, and the National Statistics Office to build capacity in the collection and analysis of information. It also includes working with others more directly to coordinate support on implementing specific programme and interventions. The Strategic Plan notes a number of existing mechanisms for coordinating planning and implementation of initiatives, such as the MICTTD Coordinating Committee. Where they are not formalised structures or systems for coordination on specific programs or broader system issues, the benefits of establishing such processes will be investigated as part of the implementation of this Strategic Plan. 8. Coordination with development partners The MICTTD is committed to build strong relationships with numerous bi-lateral and international development partners. The partners have provided technical assistance and funding for a number of programs, infrastructure, and workforce development and training. To strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and the support from donors and development partners, the Ministry will need to establish a MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) in order to strengthen the coordination and support, and planning and delivery of 26 services in Kiribati. The MDCC will comprises of the Senior Management Team (SMT) of the MICTTD and representatives from Australian DFAT, New Zealand MFAT, Japan, PRC (China), SPC, SPTO, PIPA, ADB and the World Bank. The strong commitment of the Ministry in engaging with these developing partners, provides an opportunity to integrate this support into the Strategic Plan. To this end, the MDCC will support the implementation of this Strategic Plan through providing the mechanism to the following: 1. Assist with identifying priority areas for funding and with the efficient mobilisation of resources, through working together to coordinate assistance, to give effect to the MICTTD and SOE plan. 2. Promote integrated, multi-sectoral and regional initiatives that are consistent with the Strategic Plan. 3. Identify initiatives to promote improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service delivery. 4. Review progress of activities against the indicators and targets in the Strategic Plan. 5. Report to the Government of Kiribati and development partners on the implementation of the Strategic Plan, including in such a way that rationalises reporting and other accountability processes to promote greater efficiency 6. The MDCC will meet once or twice per year during the period of this Strategic Plan. One meeting per annum will focus on the review of progress against the Strategic Plan. At the following meeting, in each annual cycle, the MICTTD will present an annual action plan for the next year for discussion and agreement. 7. One or two members of the MDCC will have oversight on each strategic objective in the Strategic Plan. These members are not responsible for implementation of the objective; they are responsible for overseeing the MDCC’s role in relation to the objective. 9. Monitoring The MICTTD’s Senior Management Team and the Planning Unit (MICTTD) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of this strategic plan. The Planning Unit will coordinate the collection and analysis of information and data to report on the indicators and targets in the plan. It will provide progress updates on the activities to the SMT on a quarterly basis, and also report on issues. One of the challenges that the Ministry is keen to tackle immediately is collection and consolidation of information and data. Whilst this needs a better system or mechanism to coordinate in order to collect (data), it will certainly assist to provide the relevant information required by the SMT and the MDCC, as well as development partners, for reporting and making decisions for future funding of projects. This MSP will become a tool for the Ministry and its SOEs. The indicators in this strategic plan will be monitored, reported, and used for developing shorter-term plans (MOPs). The Planning unit will also be able to use it as a monitoring tool and a metric matrix to check for performance and progress, that should inform the MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee and our development partners. 27 10.Risk Management The risk management matrix presented below outlines the possible risks identified, with the strategies to mitigate those risks.

With over 240  activities, underpinned by 86 strategic objectives to achieve four main goals, these planned  strategies and activities is the collective work of the senior management team from the MICTTD  Divisions and SOEs that covers the four years from 2021 to 2024.     The plan was designed to align with the Kiribati Vision for 20 years (KV20), the Kiribati  Development Plan (KDP), and Te Motinnano (Government Manifesto), to guide these activities,  but most importantly to bring changes and the needed development to meet the growing demand  of the Kiribati people.     The vision and mission of this plan recognises the importance of an enhanced productivity and   sustainable connectivity. In order for our people and Kiribati to prosper and grow economically,  we must therefore enhance all services to become efficient and effective, our human resources to  be productive, and to develop infrastructure to boost economic growth.      This strategic plan focuses our effort on these four main goals:     • Develop and strengthen sustainable Tourism development;  • Strengthen air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures;  • Improve access to Communication technologies and access to quality information and   services; and  • To strengthen supporting services from the Ministry and SOEs.     Our objectives recognise our roles and expertise, however there are always challenges along the  path to development. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions which has  caused many activities from last year to be delayed, or the lack of infrastructure that remain to be  the problem, are just a few from them. We should embrace these challenges, stay connected, learn  from the lessons, and continue to strive forward to grow. This Strategic Plan sets the compass for  every activity that could deliver our goals.    I urge the commitment of all staff of the MICTTD and SOEs to participate in the implementation  of this plan, and our development partners to continue their support, because through everybody’s  cooperation, action and determination, I am confident that we will achieve these targets and goals.

Executive Summary    This medium-term Strategic Plan sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOEs over the next  four years. It identifies a Vision, Mission, Goals, and Guiding Principles, and Strategic Objectives  that the Ministry with its SOEs envisage to achieve in the medium term. The MICTTD aims to  achieve its targets set in this plan but also intends to take into account lessons learnt, to find more  efficient ways to address challenges identified in the last MSP monitored progress for 2020. It is  able to do this by understanding these key challenges faced by MICTTD and its SOEs.    This plan identifies strategic actions and indicators that could be used to measure each activity  progress. It also signals the need for a stronger multi-sector coordination in order to effectively  implement the Strategic Plan and the need to build the right infrastructure to accommodate these  development activities.  The MICTTD recognises that the major hurdle in carrying out some of  the major activities have been the lack or the absence of proper infrastructure. Infrastructure  projects are main targets for the MICTTD in this plan, it aims to provide the basic foundation of  development through improving connectivity, and so the focus is in these capital investment  projects, or the key drivers for development. MICTTD believes that without these infrastructure  and capital investments put in place, and without proper mitigation of risks, it will be difficult to  achieve the needed development that will meet the growing population demand and for our future  generations.    The sections of the Strategic Plan outlines its scope, the strategic context, key challenges and  achievements from the last MSP, and overviews of the Divisions and SOEs under the Ministry  portfolio. It summarises the population need for better access to sustainable communication, the  increasing demand for better infrastructure, and the Ministry’s goals to address these issues and  the activities planned for the four years. The Strategic Objectives and their associated strategic  actions are based on the Guiding Principles, Indicators and the Targets. The activities are listed in  the annex – strategies matrix.     Altogether, the activity matrix describe what the Ministry wants to do (the targeted results), how  it will do it (the activities to implement), how to measure for their progress (KPIs), and when to  achieve the needed results (time-frame). The Implementation Plan can be used as a basis for  further planning, for instance it can guide SOEs on their statement of intent (SOI), or be used as  a tool for annual Divisions’ MOPs. It can also be used by the Ministry to record and monitor for  results the SOEs progress on their business plans (SOIs). The baseline in the matrix indicates  where and how much the activities have been achieved, mostly those activities that were brought  forward from the previous MSP 2020, that still form part of the strategies/activities in this MSP  2021.     Lastly, the Strategic Plan emphasises the importance of relationships, partnerships and inter- sectoral coordination and collaboration for an effective delivery of the plan. This includes  relationships with domestic partners, including other Kiribati Government Ministries and  departments, agencies, NGOs and community-based groups. It promotes partnership and aims to  build good relationships with international development partners. The Ministry also recognises the  need to have the MICTTD’s Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) which will be an  effective mechanism to support planning, implementation, and monitoring  of this Strategic Plan.  Similar to the Secretary level Coordinating Committee (DCC), the MDCC will ensure  that project  documents including plans are set out and more accurate analysis of cost and benefits are presented  well before the next stage.         2   Hon Minister  Secretary  ICT  Director  Staff  Marine  Director  Staff  Postal  Director  Staff  Printery  GP  Staff  Planning  Director  Staff  Admin  DS  SAS  AS  Account  Registry  HRO SIO  CUSTOMER  SERVICE  Board and Commisioners  AKL  CEO  Staff  AKA  CEO  Staff  BNL  CEO  Staff  KLTA  CEO  Staff  AVIATION  Director  Staff  TAK  CEO  Staff  KPA  CEO  Staff  CCK  CEO  Staff  BPA  CEO  Staff  KNSL  CEO  Staff  2. MICTTD’s organizational structure   MICTTD Organizational Structure 2021                                               The MICTTD Organizational Structure shows that several of its core departments have been transformed into commercial entities, companies, or  regulator. A total of ten entities form the core sectors of the Ministry of Communication: Land, Air and Sea, including the support service units which  sits within the divisions of the Ministry.     3   3. Introduction    The Ministry Strategic Plan (MSP) 2021-2024 sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOE’s  for the period from 2021-2024. It identifies the objectives and goals that MICTTD with its SOEs  want to achieve in the four years, and the collective actions to carry out those objectives. In order  to achieve the needed results (from strategic actions), key performance indicators (KPIs) are  identified for each activity, including the time-frame and its financial implication or estimated  budget, this way it is possible to measure and monitor the progress of that activity.    The Strategic Plan is informed by the KV20, the KDP 2020-2023, and the Motinnano 2020  (Manifesto), which examines the Government’s resource and the ability of the systems in place to  respond to the people’s needs. The alignment of the activities in the MSP by the Ministry’s  Divisions and SOEs to the national policies are imperative (figure below shows this linkage) -  therefore activities are all geared towards those targets in the longer-term plan. The MICTTD  follows this path and draws activities based on the targets from the national policies, but also  important are the Motinnano (Manifesto) that aims to deliver immediate needs for the public.                                           The Ministry Senior Management Team (SMT) which consists of Heads of Departments and  Heads of SOEs all participated in the development of the Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan sets  the overall framework of actions on the objectives. A more practical approach (outcome oriented)  is needed to deliver these outputs, so the aim of this plan is to paint a clear picture of what each  department or entity is programmed to do within the four-years - that these strategies or activities  are within the guiding principles, or the emphasis that these activities will be sustainable and  realistic. Also, the plan aims to focus on the outcome, and mechanisms to solve issues and  problems.                4   3.1 Vision    Enhanced productivity and achieved economic prosperity through infrastructure development and  sustainable connectivity.    3.2 Mission    To provide an innovative and integrated sustainable connectivity through an enhanced  transportation, communication, tourism, support service, and infrastructure that are safe, efficient,  affordable and accessible to all I-Kiribati.    3.3 Guiding Principles    The Strategic Plan is based on seven guiding principles. Together with the National policy  declarations like the KV20, KDP, and Motinnano, the following guiding principles need to be  reflected in all the strategic actions to be developed and implemented.      Guiding Principles   Relevant and appropriate  Do the proposed strategies and activities reflect the people  and the Government’s needs and will the activities  undertaken meet those needs?   Sustainable Are the proposed strategies and activities sustainable in  Kiribati?   Effective Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be  effective in Kiribati?   Efficient Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be efficient  in Kiribati?   Outcome oriented Do the strategies and activities have clear links to the  Mission and Vision of the Ministry?   Realistic Are the outcomes and targets realistic?   Coordinated Are the proposed strategies and activities well-coordinated  with relevant stakeholders and partners?     They can also be used to guide decisions on implementation priorities. The important aspect of  the guiding principle is getting the most realistic, effective and efficient outcome for the set of  objectives/activities from each division and SOE under the MICTTD. These seven questions as  guiding principles guide the planned activities in the MSP.                               5   4. Strategic Context     The pillars of the KV20, the National Focus Areas (NFA) of the KDP 2020-2023, and the  Motinnano 2020 (Manifesto), forms the foundation of the planned activities. The Ministry has  identified activities that will target these focus areas in the medium term.     The Ministry and its SOEs aim to provide complete and collective strategies to improve and  address the issues identified under the pillars and the targets of the KV20 and the KDP 2020- 2023. These coping strategies are geared to improving services and infrastructure, but overall, the  main goal is to address the issues faced by the public and constraints to developments, such as the  lack of infrastructure. There is also great emphasis on improving contracts and agreements that  Government can benefit more from, for instance, the establishment of an agreement to take back  Kiribati upper air space and to extend our air space boundary so we can maximize revenue, or to  review existing air-service agreements. All these strategies and several more are explained in the  activity matrix annex,  however the focus is not only to maximize revenue, the aim is also to have  a sustainable source of revenue for years and decades to come.    The Motinnano is fundamental and is used in identifying activities in the MSP, it plays an important  role to set targets for the Divisions and SOEs to address the increasing demand of the public for  needed services, and also for generating income for Kiribati. The focus on Tourism has been  popular from the previous Motinnano (2016). The targets and planned activities set by the new  Motinnano 2020 including the ongoing activities from the last Motinnano (2016) have been listed  also in the activity matrix annex. The baseline column in the strategy matrix will show how much  these activities from the last MSP have progressed from last year.                     KDP 2020-2023 KV20   KDP NFA 1: Harnessing our Human  Wealth    KV20 Pillar 1: Wealth (Natural Capital; Human  Capital; Cultural Capital)   KDP NFA 2: Growing our Economic  Wealth and Leaving no one behind      KV20 Pillar 2: Peace and Security     KDP NFA 3: Improving our Health  KV20 Pillar 3: Infrastructure for Development  KDP NFA 4: Protecting our  Environment and Mitigating Climate  Change    KV20 Pillar 4: Governance   KDP NFA 5: Good Governance     KDP NFA 6: Infrastructure       6   5. Situational Analysis    The MICTTD is the most diverse Ministry in Kiribati administering six divisions and ten SOEs.  It is also the main contributor to Pillar 1 (Wealth) and Pillar 3 (Infrastructure) of the KV20 and  KDP. The recurrent budget for the Ministry on average is $3.9M for the four years 2018-2021.     Recurrent Budget, MICTTD   Year 2018 2019 2020 2021   Budget $ 4,265,844.00 $   4,519,930.58 $ 3,391,423.30 $   3,418,721.00     The 2021 Development budget, similar to previous years, the budget for infrastructure takes up  the majority of the $11 Million for Development budget, $10.2M is allocated for infrastructure  development. In 2019, the Government purchased the first of the two Embraer jets, which raised  the amount for development budget for that year significantly.        The MICTTD MSP progress is monitored on a quarterly basis. The Research & Planning Unit at  the Ministry will send out Monitoring sheets and templates to Divisions and SOEs every three  months from the last progress report, to collect data, updates and progress. The activities are  monitored and reported by their percentage progress, whereby these data and updates are analysed  and reported to the MICTTD Secretary.    5.1 Achievements in 2020    The last MSP progress reports that 61% of the overall average progress on all activities planned  for Divisions and SOEs of the MICTTD for the year 2020 (Jan-Dec, 2020) were complete, and  therefore the remaining 39% were incomplete or pending, this is due to several factors and  challenges that will be discussed in the next section.       1% 6%  93%  MICTTD DEV BUDGET 2021  Economic Growth Development Governance Infrastruture  Year Dev Budget   2018 $  5,246,457.00   2019 $64,654,746.45   2020 $  5,777,433.18   2021 $11,065,475.00      7          5.2 Key Challenges in 2020    The overall achievement therefore signals major factors to consider - factors and circumstances  that affects the progress of the Ministry and SOEs planned activities. The following are major  factors impacting on the progress of the activities in 2020, from the MSP progress report.        1. Covid-19 pandemic: Border closure and travel restrictions has great impact on overseas   trainings; Technical Advisors & consultants needed from overseas; overseas purchases or  procurement, etc.   2. Inadequate resource and lack of funding for projects e.g: costly projects, lack/or not  enough capital investments, and budget allocations.   3. Lack of infrastructure, channels, sea ports and airports, roads, etc  4. Staff turnover, and when responsibilities of staff were not clear.       5.3 Sustainable Tourism    The Pillar 1 of the KV20 has endorsed that  sustainable tourism will contribute to  economic development, if this is developed  and managed properly to provide  employment, generate income, as well as  supporting the retention of cultural  traditions, sustainable management of  national environmental assets and wider  contributions towards social–economic  benefits. The sector can support the  development of other sectors like agriculture  through forward and backward linkages.  Tourism is currently approximately 3.6% of  the country’s GDP, however the Ministry  believes that Tourism can become a major   contributor to the economy if the right  approach is adopted. Some of the economic  benefits have been seen on Kiritimati Island.  Tarawa also obtain significant income but  mostly from business travellers.         61%  39%  Overall Av.

Although the number of visitors increases, there is great potential for more,  it can be improved by better tourism products and services.    The number of holiday visitors has been increasing  moderately, in 2019 it was 7,917 recorded visitors.  This shows an increase of more than 50% from the  2015 figure. It is estimated that the increase will  continue and therefore Government will need to  improve on infrastructure for tourism to meet the  increasing demand.    The Tourism Authority of Kiribati (TAK) was  established on 10 June 2019 and is governed by the  Kiribati Tourism Act 2018. TAK is mandated by the  Government of Kiribati (GoK) to lead the country’s  tourism development and promotional programme.  These include tourism investment promotion,  product development, licensing and standards  regulation, training and development, research and  statistics and tourism marketing and promotions.           The Phoenix Islands protected area (PIPA)  remains unexploited, with pristine lagoons  and beaches, the isolated islands are an ideal  vacation location for tourists. The TAK and  the PIO are finding ways to develop PIPA  into a niche tourism product adopting the  Bhutan tourism model which is a controlled  and restricted visitor destination, but a major  contributor to their economy. This approach  will require the TAK to improve on its  marketing and promotion, and to engage  more on e-marketing as social media is  currently trendy, free and more effective  approach to promoting destinations to  visitors and tourists.   The tourism industry is driven by Government  initiatives. In order to incorporate the Public and  Private sector in the Government-led programs,  first TAK had to help the locals understand what  tourism can do for them, and to also inform the  private sector to come onboard. That’s key to  TAK’s role – to provide that linkage between the  public and the private sectors. By way of response  to the Government, TAK has put in place it’s plans  for multiple activities towards its objectives.          A surfer on a Tabuaeran (Fanning Is) wave   Island dancers garlanding       9   However, the major challenges affecting TAK overall progress in 2020 were due to the lack of  finance and the Covid-19 pandemic which affects travelling worldwide, hence tourists arrival. The  progress from TAK’s MSP 2020 activities, despite the travel restrictions for covid-19, was about  87% overall for year 2020 activities. This shows a promising sector which will thrive especially  when borders reopen.     In 2021, TAK will develop the Kiribati  Sustainable Policy and the Kiribati Tourism  Investment Policy which will be conducive to  sustainable tourism development in Kiribati.  This will need Government for financial  support for the tourism developments. TAK  will also look into establishing the tourism  zones in the Linnix and Gilbert groups,   developing hotels in Kanton and selected  islands in Linnix and Gilbert groups, making  Tabuaeran a major surfing destination, and  developing mandatory Tourism and  Hospitality operational and standards for all  tourism business operators that will  incorporate Covid-19 protocols.    TAK also recognises that it is mostly about  improving its tourism product and the quality  of its services, before it is able to establish a  tourism brand with PIPA.  If the product is  well established, and of good quality and  promoted properly with a good marketing  approach (online), it could build a good and  trusted brand for tourists  Game fishing is  one area that tourism is looking to develop  and promote in the Gilbert Islands. This  tourism activity has vast potential and  travellers from Australia, New Zealand, USA  and Europe are visiting our shores for game  fishing.      5.4 Air, Sea and Land transportation and Infrastructure    The KV20 identifies transportation and its infrastructure to be key complementary drivers to  economic development. These are expensive investments but if these investments are properly  analysed and monitored, they will be very beneficial to the public and the future generation.  Government has committed to these projects, and seeing that some will not immediately reap  benefits, however Government believes that in the future these investments will eventually grow  the economy. For instance, the cost and benefit analysis on the Embraer jet shows that the  financial and social benefit of having and operating the jet will surpass its costs in five to seven  years of operation.  Expansion of these services and infrastructure will also pose risks and therefore  an effective monitoring and risk assessment mechanism is necessary.     Clear blue waters at one of the resorts in Kiribati   Game fishing in Kiritimati Island          10   The airport will stimulate economic activity,  there are only two international airports in  Kiribati; one on South Tarawa and one on  Kiritimati Island.  In addition, there are 19  airports in the outer islands which are used for  domestic services, mostly made of reef-mud and  require upgrading and additional maintenance  work to improve the deteriorating runway  surface conditions, to support frequent air  operations and to meet the traveling demand.  The Airport Act, was passed in 2018 and  became an Airport Authority in April 2019.     The AKA (Airport Kiribati Authority) aims to enable Kiribati to upgrade air transport standards  and venture into jet operations for an improved international route for AKL. So a major project  for the AKA to support the Embraer operation is the upgrading of the KANTON Airport to an  EDTO alternate airport. This is for the Embraer to operate between Tarawa and Kiritimati Island.    Air Kiribati Ltd (AKL) is a 100% government owned airline and the only domestic air operations  provider in Kiribati. AKL is dedicated to providing affordable transportation to and from Tarawa  to the outer islands, including operations in Kiritimati. AKL's key objectives includes improving  safety and compliance, with AOC certification -  which is a requirement for full safety  compliance. AKL will satisfy all key  requirements for safety and compliance in terms  of nominated persons, systems, proper finances,  and accepted manual exposition set-in place.  Also, to improve reliability and capability of the  airline to meet the growing public demand for  air transportation in Kiribati with more efficient  service, and with modern airplanes and  infrastructure development. AKL also aims to  improve financial viability to minimise  government subsidy (CSO) to the company.     Major plans for developments in domestic and international operations have been analysed,  findings suggested that the international operation will make good profits.  Similarly, domestic  operations with a new domestic fleet will serve the right flight schedule that meets the public  increasing demand for air flights but also generate good profits, hence government subsidy will be  less needed in the future, and AKL will be a profitable company. AKL will also cease loss-making  activities.                      Bonriki Airport in South Tarawa   Air Kiribati Embraer Jet   Bonriki International Airport, South Tarawa Dash-8, AKL      11   AKL had conducted aircraft study to identify the best option for an aircraft type for its domestic  fleet.  The TECNAM 2012 Traveller will cost $28M for seven aircrafts, these airplanes are the  right fit for Kiribati for their size and capacity, and costs saving features. The nine seater TECNAM  airplane will also guarantee more flight services and will operate at a profit compared to a higher  number of passengers for a larger airplane like the twin otter to breakeven. One of AKL’s main  obstacle is the high cost of fuel which has greatly affect the company’s ability to make large  marginal profits. Because of this, Government is subsidizing AKL to sustain the domestic air  travels, however with the introduction of the TECNAM to replace the domestic fleet, AKL could  make profits and therefore will need less of Government subsidy.     AKL will offer international air service with the Embraer jets, although this project has stalled  because of the Covid-19 pandemic,  however the plan to set up international operations is still a  possible endeavour, activities are in-line, including setting up office in Brisbane. It also includes  using the jet to service the route Tarawa/Kiritimati Island, which will need a EDTO alternate in  Kanton Island. This requires the Kanton Airport to be upgraded. The AKA project in remediating  and upgrading the Kanton Airport will complement this Government venture for AKL to service  this route. Tourism in Kanton will also be the next target to develop when the airport is set up  and running.    AKL also plans to build prefab office buildings  as the existing ones have been condemned by  structural survey. A hangar is also required to  house airplanes and assets, which will require an  environmental assessment on the construction  site. Further, AKL will also establish a  nationalised training academy or a training  centre to help develop local talent and provide  long-term career path options at Air Kiribati.      Furthermore, AKL aims to achieve its goals and  improve financial viability (and CSO  independent) by reducing costs and increasing  revenue. These planned activities for AKL not only are realistic for the four years, they paint a  brighter future in flying and air transportation for the public and the nation. The majority of the  projects may depend greatly on capital investments that Government will put into, however good  analyses and projections are in place to guarantee their successes.    Underpinning the success of an aviation industry in Kiribati is an effective regulator. The Civil  Aviation Authority of Kiribati (CAAK) was first established as a corporate body in 2015 under the  Civil Aviation Act that aims to achieve a cohesive, safe, responsive, and sustainable regulatory  system for air transportation in Kiribati, its focus is to establish a safe and secure skies for I-Kiribati  and tourists. In an evolving aviation industry, the CAAK is facing challenges as it continues to  respond to an increased need for the regulatory and security services to keep people safe and  secure.    The major changes and challenges ahead for CAAK in Keeping people safe, is keeping up with a  complex security environment  combined with a growing aviation environment (post Covid-19);  Ensuring that people feel safe as new technology is adopted – as well as ensuring that people are  able to participate in the aviation system without unnecessary obstacles; and also ensuring that  CAAK’s regulations keep people safe by better managing risks in the system, along with a focus  on performance and outcome rather than just ‘ticking the boxes’.   Bonriki Airport terminal and AKL’s hangar      12   With technological advancements, the Kiribati Aviation System has been challenged continuously  and therefore the CAAK is working hard to adapt and respond to new technology, to ensure there  are no unnecessary barriers to entering the system, while ensuring safety. This requires that the  CAAK effectively identifies and manages emerging risks, and also considering other factors  besides safety into the decision making – for example, on climate change.    As part of the CAAK’s regulatory responsibility an inspection and audit to service providers, such  as Air Kiribati Limited, Airport Kiribati Authority and other aviation participants, is being  conducted on a regular basis to ensure compliance to the requirements. For ICAO compliance,  Kiribati is operating in accordance with the Standards and recommended practices, an audit has  to be conducted to ensure safety regulation is effective. Capacity building is also on the top of the  list for CAAK personnel to get the required training to improve their knowledge and skills for  effective performance of duties and responsibilities and be able to support a safe and reliable air  service.    In addition to its regulatory functions, the CAAK is currently working on the delineation of  Kiribati Airspace which has been placed under the Nadi, Oakland and Tahiti FIR during the  Colonial times. This is one crucial assignment to expand Kiribati Sovereignty rights of its upper  airspace boundary and to explore the best service provider to manage Kiribati upper airspace with  the most viable financial arrangement. The proceeds from this can assist to fund other activities  to improve Kiribati aviation facilities, infrastructure, and air navigation services.    Access to the Outer Islands from the Capital (South Tarawa) is challenging due to inadequate  infrastructure: wharves, ramps, piers and ports, boat channels, passages and Aids to Navigation  (AToNs).    The Marine Division continually plays its roles to maintain its functions as a Maritime  Administration of Kiribati. It oversees its mission to provide professional, quality advice and  services to the shipping industry and the maritime training organization in compliance with IMO  convention, and it endeavours to continue targeting its main priorities in the development of the  maritime sector within the territorial waters surrounding the largest 200 nautical mile EEZ in the  Pacific region, consisting of the Gilbert Group and Banaba, the Phoenix Group and the Line  Group further in the east.    The Marine Division is responsible for all maritime regulations in Kiribati, Aids to Navigation,  Marine Guard (Tarawa and Kiritimati), Search and Rescue (SAR), Ship and vessel registration,  Seafarer Licensing, Marine Pollution and Registry; Hydrography to ensure boat passages are safe  and navigable (under SOLAS); providing safety and navigational warnings to the general public;  and including all other maritime matters that are relevant to the safety of life, marine environment  and to Kiribati. It operates with strict guidance of its Quality Management System to meet its  obligations under certain IMO requirements and subjects to undergo regular impartial audits to  maintain eminence and to function as a Maritime Administration for Kiribati as a member state.  The Marine Division also provides a 24/7 radio watch for the safety of maritime traffic, and also  provide the needed search and rescue services to prevent loss of lives at sea.      13        The Marine Division works closely with national stakeholders and regional communities to deliver  the best services through safe, secure and efficient shipping. However, there are still challenges for  the Marine Division that requires full commitment and funding. Among others,  for instance, there  is an ongoing need to provide safe passages for boats to reach the shores of islands with no  lagoons, or islands without easy access to land, this will cost the government a total of  $100 Million  dollars to cover all the islands of Kiribati. Also, to establish and improve wharfs/jetties and ramps  for domestic travel and cargo shipments will cost $167 Million.  Aid to Navigation which is a  mandatory requirement, and boat ramps which will allow easy reach of landing crafts to shores for  quick handling of cargoes,  vehicles, etc also need regular maintenance and repair.      The Kiribati Port Authority (KPA) operates the two main ports of entry; Betio port in Tarawa  island and the other in Kiritimati island. The primary function of the KPA is to facilitate safe  passage of cargo, and people from overseas vessels through the port and facilitate border control  and statutory processing.  The KPA intends to improve the performance and delivery of this  function over the coming years through ongoing performance of operational structure towards a  more cost efficient and energy saving approach, ongoing maintenance of existing facilities and  equipment, development of new systems and facilities, and the acquisition of new equipment  considered necessary to promote efficient service and to replace those considered to be beyond  repair.  KPA depends heavily on machines to  produce efficient service but procuring these  machines are expensive. Despite this difficulty,  the KPA endeavours to maintain a profitable  operation in order to replace out of date  equipment or to procure new machinery when  required. Some major projects for the KPA are;  the port expansion, Betio and Bairiki wharf  rehabilitation, these projects will need major  funding that  the Government and  Development Partners may assist with  especially for projects that are costly and beyond  the KPA’s capability and resources.     The lack of funding and resource was one of the major challenges encountered by the KPA in the  2020 MSP progress rating, achieving 63% progress in all activities for 2020. Several of KPA’s  major plans in the next four years, is to purchase more new machineries to improve cartage of  containers, expect completion of pavement of the container yard in the year 2022, and commence   Shipping containers arriving KPA      14   work on the port expansion – construction of new berth sites near the “Korekorea” corner, to  rehabilitate the Bairiki wharf, and to also construct the new KPA office in Kiritimati Island.    The Kiribati National Shipping Line (KNSL) is  the only Government owned shipping company  that provide shipping service in Kiribati prior to  the entry of the private sector. It currently  focuses on providing shipping services on a  monthly shipping service to all islands in the  Gilbert Group. KNSL which was re-organised in  2018, have an important role and responsibility  as an arm of Government to provide a  responsive and appropriate shipping service to  the people of Kiribati by supporting and  implementing relevant national socio-economic  policies and programmes. In establishing a safer, reliable, and efficient shipping line, the KNSL  adopted a mission to ‘Serve the People with safe, efficient and affordable shipping’. This is in line  with the KNSL vision to create an ‘Unparalleled sea transport service and leading maritime  solution provider that enables socio-economic development in Kiribati.’ Given the high demand  for goods shipping and on-time cargo delivery, the two operational vessels are not enough to meet  all shipping transport needs, particularly, at shipping peak times. Therefore, a great need to acquire  more vessels for the Company to maximise the Company’s profits.            In previous years, KNSL has been working closely with MICTTD on the procurement of  additional vessels to complete the KNSL fleet; this includes acquiring the tug-and-barge (thanks  to PRC who has agreed to provide the tug & barge vessel for KNSL), Landing craft for the Line  and Phoenix Islands, and the multi-purpose vessel (to replace MV Matangare).    Land transportation and infrastructure are equally vital for economic development. Nonetheless,  the South Tarawa road network is the only and recently improved road in the entire nation. The  Kiribati Land Transport Authority (KLTA) is a corporate entity responsible for the administration  and regulatory of vehicle licenses, driving licenses, and all activities that are within the premises of  the highway, including road blocks and feeder roads.      LC-Aratoba loading cargoes   KNSL’s LC-Aratoba KNSL’s LC-Linnix      15   The mission of the KLTA is “Endeavour to  become a professional, effective, and efficient  land transport authority founded on safety with  a focus on customer satisfaction”. Its Vision is  “Moving Kiribati Safely”.  KLTA is planning to  reach out to the outer islands and Kiritimati  island and in the four years, this will progress  through to complement the road construction  project in all of the outer islands.  Under the new  regulations for the KLTA many changes have  emerged, policies and regulations have been  improved, however some challenges remain, such as lack of resource to maintain and repair the  roads - the need for machineries and operators of the machines, which have been identified to be   costly projects and therefore the KLTA is  planning to approach development partners for  financial support.     Furthermore, the KLTA is strictly controlling  imported vehicles to Kiribati by the 10-year  import vehicle policy, as second-hand vehicles  pour in from Japan. This is an alarming issue  that should be controlled as early as possible  before road congestions, space for vehicle  parking, and vehicle wrecks will be difficult to  manage in the future.     5.5 Access to communication technologies and quality information and services    The ICT Policy and Development Division of MICTTD is responsible for advising the  Government on ICT related matters, coordinating the development of national ICT related  Policies such as the National ICT Policy, coordination of ICT projects throughout Kiribati,  promoting the use of ICT in the country, responsible for cyber security advice and awareness  programs for the general public. Recently the Division was responsible for leading the  development of the eGovernment Roadmap which sets a high-level plan for e-Government in  Kiribati.    The overall progress on all activities for the ICT at the end of the year 2020 was 79%. One major  factor contributing to the overall progress for the ICT last year was budget constraint, most of its  core activities/projects require huge funding, for instance, the e-Government project to improve  efficiency and effectiveness of services, and overseas trainings for capacity building of ICT officers  to support other sectors. Also the closure of the borders in respect to Covid-19 pandemic have  affected most of ICT’s progress in the last year.     The ICT’s GWAN (Government wide-area network) project will connect all Ministries to a one- stop source for access into public sector information and electronic services. This will improve  efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery and also promote transparency and openness for  Government processes and procedures. The Cyber Crime Bill will be enacted to strengthen the  National Cyber security capacity, to protect the public from cyber threats. The ICT will also  upgrade the MICTTD website and update all MICTTD computers with updated antivirus. The  other major ICT on-going projects is the Mobile rollout project in the outer islands for the   JSS students on the road after school   Enforcement officer on patrol motor cycle next to Patrol vehicle      16   remaining islands Teraina and Tabuaeran. Also, improvement of mobile coverage to the islands of  Makin, Butaritari, Abemama, Tab North and Onotoa are targeted in 2021.    CCK is a regulator for the telecom service, one of its core purpose is to address the issue of barriers  to entry and encourage fair competition in the telecom industry, the successful arrangement with  both the telecom companies being able to connect their services, where the public can now  exchange calls and receive messages between both networks ATHKL (now Vodafone) and Ocean- link (OLL) was one of the milestones achieved. Telecom wide coverage that reaches the more  remote communities and the outer islands and are key objectives, which also aims to reach groups  of people like the disabled and handicapped persons, and also to provide services for disaster and  emergency cases. In 2021, one new initiative of the CCK is to conduct surveys to identify the  needs of disabled persons in the ICT products and services and provide at least 10 products that  serve their needs in ICT - no one is left behind.    The BPA is a radio broadcasting and newspaper company formally established in 1979. Its core  function is to provide local and international media and dissemination of accurate news -  informational and educational media, and entertainment to the national public through the Kiribati  radio and the national newspaper “Te Uekera” and other authorized publications.    In this medium-term plan, BPA aims to improve and develop its core services especially on radio  broadcasting, newsprint services and to also introduce video production and TV servicee. It targets  to acquire two upgraded radio transmitters for South Tarawa and for Kiritimati Island by 2022.  BPA also looks at developing its infrastructure and buildings as the current building is old and  needs a major repair. It plans to purchase a new printing machine for its Uekera newspaper in  2021 and to develop the TV service system over the four years.    BPA also plans to design a more competitive strategy, to establish a better market share for each  of its production segments, this way BPA can generate more revenue and reach out to more  customers in the outer islands. BPA’s ambitious plan for the future is to connect all the islands of  Kiribati, to enable all I-Kiribati to access good quality radio service, newspaper, and TV service  wherever they are.    BwebwerikiNet Ltd (BNL) is an SOE, under the MICTTD and represents the Government’s  interest to support and improve voice and data telecommunications network in the Outer Islands,  an international submarine cable venture with government entities from Nauru and FSM, the East  Micronesia Cable System, and also provides needed support to the establishment of an  international submarine cable venture with Southern Cross, the Southern Cross (NEXT).           The current internet connection across Kiribati uses satellite technology. Government in  partnership with the World Bank and the ADB are jointly funding the submarine cable project.   Construction Work at the new Kiritimati Island SX NEXT Cable Landing Station      17   This will connect Tarawa with the East Micronesia Cable, and Kiritimati with SX-NEXT Cable  Network. The fibre optic cable network will provide more speed and cheaper internet for the  public. The system will connect Kiribati to FSM and onwards to Guam for global access. The  Kiritimati cable network is expected to operate in January 2022 and for Tarawa in 2023.     BNL is also responsible for operating and maintaining the Outer Island Network and is working  at refurbishing the infrastructure to ensure quality service is maintained all throughout the islands  of Kiribati.                      18   5.6 Support Services    The Ministry administered supporting services that are vital for its office and operational functions  to provide quality service to the public. Human resource capacity building is an ongoing need for  the Ministry to meet demands from the evolving and regulatory needs from its highly specialized  departments. As tourism, air, sea, ports and land transportations are expanding, so does the need  to meet the required skills. A lot of these skill-sets are dictated by international regulatory bodies  and audits to meet the required standards set mostly for functionality and safety for instance on  civil aviation and the airline. Hence, there is a great need to meet and comply with all the required  international standards, which means better and safer for the people. The Admin Division’s  objective is improving work performance and productivity, encourage openness and transparency,  and accountability.  Several of their major plans in achieving these goals were the introduction of  an award system for staff to encourage productivity, establish monitoring and evaluation of staff  performance, and capacity building which remain one of the top priorities that aims to ensure  better work quality and output from the Ministry staff.    The Postal Division is the national and only postal service provider in the country, providing  universal postal services to the government and people under the Postal Services Act (Cap 74 of  Kiribati Law) and Universal Postal Service regulations.  It is a member of the Universal Postal  Union (UPU). The core function of Postal is to provide efficient delivery of mails and money  transfer services and produce high quality philatelic products.  With a substantial increase of parcel  mails volume there is a significant need to improve International Postal System (IPS.POST) and  Express Mail Service (EMS) for fast and efficient mail delivery.  Further, Postal provide tele-money  transfer and this is the only money transfer service that is widely used by the people on the outer  Islands, however the current system is time consuming and old-fashion. The introduction of a  fast-tele-money system is underway. With a high demand for international money transfer service  and high-quality philatelic products, there is a need to expand the money transfer service and  maintain the high quality of philatelic products.      The Government Printery (GP) is established to provide central printing services to government  ministries. It manages and is responsible for the production of standard forms, documents, secured  stationeries and publications for government. The other important and very specific role is the  printing of seamen discharge books and other maritime booklets. There is significant need to  improve government printing capacity and quality of the printed materials, with state-of-the-art  machineries to meet the demand of government ministries and some of the general public that  cannot be taken up by private firms.    In the centre of the Ministry and SOE’s business, there is always the need  to maintain effective  and efficient registry, account and customer services systems. The provision of service required  from the counter to office and to elsewhere is essential, without much focus on the necessary and  quality service delivery, it can lead to a dysfunctional Ministry and its SOEs.    The approach that MICTTD has identified for effective development is having enough regulation  to support better service, but another is to also produce more autonomous bureaus, that can  support their own operations financially and sustainably. This strategy is aimed to address the  Ministry’s diverse nature, and to give that specialized function to the new Authority or SOE to  run and operate on itself with less financial assistance and tension from the Ministry. This will  allow the Ministry to focus on its core functions as a Ministry - administrator and caretaker of its  divisions and SOEs.        19   6. Goals, Objectives, and Strategic Actions    The main goal for the Ministry and SOEs in this plan is “To improve transportation,  communication, information technology, postal and printery through infrastructure development,  continuous improvement, efficient and effective service to support Government and the people,  and to contribute to the economic development.”    Based on the KV20, KDP, and the Motinnano 2020. It has identified four goals to be relevant to  the responsibilities and objectives of the Ministry and its SOEs. Strategies have been drawn from  these goals, the Motinnano also plays a pivotal role to inform these strategies to deliver what  Government has promised the public for better access, more benefits and leaving no one behind.      Goals Strategies   Develop and strengthen sustainable Tourism  development to boost economic  development.   • Developing sustainable tourism  • Improved marketing, promotion, and   public awareness of the tourism  industry   Strengthen air, sea and land transportation  and infrastructures to meet social demands  and complement economic enhancing  activities.   • To improve air, land and sea transport  infrastructure   • Human capacity to operate new  Government infrastructure to quality  standards   • To harmonize infrastructural  development for tourism   • Build and provide necessary  infrastructure for development such  as air and sea ports   • Provide/improve access between  Tarawa and the outer islands     To improve access to Communication  technologies and access to quality  information and services to all the people of  Kiribati.     • To develop and improve ICT  infrastructure and services and  expand service to the outer islands   • To develop the fiber optic cable for  Tarawa and Kiritimati for faster and  cheaper internet connection.   • To provide all islands of Kiribati  access to radio, newspaper, and tv  services.

Ministry Operational Plan and SOE’s Sector plans    The KPIs in the KDP reflects international and regional conventions, and government policies. It  also includes a set of indicators to enable progress in each KPI to be monitored and evaluated.  Future MOPs (short-term year plans for Ministry Divisions) and the SOE’s plans (SOIs) are to be  aligned with the key objectives and action strategies stated in this strategic plan.    Therefore, the MSP2021-2024 is a guide for Divisions and SOEs to develop their annual or semi- annual plans and to inform management and the Boards way-forward on what has been planned  for the medium-term (four years), however this will not restrict for new plans or modified plans,  changes are considered for the next review of this medium-term plan. It is a live work-plan and is  subject to change following changed situations, although all the activities in this plan will be  monitored every quarter of the year.    7.1 Result management     The importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration is  apparent in many of the strategic actions in this Strategic Plan, there are mostly infrastructure  projects that are costly, and development partners are involved in. For instance, the fibre optics  cable (submarine cable) project, or the purchase of a tug & barge that PRC (China) has shown  interest in purchasing for the KNSL, the purchase of the AKL domestic fleet, etc. A results  management is key for monitoring and evaluation and this will need the support of our  counterparts from other GOK departments and our development partners.    7.2 Domestic coordination    In working towards the objectives in this Strategic Plan, there are opportunities for strengthening  coordination between the MICTTD, SOEs and other GOK departments and agencies, and with  NGOs and community-based groups. This includes collaborating on issues, such as with the  Public Service Office (PSO) on objectives relating to workforce planning and human resource  development, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) on investigating  alternative sources of financing and analysis of investments, and the National Statistics Office to  build capacity in the collection and analysis of information. It also includes working with others  more directly to coordinate support on implementing specific programme and interventions.     The Strategic Plan notes a number of existing mechanisms for coordinating planning and  implementation of initiatives, such as the MICTTD Coordinating Committee. Where they are not  formalised structures or systems for coordination on specific programs or broader system issues,  the benefits of establishing such processes will be investigated as part of the implementation of  this Strategic Plan.    8. Coordination with development partners    The MICTTD is committed to build strong relationships with numerous bi-lateral and  international development partners. The partners have provided technical assistance and funding  for a number of programs, infrastructure, and workforce development and training.     To strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and the support from donors and development  partners, the Ministry will need to establish a MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee  (MDCC) in order to strengthen the coordination and support, and planning and delivery of      26   services in Kiribati. The MDCC will comprises of the Senior Management Team (SMT) of the  MICTTD and representatives from Australian DFAT, New Zealand MFAT, Japan, PRC (China),  SPC, SPTO, PIPA, ADB and the World Bank.     The strong commitment of the Ministry in engaging with these developing partners, provides an  opportunity to integrate this support into the Strategic Plan. To this end, the MDCC will support  the implementation of this Strategic Plan through providing the mechanism to the following:       1. Assist with identifying priority areas for funding and with the efficient mobilisation of   resources, through working together to coordinate assistance, to give effect to the  MICTTD and SOE plan.    2. Promote integrated, multi-sectoral and regional initiatives that are consistent with the  Strategic Plan.    3. Identify initiatives to promote improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of  service delivery.    4. Review progress of activities against the indicators and targets in the Strategic Plan.   5. Report to the Government of Kiribati and development partners on the implementation   of the Strategic Plan, including in such a way that rationalises reporting and other  accountability processes to promote greater efficiency    6. The MDCC will meet once or twice per year during the period of this Strategic Plan. One  meeting per annum will focus on the review of progress against the Strategic Plan. At the  following meeting, in each annual cycle, the MICTTD will present an annual action plan  for the next year for discussion and agreement.    7. One or two members of the MDCC will have oversight on each strategic objective in the  Strategic Plan. These members are not responsible for implementation of the objective;  they are responsible for overseeing the MDCC’s role in relation to the objective.       9. Monitoring    The MICTTD’s Senior Management Team and the Planning Unit (MICTTD) is responsible for  monitoring the implementation of this strategic plan. The Planning Unit will coordinate the  collection and analysis of information and data to report on the indicators and targets in the plan.  It will provide progress updates on the activities to the SMT on a quarterly basis, and also report  on issues.    One of the challenges that the Ministry is keen to tackle immediately is collection and consolidation  of information and data. Whilst this needs a better system or mechanism to coordinate in order to  collect (data), it will certainly assist to provide the relevant information required by the SMT and  the MDCC, as well as development partners, for reporting and making decisions for future funding  of projects.    This MSP will become a tool for the Ministry and its SOEs. The indicators in this strategic plan  will be monitored, reported, and used for developing shorter-term plans (MOPs).

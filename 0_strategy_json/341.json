The strategy is based on the general principles of Fin- land’s cyber security strategy of 2013. Finland’s goal remains to be among the top experts in cyber secu- rity internationally. The implementation of nation- al cyber security is linked to the Security Strategy of the Society (2017) and to the general principles of preparedness and security coordination as de- scribed in the Security Strategy, as well as to the principles of the competent authority. The strategy and its implementation are also part of the imple- mentation of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The need to update the cyber security strategy has been influenced by significant changes in the op- erating environment and identified development needs in the work at the national level. The devel- opment of the digital operating environment offers new significant opportunities associated with, for example, with platform economy, ecosystems, new service production models and the development of terminal equipment and telecommunications. On the other hand, the operating environment faces not only known risks, such as human mistakes, but also evolving and changing threats that may endan- ger the vital functions of society, in particular cy- ber crime, espionage, state intelligence and various forms of hybrid influencing. Several studies have been conducted on the state of national cyber se- curity in Finland.2 The proposals that were made as a result were taken into account in this strategy and they will also be taken into account in the develop- ment programme that will be prepared on the ba- sis of the strategy. The cyber security strategy 2019 will launch the preparation of the National Cyber Security Devel- opment Programme. A new management coordi- nation model supports the preparation of the de- velopment programme, taking into account the planning and cooperation for cyber security for public administration and the business communi- ty. The programme will improve the cyber security situation picture and integrate planning with other activities, such as economic planning. 1 Cyber security is understood as a space in which the cyber environment can be trusted and its functioning is secured (Vocabulary of Cyber Security 2018). The cyber environment, on the other hand, can be understood in the same way as the digital environment, which evolves rapidly as part of society and as services. 2 The VTT report on cyber competence in Finland (2016) presents 12 measures to further develop and strengthen cyber security compe- tence in Finland. A report by Jyväskylä University and Aalto University on the current state of cyber security in Finland (2017) highlights the identified shortcomings and development needs, and these have been divided into 12 areas. In addition, the National Audit Office of Finland has published a report on the organisation of cyber protection in Finland (2017), containing five positions and four recommendations for the development of the whole. The Ministry of Justice’s report on the preconditions for online voting in Finland (2017) examined how to conduct online voting. The working group does not recommend the introduction of online voting in Finland, as its risks currently outweigh its benefits. Prepared by Jyväskylä University and Aalto University, a report on the strategic management of cyber security in Finland (2018) proposed measures to manage strategic cyber security in society and public administration, to manage major disruptions in the cyber envi- ronment and to measure the state of cyber security. INTRODUCTION 5 FINLAND’S CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2019 Finland strives to secure its cyber environment while enjoying active support internationally and through EU cooperation. International cooperation is vital for Finland’s cyber security as it benefits Finland to closely cooperate with international actors multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally. This is true for cooperation and dia- logue on both technical and political levels. International cooperation relies on the existing inter- national law, international treaties and respect for human rights also in the cyber environment. Finland wants to maintain a universal, free and stable inter- net and to enable its safe use. Finland does not ac- cept the aim of restricting the freedom and openness of the internet and, consequently, the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. In all cooperation on cyber security, Finland emphasises the rule of law, democracy and transparency. To solve international cyber security challenges, Fin- land plays an active role in the European Union and in key international organisations (UN, OECD, OSCE, Council of Europe, the framework of NATO partner- ship programmes). This is part of strengthening the international rules-based system, which is a key ob- jective in Finland’s foreign policy. The decisions of the European Union and cooper- ation within the EU provide the backbone for Fin- land’s national cyber security policy and its develop- ment. Finland is actively involved in developing the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy on Cyber Security. In addition, the EU’s renewed cyber securi- ty strategy and key legislative projects, such as the EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS), have a strong impact on the development of cyber security also at national level. The cyber environment is protected by increasing the threshold for different types of cyber attacks, for example by improving the observation and attribu- tion capacity of cyber attacks and the ability to re- spond. Counter-measures may consist, for example, of law enforcement measures, diplomatic measures or active cyber counter-measures. The EU’s guide- lines for the development of strong cyber defence are taken into account in the development of coun- ter-measures. Within the framework of the EU, Fin- land contributes to the fight against cyber crime through international cooperation by justice and law enforcement authorities and by contributing to the development of international law and agreements. DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION – protection of the cyber environment without borders1. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES 6 FINLAND’S CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2019 The overall state of national cyber secu- rity will improve through a development programme and by promoting coopera- tion in planning and monitoring. So far, the implementation programmes of the 2013 cyber security strategy have been based sole- ly on proposals from actors committed to its devel- opment and the partly sectoral work of the com- petent authorities. Effective cyber security planning requires that the necessary financial resources and cooperation are taken into account with sufficient precision in each administrative branch. This will be improved by a cyber security development pro- gramme extending beyond government terms; this will replace the earlier implementation pro- gramme. The programme will concretise nation- al cyber security policies and clarify the overall pic- ture of cyber security projects, research and devel- opment programmes. The post of Cyber Security Director will be estab- lished at the Ministry of Transport and Communi- cations to coordinate the national development of cyber security. The role of the Cyber Security Director is to ensure the coordination of the development, planning and preparedness of cyber security in society. The set- ting up of this post does not change the cyber secu- rity related responsibilities and powers of the min- istries and competent authorities. The Cyber Secu- rity Director also acts as an adviser to the central government in cyber security related matters. Un- der his or her leadership, the overall picture and development programme of cyber security will be developed, drawing on the expertise of ministries, the Security Committee and cyber security actors. When drawing up the development programme, it will be ensured that representatives of the cyber security industry, cyber research institutes and key organisations responsible for important public sec- tor services participate in its preparation. The aim of this network structure is to deepen cooperation between the public administration and the busi- ness community. The management of incidents affecting the cyber environment and cooperation at the operational level will be developed between cyber security ac- tors. In the management of incidents, a general in- cident management model will be used and, where necessary, the meeting of the heads of prepared- ness will be used. Cyber security preparedness requires cooperation among various actors in society, the central gov- ernment and the business community sa well as BETTER COORDINATION OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT, planning and preparedness 2. 7 FINLAND’S CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2019 Interdependencies in the digital operating environment require a comprehensive architec- ture that takes cyber security into account. skills strengthening in different sectors. Interde- pendencies in the digital operating environment require a comprehensive architecture that takes cyber security into account. Continuity of opera- tions and preparedness for incidents require ex- pertise in procurement and tendering, implemen- tation assessment of contractual obligations and comprehensive management of the supplier net- work and supply chains. Other strategic measures for developing a sub-area: • The information resources, digital services and in- frastructure that are necessary for the vital func- tions of society will be defined. Target levels will be set for functions and service chains that are related to managing continuity of activities at the national level. • Requirements management will be improved and harmonised in security-critical services as required by national security and in compliance with standards. The verification, testing, evalua- tion and recommendations for use of products and entire solution environments related to criti- cal functions will be developed to ensure that re- quirements are met. • With regard to new legislation on intelligence and other sectors, cyber security cooperation among the authorities will be developed in the development programme. Key development ar- eas include cyber defence and the prevention of cyber threats that endanger national security. In addition, legislation enabling the fight against cy- ber crime will be developed in such a way that it enables effective prevention and investigation. • The Cyber Security Centre’s ability to compile 24/7 situational awareness and cooperation among the authorities and the business commu- nity will be further developed. This will promote Finland’s ability to identify and warn against in- formation security threats and to improve the opportunities of the business community and public administration to prepare for information security threats. • The use and development of digital services by security authorities and critical actors in the busi- ness community will be secured by specially pro- tected solutions that utilise and complement commercial services in accordance with the ex- isting legislation. • The businesses that provide critical services and continuity management for society’s vital func- tions will be supported. The position of business- es is clarified when the target level of tasks is de- fined and the support mechanisms provided by the authorities are developed. Clear targets will be set for the responsible authorities to devel- op cyber security. For example, the authorities can promote the achievement of cyber security targets by including them in commercial agree- ments and, as far as the most important parts are concerned, they must make legislation more specific when necessary. 8 FINLAND’S CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2019 National cyber security competence will be ensured by identifying require- ments and strengthening education and research. Finnish society needs cyber security competence both in public administration and in the business community. National cyber security will be built in cooperation among the authorities, the busi- ness community, organisations and citizens, when everyone can contribute to our shared cyber se- curity. Each individual is therefore an important cyber security actor who can improve cyber secu- rity through his or her actions on a daily basis and thus impact his or her own cyber security and that of others. At the national level, it must be ensured that everyone has sufficient capacity to operate safely in a digital environment. In order to manage cyber security risks, the author- ities and companies need wide-ranging expertise from both employees and subcontractors. At the national level, it must be ensured that companies have both top-level experts and other competent personnel. Skills development is also emphasised in the cooperation between the business commu- nity and research. Close cooperation, exchange of information on customer needs and development of services can create significant new skills on the national market alone. As far as competences and the competitive edge are concerned, it is important for national compa- nies to find new ways to keep their top talents as international competition increases. Finland’s com- petitive edge is improved when international in- formation security standards support products that are manufactured by Finnish companies. It is therefore important to continue to actively contrib- ute to standardisation work and to produce prod- ucts that have built-in security; this is how Finnish businesses can have better opportunities to suc- ceed in international competition in areas where they are strong. From the perspective of cyber security in society and the business community, it is essential to inte- grate cyber security into the activities of business- es which are not involved in producing cyber secu- rity related products, services and solutions. Com- panies whose actual business is outside the cyber security sector but whose activities are significantly affected by cyber security and related incidents will play an increasingly important role in the future. In particular legislative projects relating to network and information security have identified, for exam- ple, telecommunications, production and distribu- DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER SECURITY COMPETENCE – everyday skills and top skills as cyber security safeguards 3. 9 FINLAND’S CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 2019 National cyber security will be built in cooperation among the authorities, the business community, organisations and citizens, when everyone can contribute to our shared cyber security. tion of energy, the financial and insurance sector, and health care as such areas. The development of cyber security imposes com- petence requirements and cooperation obliga- tions on public administration. Cyber security re- lated guidelines, support and control responsibili- ties of the authorities who are in charge of critical functions, as well as the resources and tools re- quired by them, will be improved in all administra- tive branches and at all administrative levels. Other strategic measures to promote cyber securi- ty competence include: • Training programmes related to cyber and in- formation security, software and application development, information networks and tele- communications in vocational education, uni- versities of applied sciences and universities will be strengthened. • The high level of education required by nation- ally critical cyber competence areas will be en- sured. This is supported by both national and international training and exercises. • National research, development and testing on cyber security will be strengthened. • The national system for training and exercising digital security will be strengthened as part of digital security training in the public adminis- tration. This will develop the skills of personnel in public administration, businesses and other stakeholders as well as of citizens. • The public administration, the business commu- nity and private individuals will be made more aware of information security for new services and products. Cyber security is an essential ele- ment in the data economy and for applications based on artificial intelligence. This requires that manufacturers and service providers trust each other and that citizens trust the services and products that are offered to them.

INTRODUCTION The rapid digital transformation underway in West Africa is of great importance to improve the functioning and efficiency of administrations, public policies and economies, as well as the well-being of populations. However, the growing threats and risks facing global cyberspace and digital networks, information systems and data can significantly reduce the expected benefits of these digital policies, and seriously harm the interests of Nations, their economies, institutions and people. Faced with these threats and risks, robust national cybersecurity and anti-cybercrime organisations should be put in place, with good coordination between the departments concerned, effective response mechanisms to cyberattacks, experts and users of digital services sensitized and trained in good practices, active private sector participation, enhanced protection of the most essential or critical digital services and infrastructure, as well as regional mutual assistance and international cooperation. Clearly, these requirements are still far from being met within the region. Some countries have already set up the necessary institutions and reached a certain degree of preparation, most of the others are still at an insufficient level, constituting a weakness endangering their Nation as much as the rest of the region. In addition, all countries face a shortage of expertise in these areas. All countries are therefore encouraged to develop cybersecurity curricula and to reach a minimum level in cybersecurity and the fight against cybercrime. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the systems in place in the different countries considerably limits any attempt at regional cooperation. Their harmonization must therefore be sought: links and exchanges would be easier and more effective between institutions with perimeters of comparable responsibilities and operating modes; identical requirements and procedures would also ensure the protection of transnational infrastructures in the same way across the region; finally, harmonized penal and criminal procedure provisions would enable an efficient mutual assistance in criminal matters. In this area, ECOWAS has implemented harmonization provisions since 2010: in particular, Supplementary Act A/SA.1/01/10 on personal data protection within ECOWAS sets out the security obligations incumbent on those responsible for processing such data to ensure confidentiality; Supplementary Act A/SA.2/01/10 on electronic transactions within ECOWAS sets the conditions for acceptance of electronic signature; Lastly, Directive C/DIR 1/08/11 on fighting cybercrime within ECOWAS adapts the substantive criminal law and the criminal procedure of Member States to address the cybercrime phenomenon. At the continental level, the 2014 African Union Convention on cybersecurity and personal data protection, known as the Malabo Convention, sets out the cybersecurity and cybercrime measures to be taken at national level. At the global level, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, known as the Budapest Convention, open for signature by all countries, aims to pursue a common criminal policy by adopting suitable legislation, intensify cooperation between Member States in criminal matters and adopt powers sufficient for effectively fighting cybercrime. The objective of this Regional Strategy is to make the most of these advances, to improve the level of national cybersecurity and cybercrime mechanisms, and to develop cooperation and mutual assistance between the countries of the region. It draws on internationally recognized best practices in these areas. These objectives must be achieved without prejudice to the fundamental freedoms and human and peoples' rights contained in the declarations, conventions and other instruments adopted at regional, continental and international level. Page 3 of 10 SECTION II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS A. Overall objective The overall objective of this Strategy is to establish a community strategic framework to be considered by Member States in their national strategies and implemented in their action plans on cybersecurity and the fight against cybercrime before the end of 2022, with the full participation of the ECOWAS Commission for the benefit of this Community Member States. B. Definitions For the purposes of this Regional Strategy, the following definitions shall apply: Critical Infrastructure: a public or private infrastructure or process whose destruction, standstill, illegitimate exploitation or disruption for a defined period of time will cause either loss of lives or significant loss to the economy or damage significantly the reputation of the Member State or its symbols of governance. In this definition, infrastructure includes the networks, systems and the physical or digital data essential for providing this service. This term may refer to a certain system or process whose functioning is critical within the organization; Critical infrastructure operator: public or private operator that operates a critical infrastructure; Critical infrastructure protection (CIP): set of safeguards and actions to protect critical infrastructures from any risks and threats that could cause the total or partial interruption of the essential services they provide; CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team): team responsible for alerting about threats, preventing risks and threats to information systems, reacting to security incidents and aiding in mitigation; Cyber hygiene: all the good practices that each digital player should respect in order to preserve the security of the information system that he uses or for which he acts as an administrator; Cybercrime: criminal activities where computers and information systems are involved either as a primary tool or as a primary target. Cybercrime comprises traditional offences (e.g. fraud, forgery, and identity theft), content-related offences (e.g. on-line distribution of child pornography or incitement to racial hatred) and offences unique to computers and information systems (e.g. attacks against information systems, denial of service and malware); Cybersecurity: set of safeguards and actions to protect the cyberspace and cyber assets from those threats that are associated with or that may harm its networks and information infrastructure. Cybersecurity strives to preserve the availability and integrity of the networks and infrastructure and the confidentiality of the information contained therein; Cyberspace: the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, information systems and Internet of things; Digital data: any representation of facts, information or concepts in a form suitable for processing in a computer system; Essential service: a service where total or partial interruption of which could have a serious impact on the functioning of the Member State, the economy of the country or on the health, safety, security and well-being of citizens, or any combination of these issues that does not rise to the criteria of critical Infrastructures; Essential service operator: public or private operator that provides an essential service; Essential services protection: set of safeguards and actions to protect essential services from any risks and threats that could cause their total or partial interruption; Information and communications technologies (ICT): technologies used to gather, store, use and send information, including technologies that involve the use of computers and any communication system, including any telecommunication system; Page 4 of 10 Information system: any isolated or not isolated device or group of interconnected devices that all or in part carries out automatic processing of data pursuant to a program; Networks: set of means ensuring the supply of an infrastructure with products or services necessary for its operation (communications, energy, logistics, etc.). SECTION III. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1: FORMULATE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AND CYBERCRIME POLICY AND STRATEGY Each Member State should adopt and update at least every five years national cybersecurity and cybercrime policy and strategy1, considering this Regional Strategy, which sets for each of these two domains: - The situation of the country and the challenges it faces; - The political vision of the country; - The strategic objectives to be achieved, deadlines and priorities; - The national governance, roles and assignment of responsibilities; - The objectives in terms of: o strengthening of legislative and regulatory provisions; o standards and requirement rules; o security for critical infrastructure and essential services; o strengthening the institutional framework; o technical capacities and skilled human resources to be acquired; o awareness, communication, education and training; o threat prevention and risk management; o security incidents report; o detection and attribution of attacks; o response in case of an attack; o development of a cybersecurity and cybercrime ecosystem; o synergy in actions at the national level (national dialogue and coordination); o regional and international cooperation; - Actions to be taken to achieve these objectives, the stakeholders to be involved, the deadlines to be met and estimated budgets; - Means to strengthen institutions and capacities and to ensure their sustainability. Each Member State should define a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for the actions planed by its national cybersecurity and cybercrime strategy and implement it at least annually. SECTION IV.

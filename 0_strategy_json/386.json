The innovation in Information and Communication Technology is redefining the dimension of socio-economic development in the world, resulting in commercial, economic, cultural, and social opportunities for users of Cyberspace. This unprecedented growth has ushered in a new era, marked with easy and low-cost access to highly interconnected networks around the globe. With the developments in the ICTs, and reliance on Broadband infrastructure, in particular, the Internet has taken center in today’s modern world. The world is now increasingly interconnected and people have unprecedented access to information and knowledge. To harness the benefits of ICT technologies and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), Pakistan has also adopted the path of Digital Transformation. The increased use of information and communication technologies enhanced global connectivity, mobility, and versatility of digital services exposes information assets to a host of new and evolving Cyber Security threats. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has made these assets highly valuable. However, with the organic growth and proliferation of the Internet, some worrisome trends in the use of cyberspace have also emerged. The concerns over safety and security potentially impede the objective of accelerated development and affect the confidence of people in using applications and services offered to traverse cyberspace. The rise in incidents related to malicious use of ICTs in cyberspace is affecting the integrity and the civil rights protections guaranteed by the state, level-playing field, transparency, and the socio-economic equilibrium by posing security and financial risks to the whole spectrum of users including Individuals, Businesses, Sectors, and States and could potentially impose serious barriers to achieving development goals in various economic sectors. National Cyber Security Policy 2021 2 1.2 REVIEW OF PAKISTAN’S CYBER SECURITY LANDSCAPE In order to ensure the online safety of the citizens of Pakistan and to ensure the security of the digital systems, various initiatives are already in place by different federal & provincial bodies and sectoral regulators under the enactments such as the Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2002 (covering only electronic financial transactions and records), Investigation for Fair Trial Act (IFTA) – 2013, Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organization) Act - 1996 and Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (PECA) 2016 which cover some but not all aspects of information and Cyber Security. In addition, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issues guidelines on Cyber Security for the financial sector, and the PTA has notified the Telecom Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). However, the inter-departmental coordination and holistic approach to address the Cyber Security challenges and their emerging trends requires a special focus on a national level. With regards to setups responsible for Cyber Security in the country, only the selective Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are operational at the organizational level in the public, private, and defense sectors. However, there is a need to enhance existing legislative and institutional frameworks, and strengthen the principal, organization, mandated for national Cyber Security. The legal framework, structures, and processes related to Cyber Security need to be constantly monitored, assessed, and improved. To undertake academic research, National Center for Cyber Security was established in 2018. The HEC has also formulated new academic degrees that include BS, MS, and Ph.D. Cyber Security and MS Systems Security programs. However, the demand and supply gap for digital skills in general and Cyber Security, in particular, is ever-increasing, which underscores the importance of upskilling the existing resources. In the absence of an indigenous national ICT and Cyber Security industry, Pakistan relies heavily on imported hardware, software, and services. This reliance, inadequate national security standards, and weak accreditation National Cyber Security Policy 2021 3 has made computer systems in Pakistan vulnerable to outsider cyberattacks and data breaches through embedded malwares, backdoors, and chipsets. 1.3 CHALLENGES AND RISKS Since data treated as an economic asset, it faces threats and risks like any other asset. To mitigate IT security vulnerabilities, a comprehensive Cyber Security policy is a baseline mechanism to address the following risks and challenges globally. The most important of these are as follows. 1.3.1 Ownership at the Top Information is one of the fundamental pillars of knowledge-based economies. Hence, information being a National asset, its management, governance, and regulation must be synchronized at the National level using all available resources, to secure this time-sensitive valuable asset. Cyber Security requires administrative support due to its sensitive nature, challenging domain, and cross-sectoral application. 1.3.2 Governance and Implementation challenges of Cyber Security Policy and Strategy In the absence of a centralized policy and strategy for Cyber Security, attempts at securing the digital assets of the country are liable to be random and uncoordinated. i. WEAK ENFORCEMENT OF STATUTES The existing legislation related to Cyber Security does not provide effective legal protection of Pakistan’s digital assets. The existing legislation related to Cyber Security is not sufficient to provide an adequate mechanism and there is a dire need to transform it in such a manner that it should keep the interest of the nation in letter and spirit without fail. For that matter, an appropriate legislative structure could help to comply against a centralized and robust compliance framework. ii. ASSESSMENT AND CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT The legal framework, structures, and processes related to Cyber Security require monitoring, assessment, and improvement on a continuous basis or they will lose their viability and become a threat themselves. The National Cyber Security Policy 2021 4 implementation with regards to the compliance framework of Cyber Security policy needs to be constantly monitored, assessed, and improved. For that matter, a holistic approach and appropriate legal and technical structures could help to identify the potential threats and consequences attached thereto, and properly it could investigate and no weak area be left to be exploited by the wrongdoers. 1.3.3 Enforcement of Required Structures and Processes The assurance of Cyber Security requires proper structures and processes for governance, regulation, implementation, and enforcement. Any absence or weakness of the regulation structures poses a threat to Cyber Security. i. Inadequate and Poor Quality of Resources Cyber Security is a rapidly growing field that requires a continually updated set of relevant skills and resources as the inadequacy of the required skills shall lead to weaknesses in Cyber Security. Moreover, bridging the demand and supply gap in the digital workforce is an emerging challenge. The absence of a mechanism for ensuring the quantity and quality of these skills and resources is a threat to the Cyber Security of the country. ii. Lack of Data Governance Countries face the threat of data colonization whereby data is managed, controlled, and processed out of the legal jurisdiction of the country and there is limited or no bilateral agreement among the stakeholders in this regard. Threat actors are liable to pollute the information domain and citizen data may be sold to third parties without due consent or validation. Such proliferation and abuse of data lead to the exploitation of selected segments of society. Weak governance of data, poor data quality, and absence of data stewardship generate unreliable information resources and poses a threat to Cyber Security. iii. Reliance on External Resources With the increasing use of information technology in all domains including operations technology, critical information assets are likely to be exposed to cyber-attacks. In absence of adequate local resources, reliance on external National Cyber Security Policy 2021 5 resources including skills, hardware, and software, is a direct threat to Cyber Security. iv. Challenges of Coordinated Response to Threats and Attacks An effective response to risks, threats, and attacks requires a coordinated effort through a series of response teams (CERTs). The absence of such teams and lack of coordination between them is a major threat. This is majorly due to the weak Cyber Security posture and functions within the affiliate organizations. Empowering support organizations is vital to a successful Cyber Security ecosystem. 1.4 COURSE OF ACTION This Policy will serve as the foundation for the construction of a holistic digital ecosystem with supporting frameworks and components for the delivery of secure, reliable, and standardized digital services, applications, and digital infrastructure. This Policy will drive the fundamental demand in the local IT industry to ensure quality delivery of its products and services. This will provide an opportunity for local & international entrepreneurs and firms to offer core competencies, services, and solutions and offer an opportunity to local industry to become better positioned to compete and prosper on the international stage. The focus will also be on promoting online businesses enabling the smooth running of digital payments within and outside Pakistan. Moreover, to mitigate cyber threats, the country faces today and to improve the national Cyber Security outlook, it is imperative to undertake the strengthening of national Cyber Security capabilities through the development of essential and well-coordinated mechanisms, implementation of security standards and regulations under a policy and legislative framework. In this regard, the Government of Pakistan constituted Cyber Governance Policy Committee (CGPC). Noting the strategic importance of Cyber Security, the present Government has prioritized the formulation of the first National Cyber Security Policy – 2021. This initiative is in conformity with the national cyber vision.

The innovation in Information and Communication Technology is   redefining the dimension of socio-economic development in the world,   resulting in commercial, economic, cultural, and social opportunities for users   of Cyberspace.    This unprecedented growth has ushered in a new era, marked with easy   and low-cost access to highly interconnected networks around the globe. With   the developments in the ICTs, and reliance on Broadband infrastructure, in   particular, the Internet has taken center in today’s modern world.  The world is   now increasingly interconnected and people have unprecedented access to   information and knowledge.     To harness the benefits of ICT technologies and the Fourth Industrial   Revolution (4IR), Pakistan has also adopted the path of Digital Transformation.     The increased use of information and communication technologies   enhanced global connectivity, mobility, and versatility of digital services   exposes information assets to a host of new and evolving Cyber Security   threats. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has made these assets highly valuable.   However, with the organic growth and proliferation of the Internet, some   worrisome trends in the use of cyberspace have also emerged. The concerns   over safety and security potentially impede the objective of accelerated   development and affect the confidence of people in using applications and   services offered to traverse cyberspace.    The rise in incidents related to malicious use of ICTs in cyberspace is   affecting the integrity and the civil rights protections guaranteed by the state,   level-playing field, transparency, and the socio-economic equilibrium by   posing security and financial risks to the whole spectrum of users including   Individuals, Businesses, Sectors, and States and could potentially impose serious   barriers to achieving development goals in various economic sectors.         National Cyber Security Policy 2021   2   1.2 REVIEW OF PAKISTAN’S CYBER SECURITY LANDSCAPE   In order to ensure the online safety of the citizens of Pakistan and to   ensure the security of the digital systems, various initiatives are already in place   by different federal & provincial bodies and sectoral regulators under the   enactments such as the Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2002 (covering only   electronic financial transactions and records), Investigation for Fair Trial Act   (IFTA) – 2013, Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organization) Act - 1996 and   Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (PECA) 2016 which cover some but not all   aspects of information and Cyber Security. In addition, the State Bank of   Pakistan (SBP) issues guidelines on Cyber Security for the financial sector, and   the PTA has notified the Telecom Computer Emergency Response Team   (CERT). However, the inter-departmental coordination and holistic approach   to address the Cyber Security challenges and their emerging trends requires a   special focus on a national level.    With regards to setups responsible for Cyber Security in the country, only   the selective Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are operational   at the organizational level in the public, private, and defense sectors.   However, there is a need to enhance existing legislative and institutional   frameworks, and strengthen the principal, organization, mandated for national   Cyber Security. The legal framework, structures, and processes related to   Cyber Security need to be constantly monitored, assessed, and improved.    To undertake academic research, National Center for Cyber Security   was established in 2018. The HEC has also formulated new academic degrees   that include BS, MS, and Ph.D. Cyber Security and MS Systems Security   programs. However, the demand and supply gap for digital skills in general   and Cyber Security, in particular, is ever-increasing, which underscores the   importance of upskilling the existing resources.    In the absence of an indigenous national ICT and Cyber Security   industry, Pakistan relies heavily on imported hardware, software, and services.   This reliance, inadequate national security standards, and weak accreditation         National Cyber Security Policy 2021   3   has made computer systems in Pakistan vulnerable to outsider cyberattacks   and data breaches through embedded malwares, backdoors, and chipsets.   1.3 CHALLENGES AND RISKS   Since data treated as an economic asset, it faces threats and risks like   any other asset. To mitigate IT security vulnerabilities, a comprehensive Cyber   Security policy is a baseline mechanism to address the following risks and   challenges globally. The most important of these are as follows.    1.3.1 Ownership at the Top     Information is one of the fundamental pillars of knowledge-based   economies. Hence, information being a National asset, its management,   governance, and regulation must be synchronized at the National level using   all available resources, to secure this time-sensitive valuable asset. Cyber   Security requires administrative support due to its sensitive nature, challenging   domain, and cross-sectoral application.    1.3.2 Governance and Implementation challenges of Cyber Security   Policy and Strategy    In the absence of a centralized policy and strategy for Cyber Security,   attempts at securing the digital assets of the country are liable to be random   and uncoordinated.    i. WEAK ENFORCEMENT OF STATUTES    The existing legislation related to Cyber Security does not provide effective   legal protection of Pakistan’s digital assets. The existing legislation related to   Cyber Security is not sufficient to provide an adequate mechanism and there   is a dire need to transform it in such a manner that it should keep the interest   of the nation in letter and spirit without fail. For that matter, an appropriate   legislative structure could help to comply against a centralized and robust   compliance framework.   ii. ASSESSMENT AND CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT   The legal framework, structures, and processes related to Cyber Security   require monitoring, assessment, and improvement on a continuous basis or   they will lose their viability and become a threat themselves. The         National Cyber Security Policy 2021   4   implementation with regards to the compliance framework of Cyber Security   policy needs to be constantly monitored, assessed, and improved.    For that matter, a holistic approach and appropriate legal and technical   structures could help to identify the potential threats and consequences   attached thereto, and properly it could investigate and no weak area be left   to be exploited by the wrongdoers.   1.3.3 Enforcement of Required Structures and Processes     The assurance of Cyber Security requires proper structures and processes for   governance, regulation, implementation, and enforcement. Any absence or   weakness of the regulation structures poses a threat to Cyber Security.    i. Inadequate and Poor Quality of Resources    Cyber Security is a rapidly growing field that requires a continually updated set   of relevant skills and resources as the inadequacy of the required skills shall lead   to weaknesses in Cyber Security. Moreover, bridging the demand and supply   gap in the digital workforce is an emerging challenge. The absence of a   mechanism for ensuring the quantity and quality of these skills and resources is   a threat to the Cyber Security of the country.    ii. Lack of Data Governance    Countries face the threat of data colonization whereby data is managed,   controlled, and processed out of the legal jurisdiction of the country and there   is limited or no bilateral agreement among the stakeholders in this regard.   Threat actors are liable to pollute the information domain and citizen data may   be sold to third parties without due consent or validation. Such proliferation   and abuse of data lead to the exploitation of selected segments of society.   Weak governance of data, poor data quality, and absence of data   stewardship generate unreliable information resources and poses a threat to   Cyber Security.   iii. Reliance on External Resources    With the increasing use of information technology in all domains including   operations technology, critical information assets are likely to be exposed to   cyber-attacks. In absence of adequate local resources, reliance on external         National Cyber Security Policy 2021   5   resources including skills, hardware, and software, is a direct threat to Cyber   Security.    iv. Challenges of Coordinated Response to Threats and Attacks    An effective response to risks, threats, and attacks requires a coordinated   effort through a series of response teams (CERTs). The absence of such teams   and lack of coordination between them is a major threat. This is majorly due to   the weak Cyber Security posture and functions within the affiliate   organizations. Empowering support organizations is vital to a successful Cyber   Security ecosystem.    1.4 COURSE OF ACTION   This Policy will serve as the foundation for the construction of a holistic   digital ecosystem with supporting frameworks and components for the delivery   of secure, reliable, and standardized digital services, applications, and digital   infrastructure. This Policy will drive the fundamental demand in the local IT   industry to ensure quality delivery of its products and services. This will provide   an opportunity for local & international entrepreneurs and firms to offer core   competencies, services, and solutions and offer an opportunity to local   industry to become better positioned to compete and prosper on the   international stage. The focus will also be on promoting online businesses   enabling the smooth running of digital payments within and outside Pakistan.   Moreover, to mitigate cyber threats, the country faces today and to   improve the national Cyber Security outlook, it is imperative to undertake the   strengthening of national Cyber Security capabilities through the development   of essential and well-coordinated mechanisms, implementation of security   standards and regulations under a policy and legislative framework.   In this regard, the Government of Pakistan constituted Cyber   Governance Policy Committee (CGPC). Noting the strategic importance of   Cyber Security, the present Government has prioritized the formulation of the   first National Cyber Security Policy – 2021. This initiative is in conformity with the   national cyber vision.

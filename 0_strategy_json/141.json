A. To protect people's security in the cyberspace People are to be ensured a security level allowing them to carry out their normal personal, social and community activities in the cyberspace, such as well as to exercise their fundamental rights as freedom of speech, access to information, protection of the private life and personal property. B. To protect the country's security There is need to promote the safety of information networks and systems belonging to the public and private sector, especially the ones that are essential for the proper running of the country, ensuring there is continuity of basic services. C. To promote cooperation and coordination between institutions There is need to improve communication, coordination and cooperation actions between institutions, organisations and companies, both in the public and private sectors, at a national and international level, with the purpose of strengthening trust and provide a single answer to cyberspace risks. D. Tomanagerisks/in the cyberspace There is need to take into account the development of analysis and management processes for the use, processing, storage and transmission of information, as well as the building of capacities to prevent and recover from cybersecurity incidents that may arise, in order to achieve a stable and resilient cyberspace. ry Current status of cybersecurity: regulations, institutions, risk overview A. Regulations and institutions The current institutional structure in the field of cybersecurity is based on different bodies and entities. This requires the strategic coordination of different efforts, and their roles and duties, as well as the establishment of common practices and technical criteria, with the purpose of improving efficiency and effectiveness in the field of cybersecurity*. The country has in place a set of legal and statutory regulations that relate directly or indirectly with the challenges of cybersecurity -which should be reviewed and updated in accordance with the guidelines set out in this policy and with Chile’s international commitments, for example, Law No. 19,223 about cybercrime or Law No. 19,628 about the protection of private life, among other rights. B. Risk overview Because of the global reach of cyberspace, risks and threats may come from Chile and abroad, due both to natural and criminal activities, such as, for example, espionage and to surveillance actions carried out with different purposes, thus affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in the cyberspace and, therefore, people's rights?. At a global level, there is plenty of evidence about cyber attacks and online espionage. The large- scale interference with telecommunication networks, the outage of Internet services and espionage carried out against governments and companies, as well as attacks against critical infrastructure such as basic services, financial institutions and government entities have been openly covered in the global news. Regionally, the countries affected with the highest number of cyber attacks in 2013 in Latin America were Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Chile. Accessing or stealing information from infected computers or devices were a feature in the region®. Likewise, cybercrimes perpetrated in Chile are a confirmation of their cross-border nature, especially such crimes associated with the fraudulent use of credit and debit cards and cyber frauds among others. The policy takes into consideration this type of threats, especially the ones affecting the country’s critical infrastructure. 4 See Annex No.1 with a detail of the regulations and institutional structure currently existing in the field of cybersecurity. 5 See Annex No.2 containing information about the risks of cyberspace. 6 Prandini, P. & Maggiore, M. 2013.

The objective of this structure is proposing a general overview as to the direction the country should take in the medium and long term, with the development of a set of measures that may be implemented and evaluated during this Government's administration, thus leaving to the following administration the task of reviewing the policy and proposing an agenda that may be executed by the next administration. A. Policy objectives for 2022 This policy sets out high level long-term objectives that allow driving the country’s efforts to pursue such goals, serving at the same time as a guide to prioritise and rationalise the measures contained in this document. Additionally, the policy includes a series of minimum essential roles and the corresponding institutional design that shall govern the same both in the short term and in the medium and long term (2017-2022). B. Timetable of measures 2017-2022 and evaluation Upon development of the policy objectives, a timetable is proposed for implementation in the 2017- 2018 two-year period that will enable a joint effort from the Government and the private sector in the field of cybersecurity -focused on the adoption of prioritised measures and the preparation of a series of feedback that review and extend the policy’s scope by the end of 2017. C. Integrated supplementary policies inthe digital field This cybersecurity policy is an integral part of a set of policies implemented by the Government or at a development stage in the digital field with the purpose of having clear and systematic definitions about cyberspace. The Digital Agenda for 2020 The Digital Agenda for 2020’ is a roadmap designed to guide the country’s digital development through the definition of medium term objectives, lines of action and concrete measures. Launched in the second semester of 2015, this Agenda proposes that the widespread use of technologies becomes a means to reduce existing inequalities, with the opening of more and better opportunities for development and contributes to the respect of the rights of all Chilean women and men. The Agenda includes a specific measure (No. 25) focusing on the development of a cybersecurity strategy which will be executed through this policy. Likewise, this policy is enhanced and supplemented by a series of measures contained in the Agenda, such as the support introduced in the new Law 7 Available in: for the Protection of Personal Data, the safeguarding of Internet consumers, the development of a National Telecommunications Infrastructure Plan, and the upgrading of regulations governing the electronic signature, among measures. > National cyber defence policy Because the National Defence’s networks and information systems are a critical infrastructure for external security and the exercise of the country’s sovereignty, and by virtue of the constitutional and legal rights vested on the National Defence, during 2017 the Ministry of Defence will prepare and publish a set of cyber defence specific policies containing specific political definitions about how these networks will be protected and how the National Defence’s capabilities may cooperate in the development of a free, open, safe and resilient space for the country. > International cyberspace policy One of the high level objectives of this policy relates with the international relations and cooperation about cybersecurity in the global context. However, it is essential for the country to incorporate these and other objectives, such as the development of human rights, defence, and other related objectives in order to consolidate and integrate the same into Chile’s foreign policy. With that in mind, this policy includes a specific measure related with the creation of a strategy in this field by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which, in turn, is consistent with and executes measure No.11 of the Digital Agenda 2020 aimed at generating a country’s widespread view about Internet governance. 15 e > 16 A NATMONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICY (NCSP) 2017-2022 ry Policy objectives by 2022 A. The country will have in place a robust and resilient information infrastructure, prepared.to face and recover from cybersecurity incidents, under arisk management. approach 1. Concept. Risk identification and management Cybersecurity is described as a condition presenting the least risk for cyberspace -understood as a set of physical and logical infrastructure, and the human interactions taking place in the same. Within this set, the main feature to be protected is information confidentiality, integrity and availability which, in turn, create a robust and resilient cyberspace. This framework does not include the increased capability of state or private surveillance actions by using digital technologies, which relate with public order or national security objectives and are discussed in other instruments having a different focus. Surveillance actions proposed in this instrument will only be aimed at managing the risks of information in the cyberspace. Prevention and management models for cyberspace will be created from the Policy, including physical risks that may affect the same, regularly updated by acontinuous improvement model, which shall be the basis for technical measures to be adopted in order to prevent, manage and overcome actual risks, with an emphasis on service resilience and continuity within a set deadline and focus on maximising the country’s cybersecurity levels. 2. Protection of the information infrastructure Information infrastructure is composed of people, processes, procedures, tools, installations and technologies supporting the creation, use, transport, storage and destruction of information. There is an especially relevant group, within information structure, for a country to keep moving forward, called critical information infrastructure (Cll), which includes the installation, networks, services and physical and information technology equipment whose impairment, degradation, rejection, interruption or destruction may have an important impact on the security, health and wellbeing of people and on the effective operation of the State and the private sector. Special emphasis will be placed on the impact that an information security incident may have on physical infrastructures controlled or monitored from the cyberspace, and on the security of industrial surveillance sensors and devices enabling such actions. Clls shall the designed with an architecture maximising their robustness and resilience against events that may render them non-operational, and enabling them to adapt to natural phenomena, human interventions and information interferences such as non-voluntary incidents or cyber attacks. 3. Identification and prioritisation of critical information infrastructure Sectors included. in the definition of Cll are very similar and recurrent in various international classifications. In Chile, while consideration of a specific policy for critical infrastructure is under consideration, information infrastructure in the following sectors will be considered as critical: energy, telecommunications, water, health, financial services, public security, transport, the civil service, civil protection and defence. The policy contains a full set of areas, roles and responsible State entities used to identify and specify the critical level of each sector. Technical bodies in charge of executing measures derived from this policy shall include special cybersecurity standards for Clls depending on the different levels of development, especially with regard to special processes. The medium term will see the implementation of measures ensuring service continuity through the redundancy of the physical infrastructure of some Cll, especially in the fields of telecommunications, civil service, civil protection and defence. 4. Equipment available to respond to cybersecurity incidents According to best practices worldwide, it is essential to have available prevention, monitoring, management and response structures to face computer-related security incidents at a national level. The basic body in this structure is the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or teams in charge of responding to computer security incidents. Chile needs today the human and financial resources, a clear institutional framework and a mechanism to operate in coordination so as to promote the creation and operation of the same at different levels of the national life. Chile will have a national CSIRT in place to collect and structure information received from other (national and international) CSIRTs, promoting action coordination between CSIRTs in each sector, with the required authority to coordinate the technical response in the case of incidents endangering the country’s security. The Government’s current CSIRT will be strengthened, with a specific CSIRT to be created in the area of the National Defence. Likewise, the need is also in place to evaluate the relevance of creating a CSIRT for critical infrastructure. The creation of CSIRTs by sector will be supported by different public, private, academic and civil society stakeholders. 5. Implementation of standardised mechanisms for reporting, managing and recovering from incidents There will be centralised and standardised mechanisms for reporting cybersecurity incidents enabling the widespread and real time overview of incidents generated in the country. These mechanisms will be compulsory for the central Government and certain regulated sectors, and voluntary, in principle, for any stakeholders that may want to join them. The amount of information required will be restrictedly limited to what is needed to describe and manage the type of threat, especially avoiding the collection and processing of data affecting people’s private lives. For such purpose, the National CSIRT will keep a secure and confidential platform able to cooperate in case of cybersecurity incidents and gather the relevant information, and will create a network in conjunction with public and private bodies. 17 e > (NCSP) At the same time, both public bodies and Cll will have institutional bodies responsible for information security, together management and recovery plans in place for addressing incidents, with special emphasis on business continuity and on minimising any damages caused by actual incidents. In addition to the foregoing, the preparation of computer vulnerability reports by users and experts will be promoted through the adoption of guidelines for responsible information delivery, models to reward the detection of security problems, and other mechanisms promoting responsible disclosure. 6. Differentiated standards are required in the field of cybersecurity Any information infrastructure governed by or providing goods and services to the Chilean Government, or services to the people, shall comply with a basic set of standards covering confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information and the systems operating the same, according to the risks and threats faced by them and in consistency with their size, maturity, critical state and confidentiality level of information and/or processes supported by them. With regard to critical information infrastructure, any risk shall be properly evaluated and addressed pursuant to standards including CIll’s confidentiality, integrity and availability, aimed at having an effective and comprehensive security system in place that allows the prevention, management and recovery from cyber attacks and other information security incidents, together with contingency plans for ensuring business continuity of their services. Standards and best practices used shall be compatible with international efforts ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, without setting out specific solutions - except for qualified cases. B. The State will protect people’s rights in cyberspace 1. Crime prevention and trust building in cyberspace Crime prevention, dissuasion, control and punishment are critical to minimise risks and threats in cyberspace, thus contributing to trust building in connection with the activities carried out within the same. There are multiple criminal activities carried out in cyberspace such as stealing strategic information, interrupting online service systems, information hijacking (ransomware), phishing, pharming and the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, among other illicit activities. At a global level, there is information about cyber attacks consisting in espionage activities and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks through the Internet, the large-scale intercepting of telecommunication networks against critical infrastructure such as, inter alia, banks, basic services and Government entities. This policy is aimed at minimising risks associated to these threats. In addition to public policies developed to prevent and punish the above-mentioned crimes, it is also possible to build trust in cyberspace by employing the same technologies. The adoption of technical solutions allowing to increase user security in cyberspace, especially in the case of solutions cooperating with identity management in this environment, such as the mass adoption of digital certificates (digital signature) in websites, and by people and organisations will be promoted as a way to safeguard user communication and identity. This policy also recognises the value placed on encryption technology, thus allowing the provision of the most unprecedented levels of information confidentiality and integrity levels in history. Measures based on this policy shall promote encryption adoption for online users according to international standards, and under no circumstances the intentional use of unsafe technologies shall be promoted, or there will be and obligation by any person or organisation to provide digital services to implement ‘back door’ mechanisms compromising or increasing any risks associated with the security technologies used. 2. Priority setting in the implementation of punishing measures Unlike crimes committed in the physical space, cyberspace presents some challenges to crime prosecution and punishment. Some of these challenges include, inter alia, the identification of authors, the time elapsed between the perpetration of a crime and the victim's reaction, the low rate of complaints submitted and the unlike possibility to prosecute the perpetrator(s) -because enforcement agencies operate within the State’s territorial borders while the cyberspace is essentially a borderless place. Measures in place to punish these actions should be implemented by bearing in mind this context, and as a complement to this policy. The updating of Chile’s legislation, promoted by the decision to adhere to the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe®, together with the upgrading and strengthening of current regulations and the development of cross-cutting measures instead of the adoption of measures by sectors, are important objectives in this field. 3. Multi-sectoral prevention Because cyber attacks and cybercrime may be perpetrated by State bodies, organised groups or individuals, and threats may come from inside and outside the country, any response must come from multi-sectoral actors involving the private sector, the academia, the civil society and, indeed, criminal prosecution and defence bodies, as well as victim advocacy organisations. It is therefore essential to generate the proper spaces for coordination, meeting and cooperation, and strengthen significantly the existing technical skills and access to training by prosecutors and judges, the investigation and forensic capacities of the police bodies, and the development of guidelines aimed at providing a minimum safeguard to the entire population. Definitions must be designed to gather, standardise and integrate data and information related with cybercrime, increase investigation capacity and generate evidence regarding such crimes. 4. Respect for and promotion of fundamental rights All measures proposed by the policy should be designed and executed with a focus on fundamental rights -because of their fundamental nature and indivisibility, and on the basis that cyberspace is an environment where people have the same rights as in the physical world’. Therefore, the policy includes and promotes the following: 8 Available in: CTMContent?documentld=09000016802fa41c 9 In this regard, Resolution A/HRC/20/L.13 from the UN Human Rights Council declared that “people's rights should be also protected in the Internet”, 19 > (NCSP) The Internet is.a global public asset; therefore, users may not be deprived from accessing the network but for reasons of force majeure duly based, with access never being denied by vague reasons such as public order, national security, or for the honour of any individual despite their Capacity or title. Regarding the foregoing, and taking into account that information availability is an essential characteristic of cybersecurity, this policy will support public and private efforts made for the access to information and culture by the population through digital channels. Related with the above, the principle of respecting Internet neutrality is also included, so that Internet service providers may not discriminate or arbitrarily restrict the access to any content whatsoever, unless there is a legal justification to do that. This policy also respects and promotes the respect for freedom of speech, by taking into consideration not only communication media but also the population as a whole, the intermediaries making possible to communicate these messages and social networks?®. Any interference with this right shall be carried out in accordance with national and international standards in the field of human rights. The protection of private life and the inviolability of user communication in the cyberspace, including the protection against the unauthorised gathering, process and publication of personal data; transparency in the management of such data by private and public stakeholders, and as mentioned above, the protection of essential technologies to ensure that users may safely and confidently use the cyberspace. The protection of due process with regard to the measures affecting information security, seeking that surveillance and criminal prosecution measures in cyberspace comply with international standards with regard to protection such as the principles of suitability, need and proportionality’?. These measures will not only be applicable to criminal prosecution by the State, but also to the actions of all its bodies, thus safeguarding the application of this right among the users of cyberspace. Massive and indiscriminate surveillance of cyberspace is a serious attempt against fundamental rights, Efforts in the field of fundamental rights will especially take into account the rights of vulnerable groups, such as, inter alia, boys, girls and young people, the elderly, disabled persons and ethnic minorities. There will be also a gender focus making possible to visualise and address the inequalities faced by different users in cyberspace. The policy will seek that all people may enjoy a safe cyberspace free from abuses such as online bullying, the theft of personal information, large-scale surveillance and other practices affecting especially the most underprivileged members of society. Particularly, efforts will be carried out at all levels so that cybersecurity is not considered luxurious for people or the country’s organisations. 10 11 The role of Internet intermediaries has increasingly attracted attention because of the critical role they plan in ensuring rights such as freedom of speech. In this regard, reference frameworks such as the Manila principles may be consulted, [online] Available in A useful analysis tool is the document “Principios Internacionales sobre la Aplicacién de los Derechos Humanos a la Vigilancia de las Comunicaciones’ (International Principles about the Application of Human Rights to the Surveillance of Communications). [online] Available in: C. Chile will develop a cybersecurity culture based on education, good practices and accountability in the management of digital technologies 1. Cybersecurity culture ICTs promote the development of an equitable and inclusive cultural, technological and economic heritage of the country and comprehensive people's development. Therefore, a cybersecurity culture will be promoted at all levels with the purpose of making the tools and knowledge available for society to understand this field of human relations including its advantages and risks, and may manage them properly. 2. Community awareness and information People will be made aware of the risks and threats involved in cyberspace with the purpose of achieving a safe use of platforms providing services to the community, both from public institutions and private agents. The community will be made aware of the good use, measures or personal care and security in cyberspace. 3. Cybersecurity education This field will present many challenges to Chile’s educational system. Early and advanced education of the Chilean population should be a part of these challenges; therefore, digital gaps generated by, inter alia, inequitable access to resources, skills, infrastructure and connectivity should be addressed. To achieve the above goal, it is critical to implement initiatives promoting and developing a conscious, competent, informed and responsible digital culture including all relevant stakeholders and understanding that this is a joint effort to achieve a common, long-term benefit. D. The country will carry out cooperation actions with other stakeholders in the field of cybersecurity and will actively participate in international forums and discussions 1. Chilean foreign policy principles Chile’s foreign policy is based on a series of principles driving its diplomatic work and actions, such as: the respect for international law; the promotion of democracy; the respect for human rights; conflict prevention; the pacific resolution of disputes and the commitment to cooperate in the international arena. In turn, these principles drive the interest of Chile’s foreign policy, namely: contribute to the strengthening of multilateralism and promote international peace and security’. The emergence of cyberspace, especially the Internet, as a public asset urges us to face the challenges of managing all types of risks, where interacting at an international level is particularly important in the light of the global and cross-border nature of the same. Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting and multi-factorial concept which, at an international level, conveys the possibility to build common capacities, approaches and measures with the cooperation and 12 Further information in: 21 > 24 A NATMONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICY (NCSP) 2017-2022 Roles and required institutional structure to develop a national cybersecurity policy A. Institutional structure for cybersecurity It is essential for Chile, in order to fulfil this ambitious national cybersecurity policy and following the example of several other countries that have started this process some years ago, to have available a cybersecurity governance model responsible, at least, for carrying out such roles identified as essential -which are not being addressed, or are executed with no coordination within the country; therefore, the creation of an institutional framework to take up that role is hereby proposed. A modern governance model and institutional framework which is in Line with the needs of cyberspace and the country’s digital development, will be a matter of law to be prepared and submitted by responsible institutional actors. Additionally, the creation of an advisory consulting council composed of different sectors will be assessed. The roles identified as essential are: management of inter-institutional relationships, incident management, national and international point of contact, communications role, technical regulation and advisory role in general regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures. To carry out the above, correspondence of the cybersecurity framework with supplementary measures being developed in the area of digital governance within the State administration will be especially taken into account. B. Transitional governance in cybersecurity While the cybersecurity bill containing the final proposal for its institutional structure is discussed in the National Congress, certain essential roles identified up until now shall be temporarily performed by some of the institutions that are currently a part of the Government's structure. An example of this is the role played by CSIRT Gob, which will be technically responsible for managing incidents arisen within the State’s Connectivity Network, while, at a political level, it has been proposed to extend the term.and scope of the Inter-Ministerial Cybersecurity Committee with regard to the communication, coordination and follow up roles of the different measures set out in the NCSP.

With regard to cybersecurity, judges have the power to order some intrusive actions, control the legality of criminal investigations, and decide upon criminal cases, including cybercrime. Annex No 2: Risk and threat overview 1. SOURCES AND TYPES OF RISKS AND THREATS Due to the global nature of cyberspace, risks come from threats both from Chile and abroad and have different origins relevant for the country, namely: e Internal incidents: Involuntary information leakages, accidental interruption of information systems, or other involuntary incidents that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability of the information. e Natural disasters or force majeure: Earthquakes, floods and other disasters that may affect cyberspace caused by the destruction of physical infrastructures essential for information availability. e Espionage and surveillance activities carried out by State actors: Conducts that affect information confidentiality due to theft of the same for political or strategic purposes. Particularly important is the use of sophisticated tools known as APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) that, in turn, may benefit from non-published computer vulnerabilities of technologies in use. ¢ Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DOS and DDOS) attacks: These attacks relate with the intentional overcharge of services provided in a computer system which, in turn, can be conducted from one point of the network, or distributed to coordinate the attack from various points, many times by using infected devices with malicious programmes in order to achieve their objective. e Cybercrime: Criminal activities perpetrated against components in the cyberspace (non- authorised access, information sabotage, information theft, information hijacking or ransomware) or employing tools in cyberspace as a means for such crimes (phishing, pharming, virtual fraud, and other related crimes). e Attacks against critical infrastructures through the cyberspace: An alteration in the operation of critical infrastructures (both physical and information infrastructure) carried out by electronic means, e.g. the large-scale disruption of financial systems, interference of basis services, physical damage to physical structures and other related attacks. All the above risks and threats affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability of information assets in the cyberspace and, in the medium-term this may affect the country’s development in cyberspace, thus depriving us from the benefits associated with the digital government, ways of social organisation facilitated by cyberspace and threats to the security of people and institutions in this field. Some cases may fit in more categories than the ones described herein. 2. RISKS AND THREATS IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT At a global scale, there are many examples of cyber attacks consisting in espionage activities and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet. Likewise, the large-scale interception of telecommunication networks, the failure of Internet services, espionage activities against governments and companies, as well as attacks against critical infrastructures such as banks and Government services, have been regularly in the news. There is also plenty of evidence with regard to legal abuses in the request for data to diverse providers of digital goods and services by countries where such providers are based. 35 > NATMONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICY (NCSP) 2017-2022 Some cases worth mentioning are: Iran (2010), whose nuclear centrifuges were disabled by a computer virus especially designed for such purpose; Estonia (2007), where part of its critical infrastructure was disabled for weeks; disclosures by Edward Snowden (2013) about widespread espionage activities by the United State's intelligence agencies -which scope is still undetermined due to the number and regularity of such disclosures; and espionage activities against companies in the defence field (Lockheed, 2011) and entertainment (Sony, 2014),also in the US, which scope seriously compromises the economic interests and fundamental rights of people around the world. 3. RISKS AND THREATS. IN\\A REGIONAL CONTEXT Regionally, the countries that have reported the highest number of cyber attacks in Latin America were Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Chile. Accesses and information theft from infected computers - called botnets - were widespread in the region. There was even a specific type of malicious code called dorkbot that generated over 80K actions against the virtual system, with higher concentrations in Chile (44%), Peru (15%) and Argentina (11%). 4. MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES DETECTED IN THE STATE’S CONNECTIVITY NETWORK In Chile, the State’s Connectivity Network (RCE) is affected by many malicious or suspicious activities. There is an incident record related with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or alterations in Government website’s operations, with an increasing number of these incidents starting in 2010. Likewise, in 2015, at a general level, administrators of the Government network spotted the following patters: 17 Prandini, P. & Maggiore, M. 2013. Op.

CYBERCRIME IN-CHILE According to figures provided by the Office of the Prosecutor, regarding cybercrime between 2010 and 2015, the number of cases submitted with the name “computer-related crime” was 4,648 cases, distributed as described below: Cases of cybercrime 2010 - 2015 Office of the Prosecutor 1200 1000 800 600 400 N u m b e r of ca se s 200 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Year Cases submitted as cybercrime in 2010-2015 by the Office of the Prosecutor, related only with the types of offences set out in Law No. 19,233 (Source: ULDDECO, Office of the Prosecutor, 2016\"). Likewise, according to the data provided by the Investigations Police (PDI), during 2010-2015, a total number of 3,370 investigations distributed as described below: Cases of cybercrime 2010 - 2015 Investigations Police 700 + N u m b e r of ca se s 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Year Number of cybercrime investigations carried out in 2010-2015 by the PDI (Source: Cybercrime Brigade, PDI, 2016). The Carabineros Police, on their part, have identified different types of illicit behaviour in the cyberspace at a national level, the most common ones being the fraudulent access to systems; the purchase, sale and storage of child pornography; computer sabotage, and illicit banking operations (phishing). 18 Chilean Office of the Prosecutor. A brief description of the current state of regulations and sentences in Chile regarding cybercrime. Specialised Unit for Investigating Money Laundering, Economic Crimes, Environmental Crimes and Organised Crime. As stated in the document mentioned, data presented are not the real total number of the cases as many of them are reported as fraud (Page 6). Likewise, cybercrime perpetrated in Chile confirm the cross-border nature of illicit acts in the cyberspace, specifically regarding the fraudulent use of credit and debit cards, where people from different nationalities have been found to plan and perpetrate such crimes. Conclusion The information contained in this document represent a threat for the confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability of information in the cyberspace, which affects all users and deprives them from using cyberspace in a safe fashion, violating state and trade secrets and threatening people’s fundamental rights, especially the rights connected with the protection of private life and communication inviolability. For the reasons described above, it is essential to have policies in place to manage and minimize risks take into account such risks and threats, especially with regard to critical information infrastructure, with proper consideration of the special regulation set out for the purchase and operation of technological solutions and taking into account the international context in the field of cybersecurity. 39 << @ e®@ @ @ @ @ e ® @ NATIONAL 40 CYBERSECURITY POLICY (NCSP) A 2017-2022 Fa] Ministerio AT tel to Lat) General de la Presidencia Gobierno de Chile Subsecretaria CoG cla ele Ministerio del Interior y Seguridad Pablica Gobierno de Chile Comite Interministerial sobre Ciberseguridad CICS Subsecretaria (oem Tey ky) Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores Ministerio de Hacienda 2 2 Gobierno de Chile Gobierno de Chile Fe] Gobierno de Chile 2 Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones Tea ey Cede f aaa Ry oT-Ty Lola toy-9 Humanos ies Coney Economia, Fomento y Turismo Gobierno de Chile Gobierno de Chile Gobierno de Chile Agencia Nacional de Inteligencia bette Mea)",

People’s access to  the Internet has grown a 45.3% in the last two years,  from a 52.2% by 2014 to 73.8% by March of 2016. Our  national digital economy has grown around 11% in the  same period, from 34 billion dollars in 2014 to 39 billion  dollars in 2015.   This impact has transformed also the way our people  use and understand technology.     The ICTs have had a social effect with no precedents in history, allowing our citizens to get informed,  to organize themselves, and to participate from social life. Particularly, our children and adolescents  make intensive use of social networks.   A transformation of this magnitude brings forth important challenges for our State, as it is imperative  that all of this technology and its potential is used mainly to serve our people. We need to democra-  tize the usage of the Internet, and to transform it into a tool for inclusion, efficiency and certainty, by  ensuring the security and privacy of all those who use it everyday.   Chile must stay up-to-date in security matters, as any mistake, or any successful breach to our  systems, may harm our people’s welfare or our rights, it may negatively affect our interests, or it may  hinder or even impede the operation of critical services for the country.   Listening to this demand, my government program included the development of a Digital Security  Strategy, in order to protect both private and public interests in the digital realm.   This commitment was confirmed in November 2015, when we presented the Digital Agenda 2020,  wherein it was announced the creation of a digital security strategy which, finally, is being released  today through this document.   This first policy was designed from an intense dialog between private and public parties. For months  we listened to public services representatives, professional and labor guilds, researchers and experts  from within and abroad. When the Interministerial Committee wrote the first draft of this policy, it  was subject to a public hearing as mandated by Law 20.500 about public participation. Numerous  contributions were received which, no doubt about it, helped to improve it.   The national policy sets concrete goals and commitments for the overarching purpose of promoting   and ensuring a free, open, safe and resilient cyberspace. A space that we expect it may allow our  fellow citizens to reach their maximum potential. As it also happens with the  Digital Agenda, and the Productivity, Innovation and Growth Agenda, we expect this new policy to  allow us to reduce the access gap, to increase awareness about safe use of ICTs, and to ensure the  sustained technological leadership our country has in the region.   Michelle Bachelet Jeria   President of Chile   e<    6  A   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022    CT penetration in every area in which we develop and   interact has brought about a revolution that has left   no one indifferent. Today we can hardly think of life   without computer networks and that includes, of course,   our social relations.   In the public sector, the State increasingly transmits   information and interacts with citizens via the Internet,   thus promoting the digital government and fulfilling   its commitments of timely delivery of services and   transparency. Along with the latter and in order to   facilitate internet access to its citizens, the State has   created programs that enable free internet access   through the program WiFi ChileGob, a project that helps improve access in remote locations through   Chile. In addition, the government is promoting the initiative “I choose my PC”, which seeks to increase   equality and to bridge the digital divide by favoring vulnerable seventh grade children. This program   has benefited more than 350,000 students. Since it was launched seven years ago.       In this context, where Internet access and the use and dependence on ICT increases significantly,   the criminological phenomenon associated with cyber crime and cyber attacks has worsened. For   example, the State Information Network recorded an increase of more than one hundred million   attacks, between 2014 and 2015, rising the 2016 to values exponentially higher by DDoS attacks.   In light of this reality, both the government of President Michelle Bachelet and the Digital Agenda   2020 in particular consider the development of a digital security strategy that promotes protection   of private users. Therefore, the government has worked since April 2015 through an Inter-Ministerial   Committee on Cybersecurity, on the development of Chile’s first National Cybersecurity Policy, which   has been fine tuned after a successful Citizen Consultation process carried out between February and   March 2016,   While the National Cybersecurity Policy addresses with particular interest the prosecution and   punishment of cybercrime, it goes far beyond the punitive area, for a fundamental variable to reduce   the risks associated with cyberspace and take advantage of its potential is awareness, training in and   dissemination of cybersecurity among society. Likewise, exploiting the competitive advantages of   our country in terms of internet access, digital market maturity and quality professionals, the Policy   seeks to promote industrial and productive development in cybersecurity.   Thus, | am convinced that the implementation of the measures contained in the cybersecurity   policy as well as the State guidelines that it considers will contribute to further development of   interagency cooperation and public-private partnership, which will enhance the value of free, open   and safe cyberspace as a way to achieve greater economic development of our country and greater   welfare for all Chilean people.   Mahmud Aleuy Peja y Lillo   Undersecretary of the Interior   Chairman of the Interministerial Committee on Cybersecurity   e<    8  A   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022    t has been a long time since cyberspace ceased to   be part of science fiction to become one of the main   areas of social interaction. Without going any further,   Chile has the highest rate of Internet penetration in   Latin America, with more than 70% of its population   connected.   This has allowed its people to use digital technologies   intensively to communicate with one other, express their   ideas, share their causes or strengthen personal ties   through social media, to carry out multiple transactions   online and to take advantage of e-commerce facilities.   However, this intensive use also increases our levels of   dependence on the internet and the infrastructure that supports it, exposing us to new risks and   threats.       Therefore, one of the challenges undertaken by the Government has been to improve the standards of   digital security of our country, in order to protect people and the exercise of fundamental rights such   as privacy, freedom of expression and access to information, among others.   This policy is the first concrete result of this challenge, a result that is the fruit of collective work that   we assumed in the Interministerial Committee on Cybersecurity, made up by the Undersecretariats   of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Defense, Finance, General Secretariat of the Presidency, Economy, Justice,   Telecommunications and the National Intelligence Agency. The Committee met throughout 2015,   holding multiple public hearings where it welcomed representatives from trade associations,   companies, civil society, academics and national and international cybersecurity experts.   This policy was subject to an extensive public consultation process, through which fifty observations,   comments and criticisms were received which certainly enriched the document that you have at   hand.   The policy outlines five strategic long-term goals, aimed at addressing the challenges that our country   faces in cyberspace, incorporating not only the scope of action of the State but also considering the   role of the private sector, the civil society and the academia in this important task.   The policy reflects a central tenet: security and freedom are complementary. Combating cybercrime   and other threats on the Internet cannot become an excuse to trample human rights such as   privacy and freedom of expression on the contrary, they are means to fully guarantee these rights in   cyberspace.   Now we face the great challenge of implementing the policy and monitoring its effectiveness, for   which it is essential to have the cooperation of all stakeholders, so that our country can further   progress in building an open, free and safe cyberspace for all.   Marcos Robledo Hoecker   Undersecretary of Defense   Executive Secretary Interministerial Committee on Cybersecurity   e<    @   e®@   @   @   @   @   e   ® @   NATIONAL  10 CYBERSECURITY   POLICY (NCSP)  A 2017-2022    Introduction   The massive use of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT), while contributing to   the country’s development, also entails risks that may affect people’s rights, public security, critical   infrastructure, digital government, and Chile’s essential interests and foreign policy.   These risks may arise from multiple sources and be translated into a series of activities including   espionage, sabotage, fraud or cyber attacks carried out by, inter alia, other countries, organised   groups or individuals.   There is important progress at an international level in the management of ICT-related risks. By 2015,   over 40 countries had developed a cybersecurity’ strategy or policy -some of which are already   working on their second or third version. Note has also been taken of the important evolution in terms   of doctrine, techniques and regulations within the most diverse organisations and international   forums.   At a national level, the challenge lies on developing a policy driving the country’s actions in   cybersecurity matters, together with implementing and adopting the measures required to protect   user security in the cyberspace, by taking into account educational strategies focused on self-   care and prevention in the digital environment, and complying with President Michelle Bachelet’s   programme of government -which proposes “to develop a digital security strategy protecting   private and public users”’.   This document contains the political guidelines developed by the Chilean State in the field of   cybersecurity, with a view to 20223, and aimed at having a free, open, safe and resilient cyberspace.       1 Further information in the following websites:   https://ccdcoe.org/strategies-policies.Atml   https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/   http://www. itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/National-Strategies.aspx   2 President Michelle Bachelet’s Government Programme, Page 57.   3. Asexplained in section V, “Roadmap”, this policy contains long-term guidelines aimed at this and the coming government, and a series   of short-term measures to be planned and executed by each relevant administration.      11 <<    >>   12  A   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022   Eq Why there is need for a national  cybersecurity policy?   A. To protect people's security in the cyberspace   People are to be ensured a security level allowing them to carry out their normal personal, social   and community activities in the cyberspace, such as well as to exercise their fundamental rights as   freedom of speech, access to information, protection of the private life and personal property.   B. To protect the country's security   There is need to promote the safety of information networks and systems belonging to the public and   private sector, especially the ones that are essential for the proper running of the country, ensuring   there is continuity of basic services.   C. To promote cooperation and coordination between institutions   There is need to improve communication, coordination and cooperation actions between institutions,   organisations and companies, both in the public and private sectors, at a national and international   level, with the purpose of strengthening trust and provide a single answer to cyberspace risks.   D. Tomanagerisks/in the cyberspace   There is need to take into account the development of analysis and management processes for the   use, processing, storage and transmission of information, as well as the building of capacities to   prevent and recover from cybersecurity incidents that may arise, in order to achieve a stable and   resilient cyberspace.    ry Current status of cybersecurity:  regulations, institutions, risk   overview   A. Regulations and institutions   The current institutional structure in the field of cybersecurity is based on different bodies and   entities. This requires the strategic coordination of different efforts, and their roles and duties, as   well as the establishment of common practices and technical criteria, with the purpose of improving   efficiency and effectiveness in the field of cybersecurity*.   The country has in place a set of legal and statutory regulations that relate directly or indirectly   with the challenges of cybersecurity -which should be reviewed and updated in accordance with the   guidelines set out in this policy and with Chile’s international commitments, for example, Law No.   19,223 about cybercrime or Law No. 19,628 about the protection of private life, among other rights.   B. Risk overview   Because of the global reach of cyberspace, risks and threats may come from Chile and abroad, due   both to natural and criminal activities, such as, for example, espionage and to surveillance actions   carried out with different purposes, thus affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of   information assets in the cyberspace and, therefore, people's rights?.   At a global level, there is plenty of evidence about cyber attacks and online espionage. The large-   scale interference with telecommunication networks, the outage of Internet services and espionage   carried out against governments and companies, as well as attacks against critical infrastructure   such as basic services, financial institutions and government entities have been openly covered in   the global news.   Regionally, the countries affected with the highest number of cyber attacks in 2013 in Latin America   were Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Chile. Accessing or stealing information from infected   computers or devices were a feature in the region®.   Likewise, cybercrimes perpetrated in Chile are a confirmation of their cross-border nature, especially   such crimes associated with the fraudulent use of credit and debit cards and cyber frauds among   others.   The policy takes into consideration this type of threats, especially the ones affecting the country’s   critical infrastructure.       4 See Annex No.1 with a detail of the regulations and institutional structure currently existing in the field of cybersecurity.   5 See Annex No.2 containing information about the risks of cyberspace.   6 Prandini, P. & Maggiore, M. 2013.

The objective of this structure is proposing a general overview as to the direction the country   should take in the medium and long term, with the development of a set of measures that may be   implemented and evaluated during this Government's administration, thus leaving to the following   administration the task of reviewing the policy and proposing an agenda that may be executed by the   next administration.   A. Policy objectives for 2022   This policy sets out high level long-term objectives that allow driving the country’s efforts to pursue   such goals, serving at the same time as a guide to prioritise and rationalise the measures contained   in this document.   Additionally, the policy includes a series of minimum essential roles and the corresponding   institutional design that shall govern the same both in the short term and in the medium and long   term (2017-2022).   B. Timetable of measures 2017-2022 and evaluation   Upon development of the policy objectives, a timetable is proposed for implementation in the 2017-   2018 two-year period that will enable a joint effort from the Government and the private sector in   the field of cybersecurity -focused on the adoption of prioritised measures and the preparation of a   series of feedback that review and extend the policy’s scope by the end of 2017.   C. Integrated supplementary policies inthe digital field   This cybersecurity policy is an integral part of a set of policies implemented by the Government or at   a development stage in the digital field with the purpose of having clear and systematic definitions   about cyberspace.   The Digital Agenda for 2020   The Digital Agenda for 2020’ is a roadmap designed to guide the country’s digital development   through the definition of medium term objectives, lines of action and concrete measures. Launched   in the second semester of 2015, this Agenda proposes that the widespread use of technologies   becomes a means to reduce existing inequalities, with the opening of more and better opportunities   for development and contributes to the respect of the rights of all Chilean women and men.   The Agenda includes a specific measure (No. 25) focusing on the development of a cybersecurity   strategy which will be executed through this policy. Likewise, this policy is enhanced and supplemented   by a series of measures contained in the Agenda, such as the support introduced in the new Law       7 Available in: http:/Awww.agendadigital.gob.cl/    for the Protection of Personal Data, the safeguarding of Internet consumers, the development of a   National Telecommunications Infrastructure Plan, and the upgrading of regulations governing the   electronic signature, among measures.   > National cyber defence policy   Because the National Defence’s networks and information systems are a critical infrastructure for   external security and the exercise of the country’s sovereignty, and by virtue of the constitutional   and legal rights vested on the National Defence, during 2017 the Ministry of Defence will prepare   and publish a set of cyber defence specific policies containing specific political definitions about how   these networks will be protected and how the National Defence’s capabilities may cooperate in the   development of a free, open, safe and resilient space for the country.   > International cyberspace policy   One of the high level objectives of this policy relates with the international relations and cooperation   about cybersecurity in the global context. However, it is essential for the country to incorporate these   and other objectives, such as the development of human rights, defence, and other related objectives   in order to consolidate and integrate the same into Chile’s foreign policy.   With that in mind, this policy includes a specific measure related with the creation of a strategy in   this field by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which, in turn, is consistent with and executes measure   No.11 of the Digital Agenda 2020 aimed at generating a country’s widespread view about Internet   governance.   15      e<    >>   16  A   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022   ry Policy objectives by 2022   A. The country will have in place a robust and resilient information   infrastructure, prepared.to face and recover from cybersecurity incidents,   under arisk management. approach   1. Concept. Risk identification and management   Cybersecurity is described as a condition presenting the least risk for cyberspace -understood as a   set of physical and logical infrastructure, and the human interactions taking place in the same. Within   this set, the main feature to be protected is information confidentiality, integrity and availability   which, in turn, create a robust and resilient cyberspace.   This framework does not include the increased capability of state or private surveillance actions   by using digital technologies, which relate with public order or national security objectives and   are discussed in other instruments having a different focus. Surveillance actions proposed in this   instrument will only be aimed at managing the risks of information in the cyberspace.   Prevention and management models for cyberspace will be created from the Policy, including physical   risks that may affect the same, regularly updated by acontinuous improvement model, which shall be   the basis for technical measures to be adopted in order to prevent, manage and overcome actual risks,   with an emphasis on service resilience and continuity within a set deadline and focus on maximising   the country’s cybersecurity levels.   2. Protection of the information infrastructure   Information infrastructure is composed of people, processes, procedures, tools, installations and   technologies supporting the creation, use, transport, storage and destruction of information.   There is an especially relevant group, within information structure, for a country to keep moving   forward, called critical information infrastructure (Cll), which includes the installation, networks,   services and physical and information technology equipment whose impairment, degradation,   rejection, interruption or destruction may have an important impact on the security, health and   wellbeing of people and on the effective operation of the State and the private sector.   Special emphasis will be placed on the impact that an information security incident may have on   physical infrastructures controlled or monitored from the cyberspace, and on the security of industrial   surveillance sensors and devices enabling such actions.   Clls shall the designed with an architecture maximising their robustness and resilience against events   that may render them non-operational, and enabling them to adapt to natural phenomena, human   interventions and information interferences such as non-voluntary incidents or cyber attacks.   3. Identification and prioritisation of critical information infrastructure   Sectors included. in the definition of Cll are very similar and recurrent in various international   classifications. In Chile, while consideration of a specific policy for critical infrastructure is under   consideration, information infrastructure in the following sectors will be considered as critical:    energy, telecommunications, water, health, financial services, public security, transport, the   civil service, civil protection and defence.   The policy contains a full set of areas, roles and responsible State entities used to identify and specify   the critical level of each sector.   Technical bodies in charge of executing measures derived from this policy shall include special   cybersecurity standards for Clls depending on the different levels of development, especially with   regard to special processes.   The medium term will see the implementation of measures ensuring service continuity through the   redundancy of the physical infrastructure of some Cll, especially in the fields of telecommunications,   civil service, civil protection and defence.   4. Equipment available to respond to cybersecurity incidents   According to best practices worldwide, it is essential to have available prevention, monitoring,   management and response structures to face computer-related security incidents at a national level.   The basic body in this structure is the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or teams   in charge of responding to computer security incidents. Chile needs today the human and financial   resources, a clear institutional framework and a mechanism to operate in coordination so as to   promote the creation and operation of the same at different levels of the national life.   Chile will have a national CSIRT in place to collect and structure information received from other   (national and international) CSIRTs, promoting action coordination between CSIRTs in each sector,   with the required authority to coordinate the technical response in the case of incidents endangering   the country’s security.   The Government’s current CSIRT will be strengthened, with a specific CSIRT to be created in the area   of the National Defence. Likewise, the need is also in place to evaluate the relevance of creating a   CSIRT for critical infrastructure.   The creation of CSIRTs by sector will be supported by different public, private, academic and civil   society stakeholders.   5. Implementation of standardised mechanisms for reporting, managing   and recovering from incidents   There will be centralised and standardised mechanisms for reporting cybersecurity incidents enabling   the widespread and real time overview of incidents generated in the country.   These mechanisms will be compulsory for the central Government and certain regulated sectors, and   voluntary, in principle, for any stakeholders that may want to join them. The amount of information   required will be restrictedly limited to what is needed to describe and manage the type of threat,   especially avoiding the collection and processing of data affecting people’s private lives.   For such purpose, the National CSIRT will keep a secure and confidential platform able to cooperate   in case of cybersecurity incidents and gather the relevant information, and will create a network in   conjunction with public and private bodies.   17      e<    >>   (NCSP)   At the same time, both public bodies and Cll will have institutional bodies responsible for information   security, together management and recovery plans in place for addressing incidents, with special   emphasis on business continuity and on minimising any damages caused by actual incidents.   In addition to the foregoing, the preparation of computer vulnerability reports by users and experts   will be promoted through the adoption of guidelines for responsible information delivery, models to   reward the detection of security problems, and other mechanisms promoting responsible disclosure.   6. Differentiated standards are required in the field of cybersecurity   Any information infrastructure governed by or providing goods and services to the Chilean Government,   or services to the people, shall comply with a basic set of standards covering confidentiality, integrity   and availability of the information and the systems operating the same, according to the risks and   threats faced by them and in consistency with their size, maturity, critical state and confidentiality   level of information and/or processes supported by them.   With regard to critical information infrastructure, any risk shall be properly evaluated and addressed   pursuant to standards including CIll’s confidentiality, integrity and availability, aimed at having an   effective and comprehensive security system in place that allows the prevention, management and   recovery from cyber attacks and other information security incidents, together with contingency   plans for ensuring business continuity of their services.   Standards and best practices used shall be compatible with international efforts ensuring the   confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, without setting out specific solutions -   except for qualified cases.   B. The State will protect people’s rights in cyberspace   1. Crime prevention and trust building in cyberspace   Crime prevention, dissuasion, control and punishment are critical to minimise risks and threats in   cyberspace, thus contributing to trust building in connection with the activities carried out within   the same.   There are multiple criminal activities carried out in cyberspace such as stealing strategic information,   interrupting online service systems, information hijacking (ransomware), phishing, pharming and the   fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, among other illicit activities.   At a global level, there is information about cyber attacks consisting in espionage activities and   distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks through the Internet, the large-scale intercepting of   telecommunication networks against critical infrastructure such as, inter alia, banks, basic services   and Government entities. This policy is aimed at minimising risks associated to these threats.   In addition to public policies developed to prevent and punish the above-mentioned crimes, it is   also possible to build trust in cyberspace by employing the same technologies. The adoption of   technical solutions allowing to increase user security in cyberspace, especially in the case of solutions   cooperating with identity management in this environment, such as the mass adoption of digital   certificates (digital signature) in websites, and by people and organisations will be promoted as a way   to safeguard user communication and identity.   This policy also recognises the value placed on encryption technology, thus allowing the provision   of the most unprecedented levels of information confidentiality and integrity levels in history.    Measures based on this policy shall promote encryption adoption for online users according to   international standards, and under no circumstances the intentional use of unsafe technologies shall   be promoted, or there will be and obligation by any person or organisation to provide digital services   to implement ‘back door’ mechanisms compromising or increasing any risks associated with the   security technologies used.   2. Priority setting in the implementation of punishing measures   Unlike crimes committed in the physical space, cyberspace presents some challenges to crime   prosecution and punishment. Some of these challenges include, inter alia, the identification of   authors, the time elapsed between the perpetration of a crime and the victim's reaction, the low   rate of complaints submitted and the unlike possibility to prosecute the perpetrator(s) -because   enforcement agencies operate within the State’s territorial borders while the cyberspace is essentially   a borderless place.   Measures in place to punish these actions should be implemented by bearing in mind this context,   and as a complement to this policy.   The updating of Chile’s legislation, promoted by the decision to adhere to the Convention on   Cybercrime of the Council of Europe®, together with the upgrading and strengthening of current   regulations and the development of cross-cutting measures instead of the adoption of measures by   sectors, are important objectives in this field.   3. Multi-sectoral prevention   Because cyber attacks and cybercrime may be perpetrated by State bodies, organised groups or   individuals, and threats may come from inside and outside the country, any response must come   from multi-sectoral actors involving the private sector, the academia, the civil society and, indeed,   criminal prosecution and defence bodies, as well as victim advocacy organisations.   It is therefore essential to generate the proper spaces for coordination, meeting and cooperation, and   strengthen significantly the existing technical skills and access to training by prosecutors and judges,   the investigation and forensic capacities of the police bodies, and the development of guidelines   aimed at providing a minimum safeguard to the entire population.   Definitions must be designed to gather, standardise and integrate data and information related with   cybercrime, increase investigation capacity and generate evidence regarding such crimes.   4. Respect for and promotion of fundamental rights   All measures proposed by the policy should be designed and executed with a focus on fundamental   rights -because of their fundamental nature and indivisibility, and on the basis that cyberspace is   an environment where people have the same rights as in the physical world’. Therefore, the policy   includes and promotes the following:       8 Available in: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayD CTMContent?documentld=09000016802fa41c   9 In this regard, Resolution A/HRC/20/L.13 from the UN Human Rights Council declared that “people's rights should be also protected in   the Internet”,      19 <<    >>   (NCSP)   The Internet is.a global public asset; therefore, users may not be deprived from accessing the   network but for reasons of force majeure duly based, with access never being denied by vague   reasons such as public order, national security, or for the honour of any individual despite their   Capacity or title.   Regarding the foregoing, and taking into account that information availability is an essential   characteristic of cybersecurity, this policy will support public and private efforts made for the   access to information and culture by the population through digital channels.   Related with the above, the principle of respecting Internet neutrality is also included, so that   Internet service providers may not discriminate or arbitrarily restrict the access to any content   whatsoever, unless there is a legal justification to do that.   This policy also respects and promotes the respect for freedom of speech, by taking into   consideration not only communication media but also the population as a whole, the   intermediaries making possible to communicate these messages and social networks?®. Any   interference with this right shall be carried out in accordance with national and international   standards in the field of human rights.   The protection of private life and the inviolability of user communication in the cyberspace,   including the protection against the unauthorised gathering, process and publication of personal   data; transparency in the management of such data by private and public stakeholders, and as   mentioned above, the protection of essential technologies to ensure that users may safely and   confidently use the cyberspace.   The protection of due process with regard to the measures affecting information security,   seeking that surveillance and criminal prosecution measures in cyberspace comply with   international standards with regard to protection such as the principles of suitability, need and   proportionality’?. These measures will not only be applicable to criminal prosecution by the State,   but also to the actions of all its bodies, thus safeguarding the application of this right among the   users of cyberspace. Massive and indiscriminate surveillance of cyberspace is a serious attempt   against fundamental rights,   Efforts in the field of fundamental rights will especially take into account the rights of vulnerable   groups, such as, inter alia, boys, girls and young people, the elderly, disabled persons and ethnic   minorities. There will be also a gender focus making possible to visualise and address the inequalities   faced by different users in cyberspace.   The policy will seek that all people may enjoy a safe cyberspace free from abuses such as online   bullying, the theft of personal information, large-scale surveillance and other practices affecting   especially the most underprivileged members of society. Particularly, efforts will be carried out at   all levels so that cybersecurity is not considered luxurious for people or the country’s organisations.       10   11   The role of Internet intermediaries has increasingly attracted attention because of the critical role they plan in ensuring rights such as   freedom of speech. In this regard, reference frameworks such as the Manila principles may be consulted, [online] Available in https://   www.manilaprinciples.org/es   A useful analysis tool is the document “Principios Internacionales sobre la Aplicacién de los Derechos Humanos a la Vigilancia de las   Comunicaciones’ (International Principles about the Application of Human Rights to the Surveillance of Communications). [online]   Available in: https://es.necessaryandproportionate.org/text    C. Chile will develop a cybersecurity culture based on education, good   practices and accountability in the management of digital technologies   1. Cybersecurity culture   ICTs promote the development of an equitable and inclusive cultural, technological and economic   heritage of the country and comprehensive people's development.   Therefore, a cybersecurity culture will be promoted at all levels with the purpose of making the   tools and knowledge available for society to understand this field of human relations including its   advantages and risks, and may manage them properly.   2. Community awareness and information   People will be made aware of the risks and threats involved in cyberspace with the purpose of   achieving a safe use of platforms providing services to the community, both from public institutions   and private agents.   The community will be made aware of the good use, measures or personal care and security in   cyberspace.   3. Cybersecurity education   This field will present many challenges to Chile’s educational system. Early and advanced education   of the Chilean population should be a part of these challenges; therefore, digital gaps generated by,   inter alia, inequitable access to resources, skills, infrastructure and connectivity should be addressed.   To achieve the above goal, it is critical to implement initiatives promoting and developing a   conscious, competent, informed and responsible digital culture including all relevant stakeholders   and understanding that this is a joint effort to achieve a common, long-term benefit.   D. The country will carry out cooperation actions with other stakeholders   in the field of cybersecurity and will actively participate in international   forums and discussions   1. Chilean foreign policy principles   Chile’s foreign policy is based on a series of principles driving its diplomatic work and actions, such as:   the respect for international law; the promotion of democracy; the respect for human rights; conflict   prevention; the pacific resolution of disputes and the commitment to cooperate in the international   arena. In turn, these principles drive the interest of Chile’s foreign policy, namely: contribute to the   strengthening of multilateralism and promote international peace and security’.   The emergence of cyberspace, especially the Internet, as a public asset urges us to face the challenges   of managing all types of risks, where interacting at an international level is particularly important in   the light of the global and cross-border nature of the same.   Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting and multi-factorial concept which, at an international level, conveys   the possibility to build common capacities, approaches and measures with the cooperation and       12 Further information in: http://www.minrel.gov.cl/minrel/site/artic/20080802/pags/20080802194424.html      21 <<    assistance of other countries, such as the conviction that sustained multilateral diplomatic work   involving multiple stakeholders allows decreasing the risk of conflict in cyberspace.   To achieve the above, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for coordinating with other   ministries and Government agencies the international cybersecurity policy.   2. Cooperation and assistance   Bilateral cooperation work will promote different types of relations with other countries in the field   of cybersecurity, including assistance to and from Chile, exchange of information and experiences,   the implementation and furtherance of mechanisms for facilitating political dialogue in this field, and   the promotion of transparency and trust building in cyberspace, with an emphasis on multi-agency   work,   3. Reinforce the participation in multilateral and multi-stakeholder work   Efforts must be focused on promoting digital as a free, open and safe environment for all users in the   cyberspace.   The country needs to strengthen its work in this field, taking into consideration the special challenges   faced in terms not only of the technical conditions, and the global nature and decentralised character   of the network, but also regarding its political scope, and with a system of Internet governance   including multiple stakeholders where the private sector and civil society have a special role.   Within this framework, the country’s involvement will be increased in the multilateral and global   arena, supporting regional, sub-regional and multilateral consultations in this field, especially in Latin   America, and actively involving stakeholders in this debate.   4. Promote international regulations encouraging trust and security in the  cyberspace   Although there are practically no specific regulation instruments, the cyberspace is actually regulated   both by the existing national laws and by the general applicable international regulations; therefore,   the challenge lies particularly on being able to identify and interpret the relevant regulations of the   applicable international law.   However, there are some challenges that must be faced through specific international agreements   and regulations, such as the Convention on Cybercrime, which the country will adhere to, with   reservations and safeguards consistent with this policy.   Additionally, the debate and adoption of multilateral and bilateral agreements should be promoted   in order to encourage cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of cybersecurity, both in terms   of formal instruments and as informal agreements and arrangements focused on international   transparency and the trust building in this field.   E. The country will promote the development of a cybersecurity industry   serving its strategic objectives   1. / The importance of innovation and development in cybersecurity   Activities aimed at protecting domestic security and foreign defence generally require a strong   innovation and development element promoting an increased development of the industry at a   NATIONAL  22 _CYBERSECURITY   POLICY (NCSP)  A 2017-2022    national level. Within this framework, the field of cybersecurity requires a special effort because of   its original nature and strategic importance for the country as a whole.   2. Cybersecurity as a means to contribute to Chile’s digital development   While the size of the ICT sector represents 3~4, 12% share of the Chilean economy, in OECD countries   this industry reports an average 6% share in the country’s economies’, generating a gap between   both realities that Chile will partly resolve through the development of the cybersecurity component   within this industry.   This will generate both an increased demand on the information technology industry and a higher   industrial development in this field, helping the country to advance towards OECD's indicators, as well   as strengthening policy objectives.   3. Development of the cybersecurity industry in Chile   There are no specific figures regarding the level of development of the national industry apart from   some studies exploring this alternative’. The country’s effort to develop a cybersecurity industry will   be supported by studies describing the industry and identifying strategic fields for development in   the short, medium and long time.   Particularly, a field which is regularly developed in compared experiences is the domestic industry   related with the development and use of encryption standards by reason of its strategic importance   for the country’s security abroad.   4. Contribute to the generation of an offer by the local industry   Measures will be adopted in order to help creating and strengthening a domestic industry for   cybersecurity services, technologies and management through a programme and initiatives aimed at   the production of new goods and services in this area. A development pole will be created in this area   which is in line with the Productivity, Innovation and Growth Agenda’? and the Digital Agenda for 2020.   5. Generation of demand by the public sector based on the State’s   Strategic interests   The generation of demand by the public sector based on their strategic and security needs and   interests will support the strengthening of a national industry focused on cybersecurity services,   technologies and management which is in line with international technical standards.       13 There are studies giving an approximate value to the GDP contributed by the ICT sector such as the “Indice Pais Digital” carried out by   the Pais Digital Foundation and UDD, submitted in January 2015. This study estimated that the ICT sector represents 3% of the total   Chilean economy (source from 2012). Likewise, in March 2015 the Under-Secretariat of Economy commissioned to F&K Consultores   the study “Status of the Digital Development in Chile”, which reported that the aggregate value of the ICT sector reaches 4.12% as   compared with the total aggregated value (source from 2011).   14 Report “Tecnologias de la Informacién y Comunicacion en Chile: Areas de investigacién y capacidades, informe de estado del arte”   (Information and Communication Technology in Chile: Research Areas and Capabilities, State-of-the-art Report), Conicyt, 2010.   “Indice Pais Digital’, Pais Digital Foundation in conjunctions with UDD, January 2015. “Status of the Digital Development in Chile”, F&K   Consultores, March 2015.   15 Available in: http://www.agendaproductividad.cl/      23 <<    >>   24  A   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022   Roles and required institutional   structure to develop a national   cybersecurity policy   A. Institutional structure for cybersecurity   It is essential for Chile, in order to fulfil this ambitious national cybersecurity policy and following the   example of several other countries that have started this process some years ago, to have available   a cybersecurity governance model responsible, at least, for carrying out such roles identified as   essential -which are not being addressed, or are executed with no coordination within the country;   therefore, the creation of an institutional framework to take up that role is hereby proposed.   A modern governance model and institutional framework which is in Line with the needs of cyberspace   and the country’s digital development, will be a matter of law to be prepared and submitted by   responsible institutional actors. Additionally, the creation of an advisory consulting council composed   of different sectors will be assessed.   The roles identified as essential are: management of inter-institutional relationships, incident   management, national and international point of contact, communications role, technical regulation   and advisory role in general regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures.

With regard to cybersecurity, judges have the power to order some intrusive   actions, control the legality of criminal investigations, and decide upon criminal cases, including   cybercrime.    Annex No 2: Risk and threat overview   1. SOURCES AND TYPES OF RISKS AND THREATS   Due to the global nature of cyberspace, risks come from threats both from Chile and abroad and have   different origins relevant for the country, namely:   e Internal incidents: Involuntary information leakages, accidental interruption of information   systems, or other involuntary incidents that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability   and traceability of the information.   e Natural disasters or force majeure: Earthquakes, floods and other disasters that may affect   cyberspace caused by the destruction of physical infrastructures essential for information   availability.   e Espionage and surveillance activities carried out by State actors: Conducts that affect   information confidentiality due to theft of the same for political or strategic purposes. Particularly   important is the use of sophisticated tools known as APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) that, in   turn, may benefit from non-published computer vulnerabilities of technologies in use.   ¢ Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DOS and DDOS) attacks: These attacks   relate with the intentional overcharge of services provided in a computer system which, in turn,   can be conducted from one point of the network, or distributed to coordinate the attack from   various points, many times by using infected devices with malicious programmes in order to   achieve their objective.   e Cybercrime: Criminal activities perpetrated against components in the cyberspace (non-   authorised access, information sabotage, information theft, information hijacking or ransomware)   or employing tools in cyberspace as a means for such crimes (phishing, pharming, virtual fraud,   and other related crimes).   e Attacks against critical infrastructures through the cyberspace: An alteration in the operation   of critical infrastructures (both physical and information infrastructure) carried out by electronic   means, e.g. the large-scale disruption of financial systems, interference of basis services, physical   damage to physical structures and other related attacks.   All the above risks and threats affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability   of information assets in the cyberspace and, in the medium-term this may affect the country’s   development in cyberspace, thus depriving us from the benefits associated with the digital   government, ways of social organisation facilitated by cyberspace and threats to the security of   people and institutions in this field. Some cases may fit in more categories than the ones described   herein.   2. RISKS AND THREATS IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT   At a global scale, there are many examples of cyber attacks consisting in espionage activities and   distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet. Likewise, the large-scale interception   of telecommunication networks, the failure of Internet services, espionage activities against   governments and companies, as well as attacks against critical infrastructures such as banks and   Government services, have been regularly in the news. There is also plenty of evidence with regard   to legal abuses in the request for data to diverse providers of digital goods and services by countries   where such providers are based.      35 <<    >>   NATMONAL  CYBERSECURITY  POLICY (NCSP)   2017-2022   Some cases worth mentioning are: Iran (2010), whose nuclear centrifuges were disabled by a computer   virus especially designed for such purpose; Estonia (2007), where part of its critical infrastructure was   disabled for weeks; disclosures by Edward Snowden (2013) about widespread espionage activities   by the United State's intelligence agencies -which scope is still undetermined due to the number   and regularity of such disclosures; and espionage activities against companies in the defence field   (Lockheed, 2011) and entertainment (Sony, 2014),also in the US, which scope seriously compromises   the economic interests and fundamental rights of people around the world.   3. RISKS AND THREATS. IN\\A REGIONAL CONTEXT   Regionally, the countries that have reported the highest number of cyber attacks in Latin America   were Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Chile. Accesses and information theft from infected   computers - called botnets - were widespread in the region. There was even a specific type of   malicious code called dorkbot that generated over 80K actions against the virtual system, with higher   concentrations in Chile (44%), Peru (15%) and Argentina (11%).   4. MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES DETECTED IN THE STATE’S CONNECTIVITY NETWORK   In Chile, the State’s Connectivity Network (RCE) is affected by many malicious or suspicious activities. There is an   incident record related with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or alterations in Government website’s   operations, with an increasing number of these incidents starting in 2010. Likewise, in 2015, at a general level,   administrators of the Government network spotted the following patters:       17 Prandini, P. & Maggiore, M. 2013. Op.

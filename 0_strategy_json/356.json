In this domain countless interconnected and com- municating services meet the daily needs of our communities and carry out their economic activi- ties: energy infrastructures, financial markets, drinking water supplies, mass transit and, last but not least, the essential functions of the State, including its defence and integrity. Systems com- plexity and interdependence has grown to the point of blurring the duality between the digital dimen- sion and the real world, often making it difficult to identify borders and their respective characteristics. If, on one hand, the relentless evolution of modern technologies makes digital \"migration\" more con- venient, on the other hand, only the resilience and security of networks and systems on which these services are based on can guarantee, in the short term, the security for our community and, in the future, the economic development and welfare of the State. Scientific research and industrial development determine the spread and progressive use of the so-called emerging and disruptive technologies (EDT), which include latest generation communi- cation networks and protocols (5G/6G), block- chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum comput- ing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, advanced cryptographic tools and other disruptive innovations. The risks implied by such complexity – and the potential many economic, social and political implications – range from technological depend- ence and loss of strategic autonomy of the State to anthropogenic threats, in which human error is added to the initiatives of hostile actors, charac- terized by different degrees of sophistication and driven by different, but equally harmful, inten- tions. They are aimed at obtaining illicit profits (cyber-crime), gaining an information advantage for the purposes of geopolitical competition (cyber-espionage), spreading divisive and polariz- ing narratives in adherence to specific ideologies or political motivations. No organization, even if technologi- cally equipped and procedurally prepared, can come to completely eradicate the threats emanating from cyberspace. This reality must be addressed by acting according to an approach that includes the adoption of risk preven- tion and mitigation measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of digital infrastructures. The latter not only include networks, systems and data, but also, and above all, users – be they institutional actors, private companies or citizens – whose awareness must be raised through a widespread cybersecurity culture. If today, in fact, there is a widespread perception of the risks related to physical security, for which every indi- vidual carries out, in their daily lives, actions aimed at protecting themselves and their assets, the same cannot be said for the digital dimension, which risks are not yet fully understood. This aspect, combined with the increasingly wide availability – at relatively low costs – of offensive tools, the increased level of cyber-attacks complexity, the technical difficulty of attributing them to a certain actor, as well as the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IT products and solutions, has registered an overall number of hostile actions in constant increase. The recent attack trends provide evidence of economic and reputational damages to businesses, blocking of energy infrastructure operations, malfunctions of information systems used by hospitals and healthcare companies, dissemination of personal data aimed at discrediting public figures, journalists and political activ- ists, to the point of sometimes endangering their safety. Four essential considerations arise from this scenario: one of the duties of the State is the definition of adequate cybersecurity strategies aimed at planning, coor- dinating and implementing measures meant to make the Country safe and resilient even in the digital domain, while ensuring citizens' trust in the possibility of exploiting its competitive advantages, in full protec- tion of fundamental rights and freedoms; cybersecurity, which has become a matter of strategic importance, must be the foundation of the Country's digitalization process, as an essential element of digital transformation, also with a view to achieving strate- gic national autonomy in the sector; cybersecurity must then be perceived not as a cost, but as an investment and an enabling factor for the development of the national economy and industry, to increase the competitiveness of the Country at a global level; cultural advance at every level of society, towards a \"security-oriented\" approach, must go in parallel with ensuring the security of infrastructures, systems and information from a technical point of view, as an indis- pensable element in protecting our value and democratic system. Being aware of what mentioned above and of the speed and breadth of technological change that require persevering in the work of regulatory and strategic adaptation, starting from 2013, a lot has been done by our Country in the field of cybersecurity. Over time, in fact, a series of measures have been adopted substan- tially aimed both at acquiring, developing and strengthening the necessary national cyber capabilities, and at guaranteeing the institutional uniqueness of direction and action with respect to cybersecurity as an area of intervention extremely transversal and involving various stakeholders. These goals are being pursued through the recent reform of the national cyber ecosystem, which was enact- ed by the adoption of the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82. The Decree established the National Cyberse- curity Agency (ACN), with the aim of rationalizing and simplifying the fragmented system of skills, existing at national level – in compliance with the competences attributed to other Administrations by legislation in force – and further enhancing the cyber security and resilience, also for the purposes of protecting national security in the cyberspace. As the National Cybersecurity Authority, the Agency has, among its tasks, that of developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Furthermore, pursuant to the aforementioned Law Decree, ACN is designated as the exclusive competent national authority and single point of contact (PoC) for the purposes referred to in the legislation on the security of networks and information systems (NIS), national cybersecurity certification authority, National Coordination Centre with reference to the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, and central element of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber (PSNC). These competences were previously attributed to a plurality of institutional actors. The creation of ACN aimed at systematizing the experience gained in the previous five years of work, under the framework of the Prime Ministerial Decree of February 17, 2017 \"Directive containing guidelines for national cyber protection and IT security\", as well as that acquired by other countries, by recognizing cyber security and resilience as autonomous, placing them under the Prime Minister’s responsibility and at the basis of the Country's digitization process, also through a broader role of coordination and close synergy with all competent Administrations. It was therefore defined a further pillar assigning it to a single government entity which supplements those already existing on cybercrime prevention and countering (within the duties of National Police), military defence and security of the State in the cyber domain (pertaining to the Ministry of Defence) and intelligence (under the responsibility of the Intelligence community). This in order to ensure the coherence of initiatives, the efficiency of spending, the ability to provide a clear and updated situational awareness to the political Authority, as well as to identify a single interface in charge, in compliance with the competences attributed by the legislation in force to other Administrations, of the coordination between the public entities involved on cyber security and resilience matters, also to guarantee a common national pos- ture consistent with cybersecurity and resilience policies defined by the Prime Minister in international fora. To ensure cyber-resilience, the Agency aims to become a hotbed of skills, both to be employed internally as well as in other Public Administrations to raise our national cyber posture. In fact, to carry out its many institutional tasks ACN – as a structure of excellence and an asset for the Country – requires several and high-level professional skills. Starting from 2022, targeted campaigns will lead to the recruitment of experts who will reach the target of 800 units in 2027. This will also allow to stem the brain drain abroad and to return some of our talents to their homeland, envisaging a path of professional growth at the service of their Country’s security. The prevention and countering of cybercrime is provided by the Italian National Police through the Postal and Communications Police Service, within which operates the National Cybercrime Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNAIPIC) as a specialized unit for the protection of critical information infrastructures from cybercrime and as the national contact point for emergencies in the field of transnational cybercrime. Furthermore, the Central Directorate for scientific police and cybersecurity was recently established within the Department of Public Security which brings together the powers of central body of the Ministry of the Interior for the security and regularity of communications and those to fight against computer sexual exploitation crimes and prevent terrorism, previously ensured by the Postal and Communications Police Service. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of the Ministry of the Interior will operate at the Central Directorate for Cyber Security, established to ensure the security of the related networks and information systems, through the prevention and management of critical events. Regarding the Carabinieri Corps, the Telematic Investigations Department of the Special Operational Group (ROS) is the specialized division of the Corps in the fight against cybercrime, in the study and experimentation of technologies for surfing the web and intercepting electronic flows. Within the Financial Police, such role is held by the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud (NSTPFT) as a Special Department in charge of countering telematic and IT frauds, as well as protecting privacy. In relation, then, to the defence and security of the State, the Ministry of Defence defines and coordinates military policy, governance and military capabilities in the cyber domain, as well as the development of cyber capabilities and the protection of its networks and systems both on the national territory and in operational theatres abroad. The Defence, through dedicated specialized divisions, conducts offensive and defensive military cyber operations in pre-defined cases. The Ministry of Defence, therefore, ensures, even in case of cyber crises (both national and international), all the services and activities necessary, on the one hand, to guarantee the protection, resilience and efficiency of military networks and infrastructures. and, on the other hand, to develop their own peculiar abilities necessary for the implementation of support, defence, reaction and stabilization activities. The intelligence collection and analysis, aimed at protecting Italy's political, military, economic, scientific and industrial interests, is entrusted to the Intelligence Community, which for these purposes also provides, even through the conduct of cyber operations, for the activities aimed at the detection and systematic monitoring, prevention and contrasting of the most insidious cyber threats perpetrated in or through the digital environment. An important role, transversal to the four pillars, is also constituted by cyber diplomacy as the use of diplomatic tools and initiatives to achieve national interests in the cyberspace and as part of the broader foreign policy activities considering the impact of technology on international relations. This activity is headed by the Cyberspace Policies and Security Unit of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI). Beyond the competent institutional actors – which do not end with those mentioned above¹ – this strategy is inspired by a \"whole-of-society\" approach, which also involves private operators, the academic and research world, as well as civil society as a whole and citizenship. In this strategic vision, in fact, the latter is conceived not only as an indirect beneficiary of the measures envisaged in the Implementation Plan but also as an active part. Indeed, the ultimate goal of national cybersecurity can only be achieved with the contribution of all components of the social fabric, none excluded.

This activity is headed by the Cyberspace Policies and Security Unit of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI). Beyond the competent institutional actors – which do not end with those mentioned above¹ – this strategy is inspired by a \"whole-of-society\" approach, which also involves private operators, the academic and research world, as well as civil society as a whole and citizenship. In this strategic vision, in fact, the latter is conceived not only as an indirect beneficiary of the measures envisaged in the Implementation Plan but also as an active part.

THE TECHNICAL-OPERATIONAL PILLARS SYNERGIES Cybersecurity & Resilience Military Defence and Security of the State Intelligence Prevention and combating of cybercrime * Strategy National Cybersecurity Connection speed, number of interactions among users, and online accessibility of data and informa- tion are not sufficient parameters to define the digi- tal development that characterizes the contempo- rary age, nor are they able to describe, in its entirety, the complexity of cyberspace. In this domain countless interconnected and com- municating services meet the daily needs of our communities and carry out their economic activi- ties: energy infrastructures, financial markets, drinking water supplies, mass transit and, last but not least, the essential functions of the State, including its defence and integrity. Systems com- plexity and interdependence has grown to the point of blurring the duality between the digital dimen- sion and the real world, often making it difficult to identify borders and their respective characteristics. If, on one hand, the relentless evolution of modern technologies makes digital \"migration\" more con- venient, on the other hand, only the resilience and security of networks and systems on which these services are based on can guarantee, in the short term, the security for our community and, in the future, the economic development and welfare of the State. Scientific research and industrial development determine the spread and progressive use of the so-called emerging and disruptive technologies (EDT), which include latest generation communi- cation networks and protocols (5G/6G), block- chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum comput- ing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, advanced cryptographic tools and other disruptive innovations. The risks implied by such complexity – and the potential many economic, social and political implications – range from technological depend- ence and loss of strategic autonomy of the State to anthropogenic threats, in which human error is added to the initiatives of hostile actors, charac- terized by different degrees of sophistication and driven by different, but equally harmful, inten- tions. They are aimed at obtaining illicit profits (cyber-crime), gaining an information advantage for the purposes of geopolitical competition (cyber-espionage), spreading divisive and polariz- ing narratives in adherence to specific ideologies or political motivations. No organization, even if technologi- cally equipped and procedurally prepared, can come to completely eradicate the threats emanating from cyberspace. This reality must be addressed by acting according to an approach that includes the adoption of risk preven- tion and mitigation measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of digital infrastructures. The latter not only include networks, systems and data, but also, and above all, users – be they institutional actors, private companies or citizens – whose awareness must be raised through a widespread cybersecurity culture. If today, in fact, there is a widespread perception of the risks related to physical security, for which every indi- vidual carries out, in their daily lives, actions aimed at protecting themselves and their assets, the same cannot be said for the digital dimension, which risks are not yet fully understood. This aspect, combined with the increasingly wide availability – at relatively low costs – of offensive tools, the increased level of cyber-attacks complexity, the technical difficulty of attributing them to a certain actor, as well as the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IT products and solutions, has registered an overall number of hostile actions in constant increase. The recent attack trends provide evidence of economic and reputational damages to businesses, blocking of energy infrastructure operations, malfunctions of information systems used by hospitals and healthcare companies, dissemination of personal data aimed at discrediting public figures, journalists and political activ- ists, to the point of sometimes endangering their safety. Four essential considerations arise from this scenario: one of the duties of the State is the definition of adequate cybersecurity strategies aimed at planning, coor- dinating and implementing measures meant to make the Country safe and resilient even in the digital domain, while ensuring citizens' trust in the possibility of exploiting its competitive advantages, in full protec- tion of fundamental rights and freedoms; cybersecurity, which has become a matter of strategic importance, must be the foundation of the Country's digitalization process, as an essential element of digital transformation, also with a view to achieving strate- gic national autonomy in the sector; cybersecurity must then be perceived not as a cost, but as an investment and an enabling factor for the development of the national economy and industry, to increase the competitiveness of the Country at a global level; cultural advance at every level of society, towards a \"security-oriented\" approach, must go in parallel with ensuring the security of infrastructures, systems and information from a technical point of view, as an indis- pensable element in protecting our value and democratic system. Being aware of what mentioned above and of the speed and breadth of technological change that require persevering in the work of regulatory and strategic adaptation, starting from 2013, a lot has been done by our Country in the field of cybersecurity. Over time, in fact, a series of measures have been adopted substan- tially aimed both at acquiring, developing and strengthening the necessary national cyber capabilities, and at guaranteeing the institutional uniqueness of direction and action with respect to cybersecurity as an area of intervention extremely transversal and involving various stakeholders. These goals are being pursued through the recent reform of the national cyber ecosystem, which was enact- ed by the adoption of the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82. The Decree established the National Cyberse- curity Agency (ACN), with the aim of rationalizing and simplifying the fragmented system of skills, existing at national level – in compliance with the competences attributed to other Administrations by legislation in force – and further enhancing the cyber security and resilience, also for the purposes of protecting national security in the cyberspace. As the National Cybersecurity Authority, the Agency has, among its tasks, that of developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Furthermore, pursuant to the aforementioned Law Decree, ACN is designated as the exclusive competent national authority and single point of contact (PoC) for the purposes referred to in the legislation on the security of networks and information systems (NIS), national cybersecurity certification authority, National Coordination Centre with reference to the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, and central element of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber (PSNC). These competences were previously attributed to a plurality of institutional actors. The creation of ACN aimed at systematizing the experience gained in the previous five years of work, under the framework of the Prime Ministerial Decree of February 17, 2017 \"Directive containing guidelines for national cyber protection and IT security\", as well as that acquired by other countries, by recognizing cyber security and resilience as autonomous, placing them under the Prime Minister’s responsibility and at the basis of the Country's digitization process, also through a broader role of coordination and close synergy with all competent Administrations. It was therefore defined a further pillar assigning it to a single government entity which supplements those already existing on cybercrime prevention and countering (within the duties of National Police), military defence and security of the State in the cyber domain (pertaining to the Ministry of Defence) and intelligence (under the responsibility of the Intelligence community). This in order to ensure the coherence of initiatives, the efficiency of spending, the ability to provide a clear and updated situational awareness to the political Authority, as well as to identify a single interface in charge, in compliance with the competences attributed by the legislation in force to other Administrations, of the coordination between the public entities involved on cyber security and resilience matters, also to guarantee a common national pos- ture consistent with cybersecurity and resilience policies defined by the Prime Minister in international fora. To ensure cyber-resilience, the Agency aims to become a hotbed of skills, both to be employed internally as well as in other Public Administrations to raise our national cyber posture. In fact, to carry out its many institutional tasks ACN – as a structure of excellence and an asset for the Country – requires several and high-level professional skills. Starting from 2022, targeted campaigns will lead to the recruitment of experts who will reach the target of 800 units in 2027. This will also allow to stem the brain drain abroad and to return some of our talents to their homeland, envisaging a path of professional growth at the service of their Country’s security. The prevention and countering of cybercrime is provided by the Italian National Police through the Postal and Communications Police Service, within which operates the National Cybercrime Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNAIPIC) as a specialized unit for the protection of critical information infrastructures from cybercrime and as the national contact point for emergencies in the field of transnational cybercrime. Furthermore, the Central Directorate for scientific police and cybersecurity was recently established within the Department of Public Security which brings together the powers of central body of the Ministry of the Interior for the security and regularity of communications and those to fight against computer sexual exploitation crimes and prevent terrorism, previously ensured by the Postal and Communications Police Service. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of the Ministry of the Interior will operate at the Central Directorate for Cyber Security, established to ensure the security of the related networks and information systems, through the prevention and management of critical events. Regarding the Carabinieri Corps, the Telematic Investigations Department of the Special Operational Group (ROS) is the specialized division of the Corps in the fight against cybercrime, in the study and experimentation of technologies for surfing the web and intercepting electronic flows. Within the Financial Police, such role is held by the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud (NSTPFT) as a Special Department in charge of countering telematic and IT frauds, as well as protecting privacy. In relation, then, to the defence and security of the State, the Ministry of Defence defines and coordinates military policy, governance and military capabilities in the cyber domain, as well as the development of cyber capabilities and the protection of its networks and systems both on the national territory and in operational theatres abroad. The Defence, through dedicated specialized divisions, conducts offensive and defensive military cyber operations in pre-defined cases. The Ministry of Defence, therefore, ensures, even in case of cyber crises (both national and international), all the services and activities necessary, on the one hand, to guarantee the protection, resilience and efficiency of military networks and infrastructures. and, on the other hand, to develop their own peculiar abilities necessary for the implementation of support, defence, reaction and stabilization activities. The intelligence collection and analysis, aimed at protecting Italy's political, military, economic, scientific and industrial interests, is entrusted to the Intelligence Community, which for these purposes also provides, even through the conduct of cyber operations, for the activities aimed at the detection and systematic monitoring, prevention and contrasting of the most insidious cyber threats perpetrated in or through the digital environment.

However, such a scenario doesn’t always match with the society’s cybersecurity awareness level. Among those risks, the systemic ones are related to: cyber-attacks due to cybercriminals, hacktivists or coordinated state campaigns which exploit software errors, misconfigurations or protocols and/or human weaknesses to steal data or damage IT systems. This is the case of ransomware campaigns directly affecting the provision of services of a country (including the essential ones) and, as cascading effects, its GDP and its reputation; technology developed and produced by large companies, sometimes controlled or in any case influ- enced by the host-country governments in which they are based. This can lead to an interference in the supply chain, both in terms of availability on the market of the related components and of their own reliability; disinformation campaigns, fake news, deepfake and spreading misinformation through the cyber domain to manipulate and polarize the public opinion which finds itself overwhelmed by fast-moving and horizontal information coming from a massive number of sources, altering our sense of reality. Given those risks, this strategy aims to target the strengthening of our resilience in the digital transition, by fostering the safe use of technologies essentials for our present and future economic prosperity, the achievement of cybersecurity strategic autonomy, the cyber crises management in complex geopolitical scenarios, as well as anticipating the evolution of cyber threats and tackling the spread of online disinforma- tion, while respecting human rights, our values and principles. 10 #1 New challenges to face Strategy National Cybersecurity 111111 Bearing in mind the experience acquired in the implementation of the “National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security” (2013) and the “Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan” (updated in 2017), as the first national cybersecurity strategies, it became clear the need to focus on active defence tactics – in addition to the best practices on cyber-resilience and due diligence – aimed at increasing the costs of cyber-attacks to make them disadvantageous. That implies a radical change of approach. While it’s true that chasing the threat is not a winning strategy, it is also true that keeping up with it is no longer enough. It’s necessary, as far as possi- ble, to anticipate, predict and prevent it and to mitigate its impacts as much as possible. Anticipating the evolution of cyber threats At EU level, excessive fragmentation and competition among Member States has been a major barrier to the development of “made in EU” technology and the establishment of large digital service providers across the Union. As a consequence, the EU and Italy found themselves in a position of technological dependency on other countries leaders in the production of software and so-called emerging disruptive technologies (EDTs) such as Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing. This also has inevitable consequences on the possibility of having direct control over the data stored, processed and transmitted through these technologies. Therefore, achieving an effective technological autonomy will allow the implementation of adequate information sovereignty policies. National and European digital strategic autonomy NEW CHALLENGES TO FACE There can be no digital transition without an adequate resilience to cyber-attacks and incidents. Cybersecurity of digital assets and services is, indeed, an essential condition for their usability by citizens, who will thus not only be encouraged to use them but will do it trustfully knowing that their data are protected. It goes without saying that resilience shouldn’t be considered just as a technical circumstance but also as part of a broader vision which includes the cybersecurity culture and the availability of qualified workforce. Without the latter, indeed, there would not be any chance to achieve a real digital sovereignty. Moreover, another challenge adds to this one, the gender issue, as there is a low number of women who choose computer studies or STEM disciplines (Science, Technol- ogy, Engineering and Mathematics) and even fewer who specialize in cybersecurity. Ensure cyber resilience in the public sector and industry’s digital transition The latest international tensions have highlighted the primary importance of having an effective cyber crises management mecha- nism supported by the contribution of all the entities involved and by which activities can be graded basing on pre-set cyber threat scenarios – ranging from alerts in view of possible large-scale cyber events to their actual occurrence – which trigger the prompt application of common tools, procedures and language norms. The speed at which cyber events can occur and follow one another, especially in complex geopolitical scenarios, asks for a continuous coordination among all the public and private stakeholders involved, as well as readiness in the deployment of a pre-set of measures. Cyber crises management Tackling online disinformation also in relation to hybrid threats The digitalization of any aspect of social life, pivotal force behind the economic and social growth of the Western democratic systems, is more and more exploited to influence and interfere (or attempt to do it) in the exercise of fundamental freedoms, espe- cially just up against crucial events for these democratic systems, such as elections, decision-making processes on issues of strate- gic importance or international crises. The increasingly massive use of online disinformation, especially when highly organized, demands for synergical and coordinated preventive and countering measures carried out at both national and international level to hinder any attempt to undermine the value system on which our Country is based. Strategy National Cybersecurity 12 THE TOOLS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY To implement this strategy and face the aforementioned challenges, a solid investments program and finan- cial leverages are envisaged. Beyond the financial tools already allocated to the Administrations in charge of cybersecurity, specific funds may also be made available annually as part of the national budget, to support the implementation of specific actions. To that end, a percentage of annual gross investments will be reserved on an annual basis. These leverages may also include tax breaks for businesses or the provision of more beneficial tax treatments for the creation, for example, of a “National Cybersecurity Campus” and the related national “hubs”. Furthermore, the National Cybersecurity Agency will manage European funds to implement specific actions as National Coordination Centre, pursuant to the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82, as well as article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021, establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres, which will manage the cybersecurity-related financial support from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programmes. National funding Percentage (1,2%) of annual gross investments These funds will be dedicated to specific projects aimed at achieving digital technological autono- my, as well as further strengthening the cybersecurity of national information systems. Strategy National Cybersecurity The implementation plan, in agreement with the Department for Digital Transformation (DTD) as the invest- ment owner, is organized into three main areas of intervention and will involve all the main public and private cybersecurity national stakeholder, in accordance with the NRRP technical-organizational rules: 13 Horizon Europe 2021-2027 budget: EUR 95,51 billion Leading EU funding programme to facili- tate collaboration and to bolster the effects of research and innovation in the development, support and implementa- tion of EU policies, while addressing global challenges. It supports the crea- tion and better dissemination of top-lev- el know-how and technologies. It also aims to create new jobs, fully engage the EU talent pool, stimulate economic growth, promote industrial competitiveness and maximize the impact of investments within a strength- ened European research domain. Digital Europe 2021-2027 budget: EUR 7,59 billion First European funding programme to expand the digital skills of citizens and businesses and to speed up the economic and social recovery. The programme, which aims to bridge the gap between research on digital technolo- gies and market uptake, supports projects in five key capacity areas: These investments support the efforts to make EU greener and more digital, while strengthening its resilience and digital sovereignty. supercomputing artificial intelligence cybersecurity advanced digital skills ensuring a wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society. THE NATIONAL RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE PLAN: INVESTMENT 1.5 “CYBERSECURITY” Another strategic tool to address the aforementioned challenges is the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). As part of Mission 1 \"Digitalization, Innovation, Competitiveness, Culture and Tourism\", activi- ties aimed at achieving the digitalization of the Public Administration are included, such as the implementa- tion of a National Cloud and the digitalization of processes and services for citizens. The fulfilment of such actions will lead to an enhanced national digital infrastructures and services’ resilience capabilities. In addi- tion, the Investment 1.5 \"Cybersecurity\" – with EUR 623 million budget – assigned to the National Cyberse- curity Agency as implementing entity, is intended to implement specific actions for the creation and develop- ment of cutting-edge cyber risk management services, in close cooperation at national and international level with all the main partners of Public Administrations, businesses and technology suppliers. That to achieve a national technological autonomy by placing cybersecurity and resilience at the foundation of the digitalization of the Public Administration.

The implementation plan, in agreement with the Department for Digital Transformation (DTD) as the invest- ment owner, is organized into three main areas of intervention and will involve all the main public and private cybersecurity national stakeholder, in accordance with the NRRP technical-organizational rules: NRRP (digital transition) 2021-2026 budget: EUR 122,6 billion With NextGenerationEU (NGEU), the EU envisages investments and reforms to boost ecological and digital transitions, improve the professional development of female and male workers and achieve a better gender equality. Italy is the first beneficiary of the two main NGEU instruments: the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Terri- tories of Europe (REACT-EU). To access the funds under the RRF Member States are asked to prepare their National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRP). Our NRRP is divided into six Mis- sions and 16 Components. The six Missions are: digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, culture and tourism; green deal and ecological transition; infrastructures for a sustainable mobility; education and research; inclu- sion and cohesion; health.

Strategy National Cybersecurity Strategy National Cybersecurity #2 Our vision: the goals to reach 15 the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation. Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 16 #2 Our vision: the goals to reach National Coordination Centre National and European technology development National Cybersecurity Campus Cyber as a competitive advantage Secure digitization of the Country Technological screening Legal framework Situational awareness Cyber resilience of PAs National infrastructures Cryptography Countering online disinformation Crises management National cyber services Cyber exercises Attribution Tackling cybercrime Deterrence capabilities Institutions Civil societyPrivate operatorsBeneficiaries PROTECTION RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ENABLERS Strategy National Cybersecurity Cooperation Public - Private Partnership Cybersecurity training & Aw arness the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents.

Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 17 B. A. 1. PROTECTION GOAL Ministry of Interior’s Assessment Centre Ministry of Defence’s Assessment Centre Private Laboratories Public Laboratories CVCN ITALIA Strategy National Cybersecurity the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation. Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole.

At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 19 A. G. F. Strategy National Cybersecurity the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation. Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 20 Focus box - The management of cybersecurity incidents and crises The national cybersecurity incident and crises management architecture is fully compliant with the Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (so called Blueprint), with the: political level, represented by the Prime Minister, the Undersecretary of State for the security of the Republic, if appointed, and by the Interministerial Committee for the Security of the Republic (CISR); operational level, made up by the NCS, supported by ACN in connection with the competent units of NCS Administrations; technical level, carried out by the national CSIRT, in cooperation with the other technical units of NCS Administrations. ACN, embedding the national CSIRT, the NIS PoC and the NCS, performs two of the three aforementioned levels necessary to achieve an adequate national prevention and response to potential cyber-attacks, by supporting the political level through ACN Director General, as cyber crises coordinator. This synergical architecture aggregates and correlates the information, alerts and notifications acquired by the operational and technical levels if a cyber event requires a NCS activation and its potential escalation in its alert state, up to cyber crisis status. Such a process is fully aligned with other European and international counterparts. Moreover, this organization is integrated with the liaison role of ACN towards the European Union. At the EU level, indeed, ACN participates in the CSIRT Network and in the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe). Specifically, CyCLONe aims at contributing to the implementation of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid response to large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis, supporting Member States national authorities in charge of cyber crisis management and linking European political level – the Council of the EU, also through the Integrated Political Crisis Response mechanisms (IPCR) – with the technical one embodied by national CSIRTs and the EU CSIRT Network. CyCLONe’s tasks, on voluntary basis, include crises management preparation, situational awareness and cooperation, as well as the support to national and EU political decision-making.

Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 21 B. CyberShield ISAC Network Hyper SOC CSIRT Italia ISAC CSIRT NATIONAL NETWORK ISAC NATIONAL NETWORKSOC NATIONAL NETWORK Strategy National Cybersecurity the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation. Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap).

The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 3. DEVELOPMENT GOAL 23 A. B. C. Strategy National Cybersecurity the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.

This also with the aim to: continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments; develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) by private operators to increase their ability to manage vulnerabilities of ICT products. the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening Italy's industrial and technological autonomy. To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training, promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation. Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through: incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts, including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions; incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes- sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the labour market and the modulation of the educational paths; the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known bond between development and security; the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty; the creation of a national skills certification system (both at school/university, and work) through ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN; specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an investment rather than an expense; the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts. These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities. Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does not cease to create social alarm. In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace. This must happen: through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators; within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees – starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed, as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions; promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to independently manage the level of exposure. Finally, there is cooperation to be increased: at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry; internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting bilateral collaborations. At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies. Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media, families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination. Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored. 25 Strategy National Cybersecurity the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields: threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that could turn in significant emerging threats; ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective; incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response; information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations; incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of multiple and systemic cyber incidents. To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified - protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of the measures. Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it. The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact. To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential: the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve the Country's most critical assets. the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level. This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is of primary importance: the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and standards; the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market; the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high cybersecurity standards; the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public Administrations; the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with its counterparts and the international community. the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way. the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy. The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies, whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated. the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures; a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of the Internet by the Public Administrations; the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services, both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces; the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses. the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their maintenance and development. the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and social processes of the Country. The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and resolved response must be based on: a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured: the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the timely and synergic cyber crises management and response; the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the effective implementation from all the actors involved; a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary. These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing” (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within Member States. the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones. the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities, which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States. the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom, security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation. the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities. The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential: the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC) in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial. the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures. the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\", there are local branches throughout the Country. the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial, technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors).

In this domain countless interconnected and com- municating services meet the daily needs of our  communities and carry out their economic activi- ties: energy infrastructures, financial markets,  drinking water supplies, mass transit and, last but  not least, the essential functions of the State,  including its defence and integrity. Systems com- plexity and interdependence has grown to the point  of blurring the duality between the digital dimen- sion and the real world, often making it difficult to  identify borders and their respective characteristics.  If, on one hand, the relentless evolution of modern  technologies makes digital \"migration\" more con- venient, on the other hand, only the resilience and  security of networks and systems on which these  services are based on can guarantee, in the short  term, the security for our community and, in the   future, the economic development and welfare of  the State.  Scientific research and industrial development  determine the spread and progressive use of the  so-called emerging and disruptive technologies  (EDT), which include latest generation communi- cation networks and protocols (5G/6G), block- chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum comput- ing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet  of Things (IoT), robotics, advanced cryptographic  tools and other disruptive innovations.  The risks implied by such complexity – and the  potential many economic, social and political  implications – range from technological depend- ence and loss of strategic autonomy of the State  to anthropogenic threats, in which human error is  added to the initiatives of hostile actors, charac- terized by different degrees of sophistication and  driven by different, but equally harmful, inten- tions. They are aimed at obtaining illicit profits  (cyber-crime), gaining an information advantage  for the purposes of geopolitical competition  (cyber-espionage), spreading divisive and polariz-  ing narratives in adherence to specific ideologies or political motivations. No organization, even if technologi- cally equipped and procedurally prepared, can come to completely eradicate the threats emanating from  cyberspace.  This reality must be addressed by acting according to an approach that includes the adoption of risk preven- tion and mitigation measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of digital infrastructures. The latter not only  include networks, systems and data, but also, and above all, users – be they institutional actors, private  companies or citizens – whose awareness must be raised through a widespread cybersecurity culture. If  today, in fact, there is a widespread perception of the risks related to physical security, for which every indi- vidual carries out, in their daily lives, actions aimed at protecting themselves and their assets, the same  cannot be said for the digital dimension, which risks are not yet fully understood.   This aspect, combined with the increasingly wide availability – at relatively low costs – of offensive tools, the  increased level of cyber-attacks complexity, the technical difficulty of attributing them to a certain actor, as  well as the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IT products and solutions, has registered an overall  number of hostile actions in constant increase.  The recent attack trends provide evidence of economic and reputational damages to businesses, blocking of  energy infrastructure operations, malfunctions of information systems used by hospitals and healthcare  companies, dissemination of personal data aimed at discrediting public figures, journalists and political activ- ists, to the point of sometimes endangering their safety.  Four essential considerations arise from this scenario:   one of the duties of the State is the definition of adequate cybersecurity strategies aimed at planning, coor- dinating and implementing measures meant to make the Country safe and resilient even in the digital  domain, while ensuring citizens' trust in the possibility of exploiting its competitive advantages, in full protec- tion of fundamental rights and freedoms;   cybersecurity, which has become a matter of strategic importance, must be the foundation of the Country's  digitalization process, as an essential element of digital transformation, also with a view to achieving strate- gic national autonomy in the sector;  cybersecurity must then be perceived not as a cost, but as an investment and an enabling factor for the  development of the national economy and industry, to increase the competitiveness of the Country at a  global level;   cultural advance at every level of society, towards a \"security-oriented\" approach, must go in parallel with  ensuring the security of infrastructures, systems and information from a technical point of view, as an indis- pensable element in protecting our value and democratic system.  Being aware of what mentioned above and of the speed and breadth of technological change that require  persevering in the work of regulatory and strategic adaptation, starting from 2013, a lot has been done by  our Country in the field of cybersecurity. Over time, in fact, a series of measures have been adopted substan- tially aimed both at acquiring, developing and strengthening the necessary national cyber capabilities, and at   guaranteeing the institutional uniqueness of direction and action with respect to cybersecurity as an area of  intervention extremely transversal and involving various stakeholders.  These goals are being pursued through the recent reform of the national cyber ecosystem, which was enact- ed by the adoption of the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82. The Decree established the National Cyberse- curity Agency (ACN), with the aim of rationalizing and simplifying the fragmented system of skills, existing at  national level – in compliance with the competences attributed to other Administrations by legislation in  force – and further enhancing the cyber security and resilience, also for the purposes of protecting national  security in the cyberspace.  As the National Cybersecurity Authority, the Agency has, among its tasks, that of developing the National  Cybersecurity Strategy. Furthermore, pursuant to the aforementioned Law Decree, ACN is designated as the  exclusive competent national authority and single point of contact (PoC) for the purposes referred to in the  legislation on the security of networks and information systems (NIS), national cybersecurity certification  authority, National Coordination Centre with reference to the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology  and Research Competence Centre, and central element of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber (PSNC).  These competences were previously attributed to a plurality of institutional actors.  The creation of ACN aimed at systematizing the experience gained in the previous five years of work, under  the framework of the Prime Ministerial Decree of February 17, 2017 \"Directive containing guidelines for  national cyber protection and IT security\", as well as that acquired by other countries, by recognizing cyber  security and resilience as autonomous, placing them under the Prime Minister’s responsibility and at the  basis of the Country's digitization process, also through a broader role of coordination and close synergy with  all competent Administrations. It was therefore defined a further pillar assigning it to a single government   entity which supplements those already existing on cybercrime prevention and countering (within the duties  of National Police), military defence and security of the State in the cyber domain (pertaining to the Ministry  of Defence) and intelligence (under the responsibility of the Intelligence community). This in order to ensure  the coherence of initiatives, the efficiency of spending, the ability to provide a clear and updated situational  awareness to the political Authority, as well as to identify a single interface in charge, in compliance with the  competences attributed by the legislation in force to other Administrations, of the coordination between the  public entities involved on cyber security and resilience matters, also to guarantee a common national pos- ture consistent with cybersecurity and resilience policies defined by the Prime Minister in international fora.  To ensure cyber-resilience, the Agency aims to become a hotbed of skills, both to be employed internally as  well as in other Public Administrations to raise our national cyber posture. In fact, to carry out its many  institutional tasks ACN – as a structure of excellence and an asset for the Country – requires several and  high-level professional skills. Starting from 2022, targeted campaigns will lead to the recruitment of experts  who will reach the target of 800 units in 2027. This will also allow to stem the brain drain abroad and to  return some of our talents to their homeland, envisaging a path of professional growth at the service of their  Country’s security.  The prevention and countering of cybercrime is provided by the Italian National Police through the Postal and  Communications Police Service, within which operates the National Cybercrime Centre for Critical  Infrastructure Protection (CNAIPIC) as a specialized unit for the protection of critical information  infrastructures from cybercrime and as the national contact point for emergencies in the field of  transnational cybercrime. Furthermore, the Central Directorate for scientific police and cybersecurity was  recently established within the Department of Public Security which brings together the powers of central  body of the Ministry of the Interior for the security and regularity of communications and those to fight  against computer sexual exploitation crimes and prevent terrorism, previously ensured by the Postal and  Communications Police Service. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of the Ministry of the  Interior will operate at the Central Directorate for Cyber Security, established to ensure the security of the  related networks and information systems, through the prevention and management of critical events.  Regarding the Carabinieri Corps, the Telematic Investigations Department of the Special Operational Group  (ROS) is the specialized division of the Corps in the fight against cybercrime, in the study and experimentation  of technologies for surfing the web and intercepting electronic flows. Within the Financial Police, such role is  held by the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud (NSTPFT) as a Special  Department in charge of countering telematic and IT frauds, as well as protecting privacy.  In relation, then, to the defence and security of the State, the Ministry of Defence defines and coordinates  military policy, governance and military capabilities in the cyber domain, as well as the development of cyber  capabilities and the protection of its networks and systems both on the national territory and in operational  theatres abroad. The Defence, through dedicated specialized divisions, conducts offensive and defensive  military cyber operations in pre-defined cases.  The Ministry of Defence, therefore, ensures, even in case of cyber crises (both national and international), all  the services and activities necessary, on the one hand, to guarantee the protection, resilience and efficiency  of military networks and infrastructures. and, on the other hand, to develop their own peculiar abilities  necessary for the implementation of support, defence, reaction and stabilization activities.  The intelligence collection and analysis, aimed at protecting Italy's political, military, economic, scientific and  industrial interests, is entrusted to the Intelligence Community, which for these purposes also provides, even  through the conduct of cyber operations, for the activities aimed at the detection and systematic monitoring,  prevention and contrasting of the most insidious cyber threats perpetrated in or through the digital  environment.  An important role, transversal to the four pillars, is also constituted by cyber diplomacy as the use of  diplomatic tools and initiatives to achieve national interests in the cyberspace and as part of the broader  foreign policy activities considering the impact of technology on international relations. This activity is  headed by the Cyberspace Policies and Security Unit of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International  Cooperation (MAECI).  Beyond the competent institutional actors – which do not end with those mentioned above¹  – this strategy  is inspired by a \"whole-of-society\" approach, which also involves private operators, the academic and  research world, as well as civil society as a whole and citizenship. In this strategic vision, in fact, the latter is  conceived not only as an indirect beneficiary of the measures envisaged in the Implementation Plan but also  as an active part. Indeed, the ultimate goal of national cybersecurity can only be achieved with the  contribution of all components of the social fabric, none excluded.  Strategy National Cybersecurity    05  Connection speed, number of interactions among  users, and online accessibility of data and informa- tion are not sufficient parameters to define the digi- tal development that characterizes the contempo- rary age, nor are they able to describe, in its entirety,  the complexity of cyberspace.  In this domain countless interconnected and com- municating services meet the daily needs of our  communities and carry out their economic activi- ties: energy infrastructures, financial markets,  drinking water supplies, mass transit and, last but  not least, the essential functions of the State,  including its defence and integrity. Systems com- plexity and interdependence has grown to the point  of blurring the duality between the digital dimen- sion and the real world, often making it difficult to  identify borders and their respective characteristics.  If, on one hand, the relentless evolution of modern  technologies makes digital \"migration\" more con- venient, on the other hand, only the resilience and  security of networks and systems on which these  services are based on can guarantee, in the short  term, the security for our community and, in the   future, the economic development and welfare of  the State.  Scientific research and industrial development  determine the spread and progressive use of the  so-called emerging and disruptive technologies  (EDT), which include latest generation communi- cation networks and protocols (5G/6G), block- chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum comput- ing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet  of Things (IoT), robotics, advanced cryptographic  tools and other disruptive innovations.  The risks implied by such complexity – and the  potential many economic, social and political  implications – range from technological depend- ence and loss of strategic autonomy of the State  to anthropogenic threats, in which human error is  added to the initiatives of hostile actors, charac- terized by different degrees of sophistication and  driven by different, but equally harmful, inten- tions. They are aimed at obtaining illicit profits  (cyber-crime), gaining an information advantage  for the purposes of geopolitical competition  (cyber-espionage), spreading divisive and polariz-  ing narratives in adherence to specific ideologies or political motivations. No organization, even if technologi- cally equipped and procedurally prepared, can come to completely eradicate the threats emanating from  cyberspace.  This reality must be addressed by acting according to an approach that includes the adoption of risk preven- tion and mitigation measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of digital infrastructures. The latter not only  include networks, systems and data, but also, and above all, users – be they institutional actors, private  companies or citizens – whose awareness must be raised through a widespread cybersecurity culture. If  today, in fact, there is a widespread perception of the risks related to physical security, for which every indi- vidual carries out, in their daily lives, actions aimed at protecting themselves and their assets, the same  cannot be said for the digital dimension, which risks are not yet fully understood.   This aspect, combined with the increasingly wide availability – at relatively low costs – of offensive tools, the  increased level of cyber-attacks complexity, the technical difficulty of attributing them to a certain actor, as  well as the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IT products and solutions, has registered an overall  number of hostile actions in constant increase.

Four essential considerations arise from this scenario:   one of the duties of the State is the definition of adequate cybersecurity strategies aimed at planning, coor- dinating and implementing measures meant to make the Country safe and resilient even in the digital  domain, while ensuring citizens' trust in the possibility of exploiting its competitive advantages, in full protec- tion of fundamental rights and freedoms;   cybersecurity, which has become a matter of strategic importance, must be the foundation of the Country's  digitalization process, as an essential element of digital transformation, also with a view to achieving strate- gic national autonomy in the sector;  cybersecurity must then be perceived not as a cost, but as an investment and an enabling factor for the  development of the national economy and industry, to increase the competitiveness of the Country at a  global level;   cultural advance at every level of society, towards a \"security-oriented\" approach, must go in parallel with  ensuring the security of infrastructures, systems and information from a technical point of view, as an indis- pensable element in protecting our value and democratic system.  Being aware of what mentioned above and of the speed and breadth of technological change that require  persevering in the work of regulatory and strategic adaptation, starting from 2013, a lot has been done by  our Country in the field of cybersecurity. Over time, in fact, a series of measures have been adopted substan- tially aimed both at acquiring, developing and strengthening the necessary national cyber capabilities, and at   guaranteeing the institutional uniqueness of direction and action with respect to cybersecurity as an area of  intervention extremely transversal and involving various stakeholders.  These goals are being pursued through the recent reform of the national cyber ecosystem, which was enact- ed by the adoption of the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82. The Decree established the National Cyberse- curity Agency (ACN), with the aim of rationalizing and simplifying the fragmented system of skills, existing at  national level – in compliance with the competences attributed to other Administrations by legislation in  force – and further enhancing the cyber security and resilience, also for the purposes of protecting national  security in the cyberspace.  As the National Cybersecurity Authority, the Agency has, among its tasks, that of developing the National  Cybersecurity Strategy. Furthermore, pursuant to the aforementioned Law Decree, ACN is designated as the  exclusive competent national authority and single point of contact (PoC) for the purposes referred to in the  legislation on the security of networks and information systems (NIS), national cybersecurity certification  authority, National Coordination Centre with reference to the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology  and Research Competence Centre, and central element of the National Security Perimeter for Cyber (PSNC).  These competences were previously attributed to a plurality of institutional actors.  The creation of ACN aimed at systematizing the experience gained in the previous five years of work, under  the framework of the Prime Ministerial Decree of February 17, 2017 \"Directive containing guidelines for  national cyber protection and IT security\", as well as that acquired by other countries, by recognizing cyber  security and resilience as autonomous, placing them under the Prime Minister’s responsibility and at the  basis of the Country's digitization process, also through a broader role of coordination and close synergy with  all competent Administrations. It was therefore defined a further pillar assigning it to a single government   entity which supplements those already existing on cybercrime prevention and countering (within the duties  of National Police), military defence and security of the State in the cyber domain (pertaining to the Ministry  of Defence) and intelligence (under the responsibility of the Intelligence community). This in order to ensure  the coherence of initiatives, the efficiency of spending, the ability to provide a clear and updated situational  awareness to the political Authority, as well as to identify a single interface in charge, in compliance with the  competences attributed by the legislation in force to other Administrations, of the coordination between the  public entities involved on cyber security and resilience matters, also to guarantee a common national pos- ture consistent with cybersecurity and resilience policies defined by the Prime Minister in international fora.  To ensure cyber-resilience, the Agency aims to become a hotbed of skills, both to be employed internally as  well as in other Public Administrations to raise our national cyber posture. In fact, to carry out its many  institutional tasks ACN – as a structure of excellence and an asset for the Country – requires several and  high-level professional skills. Starting from 2022, targeted campaigns will lead to the recruitment of experts  who will reach the target of 800 units in 2027. This will also allow to stem the brain drain abroad and to  return some of our talents to their homeland, envisaging a path of professional growth at the service of their  Country’s security.  The prevention and countering of cybercrime is provided by the Italian National Police through the Postal and  Communications Police Service, within which operates the National Cybercrime Centre for Critical  Infrastructure Protection (CNAIPIC) as a specialized unit for the protection of critical information  infrastructures from cybercrime and as the national contact point for emergencies in the field of  transnational cybercrime. Furthermore, the Central Directorate for scientific police and cybersecurity was  recently established within the Department of Public Security which brings together the powers of central  body of the Ministry of the Interior for the security and regularity of communications and those to fight  against computer sexual exploitation crimes and prevent terrorism, previously ensured by the Postal and  Communications Police Service. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of the Ministry of the  Interior will operate at the Central Directorate for Cyber Security, established to ensure the security of the  related networks and information systems, through the prevention and management of critical events.  Regarding the Carabinieri Corps, the Telematic Investigations Department of the Special Operational Group  (ROS) is the specialized division of the Corps in the fight against cybercrime, in the study and experimentation  of technologies for surfing the web and intercepting electronic flows. Within the Financial Police, such role is  held by the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud (NSTPFT) as a Special  Department in charge of countering telematic and IT frauds, as well as protecting privacy.  In relation, then, to the defence and security of the State, the Ministry of Defence defines and coordinates  military policy, governance and military capabilities in the cyber domain, as well as the development of cyber  capabilities and the protection of its networks and systems both on the national territory and in operational  theatres abroad. The Defence, through dedicated specialized divisions, conducts offensive and defensive  military cyber operations in pre-defined cases.  The Ministry of Defence, therefore, ensures, even in case of cyber crises (both national and international), all  the services and activities necessary, on the one hand, to guarantee the protection, resilience and efficiency  of military networks and infrastructures. and, on the other hand, to develop their own peculiar abilities  necessary for the implementation of support, defence, reaction and stabilization activities.  The intelligence collection and analysis, aimed at protecting Italy's political, military, economic, scientific and  industrial interests, is entrusted to the Intelligence Community, which for these purposes also provides, even  through the conduct of cyber operations, for the activities aimed at the detection and systematic monitoring,  prevention and contrasting of the most insidious cyber threats perpetrated in or through the digital  environment.  An important role, transversal to the four pillars, is also constituted by cyber diplomacy as the use of  diplomatic tools and initiatives to achieve national interests in the cyberspace and as part of the broader  foreign policy activities considering the impact of technology on international relations. This activity is  headed by the Cyberspace Policies and Security Unit of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International  Cooperation (MAECI).  Beyond the competent institutional actors – which do not end with those mentioned above¹  – this strategy  is inspired by a \"whole-of-society\" approach, which also involves private operators, the academic and  research world, as well as civil society as a whole and citizenship. In this strategic vision, in fact, the latter is  conceived not only as an indirect beneficiary of the measures envisaged in the Implementation Plan but also  as an active part. Indeed, the ultimate goal of national cybersecurity can only be achieved with the  contribution of all components of the social fabric, none excluded.  07  Strategy National Cybersecurity    Connection speed, number of interactions among  users, and online accessibility of data and informa- tion are not sufficient parameters to define the digi- tal development that characterizes the contempo- rary age, nor are they able to describe, in its entirety,  the complexity of cyberspace.  In this domain countless interconnected and com- municating services meet the daily needs of our  communities and carry out their economic activi- ties: energy infrastructures, financial markets,  drinking water supplies, mass transit and, last but  not least, the essential functions of the State,  including its defence and integrity. Systems com- plexity and interdependence has grown to the point  of blurring the duality between the digital dimen- sion and the real world, often making it difficult to  identify borders and their respective characteristics.  If, on one hand, the relentless evolution of modern  technologies makes digital \"migration\" more con- venient, on the other hand, only the resilience and  security of networks and systems on which these  services are based on can guarantee, in the short  term, the security for our community and, in the   future, the economic development and welfare of  the State.  Scientific research and industrial development  determine the spread and progressive use of the  so-called emerging and disruptive technologies  (EDT), which include latest generation communi- cation networks and protocols (5G/6G), block- chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum comput- ing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet  of Things (IoT), robotics, advanced cryptographic  tools and other disruptive innovations.  The risks implied by such complexity – and the  potential many economic, social and political  implications – range from technological depend- ence and loss of strategic autonomy of the State  to anthropogenic threats, in which human error is  added to the initiatives of hostile actors, charac- terized by different degrees of sophistication and  driven by different, but equally harmful, inten- tions. They are aimed at obtaining illicit profits  (cyber-crime), gaining an information advantage  for the purposes of geopolitical competition  (cyber-espionage), spreading divisive and polariz-  ing narratives in adherence to specific ideologies or political motivations. No organization, even if technologi- cally equipped and procedurally prepared, can come to completely eradicate the threats emanating from  cyberspace.  This reality must be addressed by acting according to an approach that includes the adoption of risk preven- tion and mitigation measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of digital infrastructures. The latter not only  include networks, systems and data, but also, and above all, users – be they institutional actors, private  companies or citizens – whose awareness must be raised through a widespread cybersecurity culture. If  today, in fact, there is a widespread perception of the risks related to physical security, for which every indi- vidual carries out, in their daily lives, actions aimed at protecting themselves and their assets, the same  cannot be said for the digital dimension, which risks are not yet fully understood.   This aspect, combined with the increasingly wide availability – at relatively low costs – of offensive tools, the  increased level of cyber-attacks complexity, the technical difficulty of attributing them to a certain actor, as  well as the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IT products and solutions, has registered an overall  number of hostile actions in constant increase.

However, such a scenario doesn’t always  match with the society’s cybersecurity awareness level.   Among those risks, the systemic ones are related to:  cyber-attacks due to cybercriminals, hacktivists or coordinated state campaigns which exploit software  errors, misconfigurations or protocols and/or human weaknesses to steal data or damage IT systems.  This is the case of ransomware campaigns directly affecting the provision of services of a country  (including the essential ones) and, as cascading effects, its GDP and its reputation;  technology developed and produced by large companies, sometimes controlled or in any case influ- enced by the host-country governments in which they are based. This can lead to an interference in the  supply chain, both in terms of availability on the market of the related components and of their own  reliability;   disinformation campaigns, fake news, deepfake and spreading misinformation through the cyber  domain to manipulate and polarize the public opinion which finds itself overwhelmed by fast-moving and  horizontal information coming from a massive number of sources, altering our sense of reality.  Given those risks, this strategy aims to target the strengthening of our resilience in the digital transition, by  fostering the safe use of technologies essentials for our present and future economic prosperity, the  achievement of cybersecurity strategic autonomy, the cyber crises management in complex geopolitical  scenarios, as well as anticipating the evolution of cyber threats and tackling the spread of online disinforma- tion, while respecting human rights, our values and principles.  10  #1 New challenges to face  Strategy National Cybersecurity    111111  Bearing in mind the experience acquired in the implementation of the “National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security”  (2013) and the “Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan” (updated in 2017), as the first national cybersecurity strategies, it became clear  the need to focus on active defence tactics – in addition to the best practices on cyber-resilience and due diligence – aimed at  increasing the costs of cyber-attacks to make them disadvantageous. That implies a radical change of approach. While it’s true that  chasing the threat is not a winning strategy, it is also true that keeping up with it is no longer enough. It’s necessary, as far as possi- ble, to anticipate, predict and prevent it and to mitigate its impacts as much as possible.   Anticipating the evolution of cyber threats  At EU level, excessive fragmentation and competition among Member States has been a major barrier to the development of “made in  EU” technology and the establishment of large digital service providers across the Union. As a consequence, the EU and Italy found  themselves in a position of technological dependency on other countries leaders in the production of software and so-called emerging  disruptive technologies (EDTs) such as Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing. This also has inevitable consequences on the  possibility of having direct control over the data stored, processed and transmitted through these technologies. Therefore, achieving  an effective technological autonomy will allow the implementation of adequate information sovereignty policies.  National and European digital strategic autonomy  NEW CHALLENGES TO FACE  There can be no digital transition without an adequate resilience to cyber-attacks and incidents. Cybersecurity of digital assets and  services is, indeed, an essential condition for their usability by citizens, who will thus not only be encouraged to use them but will do  it trustfully knowing that their data are protected. It goes without saying that resilience shouldn’t be considered just as a technical  circumstance but also as part of a broader vision which includes the cybersecurity culture and the availability of qualified workforce.  Without the latter, indeed, there would not be any chance to achieve a real digital sovereignty. Moreover, another challenge adds to  this one, the gender issue, as there is a low number of women who choose computer studies or STEM disciplines (Science, Technol- ogy, Engineering and Mathematics) and even fewer who specialize in cybersecurity.  Ensure cyber resilience in the public sector and industry’s digital transition  The latest international tensions have highlighted the primary importance of having an effective cyber crises management mecha- nism supported by the contribution of all the entities involved and by which activities can be graded basing on pre-set cyber threat  scenarios – ranging from alerts in view of possible large-scale cyber events to their actual occurrence – which trigger the prompt  application of common tools, procedures and language norms. The speed at which cyber events can occur and follow one another,  especially in complex geopolitical scenarios, asks for a continuous coordination among all the public and private stakeholders  involved, as well as readiness in the deployment of a pre-set of measures.    Cyber crises management  Tackling online disinformation also in relation to hybrid threats  The digitalization of any aspect of social life, pivotal force behind the economic and social growth of the Western democratic  systems, is more and more exploited to influence and interfere (or attempt to do it) in the exercise of fundamental freedoms, espe- cially just up against crucial events for these democratic systems, such as elections, decision-making processes on issues of strate- gic importance or international crises. The increasingly massive use of online disinformation, especially when highly organized,  demands for synergical and coordinated preventive and countering measures carried out at both national and international level to  hinder any attempt to undermine the value system on which our Country is based.   Strategy National Cybersecurity    12  THE TOOLS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY  To implement this strategy and face the aforementioned challenges, a solid investments program and finan- cial leverages are envisaged.  Beyond the financial tools already allocated to the Administrations in charge of cybersecurity, specific  funds may also be made available annually as part of the national budget, to support the implementation  of specific actions. To that end, a percentage of annual gross investments will be reserved on an annual  basis. These leverages may also include tax breaks for businesses or the provision of more beneficial tax  treatments for the creation, for example, of a “National Cybersecurity Campus” and the related national  “hubs”.  Furthermore, the National Cybersecurity Agency will manage European funds to implement specific actions  as National Coordination Centre, pursuant to the Law Decree of June 14, 2021, no. 82, as well as article 6 of  Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021, establishing the  European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of  National Coordination Centres, which will manage the cybersecurity-related financial support from Horizon  Europe and the Digital Europe Programmes.  National funding Percentage (1,2%) of annual gross investments  These funds will be dedicated to specific projects aimed at achieving digital technological autono- my, as well as further strengthening the cybersecurity of national information systems.  Strategy National Cybersecurity    The implementation plan, in agreement with the Department for Digital Transformation (DTD) as the invest- ment owner, is organized into three main areas of intervention and will involve all the main public and private  cybersecurity national stakeholder, in accordance with the NRRP technical-organizational rules:  13  Horizon Europe 2021-2027 budget:  EUR 95,51 billion  Leading EU funding programme to facili- tate collaboration and to bolster the  effects of research and innovation in the  development, support and implementa- tion of EU policies, while addressing  global challenges. It supports the crea- tion and better dissemination of top-lev- el know-how and technologies. It also aims to create new jobs, fully  engage the EU talent pool, stimulate  economic growth, promote industrial  competitiveness and maximize the  impact of investments within a strength- ened European research domain.  Digital Europe 2021-2027 budget:   EUR 7,59 billion  First European funding programme to  expand the digital skills of citizens and  businesses and to speed up the economic  and social recovery.

THE NATIONAL RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE PLAN: INVESTMENT 1.5 “CYBERSECURITY”   Another strategic tool to address the aforementioned challenges is the National Recovery and Resilience  Plan (NRRP). As part of Mission 1 \"Digitalization, Innovation, Competitiveness, Culture and Tourism\", activi- ties aimed at achieving the digitalization of the Public Administration are included, such as the implementa- tion of a National Cloud and the digitalization of processes and services for citizens. The fulfilment of such  actions will lead to an enhanced national digital infrastructures and services’ resilience capabilities. In addi- tion, the Investment 1.5 \"Cybersecurity\" – with EUR 623 million budget – assigned to the National Cyberse- curity Agency as implementing entity, is intended to implement specific actions for the creation and develop- ment of cutting-edge cyber risk management services, in close cooperation at national and international  level with all the main partners of Public Administrations, businesses and technology suppliers.

Italy is the first beneficiary of the two main NGEU instruments:  the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Terri- tories of Europe (REACT-EU). To access the funds under the RRF Member States are asked to  prepare their National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRP). Our NRRP is divided into six Mis- sions and 16 Components. The six Missions are: digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, culture and tourism; green deal  and ecological transition; infrastructures for a sustainable mobility; education and research; inclu- sion and cohesion; health.

Strategy National Cybersecurity    Strategy National Cybersecurity  #2 Our vision: the goals to reach   15    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  16  #2 Our vision: the goals to reach   National Coordination  Centre  National and European  technology development  National Cybersecurity  Campus  Cyber as a competitive  advantage  Secure digitization  of the Country  Technological screening  Legal framework  Situational awareness  Cyber resilience of PAs  National infrastructures  Cryptography  Countering online  disinformation  Crises management  National cyber services  Cyber exercises  Attribution  Tackling cybercrime  Deterrence capabilities  Institutions Civil societyPrivate operatorsBeneficiaries  PROTECTION RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT  GOALS  ENABLERS  Strategy National Cybersecurity  Cooperation  Public - Private Partnership  Cybersecurity training & Aw arness    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.

Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  17  B.

PROTECTION GOAL  Ministry of Interior’s Assessment Centre  Ministry of Defence’s Assessment Centre  Private Laboratories Public Laboratories  CVCN ITALIA  Strategy National Cybersecurity    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  18  C.

Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  19  A.  G.  F.  Strategy National Cybersecurity    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  20  Focus box - The management of cybersecurity incidents and crises The national cybersecurity incident and crises management architecture is fully compliant with the Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (so called  Blueprint), with the:  political level, represented by the Prime Minister, the Undersecretary of State for the security of the Republic, if appointed, and by the  Interministerial Committee for the Security of the Republic (CISR);  operational level, made up by the NCS, supported by ACN in connection with the competent units of NCS Administrations;  technical level, carried out by the national CSIRT, in cooperation with the other technical units of NCS Administrations.  ACN, embedding the national CSIRT, the NIS PoC and the NCS, performs two of the three aforementioned levels necessary to achieve an adequate  national prevention and response to potential cyber-attacks, by supporting the political level through ACN Director General, as cyber crises  coordinator. This synergical architecture aggregates and correlates the information, alerts and notifications acquired by the operational and  technical levels if a cyber event requires a NCS activation and its potential escalation in its alert state, up to cyber crisis status. Such a process is  fully aligned with other European and international counterparts. Moreover, this organization is integrated with the liaison role of ACN towards the European Union. At the EU level, indeed, ACN participates in the  CSIRT Network and in the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe). Specifically, CyCLONe aims at contributing to the implementation  of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid response to large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis, supporting Member States  national authorities in charge of cyber crisis management and linking European political level – the Council of the EU, also through the Integrated  Political Crisis Response mechanisms (IPCR) – with the technical one embodied by national CSIRTs and the EU CSIRT Network. CyCLONe’s tasks,  on voluntary basis, include crises management preparation, situational awareness and cooperation, as well as the support to national and EU  political decision-making.

To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  21  B.

To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles.

In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  3. DEVELOPMENT GOAL  23  A.  B.  C.  Strategy National Cybersecurity    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation.

Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.  To ensure an effective and lasting level of protection it is, in-fact, essential:  the strengthening of ACN National Assessment and Certification Centre’s capacities (CVCN) and of  the Ministry of Interior and Defence’s Assessment Centres (CV) for their respective areas of compe- tence, as well as the integration with a network of Accredited Test Laboratories, which will allow the  development of national vulnerability assessment capabilities for advanced technologies to serve  the Country's most critical assets.   the definition and maintenance of an updated and coherent national legal cybersecurity frame- work, which considers the orientations and developments at the European and international level.  This system does not only include the regulatory level but also a set of guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial policies addressed to public entities and private operators. In this context it is  of primary importance:  the support to the development of European and international cybersecurity certification schemes and  standards;  the promotion of the use of European cybersecurity certification schemes by specialized Italian compa- nies to achieve a competitive advantage on the market;  the adoption of guidelines for Public Administrations based on a \"zero trust\" approach as a new  model for cyber risk management, so that their networks, systems and services can meet high  cybersecurity standards;  the promotion of the inclusion of cybersecurity requisites in ICT procurement activities of Public  Administrations;  the definition of a national policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure to keep our Country up with  its counterparts and the international community.  the in-depth knowledge of the cyber threat scenario along with adequate technical tools, special- ized skills and operational capabilities of the different entities involved. The further strengthening of  situational awareness through the continuous cyber events monitoring and the timely sharing of related  findings, according to the specific areas of competence, constitutes a necessary condition for  increasing our national defence, resilience, counter-cybercrime and cyber intelligence capabilities. To  this end, the continuous public-private and public-public information sharing is essential, also  through secure communication channels and an integrated cyber risk management system to iden- tify and analyse vulnerabilities, threats and risks in a forecasting and programmatic way.  the enhancement of Public Administration cyber capabilities’ maturity level, ensuring a secure and  resilient digital transformation. To this end, the Public Administration’s migration to the Cloud, both  towards Public Cloud technologies and the creation of a National Strategic Hub (PSN) represents a  fundamental element for ensuring appropriate warranties to the Country’s technological autonomy.  The reinforcement of Public Administrations’ computational infrastructures also allows them to  reduce the need for cybersecurity and IT governance experts. The migration to Cloud technologies,  whether the PSN or the Public Cloud, will be guided and controlled by a risk management methodol- ogy whose main element is the classification of Public Administration’s data and services (i.e. ordi- nary, critical and strategic). In this regard, interventions to enhance cyber risk identification, monitoring  and control for the Public Administration will also be coordinated.    the development of protection capacities for national infrastructures, also through ad hoc implement- ing programs with industry, including:  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations monitoring through the development of proce- dures, processes and tools in cooperation with national Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to  increase the resilience of national BGP infrastructures;  a national DNS resolution infrastructure with web browsing protection services for a safer use of  the Internet by the Public Administrations;  the monitoring of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of Public Administration’s digital services,  both at DNS application and configuration level to proactively reduce potential attack surfaces;  the monitoring of Public Administration's e-mail domains configurations supporting and facili- tating the application of the best security configurations against phishing or related abuses.  the promotion of the use of cryptography as a cybersecurity tool fostering its commercial use  throughout the entire ICT systems and services lifecycle in compliance with security and privacy  protection principles and with those defined by national and European legislation. In this context and  in specific sectors, ACN, together with the other Administrations, aims to realize national encryption  technologies/systems, which will be based on the creation of a specific national ecosystem for their  maintenance and development.  the implementation of a national coordination action consistent with similar European initiatives and  in synergy with like-minded countries to prevent and counter online disinformation which, by  exploiting the inherent features of the cyber domain, seeks to influence the political, economic and  social processes of the Country.  The response to national cyber threats, incidents and crises, through the deployment of enhanced  national monitoring, detection, analysis and response capabilities and the activation of processes which  involve all the stakeholders included in the national cybersecurity ecosystem. Indeed, a timely and  resolved response must be based on:  a cybersecurity crises management system at national level – guided by the National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCS) – and transnational level, based on consolidated collaboration procedures between public and  private entities supported by continuous sharing of information and knowledge, also through national  and transnational networks and infrastructures. In that field, it should be ensured:  the development of a continuous coordination system among all the NCS Administrations for the  timely and synergic cyber crises management and response;  the regular update of operating procedures on cyber-threat response measures for Prime Minis- ter’s resolutions in the event of cyber crises, according to the legislation in force, and for the  effective implementation from all the actors involved;  a timely institutional communication in the event of relevant cyber incidents or crises, as well as  when awareness campaigns towards civil society are deemed necessary.  These capabilities fully complement the “European Cyber Shield” initiative as part of the “EU's Cyber- security Strategy for the Digital Decade” and will take advantage of the most recent artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning technologies provided by an ad hoc “High Performance Computing”  (HPC) centre and by integrated national cyber-risk monitoring and analysis systems. Italy will guide  in Europe the process of development and integration of these new technological tools within  Member States.  the organization of periodic cybersecurity exercises also within the scope of the National Security  Perimeter for Cyber, as well as the promotion and participation in the European and international ones.  the definition of a national posture and procedure for the attribution of malicious cyber activities,  which defines the different actors involved and their roles. Our Country, as a member of the EU and  NATO, is, indeed, asked to bring its contribution to discuss the application of response measures to  malicious cyber activities – including joint statements – among those defined by the EU Cyber Diplo- macy Toolbox and the NATO Guide for Response Options to Malicious Cyber Activities. In any case it  is important to highlight that, as already acknowledged in EU and NATO policy documents, attribu- tion remains a national political decision of Member States.  the tackle of cybercrime, which includes the prevention and countering of organized or terroristic  criminal actions to the integrity of digitized critical infrastructures that supply essential public servic- es; the tackle of financial cybercrimes and illicit actions against financial infrastructures; the investi- gative and informative activities, in close cooperation with the competent branches of the Italian  National Police, applied to public order and counter-terrorism in the cyber domain; the safeguard of  individuals, and above all the minors, from virtual or online attacks to individual and gender freedom,  security and safety, privacy, honour and reputation.  the strengthening of cybersecurity deterrence capabilities.  The conscious and safe development of digital technologies, research, and industrial competitiveness  able to respond to the market needs. The entirety of centres of excellence and companies that together  with academia compose the research and development fabric is, indeed, an essential asset for our Coun- try with significant growth potential. Several tools and initiatives have been launched in recent years to  support the development of national research ecosystem's capabilities as well as digital transformation  and technological innovation, including those envisaged by the NRRP by the latest budget laws and by  the National Plan Industry 4.0. To further increase this commitment, it is therefore essential:  the role of the National Coordination Centre (NCC) which contributes to the development and  enhancement of a European and national technological, strategic and digital autonomy while sup- porting the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre (ECCC)  in fulfilling its mission and objectives. That, coordinating relevant activities on research and develop- ment and facilitating synergies between industry and the academic and research communities to  projects and public-private partnerships in cybersecurity funded by relevant Union programmes. To that end, the involvement of national Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is crucial.  the development of national and European technology reducing the dependence on non-EU  technologies through the implementation of specific projects to be carried out – thanks to dedicated  national and European funds – within a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" that will also include the  technological Clusters operating on that field. This technology will foster the development of a  competitive national and European industry also through the virtuous specialization of innovative  start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) able to provide highly secure enabling  technologies and services mainly for digital critical infrastructures.  the establishment of a \"National Cybersecurity Campus\" which, by systematizing skills and resources  from the Public Administration, industry and the academic and research community, provides all the  necessary technological infrastructures for carrying out research and development activities in the  field of cybersecurity and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  cryptography and robotics. Its creation allows the gradual achievement of a greater national  strategic autonomy on cyber technologies, supporting the development and production of national  software and hardware to be used in strategic relevant networks and systems. The Campus is  therefore conceived as an incubator of skills and technologies in which young talents and start-ups  can interact with large companies and all the various national entities operating in the cybersecurity  field. That is why the Campus must have a \"widespread\" structure in which, alongside a central \"hub\",  there are local branches throughout the Country.  the introduction of new incentive mechanisms and solutions to keep supporting the industrial,  technological and research development particularly regarding skills development and technolo- gy transfer (especially in advanced cybersecurity sectors). This also with the aim to:  continue fostering the competitiveness of the Country's production system, supporting companies in  their digital and ecological transition, facilitating their internationalization and attracting invest- ments;  develop highly reliable ICT products and services also by encouraging the establishment of Product  Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)  by private operators to increase their ability to manage  vulnerabilities of ICT products.  the continuous drive towards technological innovation and digitalization of the Country's Public Admin- istration and productive fabric ensuring steady compliance with cybersecurity principles and making  use of NRRP funds. This goes hand in hand with the promotion of initiatives aimed at strengthening  Italy's industrial and technological autonomy.  To effectively achieve the aforementioned goals it is crucial to refer to three enabling factors – training,  promotion of a cybersecurity culture and cooperation – which, given their wide scope, are necessarily  related to the goals outlined above and are essential for their full implementation.  Firstly, cybersecurity training with a specific focus on new technologies. The development of new initiatives  and the strengthening of the existing ones must be based on the increased need to foster the creation of a  solid national workforce made up of experts and young talents with the necessary skills and knowledges on  ICT and cybersecurity, for the benefit of Italian companies and administrations. This must be done through:  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies, with an educational and cultural approach, other than technical and practical. It is  appropriate to introduce information technology as a discipline, in all levels of the educational  system, from primary school to university and, from upper secondary school onwards, in all contexts,  including generalist ones and those oriented towards non-technical professions;  incentive mechanisms that foster the progressive familiarization of students with new information  technologies supporting the attractiveness of technical and scientific careers (also to bridge the  gender gap). Also in this case, specific levels of action are needed for: the technical and professional  educational paths for secondary school; the Higher Technical Institutes (ITS); the degree courses with  professional orientation recently established by law; the degree courses, post-graduate and mas- ter’s degrees and PhD. Specific attention also goes to the ITS and to the degree courses with profes-  sional orientation which, with the collaboration of industry, could facilitate the transition to the  labour market and the modulation of the educational paths;  the continuous teaching update and the preparation of the professors at all school and university levels  so that the educational offer can keep pace with the labour market needs on the basis of the well-known  bond between development and security;  the allocation of funds for specialized and professional training for the public and private sectors to be  carried out in a continuous and multilevel way to support the growth and qualification of human  resources operating in the cybersecurity field, and to achieve a national digital skills sovereignty;  the creation of a national skills certification system  (both at school/university, and work) through  ad-hoc training courses previously approved by ACN;  specific training courses for Public Administrations and private entities’ employees, including SMEs, start- ing with top managers, to raise their awareness on the importance of conceiving cybersecurity as an  investment rather than an expense;  the enhancement of cyber diplomacy skills through targeted courses for the diplomatic staff working in  the main international cybersecurity organizations, to keep up with other European and non-Euro- pean counterparts.  These actions will be developed in close cooperation with universities, upper secondary schools, Regions  – on the basis of specific agreements – as well as with Public Administrations and private entities.  Another enabling factor, along with training needs, is the promotion of a cybersecurity culture to increase  the awareness of the public and private sector, and of civil society, on cyber risks and threats which include  not just cyber-attacks but also the spread of fake contents and cyberbullying which, although not new, does  not cease to create social alarm.  In this regard, it is therefore important that public entities, private operators, and civil society perceive their  active and responsible role within the Country by implementing safe and virtuous behaviour in cyberspace.  This must happen:  through a widespread digital education program – to be developed also online – for the sake of the  community and aimed at the adoption of good practices and the acquisition of the capabilities to  check online contents and information as well as “fake news” indicators;    within public and private organizations through a strong awareness campaign for the employees –  starting from top levels to the entire line – not only to promote an internal \"cyber hygiene\" but to  increase the perception of the organization’s security needs and the threats to which it is exposed,  as well as to implement the most effective preventive actions;  promoting the responsible management of the so called \"residual risk\", also by providing for the  adoption of self-assessment tools based on specific \"cyber index\", which allow organizations to  independently manage the level of exposure.  Finally, there is cooperation to be increased:  at the national-governmental level, in public-private and public-public interaction, as well as with the  academic and research community. In this context, it is envisaged the creation of permanent operat- ing working groups among the entities included in the Perimeter, divided by sector and depending on  matters and needs, to increase the synergies between Public Administrations and industry;  internationally, proactively participating in European and international initiatives and promoting  bilateral collaborations.  At national level, each part of the cybersecurity ecosystem is not only responsible for security in the digital  domain for its areas of competence but is the bearer of experiences and knowledge crucial to increase the  capacity to prevent and tackle threats, to promote know-how, technologies and human resources’ transfer, as  well as to allow innovative companies to expand more easily on the market. At international level, Italy collab- orates in promoting respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values in the cyber  domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and secure space in which international law and shared  principles are respected. To this end, our Country participates in the main cooperation, cyber diplomacy and  capacity building initiatives towards partner countries which are experiencing a rapid digital development. This also through the implementation of OSCE's confidence building measures (CBMs) to avoid the emerging of  political and military tensions stemming from the use of ICTs. In addition, Italy shares the methodologies and  tools for cyber-attacks deterrence and response defined within the EU and NATO. In this context, the partici- pation in international initiatives and the prosecution of dialogues and relations with like-minded countries are  crucial elements to further strengthen the positioning of our Country, to foster the exchange of knowledge, and to  promote the internationalization of national cybersecurity companies.  Transversal to the aforementioned goals of protection, response, and development, as well as to the enabling  factors of training, promotion of the cybersecurity culture, and cooperation, is the Public-Private Partnership  (PPP) that fully permeates this strategy based, as already said, on a \"whole-of-society\" approach in which the  public sector acts synergically with the industry, civil society, academia and research, as well as the media,  families, and individuals, to strengthen the cyber resilience of the Country and the society as a whole. Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  25  Strategy National Cybersecurity    the integration of national cybersecurity services in the following fields:  threat detection through the creation of an “Hyper SOC” that is a collection, correlation and analy- sis system of relevant events coming from Security Operation Centres (SOC) and Internet Service  Providers (ISP) by specific agreements, to early detect potential complex attack patterns that  could turn in significant emerging threats;  ensure and facilitate unitary cybersecurity incident notifications to the Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT)  to make its response and timely warning capabilities more effective;  incident response through the creation of a sectorial CSIRT/Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT) network, federated with the “CSIRT Italia” for sharing procedures, information and sup- port in case of emerging threats and incidents response;  information sharing through the creation of a central Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISAC) established at ACN and potentially integrated into a network of sectorial ISACs developed  through public-private initiatives, which can bolster the dissemination and application of higher  added-value information to enhance the Country’s level of cyber resilience, such as sectorial  best-practices, guidelines, security alerts and recommendations;  incident response companies’ qualification which can provide support to the CSIRT Italia in case of  multiple and systemic cyber incidents.    To better face the above challenges for the Country, three fundamental goals have been identified -  protection, response and development – together with the related measures to ensure the concrete  implementation of the strategy, grouped by thematic areas as regards organizational, policy and opera- tional aspects. For each measure, associated with the most characterizing goal, the actors responsible for  the implementation and all the other subjects involved are indicated, excluding the direct beneficiaries of  the measures.  Referring to the Implementation Plan for a more detailed description of the measures, we intend to provide  below a comprehensive overview of the salient aspects and related strategic vision underlying it.  The protection of national strategic assets, through a systemic approach aimed at managing and miti- gating risk, consisting in both a regulatory framework and measures, tools and controls that can enable  a resilient digital transition in the Country. Relevant importance has the development of strategies and  initiatives for verifying and assessing the security of ICT infrastructures, including procurement and sup- ply-chain aspects with a national impact.

Moreo- ver, cyberspace is made up of ICT products and services mainly produced or provided by private entities. For  this reason, this strategy cannot exclude the close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation  which translates into a series of structured actions, such as cyberspace monitoring through the cooperation of  SOCs, incidents mitigation through CSIRTs collaboration and qualified incident response, the network of test  laboratories, as well as training and awareness dissemination.  Finally, the strategy cannot be considered complete without a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) as tools to measure not only its concrete implementation but also all of the related actions, whose actual  effectiveness and impact would otherwise remain unexplored.  26  METRICS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  Strategy National Cybersecurity    Strategy National Cybersecurity  Acronyms  27    Acronyms  28  Strategy National Cybersecurity  ACN National Cybersecurity Agency  AI Artificial Intelligence  BGP Border Gateway Protocol  CBM Confidence Building Measure  CERT Computer Emergency Response Team  CISR Inter-ministerial Committee for the Security of the Republic  CNAIPIC National Cybercrime Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection of the Italian National Police  CSIRT Computer Security Incident Response Team  CVCN National Assessment and Certification Centre  CV Assessment Centre  CyCLONe Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network  DIH Digital Innovation Hub  DSP Digital Service Providers  DNS Domain Name System  GDP Gross Domestic Product  ECCC European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  EDT Emerging and Disruptive Technologies  EU European Union  DTD Department for Digital Transformation  HPC High Performance Computing  IoT Internet of Things  ICT Information and Communication Technologies  Integrated Political Crisis ResponseIPCR  Information Sharing and Analysis CentreISAC    29  Strategy National Cybersecurity  Special Operations Group of the Carabinieri CorpsROS   Small and Medium EnterpriseSME  Security Operation CenterSOC   Science, Technology, Engineering and MathematicsSTEM   Key Performance IndicatorKPI   Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International CooperationMAECI   North Atlantic Treaty OrganizationNATO   National Coordination CentreNCC  National CyberSecurity CellNCS   National Recovery and Resilience PlanNRRP  Special Unit for Privacy Protection and Technological FraudNSTPFT    Operators of Essential ServicesOES  Organization for Security and Co-operation in EuropeOSCE   Public AdministrationPA  Public-Private PartnershipPPP   Product Security Incident Response TeamPSIRT   National Strategic HubPSN  National Security Perimeter for CyberPSNC  Internet Exchange PointIXP  Higher Technical InstitutesITS   Internet Service ProviderISP   Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of EuropeREACT-EU  Recovery and Resilience FacilityRRF  Network and Information SecurityNIS   NIS Single Point of ContactNIS PoC  Next Generation EUNGEU    Strategy National Cybersecurity",

The result was exemplary. The strategy translated into the establishment of 4 eGov channels and more than 200 eServices. A new Economic Vision 2030 for the Kingdom of Bahrain was then launched in October 2008, striving to ensure the future economic sustainability of the Kingdom. To contribute to the realisation of this Economic Vision, as well as the fulfilment of the Government Action Plan, a new eGov strategy was commissioned. This document summarises this strategy and outlines its objectives. 37 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 eGoVerNmeNt StrateGy deVelopmeNt approaCh The development of the Kingdom of Bahrain eGov strategy 2016 followed a structured 6-step approach, driven by a new eGov vision. The strategy takes a holistic view of all factors relevant to eGov by applying a wide range of frameworks to clearly define the eGov target and operating models. The resulting eGov road-to-implementation is delineated through a comprehensive master plan. 9 New eGov Vision Built on Achievements While Resolving Challenges Challenging Yet Achievable Master Plan Comprehensive Frameworks Ambitious eGov Target Model VISION FRAMEWORKS BASELINE eGov TARGET & OPERATING MODEL figure 1 PROJECT CHARTERS & MASTER PLAN Sufficient Funding Capabilities Required IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS eGovernment Strategy Development Approach KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 ViSioN Building on a strong foundation from the previous period 2007-2010, the new eGov strategy aims for an ambitious yet achievable target. To encapsulate the key objectives, a new eGov vision, adVaNCe, has been put in place: “Achieve next generation Government excellence by delivering high quality services effectively, valuing efficiency, advocating proactive customer engagement, nurturing entrepreneurship, collaborating with all stakeholders and encouraging innovation” miSSioN The new eGov mission encapsulates the new adVaNCe vision: “To realise the Kingdom of Bahrain eGov vision by defining and managing implementation of relevant strategies, setting and monitoring compliance to policies and standards, facilitating transformation of services and advocating incubation of next generation concepts, all in close collaboration with government entities and effective partnership with the private sector” This enhanced mission lays out the proper context for The Kingdom’s eGov Authority (eGA) to operate and interact with other national stakeholders as the eGov strategy 2016 is implemented. 10 A figure 2 D V A N C E chieve next generation government excellence eliver high quality services effectively alue efficiency dvocate proactive customer engagement urture entrepreneurship ollaborate with all stakeholders ncourage innovation Elements of the Kingdom of Bahrain New eGovernment Vision figure 5 Increased Society Participation and Engagement Increased Partnerships and Private Sector ICT Readiness Improved National eLiteracy and Government IT Skills Heightened Protection of Information and User Rights Higher Performing, Collaborative, Integrated, and Efficient Government Comprehensive and Effectively Managed Quality Service Offering Enhanced eGov Channels and User Experience with Increased Service Uptake Greater Innovation and Entrepreneurship KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 StrateGiC objeCtiVeS To materialise the new eGov mission and realise its benefits, a set of key strategic objectives have been developed targeting various stakeholder groups and catering to their needs and preferences. beNefiCiary Stakeholder GroupS At the core of both the adVaNCe vision and eGov mission and objectives is a pledge to positively impact three key identified stakeholder groups within the Kingdom of Bahrain: Individuals, Businesses and Government; where Individuals refer to citizens, residents and visitors, Businesses refer to small, medium and large enterprises and their employees, and Government refers to government entities and their employees. 11 eGovernment Stakeholder Groups Key Objectives of the eGovernment Strategy 2016 BUSINESSES • Small/ Medium/Large Enterprises • Business Employees GOVERNMENT • Government Entities • Government Employees INDIVIDUALS • Citizens • Residents • Visitors BENEFITS & IMPACT figure 4 CompreheNSiVe eGoVerNmeNt moderNiSatioN frameWork To deliver against the new eGov vision and to achieve the key objectives set, a comprehensive Environment- Readiness-usage (ERu) framework has been used which provides a holistic approach to eGov modernisation. environment addresses many country-wide factors like ICT and regulatory environments, Government collaboration and social engagement to help drive customer service-oriented, efficient and effective Government. readiness addresses Government capabilities through its people, processes, governance and technology to deliver solid infrastructure. usage addresses not only customer-focused services but also interaction channels for better user experience. As part of developing the strategy, and to ensure its comprehensiveness, a detailed analysis of the current situation was conducted leveraging a number of information sources, including workshops attended by 27 entities, over 30 face-to-face interviews with key individuals, 4 focus group sessions, and 32 entity surveys. International eGov and ICT trends relevant to the Kingdom were also taken into consideration. To identify internationally recognised best practices, 18 countries were benchmarked across the ERu framework. International eGov and ICT reports and trends were also researched. Out of an identified long list of best practices and trends, 9 latest eGov and 11 latest ICT trends were taken into consideration in developing the new eGov strategy. 12 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 E N T IT Y 1 E N T IT Y 2 E N T IT Y 3 E N T IT Y 4 E N T IT Y  .

The owner and involved stakeholders have been identified for each project and the objectives and benefits set, deliverables and dependencies defined and costs for eGA and other stakeholders estimated from a capital and operational expenditure perspective. The required time duration has been identified for multiple work steps along 5 main phases: strategic articulation, procurement, design, implementation and operations. Finally, a roadmap has been created, identifying an overall timeline to implement all projects between 2012 and 2016. This roadmap will be revised on a yearly basis to ensure it is up to date and reflects the latest and greatest achievements as well as the most up to date eGov plans in the Kingdom of Bahrain. 13 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 eGovernment Projects Classified Across the ERU Framework figure 15 • National Broadband Agenda • eLiteracy Campaign • ICT Education Strategy • Business ICT Adoption Strategy • eGov Innovation Programme • eLaws and eRegulation Update* • Society Engagement Campaign* • eParticipation Programme* • Gov Leadership Engagement Plan • Return on eGov Investment (ReGI) Analysis • Public-Private Partnership Strategy • International Partnership Programme ENVIRONMENT • Knowledge Management • eGov Capabilities Management Programme • eGov Change Management Programme • eGov Policies & Standards* • IT Planning & Management Toolkit • Smart PMO Toolkit • Service Transformation Toolkit • Entity IT Strategy • Legal Case Management • eProcurement* • Customer Relationship Management (CRM) • Special Data Infrastructure (SDI) Consolidation • Document & Record Management* • Open Data Platform • IT Shared Service Rationalisation • National Data Center Consolidation • Government Data Network Expansion • ID & Access Management* • Business Continuity Programme • Location-Based Services Platform • Internet of Things Strategy • Green IT Strategy • Government Cloud Computing Strategy • eGov Performance Management • Next Generation Mobile Platform • eGov Interoperability Framework • National ePayment Platform* • ERP Consolidation • Information Security Programme READINESS • eGov Portal Enhancement* • Mobile Channel Enhancement • Contact Centre Enhancement* • Service Kiosk Enhancement* • Government Service Centres • Multi-Channel Management • Customer Service Quality Certification Programme • Service Portfolio Management* • Static Information Services • Entity eServices Charters* USAGE * Projects are being kicked off in 2012 and 2013. eGoVerNmeNt key performaNCe iNdiCatorS Each strategic objective is broken down into a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) with a projected target realisation period for each.

Improvements to the ICT environment will include an increase in fixed and mobile broadband penetration rendering higher broadband and Government eService usage. Higher business ICT spending and adoption will result in increased competitiveness and ICT readiness of private sector institutions. Human capital and eLiteracy in the Kingdom of Bahrain will be improved through measures to train 5,000 nationals on IT and eGov foundational topics and 150 employees on eGov specialised disciplines annually. Customer engagement and eParticipation will be crucial in the Kingdom, and given particular focus. Clients will participate in shaping eServices and will be allowed to voice their opinions and preferences. eGov program awareness will increase to 90%, with customer satisfaction index levels to be maintained over 80%. It is planned that 50% of Government entities will interact with clients on a weekly basis through social networks by 2014. The Kingdom will drive eGov innovation by exposing public data sets and providing funding support for innovation projects. Three eGov related projects will be seed funded at BHD20,000 per project annually. Furthermore, partnerships will be established with the private sector to deliver high impact projects and support the national economy. Political support for the eGov programme will be firmed up and sustained, whilst government collaboration will be improved to enable impactful results. 15 figure 8 SOCIAL NETWORKS BLOGS MASHUPS RSS FEEDS WIKIS PODCASTS FEEDBACK & ePARTIC IPA TIO N CUSTOMER ENG AG EM EN TCUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT GOVERNMENT CLIENTS ePARTICIPATION Identify Prefer en ce s an d N ee ds C us to m is e eC han nels & eServices Promote Aw areness A ssess Satisfaction KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 Society Engagement & eParticipation The Government will enhance its people’s skills and cascade down organisational change through entities by developing a formal eGov change program. Three eGov toolkits will be developed to support and assist government entities in their eGov related projects, with the aim of ensuring project delivery consistency. eGov projects will be governed through business-IT planning committees and formal eGov performance management will be adhered to. A comprehensive eGov Return on Investment (ReGI) model will capture the tangible and intangible eGov costs and benefits pertaining to all stakeholders. On the technology front, the Kingdom of Bahrain will focus on ensuring that proper IT strategic planning is conducted across the Government. Adoption of common technology will be key in driving efficiency and standardisation. The Government will follow a more collaborative and performance-based culture, leveraging a number of government-wide systems. Security and back up will be implemented to reduce disruption of services. Also, several “Next Generation” technologies will be considered for deployment (e.g. Internet of Things, Mashups). 16 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 eGov Change Management Journey figure 9 Stakeholders actively contribute to and participate towards successful implementation efforts Stakeholders accept and are in line with the eGov programme objectives and plans UNDERSTANDING Stakeholders have a proper understanding of the eGov programme and its objectives BUY-IN ACTIVE PARTICIPATION SUCCESSFUL CHANGE START FINISH Showcased Next Generation Technology Solutions Location Based Technology & Mashups Internet of Things Green IT figure 10 Kingdom of Bahrain Green IT Strategy Going Green through IT Greening IT Green IT Governance Smart Phone Application Open Data Programme Smart Phone Total Sales Q1 2009: 40,971k, Q2 2010: 61,649k sales (150% Growth) Public Data Interfaces (APis) Clients Kingdom Public Data Sets SDI Location Cloud Computing Public Cloud Private Cloud Hybrid Cloud eGov services will proactively cater to the needs of customers and businesses to enable a better life.

The Kingdom will enhance user experience through best-in-class eGov access channels to effectively steer and improve customers’ service usage. By 2014, 3 eGov channels will be significantly upgraded by way of facilitating usage and adding features to enhance the customer experience. Through these channels, 10% of all transaction based services will have an uptake of 100%. Ten new Government mobile apps (for the top three mobile application stores) will be launched annually, ensuring that an array of Government services are available to individuals at all times. The customer service experience will be a constant focus, driven by a tiered award programme for Government entities. 17 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 figure 11 BIRTH EDUCATION FAMILY RETIREMENT BUSINESS Automatic health record is generated at birth Location-based services allow parents to locate closest available vaccination/health professionals for their children Education databases with interactive digital content are the norm Pupils can access online classes anytime, anywhere Mobile applications proactively notify household owners of due electricity & water bill Environmental awareness services educate about green living Citizens can access and manage their retirement and pension funds online Death certificates trigger the issuance of a widow certificate Bussinesses can access a Bahraini comprehensive virtual job market Round-the-clock call center service experts offering advice on business operations eGovernment Services Examples Through all Stages of Life eGoVerNmeNt authority key CoNtributioNS eGA operations have been very successful so far, putting eGov at the forefront of national achievements across all ERu dimensions and giving the Kingdom of Bahrain international recognition (ranked in the top 10 for “Online Service Delivery” in the united Nations eGov Survey over the last four years). However, there are still a number of improvements that eGA aspires to implement to enhance its own operations. These are also tackled by the new eGov strategy. 18 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 Highlights of eGovernment Authority’s Key Contributions Operational Programme Governance (PMO) ENVIRONMENT figure 13 READINESS USAGE OPERATING MODEL 200+ eServices Deployed on the eGov Portal 4 Operational eGov Channels (Portal, Contact Center, CSC, Mobile) eGA Mandate, a Strong Lever for Ambitious Reform Programme Senior Political Sponsorship (SCICT) Established Working Groups at Different Entities (8 Fully Operational) Well Defined Government-wide Target Enterprise Architecture Operational Secure Government Networks eGoVerNmeNt authority refiNed operatiNG model To support the rollout of the new eGov strategy, the target operating model for eGA, has also been refined via a framework of 6 clear dimensions, addressing operational scope, people, processes, governance, performance management, and technology. eGoVerNmeNt authority’S StrateGiC direCtioN To support the eGov program going forward, eGA will play four main roles: it will be the eGov strategist, the IT policy and standard setter, the service transformation facilitator and the strategic incubator. In that respect, and over the next few years, eGA will start enabling entities to gradually take on the responsibility for more and more eService transformation. 19 KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016 Operational Programme Governance (PMO) ENVIRONMENT figure 13 READINESS USAGE OPERATING MODEL 200+ eServices Deployed on the eGov Portal 4 Operational eGov Channels (Portal, Contact Center, CSC, Mobile) eGA Mandate, a Strong Lever for Ambitious Reform Programme Senior Political Sponsorship (SCICT) Established Working Groups at Different Entities (8 Fully Operational) Well Defined Government-wide Target Enterprise Architecture Operational Secure Government Networks figure 7 ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES CAPABILITIES PEOPLE PROCESSES BUSINESS PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE SUPPORT GOVERNANCE INTERACTION MODEL DECISION RIGHTS CONTROL/AUDIT FRAMEWORK PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS PERFORMANCE REPORTING MECHANISM TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS APPLICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONAL SCOPE MANDATE SERVICE OFFERING DELIVERY MODEL eGovernment Authority’s Operating Model Framework Future Main Roles of eGovernment Authorityfigure 12 eGOV STRATEGY DEFINITION AND MANAGEMENT • Develop and refresh the eGov strategy • Drive the eGov Programme and coordinate all its related efforts • Monitor the progress of eGov programme implementation • Communicate eGov programme goals and progress and ensure awareness and usage uptake of eServices • Be informed of Government entities IT programmes and budgets STRATEGIC INCUBATION • On behalf of other entities, design and drive the implementation and operation of key foundational eGov components/services until they mature and can be completely transferred to such entity • Setup and manage an innovation fund to solicit innovative eGov related solutions from the market eGOV AND IT POLICY AND STANDARDS SETTING AND MONITORING • Set and refine eGov & IT related policies and standards • Educate concerned entities on eGov & IT related policies and standards • Monitor and report adherence to eGov & IT related policies and standards to the SCICT eGA eSERVICE TRANSFORMATION FACILITATION • Set the agenda for the deployment of Government eServices • Oversee and drive implementation of high priority eServices as per prioritised master plan and in coordination with entities • Drive revenue generation through eGov • Develop a service transformation toolkit to enable entities to transform their eServices on their own or with the help of a third party In summary, this is a comprehensive programme of projects and activities with the central aim of making eGovernment adVaNCe.

Improvements to the ICT  environment will include an increase in fixed and  mobile broadband penetration rendering higher  broadband and Government eService usage.   Higher business ICT spending and adoption will result in increased  competitiveness and ICT readiness of private sector institutions. Human  capital and eLiteracy in the Kingdom of Bahrain will be improved through  measures to train 5,000 nationals on IT and eGov foundational topics and 150  employees on eGov specialised disciplines annually.   Customer engagement and eParticipation will be crucial in the Kingdom, and  given particular focus.   Clients will participate in shaping eServices and will be allowed to voice their  opinions and preferences. eGov program awareness will increase to 90%, with  customer satisfaction index levels to be maintained over 80%. It is planned  that 50% of Government entities will interact with clients on a weekly basis  through social networks by 2014.   The Kingdom will drive eGov innovation by exposing public data sets and  providing funding support for innovation projects. Three eGov related projects   will be seed funded at BHD20,000 per project annually. Furthermore,  partnerships will be established with the private sector to deliver high impact  projects and support the national economy. Political support for the eGov  programme will be firmed up and sustained, whilst government collaboration   will be improved to enable impactful results.  15  figure 8  SOCIAL  NETWORKS  BLOGS  MASHUPS  RSS FEEDS  WIKIS  PODCASTS  FEEDBACK & ePARTIC IPA  TIO N  CUSTOMER ENG AG  EM EN  TCUSTOMER  ENGAGEMENT  GOVERNMENT  CLIENTS  ePARTICIPATION  Identify  Prefer  en ce  s  an  d  N  ee ds    C  us to  m is  e  eC  han nels & eServices   Promote Aw areness   A ssess Satisfaction  KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN  eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016  Society Engagement & eParticipation    The Government will enhance its people’s skills and cascade down organisational  change through entities by developing a formal eGov change program.    Three eGov toolkits will be developed to support and assist government  entities in their eGov related projects, with the aim of ensuring project delivery  consistency. eGov projects will be governed through business-IT planning  committees and formal eGov performance management will be adhered to.  A comprehensive eGov Return on Investment (ReGI) model will capture the  tangible and intangible eGov costs and benefits pertaining to all stakeholders.  On the technology front, the Kingdom of Bahrain will focus on ensuring that  proper IT strategic planning is conducted across the Government. Adoption of  common technology will be key in driving efficiency and standardisation. The  Government will follow a more collaborative and performance-based culture,  leveraging a number of government-wide systems. Security and back up will be  implemented to reduce disruption of services. Also, several “Next Generation”  technologies will be considered for deployment (e.g. Internet of Things, Mashups).   16  KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN  eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016  eGov Change Management Journey figure 9  Stakeholders actively contribute to  and participate towards successful  implementation efforts  Stakeholders accept and are in  line with the eGov programme   objectives and plans  UNDERSTANDING  Stakeholders have a proper  understanding of the eGov   programme and its objectives  BUY-IN  ACTIVE  PARTICIPATION  SUCCESSFUL  CHANGE  START  FINISH  Showcased Next Generation Technology Solutions  Location Based Technology  & Mashups  Internet of Things Green IT  figure 10  Kingdom of  Bahrain  Green IT  Strategy  Going Green through IT  Greening IT  Green IT Governance  Smart Phone Application Open Data Programme   Smart Phone Total Sales  Q1 2009: 40,971k,   Q2 2010: 61,649k sales  (150% Growth)  Public Data  Interfaces (APis)  Clients  Kingdom  Public Data   Sets  SDI Location  Cloud Computing  Public  Cloud  Private  Cloud  Hybrid Cloud    eGov services will proactively cater to the needs of customers and businesses to  enable a better life. All services will be consistently defined, named and managed  through an online services factbook. It is planned that 40 new eServices will be  deployed annually, and all government service information will be made available  online, with a view to ensuring an annual growth in uptake of online transaction  based services by 10%.   The Kingdom will enhance user experience through best-in-class eGov access  channels to effectively steer and improve customers’ service usage. By 2014,  3 eGov channels will be significantly upgraded by way of facilitating usage and  adding features to enhance the customer experience. Through these channels,  10% of all transaction based services will have an uptake of 100%. Ten new  Government mobile apps (for the top three mobile application stores) will be  launched annually, ensuring that an array of Government services are available to  individuals at all times. The customer service experience will be a constant focus,  driven by a tiered award programme for Government entities.  17  KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN  eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016  figure 11  BIRTH  EDUCATION  FAMILY  RETIREMENT  BUSINESS  Automatic health record is generated at birth Location-based services allow parents to locate closest available vaccination/health professionals for their children  Education databases with interactive digital content are the norm Pupils can access online classes anytime, anywhere  Mobile applications proactively notify household owners of due electricity & water bill Environmental awareness services educate about green living  Citizens can access and manage their retirement and pension funds online Death certificates trigger the issuance of a widow certificate  Bussinesses can access a Bahraini comprehensive virtual job market Round-the-clock call center service experts offering advice on business operations  eGovernment Services Examples Through all Stages of Life    eGoVerNmeNt authority key  CoNtributioNS  eGA operations have been very successful so far,  putting eGov at the forefront of national achievements  across all ERu dimensions and giving the Kingdom of  Bahrain international recognition (ranked in the top 10  for “Online Service Delivery” in the united Nations  eGov Survey over the last four years).   However, there are still a number of improvements that eGA aspires to  implement to enhance its own operations. These are also tackled by the new  eGov strategy.  18  KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN  eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016  Highlights of eGovernment Authority’s Key Contributions  Operational  Programme  Governance   (PMO)  ENVIRONMENT  figure 13  READINESS  USAGE  OPERATING  MODEL  200+ eServices  Deployed on the   eGov Portal  4 Operational  eGov Channels  (Portal, Contact   Center, CSC,  Mobile)  eGA Mandate, a  Strong Lever for   Ambitious  Reform   Programme  Senior Political  Sponsorship   (SCICT)  Established  Working Groups at  Different Entities (8  Fully Operational)  Well Defined  Government-wide  Target Enterprise   Architecture  Operational  Secure   Government  Networks    eGoVerNmeNt authority refiNed  operatiNG model  To support the rollout of the new eGov strategy, the  target operating model for eGA, has also been refined  via a framework of 6 clear dimensions, addressing  operational scope, people, processes, governance,  performance management, and technology.  eGoVerNmeNt authority’S   StrateGiC direCtioN  To support the eGov program going forward, eGA will play four main roles:  it will be the eGov strategist, the IT policy and standard setter, the service  transformation facilitator and the strategic incubator. In that respect, and over  the next few years, eGA will start enabling entities to gradually take on the  responsibility for more and more eService transformation.  19  KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN  eGOVERNMENT STRATEGY 2016  Operational  Programme  Governance   (PMO)  ENVIRONMENT  figure 13  READINESS  USAGE  OPERATING  MODEL  200+ eServices  Deployed on the   eGov Portal  4 Operational  eGov Channels  (Portal, Contact   Center, CSC,  Mobile)  eGA Mandate, a  Strong Lever for   Ambitious  Reform   Programme  Senior Political  Sponsorship   (SCICT)  Established  Working Groups at  Different Entities (8  Fully Operational)  Well Defined  Government-wide  Target Enterprise   Architecture  Operational  Secure   Government  Networks  figure 7  ORGANISATIONAL  STRUCTURE  ROLES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES  CAPABILITIES  PEOPLE PROCESSES  BUSINESS  PROJECT  MANAGEMENT   OFFICE  SUPPORT  GOVERNANCE  INTERACTION  MODEL  DECISION RIGHTS  CONTROL/AUDIT  FRAMEWORK  PERFORMANCE  MANAGEMENT  PERFORMANCE  MANAGEMENT  FRAMEWORK  KEY  PERFORMANCE   INDICATORS  PERFORMANCE  REPORTING   MECHANISM  TECHNOLOGY  ARCHITECTURE  STANDARDS  APPLICATIONS  INFRASTRUCTURE  OPERATIONAL  SCOPE  MANDATE SERVICE  OFFERING  DELIVERY  MODEL  eGovernment Authority’s  Operating Model Framework  Future Main Roles of eGovernment Authorityfigure 12  eGOV STRATEGY DEFINITION AND MANAGEMENT  • Develop and refresh the eGov strategy • Drive the eGov Programme and coordinate all its related efforts • Monitor the progress of eGov programme implementation • Communicate eGov programme goals and progress and   ensure awareness and usage uptake of eServices • Be informed of Government entities IT programmes   and budgets  STRATEGIC INCUBATION  • On behalf of other entities, design and drive the  implementation and operation of key foundational eGov  components/services until they mature and can be completely  transferred to such entity   • Setup and manage an innovation fund to solicit innovative  eGov related solutions from the market  eGOV AND IT POLICY AND STANDARDS SETTING AND MONITORING  • Set and refine eGov & IT related policies and standards • Educate concerned entities on eGov & IT related policies   and standards • Monitor and report adherence to eGov & IT related policies   and standards to the SCICT  eGA    eSERVICE TRANSFORMATION FACILITATION  • Set the agenda for the deployment of Government eServices • Oversee and drive implementation of high priority eServices   as per prioritised master plan and in coordination with entities • Drive revenue generation through eGov • Develop a service transformation toolkit to enable entities to transform   their eServices on their own or with the help of a third party    In summary, this is a comprehensive  programme of projects and activities with  the central aim of making eGovernment  adVaNCe.

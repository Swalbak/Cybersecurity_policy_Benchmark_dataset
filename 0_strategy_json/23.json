It is a key lever of economic development. The growth trends of Pakistan’s economy have been corroborated and praised by numerous independent global institutes. Pakistan’s Information Technology (IT) sector is carving a differentiated position as the preferred source for software development, BPO and freelancing. Pakistan was ranked at number four1 for freelance development in the world and IT exports have increased 70%2 during the last three years. Pakistan, which has about 60% of its 200 million population in the 15 to 29 age group, represents an enormous human and knowledge capital. Pakistan has more than 2000 IT companies & call centers and the number is growing every year. Pakistan has more than 300,000 English-speaking IT professionals with expertise in current and emerging IT products and technologies. More than 20,000 IT graduates and engineers are being produced each year. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) continues to facilitate the IT industry through numerous sustainable development and accelerated digitization projects, research and innovation, software technology parks, subsidized bandwidth, international marketing, international certifications, internships and trainings. Incentives to bolster growth include 100% equity ownership, 100% repatriation of capital/dividends, tax exemption on IT & ITeS export revenues, tax exemptions to startups and subsidized state of the art Software Technology Parks. The GOP has a holistic strategy for positioning Pakistan on the global outsourcing map, participation in international forums, organizing domestic conferences, scaling software technology parks and facilitating certification (ISO 27001 and CMMI) programs. Given the augmented IT demand and growth, it has become imperative to reformulate the Digital Pakistan Policy: one that takes into account its increasingly transformed role across all sectors of socio-economic development; their accelerated digitization, and transformational modernization into integrated components of a holistic knowledge based economy. With this in mind, Ministry of IT & Telecom (MoIT) has formulated this policy document based on a multi-stakeholder model. The Digital Pakistan Policy imperatives are also very much intertwined and therefore addressed holistically to transform the IT and other sectors of economy on fast track basis. This policy will also serve as the foundation for the construction of a holistic digital ecosystem with advanced concepts and components for the rapid delivery of next generation digital services, applications and content. It will serve as an aggregator of demand for innovative digital services and as a supplier of data for value added services and applications. It is an opportunity for local entrepreneurs and firms to acquire core competencies, experience, and credibility and become better positioned to compete and prosper on the international stage. 1 Odesk.com, 2 State Bank of Pakistan Digital Pakistan Policy Page 5 Policy Vision & Goals Policy Vision The Government of Pakistan (GOP) strives to improve its citizens’ quality of life and economic well-being by ensuring availability of accessible, affordable, reliable, universal and high quality ICT services.

It is a key lever of economic development. The  growth trends of Pakistan’s economy have been corroborated and praised by numerous  independent global institutes. Pakistan’s Information Technology (IT) sector is carving a  differentiated position as the preferred source for software development, BPO and freelancing.  Pakistan was ranked at number four1 for freelance development in the world and IT exports have  increased 70%2 during the last three years.   Pakistan, which has about 60% of its 200 million population in the 15 to 29 age group, represents  an enormous human and knowledge capital. Pakistan has more than 2000 IT companies & call  centers and the number is growing every year. Pakistan has more than 300,000 English-speaking  IT professionals with expertise in current and emerging IT products and technologies. More than  20,000 IT graduates and engineers are being produced each year.    The Government of Pakistan (GOP) continues to facilitate the IT industry through numerous  sustainable development and accelerated digitization projects, research and innovation, software  technology parks, subsidized bandwidth, international marketing, international certifications,  internships and trainings.  Incentives to bolster growth include 100% equity ownership, 100%  repatriation of capital/dividends, tax exemption on IT & ITeS export revenues, tax exemptions to  startups and subsidized state of the art Software Technology Parks.   The GOP has a holistic strategy for positioning Pakistan on the global outsourcing map,  participation in international forums, organizing domestic conferences, scaling software  technology parks and facilitating certification (ISO 27001 and CMMI) programs.   Given the augmented IT demand and growth, it has become imperative to reformulate the Digital  Pakistan Policy: one that takes into account its increasingly transformed role across all sectors of  socio-economic development; their accelerated digitization, and transformational modernization  into integrated components of a holistic knowledge based economy. With this in mind, Ministry  of IT & Telecom (MoIT) has formulated this policy document based on a multi-stakeholder model.  The Digital Pakistan Policy imperatives are also very much intertwined and therefore addressed  holistically to transform the IT and other sectors of economy on fast track basis.    This policy will also serve as the foundation for the construction of a holistic digital ecosystem with  advanced concepts and components for the rapid delivery of next generation digital services,  applications and content. It will serve as an aggregator of demand for innovative digital services  and as a supplier of data for value added services and applications.    It is an opportunity for local entrepreneurs and firms to acquire core competencies, experience,  and credibility and become better positioned to compete and prosper on the international stage.                                                                              1  Odesk.com,   2  State Bank of Pakistan        Digital Pakistan Policy Page 5     Policy Vision & Goals     Policy Vision   The Government of Pakistan (GOP) strives to improve its citizens’ quality of life and economic  well-being by ensuring availability of accessible, affordable, reliable, universal and high quality ICT  services. GOP strongly believes in mass adoption of emerging digital technologies and innovative  applications to enable cross-sector socio-economic development and transformation of economic  activities, governance models, social interaction, and achievement of sustainable development  goals.   The vision with regards to Digital Pakistan Policy is:   To become a strategic enabler for an accelerated digitization eco  system to expand the knowledge based economy and spur socio   economic growth   Policy Objectives   I. Holistic Digital strategy  A key goal of the Digital Pakistan Policy is to create a digital ecosystem with infrastructure  and institutional frameworks for the rapid delivery of innovative digital services, applications  and content. This policy represents a shift away from a piece-meal approach to a holistic  technology strategy clearly focused on ICT as a broad enabler of every sector of socio- economic development.     II. Sectorial Digitalization   Promote the use of technology in education, health, agriculture and other key socio economic  sectors. Encourage the use of ICT in public schools and ensure they are online and have a  meaningful impact on the current education eco-system in a phased manner.     III. E/M-Commerce  Enhance the current market size of e/m-commerce.  According to some estimates, the  market carries an enormous growth potential due to exponential growth in broadband  subscribers from 3.7 million in 2013 to over 44.3 million in 2017 and increasing. With these  growth trends projected to persist in the future, overseas investments will continue to grow  in e-commerce.   Promote e-commerce by providing and enabling an environment where Payment Service  Providers (PSP) and Payment Service Operators (PSO) can operate and establish an effective  e-commerce platform and take e-commerce activities in Pakistan to the next level.     IV. Youth, Women and Girls empowerment using IT   Youth and Women represent roughly 60% and 49% respectively of the population. Ensuring  women and girls have equal access to ICTs will help reduce inequalities and support gender     Digital Pakistan Policy Page 6     equality.  The value of ICTs is largely seen through increased productivity, improved access to  health and education, equitable participation in social, political and economic spheres, thus  breaking barriers of isolation.

The telecom infrastructure expansion across the country has played a     Digital Pakistan Policy Page 18     pivotal role in the growth of IT &ITeS sector and this is now getting global acknowledgment and a   reputation for reliable and cost-effective delivery of IT and IT enabled services.   According to latest forecast by Gartner Inc. in October 2017, Worldwide IT spending is projected   to total $3.7 trillion in 2018, an increase of 4.3 percent from 2017 estimated spending of $3.5   trillion. Enterprise software and IT services continue to exhibit strong growth, with   communications services continuing to drive the majority of spending. Software spending is   projected to grow 8.5 percent in 2017, and it will grow another 9.4 percent in 2018 to total $387   billion. IT services spending is on pace to grow 4 percent in 2017 to reach $931 billion, and increase   5.3 percent in 2018 to reach $980 billion. This report depicts the potential of ITeS sector and it is   time to re-align the government strategies to attract a reasonable chunk out of $980 billion. This   will help to create thousands of new jobs in IT sector of Pakistan in line with current Government   policy to create more and more jobs for youth in digital economy.   Current incentives and promotional initiatives already in place for the sector include   - 100% foreign ownership Allowed   - 100% repatriation of capital & dividends (subject to SBP Approval)   - IT & ITeS Export Income Tax exemption till June 2019   - Income tax holiday for Venture Capital companies/funds till June 2024, under Venture   Capital Companies and Funds Management Rules, 2000   Additional incentives particularly for IT startups were awarded in the budget (FY 2017-18) to  promote innovation & entrepreneurship that included:   - Exemption for a period of three years from Income Tax, Minimum Tax and Withholding   Tax for PSEB registered and certified IT startups that are offering technology driven   products and services   - Exemption from sales tax on export of IT services from Islamabad and other federal   territories   - IT Companies allowed to open Foreign Exchange Accounts in Pakistan      However, in order to achieve the policy objectives, Ministry of IT & Telecom plans to further   incentivize the IT sector through a number of attractive fiscal & non-fiscal incentives to create a   favorable business environment.   Fiscal Incentives   Proposals for fiscal incentives for IT industry are recommended in-consultation with IT industry   including PASHA to boost the IT/ITeS Exports. Ministry of IT & Telecom will recommend the   proposals for inclusion in the relevant documents such as Finance Bill and BOI’s Special Economic   Zone (SEZ) Act etc. after due process.     Digital Pakistan Policy Page 19      Extension of Income Tax Holiday - In order to attract long term investment in the IT/ITeS   sector, income tax holiday under clause 133 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax   Ordinance, 2001 to be extended till 2025 to IT / ITeS Companies registered with the   Pakistan Software Export Board on their export revenue/income;    5% Cash Reward on Export Remittances - Improving the export remittances and the   reporting of remittances in the purpose codes assigned by the State Bank of Pakistan for   the IT & ITeS sector is key to boosting the economic growth of the country. Hence, 5% cash   reward shall be awarded on the net export remittances of PSEB registered IT/ITeS   companies and PSEB registered call centers subject to a verifiable criteria to be agreed   among the State Bank, FBR, Ministry of IT & Telecom, and Pakistan Software Houses   Association (PASHA);         5% Sales Tax on Services (Domestic) – Profit margins in the domestic market are already   low, and customers are unwilling to pay double digit sales tax which results in IT companies   shouldering the cost. Hence, reduced sales tax of about 5% shall be charged on domestic   revenues of IT/ITeS companies located in Islamabad Capital Territory. Additionally, MoIT   will take up the matter of rationalizing sales tax in provinces through appropriate channels;    Provision of Bank loans to IT/ITeS Industry: - Finance Division in consultation with Ministry   of IT & Telecom will work with relevant stakeholders including State Bank on a proposal to   reduce long term financing rates to 5% for IT/ITeS companies as well as financing   arrangements based on trade receivables/contracts and intellectual property such as   trademarks, copyrights and patents. This will enable IT enterprises to compete for large   projects locally and internationally;    Tech SEZs (Special Economic Zones) – Ministry of IT & Telecom will recommend to   incentivize investment in IT infrastructure in the country to Board of Investment (BOI)   through the concept of technology SEZs, availing the already in place Special Economic   Zone Act 2012 of Pakistan through modifications and exceptions, extending the incentives   of SEZs to IT industry;    Proliferation of new IT Parks – Given the high land cost in major metropolitans such as   Islamabad and Karachi, PSEB would allocate land on a long term lease to IT/ITeS   companies. Detailed terms and conditions for the leased land will be decided as part of the   Action Plan and would include specific commitments for development, occupation and   employment generation as specified by the PSEB;      Non-Fiscal Incentives    Reinforce the industry status of IT Sector at all levels of the government in pursuance to   previous formal notification of the government.      Digital Pakistan Policy Page 20      Ratification of World Trade Organization’s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) by   the Government – MoIT will work with Ministry of Commerce & other stakeholders for   accession to the ITA regime to eliminate tariff barriers on imports of ICT products;    Increasing the timeframe of initial registration period of call centers with PSEB to 5 years   from the current 1-year period. Similarly, the renewal of call centers registrations will be   for 5 years as well as opposed to yearly renewal regime currently in place. PSEB to provide   registration certificate/NOC to call centers in 3 days in both initial registration and renewal   cases;    Call center certifications to Individual/Sole proprietors will be allowed;    PSEB/PTA to enable telecommuting/work from home facility for the call centers to expand   BPO workforce;    Government of Pakistan to encourage trade delegations comprising of IT/ITeS-BPO to the   major international market and to launch an international branding & PR campaign   projecting Pakistan as a leading outsourcing destination for IT & ITeS-BPO services.       Section IV: Policy Implementation & Reviews  The policy implementation will require consistent monitoring and evaluation of its outcomes.   However, an appropriate strategy will also be prepared to align the ‘Action Plan’ with key priority   areas for proper monitoring and evaluation.       MoIT will encourage provincial departments and bodies to use this Digital Pakistan Policy as a   guideline for their own IT initiatives. Provinces can identify their own unique requirements and   implementation frameworks. However broad alignment to the National Digital Pakistan Policy   may be pursued.  The IT Sector is one of the most dynamic sector. Therefore, requisite measures   will be adopted to cope with latest trends and technologies. One such measure will be to ensure a   biennial review of the policy to keep it relevant, vibrant and up-to-date.   Roles and Responsibilities   For implementation of the Digital Pakistan Policy, various ministries and departments will be   involved. Considering the involvement of broad spectrum of agencies, it is appropriate to align the   agencies with their specific roles and responsibilities for clarity. Responsibilities/assignments   being proposed as part of this policy are attached at Annexure-1.

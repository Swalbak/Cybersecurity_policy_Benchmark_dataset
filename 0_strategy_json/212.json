In the past three years processes in the Defense Sector were focused on the implemen- tation of appropriate reforms and adjustments related to the ambiguous strategic and regional environment. Functioning of the Defense Sector that was determined by limited Defense Budget and requirements to have capabilities to respond to current and future threats in a dynamic and complex security environment, were the main driving force in reviewing of the existing plans and functioning of Defense. An obsolete and outdated conceptual-normative framework prevented reform processes and therefore this segment was targeted for radical reforms. The Long-Term Develop- ment Plan reflects strategic shift toward a new, modern deliberation of Defense and its conceptual and institutional positioning in modern geopolitical and geostrategic realities. This is the first Long-Term Development Plan since we become members of NATO and the European Union, and this fact creates an essential framework for our efforts aimed at positioning defense functions in relation to the contemporary security architecture. Although one of the biggest challenges is to achieve the necessary level of Defense Capabilities in circumstances marked by reduced defense spending, the vision set out in this document attempts to position and understand the Defense and the social role of the Armed Forces in a far broader and more meaningful way. The Republic of Croatia will develop respectable Armed Forces that will be able to: ad- equately respond to the long-term period challenges; Forces capable of executing its fundamental Constitutional role; Forces that are ready, trained and equipped to carry out their part in joint operations with Allies, and Forces that will be available to provide as- sistance to affected civil population during disasters and crisis situations. At the same token, the Armed Forces will be developed as an important building block of the overall potential of the country, support to security, stability and development of society.

With the ac- cession to Euro-Atlantic integration, the key strategic national goals have been accomplished. In 2009 the Republic of Croatia joined the NATO Alliance and in 2013 became the member of the Euro- pean Union. Through this membership a stable and long-term security perspective has been achieved. Concurrently, due to economic crisis, the funds allocated for defense have been reduced, whereas the security environment at the global and regional levels generates new security and defense challenges and threats. This altogether requires further adjustments and transformation in the development of Defense Capabilities. Reconsideration of conceptual solutions and available capabilities has resulted in decisions to elaborate and adopt the new legal regulations (the Defense Act1, the Act on Service in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia2), and a series of strategic and planning documents in the field of Defense that will direct further de- velopment of the Croatian Armed Forces (hereinafter referred to as “the Armed Forces”). After the implementation of the Strategic Defense Review process, the fi- nal document was adopted by the Govern- ment on 25th July 2013. The development of the Croatian Armed Forces Long-Term Development Plan 2015-2024 (hereinafter referred to as “the LTDP”) is a continuation of this process that puts into operation conceptual approaches and the neces- sity for transforming defense capabilities identified in the Strategic Defense Review. The LTDP is the basic defense plan- ning document defining the long-term projection of development of military capabilities and the required resources. Having considered all aspects of strate- gic circumstances and available capabili- ties and resources, the analytical phase played a key role in identifying Target Ca- pabilities to be developed in the upcom- ing planning period. Within this process, a wide range of scenarios has been devel- oped that can generate the need for the Armed Force engagement. The scenarios were analyzed, along with the probability of each scenario occurring, requirements, security impacts on the state and society, ambitions and possibilities for develop- ment of military capabilities that should be employed. Finally, summarization and prioritization were conducted, including harmonization of the type and size of the affordable capabilities which was taken as a basis for defining the size and or- ganization of the Armed Forces.

SECURITY STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK The global strategic environment is marked by highly dynamic political, social and economic changes that result in the shift of power and influence generating new instabilities, divisions, competitions and opposition of the global actors. In a narrow security sense, the environment was characterized by disruption of secu- rity by non-traditional security threats, such as new forms of international ter- rorism, trans-border organized crime, and proliferation of Weapons of Mass De- struction, disruption of energy supply sys- tems, potential dangers from missile and cyber-attacks, and piracy. Although the probability of conventional and nuclear attack on the European Union and NATO member states is not high, primarily due to their capabilities for defense and deter- rence built through the combined efforts of the Allies, instabilities arising in the close vicinity of the Allies’ borders could have far-reaching impacts on the global security architecture, thus reaffirming the importance of a balanced approach to the Alliance’s core tasks – Collective Defense, Crises Management and Cooperative Se- curity. Numerous conflicts and crisis areas, emerging failed and unstable states and various types of threats caused by the rise of extremist ideologies impose the need for the development of key capabilities and launching of international operations directed towards improving security. An effective response to a broad spectrum of global threats is possible only through a strong and comprehensive cooperation with the Allies and Partners, and through integration of civilian and military capa- bilities. The tasks that are set before the Armed Forces impose the need for their further transformation and modernization, i.e. building and development of capabili- ties for a balanced approach to the Alli- ance’s core tasks. In order to respond to modern challenges and threats, the Armed Forces should be capable of performing non-traditional tasks. They should be ad- justable, mobile, interoperable, deployable and sustainable in the Area of Operations. Armed conflicts from the recent past that took place in the Southeast European Region have been replaced by a wide range and an extensive network of multi- lateral and bilateral cooperation. This has mostly been a result of a strong influence of external factors and aspirations of all countries in the Region to establish close connections with the Euro-Atlantic com- T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 munity. Countries in the Southeast Europe- an Region have recognized the importance of the regional cooperation and, with the support of the Euro Atlantic community, have established a series of initiatives for cooperation. As a result of the years long successful cooperation, the states of the Region have gradually taken over the own- ership over regional initiatives, as for ex- ample the US-Adriatic Charter (A-5), South- east Europe Defense Ministerial – SEDM, RACVIAC – The Center for Security Coopera- tion and have taken over the implemen- tation of the Agreement on Sub regional Arms Control (Article IV, Annex 1-B of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina – Dayton Ac- cord). The results of such efforts have been positive and are reflected in a wide range of mutual cooperation between the coun- tries in the Region focused on multilateral solutions to security problems, i.e. in the readiness to settle interstate and interior disputes through an open dialogue. The aspiration to connect with the Euro- Atlantic community, to a greater or lesser degree has been present in all countries of the Region, and every step towards Euro-Atlantic integration has further re- duced the likelihood of new crises or re- newed conflicts. However, in spite of the aforementioned positive characteristics of the security environment, there have still been poten- tial security threats resulting from open regional issues caused by the legacy of the 1990s. In the spectrum of potential regional threats we cannot exclude the probability of armed conflicts, so there is still a need for international military and police presence in some countries of the Region. While the Republic of Croatia could be in- directly exposed to implications of poten- tial regional conflicts, there is no danger from direct armed aggression on its terri- tory in the context of the existing strategic circumstances. Starting from the considerably strength- ened international position of the Republic of Croatia, unquestionably determined by its affiliation with NATO and the EU, the Armed Forces will participate more actively in multilateral and bilateral regional coop- eration projects by strengthening regional stability and good neighborly relationships and by helping the countries in the Region to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, not neglecting multilateral and bilateral coop- eration with all Allies and Partners in the Euro-Atlantic community and beyond. In accordance with the strategic orientation of the Republic of Croatia, the Armed Forc- es have given a significant contribution to international peace and security for more than a decade by participating in NATO, EU and UN missions and operations which required a gradual development of the en- tire spectrum of new capabilities. These 11 capabilities of the Armed Forces will be further developed, inter alia, through vari- ous types of international training, courses and exercises. The commitments of the Armed Forces resulting from the new Se- curity and Defense architecture of the Re- public of Croatia governed by the Defense Act that envisages assistance provided to Allied countries, declaring their forces for Multinational Response Forces, joining the multinational military structures and en- gagement in Peace Support Operations, Crisis Response Operations, Humanitarian Operations, and other activities abroad. Participation in the UN Peace Support Missions will remain one of the priorities of the Croatian contribution to maintain- ing international peace and security. With its own war experience, the Republic of Croatia has acquired expertise in manag- ing UN Peace Missions that have become an important mechanism that can stop international conflicts. In that context, the Republic of Croatia has gained additional credibility and globally applicable sub- stantial knowledge. It has also assumed responsibility to apply its excellence in implementation of the international peace activities and to pass on practical expe- riences. Participation in the UN Peace Missions and operations, in addition to maintaining world order based on obeying the international law, is also useful in the context of strengthening strategic part- nerships with key partners. NATO membership obligates the Repub- lic of Croatia to give full contribution to the Collective Defense of the Allies under Arti- cle V of the North Atlantic Treaty according to its capabilities, and to engage its forces to actively participate in the execution of other tasks in accordance with the NATO Strategic Concept, including the activi- ties related to Crisis Management and the contribution to international peace and se- curity. The Armed Forces have significant obligations that are a result of declaring their forces for NATO Response Forces (NRF), improved military capabilities and interoperability through participation in the implementation of concepts used to de- velop mechanisms for mutual cooperation on building, maintaining and strengthening Defense Capabilities. Capability Targets that the Republic of Croatia assumed in the NATO Defense Planning Process play a cru- cial role as direct indicators of the dedica- tion to the development of the Alliance, and their implementation will form a backbone of the Armed Forces development. The European Union strives to struc- ture its Security and Defense dimension more firmly through a series of initiatives and activities within Common Security and Defense Policy. Therefore, the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union implies a new commitment to the development of the Armed Forces capabili- ties. The Republic of Croatia will continue to give contribution to the Peace Support Operations within the EU framework and the EU Battle Group (EU BG), and partici- pate in the Pooling and Sharing initiative and in the activities of the European De- fense Agency (EDA). As a full-fledged mem- ber, the Republic of Croatia has taken over the commitments of potential employment of the Armed Forces in providing assis- tance to the EU member states regarding their defense and their employment in ac- cordance with the Solidarity Clause. Common affiliation of the majority of NATO and EU member states, common values and strategic interests present a new challenge to the Republic of Croatia, its Defense Sector and the Armed Forces. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 years the Defense Budget will remain at the level of Fiscal Year 2014, i.e., the total Defense Budget will be 4.3 billion HRK, and this will, in a real sense, put an end to its year-long continuous decrease. With the recovery of the economy and the GDP growth, and in accordance with the European Union procedures related to the excessive deficit, the conditions for a gradual increase in the Defense Budget will be met, that is, the prerequisites for a gradual accomplishment of the long-term ambition to increase the Defense spend- ing by 2 percent of the country’s GDP. Long-term planning in the Defense Sec- tor under the conditions of uncertain eco- nomic movements and continuous budget restructuring has been accompanied by a series of challenges and risks which re- quire intensive short-term management and fast adaptations. This means a possibility and an obligation to participate in numerous initiatives and activities arising from the need for enhanc- ing the complementarities and coordina- tion of these two organizations, particularly in the area of practical cooperation in mis- sions and operations and cooperation in the development of Defense Capabilities. FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK Due to the economic crisis, the Defense Sector has been faced with a reduced De- fense Budget, and with the imperative to adapt to financing under the conditions of fiscal rationalization and savings. Emanat- ing from the macroeconomic reality that is currently not capable of producing reli- able medium and long-term forecasts of GDP dynamics, this Document is based on the assumption that for the next three 13 and Pooling and Sharing initiatives are the key elements of such approach. In the context of EU membership, EU structural funds will be used accordingly, in order to build the capabilities of the Armed Forces envisaged for the civil- military dual use, particularly in the area of Search and Rescue, Medical Trans- portation, Border Control, coping with the impacts of ecological disasters, etc. • Affordability: Defined priorities and appropriate dynamics of Capability De- velopment will set up the balance be- tween the Capability Development re- quirements and resources provided by the State. • Single Set of Forces: The Republic of Croatia will develop a single set of Forces for NATO and EU arrangements and mechanisms deriving from the com- mitment to strengthen strategic partner- ship between these two organizations. • High Standards of Civil-Military Relations: The Republic of Croatia will provide the conditions for establishing high standards of Civil-Military relations that encourage the society to place the high levels of trust in the Armed Forces, build effective management and control mechanisms, professional autonomy and social responsibility of the Armed Forces, effective prevention of all forms of discrimination, continuous enhance- ment of integrity and transparency, pro- motion of Military Ethics and Gender Awareness Policy. • Inter-Agency Cooperation: There will be cooperation, coordination and coordinated action between the Armed Forces and other State bodies in the development of capabilities to conduct missions and tasks, and to provide re- sponse to risk and threats. PRINCIPLES OF THE ARMED FORCES DEVELOPMENT In the planning period defined in this Plan, the Armed Forces will be organized ac- cording to the following principles: • Strategic Coherence: the develop- ment of Defense Capabilities will ensure readiness to respond to present and fu- ture threats and security challenges. • Focus on Capabilities: Taking into account threat diversity and risks result- ing from the complexity of the Security environment, the Armed Forces should have capabilities required for the execu- tion of various types of operations and activities – the ones resulting from their basic Constitutional role and commit- ments assumed under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty; Crisis Response Operations outside the territory of the Republic of Croatia that contribute to in- ternational security and stability; activi- ties for providing assistance to civilian institutions and population, that is, vari- ous kinds of Humanitarian Operations at home and abroad. • Flexibility: The Armed Forces will undergo continuous adjustments and transformation in accordance with the complexity of Security environment. • Competence Based Approach: Human resources of the Armed Forces will be continuously strengthened as well as the institutional prerequisites for the professional development of the mem- bers of the Armed Force based on com- petencies. • Focus on the International Co- operation: The Republic of Croatia will participate in common efforts of NATO and the EU to build, maintain and strengthen capabilities. Smart Defense, T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 THE MISSSION OF THE ARMED FORCES In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, there are three missions of the Armed Forces: the Defense of the Republic of Croatia and its Allies, the contribution to international security and support to civil institutions. Support to Civil Institutions is a mis- sion in which the Armed Forces provide as- sistance to civil institutions and population in the Crisis Management process and in dealing with different types of risks and threats of a non-military nature. This sup- port is accomplished through the support The defense of territorial integrity, sovereignty and inde- pendence, and the defense of Allies is a primary mission of the Croatian Armed Forces. Therefore, the Armed Forces should be ready: to deter, halt and reject, independently, and with the help of the Allies, the armed aggression on the Republic of Croatia; contribute to the Defense of the Allies in the operations pertinent to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and to protect the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia on land, at sea and in air. Contribution to International Security is a mission of the Armed Forces through which they contribute to international security and to the creation and maintenance of the most suitable international environment. This is accomplished by participation in Peace Support Operations, Defense Diplomacy and Arms Control, Disarmament and Prevention of Proliferation of Weapons. to the Police and other state bodies, as well as through the support in Protection and Rescue, and the support to civil society. VISION OF THE ARMED FORCES At the end of the development period cov- ered within the Long Term Development Plan, the Armed Forces will be managed, well trained, and equipped, capable and ready to carry out the defined missions and tasks. Imbued with patriotism and faced with the requirements of the 21st century, radically different from the previ- ous ones, the military profession will de- velop in accordance with the principles of high professionalism, expertise and social responsibility. The Armed Forces are not only the in- strument for implementing missions and tasks, but also one of the key elements and an indicator of the identity of state and society. Established in the Homeland War, with a high social reputation based on the successful, historically significant mission of defending and liberating the country, they will with the provision of ad- equate resources, continue to be one of the fundamental pillars of security, stabil- ity and development of the society. The Armed Forces will be developed as an important integral element of the overall potentials of the state, and one of the in- II. DEVELOPMENT VISION 15 dicators of integration of modern Croatian society into contemporary European and global developmental trends. Their activity will continuously confirm the social role, commitment of the country to the Alliance and to the values underlying the European and Euro-Atlantic community. Extending the traditional role of the mili- tary in modern environment and the in- creasing complexity of conditions in which its engagement is taking place have not reduced but rather increased the demands and the complexity of military vocation. In addition, the economic crisis has sig- nificantly slowed down the development processes and did prevent the allocation of social resources to the Defense Sector from being in line with its role in a signifi- cantly changed environment. The development of the Armed Forces in such circumstances is not based on the growth of the Defense Budget3 taken out of the social context, but on rationaliza- tion and effectiveness of the management processes. Development of the Armed Forces, together with the necessary budg- et funds, underlines that ideas and visions could mitigate and partly compensate for the lack of resources. Development of the Armed Forces is based not only on new weapons and military equipment but on personnel too. Investment into personnel, their education, overall care and improve- ment of their working and living conditions is a presumption of making the vision of their development real. KEY LONG−TERM GOALS OF THE ARMED FORCES DEVELOPMENT Development of the Armed Forces, based on such elaborated vision, will be focused on the accomplishment of the following key Long term goals: 1. Building of the Armed Forces capabili- ties for effective engagement in current and future theater of operations. 2. Optimizing the strength and structure of the Armed Forces and increasing the effectiveness of the management pro- cess, Command and Control. 3. Credible and consistent activities in terms of the system of Collective Defense and arrangements within the EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and the UN Peacekeeping Missions. 4. Developing the Armed Forces as an or- ganization based on competencies and imbued with social accountability. 5. Strengthening the capacity for the im- plementation of non-military tasks at home and abroad that include provid- ing assistance to civil institutions and population in Crisis Management and Crisis Response Operations, in cases of accidents, disasters and catastro- phes, Humanitarian Operations, Search and Rescue operations on land, at sea and in the air, that is, those capabilities foreseen for civil-military dual use. 3 According to the regulations for the elaboration of the State Budget in the Republic of Croatia, the official term for the “defense budget“ is the Financial Plan of the Ministry of the Defense. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 The Republic of Croatia refers to the de- fense against the armed aggression in terms of Article 5 of North Atlantic Treaty. In the defense of sovereignty and territori- al integrity, the Republic of Croatia will use all available forces and resources includ- ing development of its own Armed Forces and accepting the Allied forces up to the required level. In defending the Allies, the Armed Forces will participate primarily with capabilities that have been developed within NATO Defense Planning framework as well as with the other available forces. The Republic of Croatia will develop the Armed Forces whose primary mission will be the defend sovereignty and territorial integrity and to maintain capabilities for initial response to a potential armed ag- gression and acceptance of Allied forces in conducting Collective Defense on the national territory. With this purpose, up to 20000 members of the Assigned Reserve will be posted to the Reserve Armed Forc- es together with corresponding weapons and equipment. The mechanisms of acti- vating Mobilization Reserve, together with reactivating Compulsory Military Service will ensure the growth of the forces up to the level required for the successful coun- ter potential armed aggression on the na- tional territory. The Republic of Croatia will develop ca- pabilities for sustainable participation in operations abroad with up to 1000 Armed Forces members. The required Defense Budget funding will be planned for the participation in operations with up to 200 Armed Forces members while the fund- ing of the possible participation above the stated number will be provided outside of the Defense Budget. The Republic of Croatia will keep on con- tributing with its forces to the NATO Re- sponse Forces (NRF) and European Union Battle Groups (EU BG). Overall declared forces of the Republic of Croatia for the NATO Response Forces will make up to 1% of the NATO Immediate Response Forces (IRF).4 Within the Immediate Response Forces, the Armed Forces will participate contributing with a Company-size unit of a Mechanized infantry or equivalent forces. The Armed Forces will participate with de- clared forces within the NATO Response Forces Pool (RFP). In addition to the ambition to contribute in filling in the share of the NATO Command Structure, the Republic of Croatia will con- tinuously join the NATO Force Structure. Parallel to this, the Republic of Croatia re- mains open to joining forces through other initiatives and multilateral arrangements beyond the framework of NATO and EU, especially in the regional environment. Participation in the EU BG will range from a significant contribution in the time span III. LEVEL OF AMBITION 4 The Immediate Response Forces (IRF) are part of NATO Response Forces. Their size is up to 13,000 members of the land, air and naval forces. The Armed Forces will participate with up to 130 members or the equivalent of a maneuver company. 17 of every three to four years (up to 300 Armed Forces members), to lesser con- tributions to combat groups within these intervals. Additionally, participation in NRF and EU BG, does not exclude the possibility of joining other multinational formations in- tended for Immediate Response to crisis situations. Contribution to missions and operations under the auspices of the United Nations will be provided through appropriate par- ticipation of units, teams and individual members. By the end of 2018, the Land forces will be capable of sending sustainable forces of a Combat group size within Mecha- nized battalion to the Peace Support Operations. In order to achieve this level of ambition, the Land forces will be de- veloped in a way that 50% of total Land forces is structured, trained and equipped for participation in Peace Support Opera- tions, and 10% of forces are sustainable in operations. Naval forces will develop capabilities to protect sovereignty and to control and protect legal rights and interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea. In the first part of the planning period, the capabilities for the execution of traditional naval tasks will remain at the existing level. Their further development will be planned for the period after the year 2017. Although the focus will be on the execution of tasks at the Adriatic Sea, naval forces will continue to develop capabilities in NATO, EU and UN operations outside the Adriatic as well. Naval forces will improve their capabilities of control and protection of legal rights and interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea in cooperation with other state bodies and Allies relying upon the development of Coastal patrol boats and capabilities of creating integrated picture of the naval situation at the Adriatic Sea. In addition to the mentioned capabilities, naval forces will develop capabilities of counter-mine activities, capabilities for the protection of merchant ships from piracy and criminal activities during navigation and capabili- ties for naval interception. In the process of developing capabilities of the naval forces, NATO and the EU Maritime Strategy will be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner. Capability of controlling and protecting the airspace of the Republic of Croatia within NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATI- NAMDS) will be accomplished primarily by existing combat aircrafts until the end of the resource lifecycle, with the support of Surveillance, Com- mand and Control System. By the end of 2016, the possibilities to retain this capability will be determined, including a multinational approach to its maintenance or abandonment of certain elements of this capability and searching for the solution within the Collective Defense of NATO. By 2018, the Air Forces will have capabilities to deploy helicopter forces (up to eight medium transport helicopters) for Peace Support Operations, sustainable for six months (without rotation). They will be capable of sending and maintaining helicopter forces up to the size of four mid transport helicopters on rotation basis. In order to accomplish the Level of Ambition, the Air Forces will be developed in a way that 40% of total Air Forces are structured, trained and equipped for par- ticipation in Peace Support Operations, and 8% of the forces will be sustainable in Peace Support Operations. In the process of developing particular capabilities, the Republic of Croatia will join the initiatives within the framework of Allied and Part- nership arrangements. At the same time, in certain initiatives, depend- ing on the real possibilities, Croatia will take the leading role. When conducting international operations the Republic of Croatia will focus on Joint forces generated within NATO and the EU. Capabilities of the Armed Forces in assisting civil institutions will be developed through the enhancement of institutional capabilities in the Republic of Croatia that will, by synergy strengthen the resilience of the society to disasters and crisis situations, and will be also used in international Humanitarian Operations. Existing capabilities of the Air Forces will be the backbone of maintenance and development of the national capabilities for aerial firefighting. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Possessing and developing relevant ca- pabilities is a prerequisite of successful accomplishment of the Armed Forces missions and tasks. Dynamic security environment characterized by series of hardly predictable specific threats and challenges considering form and effec- tiveness together with a low degree of possibility of a traditional threat by armed aggression, determines the approach to the capability based planning of the Armed Forces development. Successful response to a threat or challenge requires capabilities that are tailored and built with regards to types and the nature of threats or challenges and act accordingly. Since the acquiring of the capabilities is accomplished by means of organization and other elements of capabilities5, the requirements that define the capabilities direct all aspects of organization and de- velopment of the Armed Forces. Capabilities that the Armed Forces should possess and develop are to be considered through seven main areas: 1. Prepare, 2. Communications, command and control (C3), 3. Project, 4. Engage, 5. Inform/Situational Awareness, 6. Logistics and Sustain, 7. Protect. Prepare Preparation comprises capabilities needed for continuous improvement of effective- ness, before and during operations. The following types of capabilities will be developed: • Defense Planning Capability will be continually enhanced and will follow processes of Strategic Planning in the Republic of Croatia.

The ultimate goal is to maintain more operational, highly- trained and well-equipped Armed Forces that are smaller in size, but able to carry out all assigned missions and tasks. The Armed Forces will be organized into headquarters, commands, units, institu- tions and other organizational units, and with regard to their role and functions, they will be clearly divided into two com- ponents - Operational and Institutional component. The Armed Forces operational component will be composed of organizational units that will be organized and prepared to im- plement combat and non-combat opera- tions (Operational Commands, Guard Bri- gades, Flotilla and Croatian Coast Guard, Air Force, Special Operations Forces Com- mand, etc.). The Armed Forces Institutional Compo- nent will be composed of organizational units whose purpose is to build capabili- ties or support capability building of the Operational Component (Support Com- mands, Military Schools, Training Centers, Service Units, etc.). In the following period the Armed Forces will implement reorganization measures in order to downsize their administrative and command structure in relation to the oper- ational forces. Through functional integra- tion or separation of organizational units, the Armed Forces will consolidate and/or establish new organizational units, create a more efficient command structure and achieve decentralization of the command system. Special Operations Battalion will be reor- ganized into the Special Operations Forc- es Command in order to fulfill the commit- ment to improve capabilities to conduct special operations. Croatian Army Military Police Regiment (Land Forces) and Military Police platoons (the Croatian Navy, Air Force and Air De- fense) will be reorganized and combined into a single General Staff sub-staff unit. The Personnel Management Center will be extracted from the Support Command unit. It will be reorganized as a General Staff sub-staff unit. V. ARMED FORCES ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 The Croatian Army Signal Regiment will be reorganized as a General Staff sub- staff unit and redesigned as the Center for Communication and Information Systems. Signal Battalion will become a subordinate unit under the command of the Army Com- mander. The Center for Electronic Reconnaissance as a General Staff sub-staff unit and a part of the Croatian Army Military Intelligence Battalion will be reorganized and combined into a General Staff sub-staff unit rede- signed as the Intelligence Operations Cent- er. The remainder of the Croatian Army Military Intelligence Battalion will be reor- ganized and become a part of the Guard Brigade Military Intelligence Companies. By the end of 2017 the reorganized Armed Forces will comprise up to 15,000 employ- ees and up to 400 military Cadets. The current Branch and Service structure of the Armed Forces will be basically re- tained, apart from downsizing and organi- zational changes referred to above. The Armed Forces will consist of the Croatian Army (CA), Croatian Navy (CN), Croatian Air Force and Air Defense (CAF&AD), Croatian Defense Academy (CDA), Support Com- mand (SC), Special Operations Forces Command (SOFCOM), Court Martial (CM), Military Representations (MRs) and the fol- lowing Sub-Staff Units (SSUs): • Intelligence Operations Center (IOC), • Military Police Regiment (MPR), • Honor Guard Battalion (HGB), • Center for Communication and Informa- tion Systems (CCIS), • Personnel Management Center (PMC) • CAF General Staff Support Unit (CAF GS SU). ARMED FORCES STRUCTURE Based on the findings and recommenda- tions of the Strategic Defense Review, the Armed Forces Organizational Structure will be formed as shown in Figure 1. CAF General Staff (CAF GS) is a joint body of the Croatian Armed Forces organ- ized within the Ministry of Defense. It has a responsibility to prepare command, use and employ the Armed Forces. Figure 1: CAF Organizational Structure 25 CAF Service Commands have a respon- sibility to enable the functioning of the CAF Services and to prepare subordinate com- mands and units to carry out their tasks. Service commands participate in profes- sional development and have a responsibil- ity to provide training for Active Duty and Reserve personnel. Croatian Defense Academy (CDA) pro- vides military education for Armed Forces requirements. It is responsible for conduct- ing scientific research and publishing ac- tivities. Support Command (SC) provides contin- ued logistics, medical and other support to CAF commands and units when executing their tasks at home and abroad. It also pro- vides functional training to CAF members in the field of Logistics. Special Operations Forces Command (SOFCOM) plans and conducts special operations and activities in order to sup- port and protect national interests. The Special Operations Forces Command will be responsible for training and equipping Special Operations Forces, doctrine devel- opment and it will also coordinate prepara- tions for Special Operations training. Military Representations (MRs) repre- sent the Croatian Armed Forces and per- form other professional tasks related to participation in the activities and supervi- sion of different Boards, Working Groups, Standing and Interim bodies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Eu- ropean Union, the Allied Command Op- erations (ACO) and the Allied Command Transformation (ACT). Court Martial (MC) represents an auton- omous and independent body who decides on disciplinary liability of CAF members for committing a disciplinary offence and ma- terial liability of CAF members. It will con- sist of General Court Martial in Zagreb and District Courts Martial in Osijek and Split. Sub-Staff Units are established for the purpose of developing capabilities to carry out different tasks and support activities that other CAF components, due to its specificity or scope, cannot provide within their organic entities. CAF General Staff Croatian Armed Forces General Staff will be organized into the following organiza- tional units shown in Figure 2. The Chief of the General Staff is the Head of the CAF General Staff. He is superior to commands, units and institutions of the Armed Forces, the Croatian Military Rep- resentative to NATO and the EU as part of the Permanent Representation of Croatia to NATO, the Croatian National Military Figure 2: The CAF General Staff structure T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Representative to Allied Command Op- erations (ACO) and the Allied Command Transformation (ACT). The Chief of the General Staff is the prin- cipal Military Advisor to the Croatian Presi- dent and Croatian Defense Minister. The Chief of the General Staff reports to the Croatian President for execution of orders and decisions. He reports to the Croatian Defense Minister for execution of decisions and informs both (the President and the Minister) regarding their execution under the provisions of the Defense Law. The Chief of the General Staff can trans- fer parts of command authority to Deputy Chief of the General Staff and/or Director of the General Staff. The Chief of General Staff has a Deputy who performs the duties of the Chief of the General Staff in the event of his ab- sence. The Director of the General Staff is directly in charge of the General Staff Directorates. He performs the duties of the Chief of the General Staff in the event of his or his Dep- uty’s absence. Advisor to the Chief of the General Staff for Health Affairs is the principal advisor to the Chief of the General Staff for all mat- ters related to force health protection and medical support. He is responsible for doc- trinal organization and functioning of the CAF Health Care service. The CAF Command Sergeant Major is di- rectly responsible to the Chief of the Gen- eral Staff for performance and develop- ment of the NCO Corps. He participates in directing professional development of privates, Seamen and NCOs. The Cabinet of the Chief of the General Staff is organized to create the necessary preconditions for the regular performance of official duties of the Chief of the Gen- eral Staff, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Director of the General Staff, Advi- sor for Health Affairs and CAF Command Sergeant Major. The Command Operations Center (COS) has a command authority over assigned forces in Peace Support Operations abroad and in providing of assistance to civilian in- stitutions and population affected by natu- ral, technical and technological disasters, also in ecological incidents, Search and Rescue operations, firefighting activities and transportation of the sick or injured people in accordance with the approved Plans for Employment of the Croatian Armed Forces and Executive Orders issued by the Chief of the General Staff. It is also responsible for preparing Orders and de- velopment of other implementation docu- ments required for CAF functioning. The Command Operations Center is headed by a commander who exercises command over a part of the Croatian Armed Forces placed under his authority. The Military Police Division (MPD) is re- sponsible for military police activities. It is headed by Chief of Division who manages the Military Police Division, organizes and conducts its activities. The CAF General Staff has directorates that are responsible for doctrinal organization of a certain functional area. They provide direction for and supervise its functioning. 27 Further development of functional areas will result in the development of a Func- tional Management Model that will enable Chiefs of the General Staff Directorates who are responsible for certain functional areas to serve as commanders of the Gen- eral Staff Sub-Staff units that are respon- sible for task execution in the particular functional area. This model will enable a reduction in the number of executive com- mand functions. The General Staff Sub-Staff Units The General Staff Sub-Staff units will be organized into the following organizational units shown in Figure 3. Intelligence Operations Center will continue to conduct strategic electronic surveillance for the purposes of Security and Intelligence Agencies of the Republic of Croatia in accordance with the Secu- rity and Intelligence System Act, and will provide joint intelligence support to the Croatian Armed Forces in carrying out peacetime tasks and in the execution of combat and non-combat operations.

Personnel Management Center will carry out personnel management tasks, such as managing Active Duty military, Re- serve and Conscript personnel in accord- ance with the conceptual organization of functional areas, particularly in the area of recruitment, duty assignment and develop- ment, and to some extent in the area of personnel support in peacetime, war and non-war operations. CAF General Staff Support Unit will provide transportation, administrative and logistics support to the CAF General Staff. In accordance with their functional areas, the General Staff Directorates and the Mil- itary Police Division will coordinate, direct and carry out joint tasks as provided in the planning documents. They will supervise the work and activities of Sub-Staff units (Figure 4) as follows: • Personnel Directorate – Personnel Man- agement Center; • Intelligence Directorate – Intelligence Operations Center; • CIS Directorate – Center for Communica- tion and Information Systems; • Military Police Division – Military Police Regiment. Figure 4: The CAF command relationships and authority 29 The chain of command in peacetime and during CAF employment and assistance (participation in Peace Support Operations, man-made, technical or natural disasters, etc.) is shown in Figure 5. The CAF Command and Control System will be able to plan and execute operations in accordance with the plans for CAF us- age and employment. It will enable man- agement of everyday activities in the CAF organizational units. The Chief of the General Staff can trans- fer his authority of operational and tactical command and control over CAF units and members in Peace Support Operations, Crisis Response Operations and Humani- tarian Operations. CAF services will train and equip individual members, units and task forces to carry out their tasks in certain geographic areas (land, sea or air). Their primary task is to maintain the operational units’ necessary level of readiness. Command and Control System will not undergo any significant changes in opera- tions conducted to defend Croatia’s terri- torial integrity, sovereignty and independ- ence by employing its own forces or with the assistance of Allies. The Task Force Command will be established from the CAF Figure 5: The Chain of Command in Peacetime and during CAF employment and assistance T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Service Commands, the Support Command and the Special Operations Forces Com- mand in order to plan and conduct joint operations.

Situation in the Area of Human Resources One of the main characteristics of the area of Human Potentials is harmoniza- tion of the personnel structure aimed to create an optimal ratio of officers, NCOs and Soldiers/Seamen in addition to down- sizing the number of civil employees. Planned admission provides for gradual improvement of the age structure of the Active Duty military personnel. Obligatory conscription has been suspend- ed since the year 2008 and Voluntary con- scription has been established. However, the annual number of voluntary conscripts (from 500 to 800) is significantly smaller compared to the planned (2000), primarily due to the insufficient funds. A new personnel category of Military Spe- cialists has been introduced through the system in early 2014 whereas Contract and Mobilization Reserve are being established. The system of Deployment to Internation- al Operations and appointments to duties abroad has been established at satisfac- tory level. The portion of female officers in Active Duty military composition has reached the targeted strength of 10% (on June 1, 2014 a total of 10.34%, female officers 15.66%, female NCOs 11.27%, and female Soldiers 5.71% respectively). Designated strength of the Armed forces amounts to a total of 17,504 Active Duty military personnel and 1,905 civil employ- ees. The real strength as of January 1, 2014 is shown in the following table. Direction of Human Resources Development Targeted Personnel Strength and Structure Total targeted strength of the Armed Forces is 15,000 employees (Active Duty military personnel and Civil employees) and up to 400 Cadets by the end 2017. Of the stated number there will be 14,380 Active Duty military personnel and 620 civil employees. By the end of the year 2020 a ratio from 1: 3 to 1: 5 should be VI.

Within the category of Active Duty mili- tary personnel a newly established sub- category of Military Specialists will be fully developed. Their career will be regu- lated by separate regulations and a spe- cial system of salaries will be established for them. This way the need to staff es- pecially demanding positions with experts will be solved. In the first part of the planning period up to 2,000 conscripts annually will undergo voluntary military training for the purpose of manning Active Duty personnel posi- tions and Assigned Reserve. That number will be increased respectively as required for manning Active Duty component and Assigned Reserve. With the aim to provide for manning Active Duty military composition with officers, up to 400 Cadets will receive education at the CDA study programs in accordance with requirements of the Branches and Services of the Armed Forces.

Reserve component will be formed of the Contract and Mobilization Reserve that will provide for growth of the Forces. Part of the Active Duty military personnel will be deployed to additional duties, ful- filling the key organizational positions in Reserve units in conformity with the War- time Formation. Contracted reserve will fulfill insufficient Military-Occupational Specialties that are not adequate or cost-effective for organi- zation in Active Duty composition. A part of the Contract Reserve members will be assigned to organizational positions in Re- serve units, as required. Mobilization Reserve will be formed of the Assigned and Non-assigned reserve. Assigned reserve will be formed of the conscripts assigned to Military Occupa- tional Specialty, after conscription, volun- tary military training or Active Duty mili- tary service. Non-assigned Reserve members will be listed in military records and in the case of required development of Defense Capa- bilities; they will have to undergo medical examinations and evaluation of their capa- Figure 12: Organizational chart of the Assigned Reserve. bility for military service. They will also be able to enter Active Duty military service. Engagement of the Reserve component will result in growth of the overall De- fense Capabilities of the Armed Forces to conduct missions and tasks at home and abroad. Contracted and Assigned reserve mem- bers will be evaluated during training and execution of duties and will be upgraded or rather promoted to higher rank. A special concept of military education will be developed for Contracted and As- signed Reserve members (for candidates for Reserve Officers and NCOs, for Re- serve Officers and NCOs, as well as for more demanding Military Occupational Specialties). For requirements of the Reserve Compo- nent, the Armed Forces will keep/store weapons and equipment. Contracted Reserve Contract Reserve will number up to 1,000 members, and for the most part it will comprise of organizational positions for specific Military Occupational Specialties indispensable for conduct of operations that, for some particular reasons, are not suitable for manning Active Duty military component of the Armed Forces. These will mainly be highly specialized medical personnel for ROLE-2 and other person- 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 2. INFANTRY REGIMENT LOGISTICS REGIMENT ENGINEERING BATTALIONAD REGIMENT ARTILLERY- MISSILE REGIMENT 49 nel, as required. Top sportsmen will be in- cluded in Contracted Reserve. Recruitment of the Contracted Reserve will be carried out for requirements of the Armed Forces. Upon selection, the Ministry of Defense will sign a contract with Con- tracted Reserve that will regulate rights and duties of the Contracted Reserve member. Appropriate compensation will be given to Contracted Reserve members in conformity with the signed contract. Training of the Contracted Reserve mem- bers will be organized and exercised in the Armed Forces and Contracted Reserve will participate in the organizational structure of the Armed Forces units, in missions and tasks at home and abroad. Assigned Reserve Assigned Reserve will be formed of the draftees who underwent training for Military Occupational Specialty during conscription, voluntary military training, in Active Duty military service or through some other forms of in-service train- ing. Of the total number of Assigned Reserve members, 20,000 of them will be assigned to Reserve Units (Infan- try, Artillery, Air Defense and Logistics regiments, Engineering and Signal Bat- talions) deployed to the territory of the Republic of Croatia. Training of the Assigned Reserve will be organized and exercised in the Armed Forces. Together with other organization- al units of the Armed Forces, Assigned Reserve will participate in conduct of the missions and tasks in our country. Non-Assigned Reserve Non-assigned Reserve will be formed of draftees listed in military records (who were not conscripts and did not undergo voluntary training). Only in the case of the required growth of the Armed Forces, their capabili- ties will be evaluated; they will undergo train- ing and enter Active Duty military service. Calling up of the Non-assigned Reserve will be carried out when professional composition and Assigned Reserve would not be sufficient to conduct missions and tasks in our country. Non-assigned Re- serve will take part in conduct of the mis- sions and tasks of the Armed Forces in our country. It will not be organized within mobilization-development of the Armed Forces nor will organizational positions of the Non-assigned Reserve be shown in Organizational Structure of the units and commands of the Armed Forces. Improvements Personnel Management Based on the analysis of the existing organizational framework and competences in Personnel Management, a more efficient and more simplified business processes and intensified procedures will be es- tablished in order to eliminate overlaps. Management of civilian and military personnel will be improved by introduction of the Long-Term Personnel Planning based on available fi- nancial resources and on principles of equal opportunities and on clearly established standards and incentives for Professional Development. Consistent, measurable and transparent criteria of advancement and retention in service will be established and applied as well as efficient protection from violation of individual rights. Career advancement of Active Duty military personnel will be harmonized with requirements of the future strength and structure of the Armed Forces. Participation in Allied and other international operations will become an inseparable part of professional obligations and requirements. In- stead of the previous voluntary nature of participation, future partici- pation will be determined by the requirements of the Service.

This model pre- sents a combination of the modified and upgraded ‘’Cadet’’ model, granting schol- arships in support of lacking Services and Occupations, admission from labor mar- ket, admission among employees from the category of NCOs and contract soldiers/ seamen, education in foreign countries. The possibility of contract based admis- sion will also be taken into consideration. Soldiers/seamen will be, as so far, admit- ted to Contract service and NCOs solely from the ranks of the best soldiers/sea- men who served at least one contract. Standards for professional/contract sol- dier/seaman will be defined taking into ac- count the heterogeneity of requirements and obligations resulting from missions of individual services of the Armed Forces, operations in international environment and roles of the Armed Forces in society. Stimulating measures will be developed for unavailable, i.e., critical specialties of Active Duty military personnel aimed at more efficient attraction/recruitment and retention in service. A particular status and consideration will be given to the phy- sicians, that is, to a model of attraction and retention that will be established and suitable for requirements of the military system and specific characteristics of the medical profession. Up to 100 NCOs, 350 to 1000 soldiers/ seamen and up to 80 officers will be annu- ally admitted in service. Annual number for admission of Cadets and Contract Reserve will be established according to require- ments for individual occupations and ca- pacities of education. The number of con- scripts will be up to 2,000 annually with increase in the second part of the planning period for the manning purposes of the Active Duty military composition and As- signed Reserve. Personnel who underwent military training or have given up Active Duty military service will enter Assigned Reserve on annual basis, and an equal number will be discharged. Exceptionally, a minimal number of candidates for officer and NCO duties of military specialists will be admitted directly from labor market and this will apply also to civil employees. Professional Development Professional Development of Active Duty military personnel during their service will be based on training and education, car- rying out of duty, and continuous life-long learning and self-development. Education- al system will be harmonized with national educational standards and with NATO rec- ommendations. Advancement in service will be based on acquiring new knowledge and skills that will be evaluated, on build- ing and maintaining capabilities that are necessary for carrying out duties at higher level. The existing system of Military-oc- cupational specialties will be upgraded in support of development. Personnel Support Particular attention will be paid to quality of living and the implementation of spe- cific measures in the area of Support to Readiness, Welfare and Recreation of the members of the Armed Forces and protec- tion of their rights. That will contribute to attracting and retaining quality-personnel as well as development and maintenance of appropriate organizational culture that should be monitored and systematically 51 built. In the forthcoming period, in the area of Personnel Support projects will be implemented with the aim to provide for conditions that can guarantee reten- tion and attraction of quality, qualified and motivated personnel. The existing systems of selection, monitoring the state of per- sonnel and support will be improved and upgraded, respecting medical, psychologi- cal and physical requirements and its sci- entific and professional foundation. Through direct cooperation with Religious communities/unions and on the basis of signed Agreements, the implementation of the policy of openness in the area of spir- itual guidance will continue, ensuring the freedom of religious expression and reali- zation of the members’ spiritual needs. Health Care Health care of the employees of the Minis- try of Defense and members of the Armed Forces will be developed within the inte- gral Health Care System of the Republic of Croatia and will be implemented through the system of Medical Support as part of the comprehensive system of logistics support of the Armed Forces. Military Health Centre of the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, as a military health institution, will provide health care to employees of the Ministry of Defense and members of the Armed Forces at pri- mary level. Health care of the employees of the Ministry of Defense and members of the Armed Forces not provided by capaci- ties of the Armed Forces will be provided by the Public Health Service or through the network of Occupational Medicine physi- cians in the Republic of Croatia. In operations abroad, Health Care of the members of the Armed Forces shall be provided and implemented through their own system of medical support and will also relay on Allied forces and their capa- bilities, based on contracts and technical agreements. Transition and Separation of Personnel The specificity and complexity of the military service will be followed by solutions that provide Active Duty military personnel retirement un- der the special conditions, which should go side by side with quality preparation for leaving the service, while respecting the principles of equality and fairness. In order to achieve the strength of the Armed Forces of 15,000 employ- ees and up to 400 Cadets that was also planned in the Strategic De- fense Review from the year 2013, the planned downsizing has already begun in the year 2014. Within this downsizing about 4,200 Active Duty military personnel and 1,500 civil employees will be separated by the end of 2017. Separation of civil employees will be mostly carried out through outsourcing of the jobs of Supply and Maintenance of military locations and structures and Logistic services in barracks. The program for preparation of the personnel for separation will be further developed. The program of transition and separation of the Con- tract Soldiers/Seamen who will be discharged from military service af- ter one, two or three contracts will be developed. Moreover, special pro- gram of transition of civil employees will be taken into consideration.

T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Demands placed before the Armed Forc- es and the entire Defense Sector involve training of the personnel for undertaking actions in the new and increasingly com- plex circumstances, intricate/complicated Defense and Security structures and new technologies. Therefore, training of the new and in-service training of the existing personnel in the field of Defense and Se- curity is of primary importance. Having in mind the vision of the Armed Forces where the military profession is being developed in accordance with the high professional principle, expertise and social responsibil- ity, education for the needs of the Armed Forces and the Defense Sector respective- ly, as well as activities within the Science Sector -represent the core areas of the Long Term Development Plan. This Plan is oriented towards increasing the quality of military education at all lev- els and categories of personnel. However, the capability to execute various programs of training has already been developed to a great extent, as e.g., Military-Occupa- tional Training of NCOs and soldiers, vari- ous forms of functional training, learning foreign languages, etc., and the emphasis is placed on activities within higher level of education and science for requirements of the Armed Forces and the Defense Sector. Higher Military Education and Science In the period comprised within this Plan, higher education for defense require- ments will be transformed. This process will be implemented in three phases: 1. The first phase will establish Under- graduate university study programs within Croatian Defense Academy, in cooperation with and in conformity with regulations that govern the Sci- entific Sector and higher education in the Republic of Croatia or rather Bologna Process. The academic year 2014/2015 begun with the implemen- tation of two Undergraduate Study programs - Military Engineering and VII. EDUCATION AND SCIENCE 55 Military Leadership and Management that will include the current program of Basic Officer Education. Afterwards, two Undergraduate Study programs for requirements of the Croatian Navy will be established (Military Nautical Science and Military Marine Engineer- ing), and one Undergraduate Study for requirements of the Croatian Air Force and Air Defense (Military Aerospace Engineering). Development of these programs would place emphasis on de- velopment of Basic Military Competen- cies and adoption of the Officer’s Code of Conduct by future Officers. Through the influence and contribution of the educative component of the Program, Officers will be prepared to respond to future challenges of the security envi- ronment. 2. In the second phase, also in coopera- tion with the University community, study programs at Undergraduate level will be established. They will comprise the current program of inter service Command and Staff education and Mil- itary Occupational Specialty education for Officers in functional area, and pro- grams at Post-graduate level that will comprise the former program of stra- tegic education (War College). These study programs will be established in the year 2018. 3. In the third phase, by the year 2020 at the latest, higher education for defense requirements at the Petar Zrinski CDA will be institutionalized, i.e., Croatian Defense Academy as an institution of higher level education and scientific- research institution organized in con- formity with regulations governing higher education and scientific activi- ties in the Republic of Croatia. This process will be followed by further in- vestments that will upgrade the standard of living and work of the students at all levels of education. Selection and education of the teach- ing cadre represents the key element for implementation of all study programs, stimulation for earning higher academic degrees, selection to scientific-teaching and teaching professions and creating conditions to retain scientific-teaching cadre within Defense Sector. Programs of Education and Training with other governmental bodies will concurrently be developed, focused on achieving capa- bility for common response to challenges and threats, joint participation in opera- tions and assistance to civilian institutions. In addition to meeting the defense needs and to ensure the high-quality, also the mobility of the personnel from military environment to civilian and vice versa is being achieved in this manner. Higher lev- el of education for Defense requirements should be organized in a way to provide training to future officers of the Croatian Armed Forces and more broadly, for ex- perts in the Ministry of Defense and other government bodies whose activities are related to Defense and National Security, researchers in scientific research institu- tions and research institutions who con- duct research in the field of Defense, and other entities outside the State adminis- tration system. Furthermore, partner relations with edu- cational institutions in other countries, primarily with NATO and the EU will be developed. These will provide for acquiring new knowledge, skills and capabilities that will contribute to more efficient develop- ment of the Armed Forces and fulfillment of their basic missions and assignments. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Institutionalization of education for De- fense and Security requirements accord- ing to principles that govern scientific ac- tivities and higher level of education in the Republic of Croatia has created presump- tions for a greater degree of integration and compatibility with NATO institutions and programs, harmonization with stand- ards of the Bologna Process and use of NATO and EU resources. In the recent years NATO has undertaken important steps directed towards har- monization of the education and training in educational institutions of the NATO member and Partner countries with stand- ards of the Bologna Process. The goal of these processes is to improve quality in education and training, as well as confidence and transparency, both among the states and within the states between the Armed Forces and society. Harmonization of the education for De- fense requirements in NATO member states with Bologna Process presumes that Defense educational institutions are integrated in scientific-educational sys- tems of their countries. Attainment of the goals of this Plan provides for efficient ap- plication of the mechanisms developed to upgrade the quality of education, enable mobility of students and teachers and contribute to mutual confidence. Examples of such mechanisms are represented by: • ERASMUS, educational program of the European Union for promotion of mobil- ity of the European students and profes- sors that has become a core factor in in- ternationalization and ‘Europeanization’ of higher education in European Union. • European Initiative for Exchange of Young Officers Inspired by Erasmus Program (“Military Erasmus”) – a concept aimed at improving quality of education and train- ing of the military personnel in the EU member countries. As a general goal of the “Military Erasmus” prominence is giv- en to increased interoperability among European Armed Forces, development of the Common Security culture and shar- ing of same values. • European Defense Agency (EDA) with numerous programs that include educa- tional component. • European Security and Defense College (ESDC) as a platform for connecting and networking of the institutions of higher level education for Defense and Security requirements of member states. • NATO Security through Science Pro- gramme that contributes to security, stability and solidarity by application of science in problem solving. • NATO concept of the Centers of Excel- lence that provides for development of expert opinions in areas that are of core importance for the Alliance, and in which a single nation can give its most visible contribution. Scientific-research activity (work) will be primarily developed within Croatian De- fense Academy. Strengthening scientific- 57 teaching potentials concurrently develops the capability of implementation of the study programs, as well as the capability of conducting scientific-research activity, particularly in areas of special interest, such as military technology, strategy re- search and military history. In the other segment, Scientific and Re- search activities will enhance the devel- opment of the functions of articulating directions and the need for Research and Development, whereas implementation will be provided in cooperation with re- search potentials of the civilian sector. Cooperation will be established with sci- entific institutions within their scope of work and activities during implementation of Research and Development projects needed in Defense field. They will contrib- ute to development of the studies and ex- pert opinions. Research and development for defense requirements will be directed toward a specific purpose and in support of development of the core capabilities. Lifelong Education and Military Vocational Training Acquiring competencies should be a con- tinuous process, made relevant through activities of all forms of learning during life time and aimed to upgrade knowledge, skills, independence and responsibility for professional, social and personal require- ments. Development of an individual dur- ing his/her working life in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces should be, not only in function of upgrading overall capabilities, but also in acquiring compe- tence that can be used for the well-being of the entire society. It is possible that an individual acquires competencies and continues to develop at the end of his/her military career through use of supportive Transition programs. Requirements for implementation of mili- tary education in support of professional development, particularly officer’s, are significantly greater than the present ca- pacities. Therefore, the level of capabilities necessary to increase the level needed for enhancement of the present educational capacities will be continually developed. For requirements of manning Reserve units in the later planning period, education of Reserve officers and NCOs will be initiated. Learning foreign languages will be intensi- fied, both within capacities of the Armed Forces (Foreign Language Centre, Foreign Languages Training in units), and through civilian capacities. Equipping units with multimedia language classrooms will also be continued. Validation of the Training efficiency in com- parison to operational/working require- ments will be carried out on regular basis.

Education and Science Area Tasks Review 59 Training Training in the Armed forces will be im- plemented on the single doctrinal princi- ples, regardless of whether it is training for execution of tasks in our country or for participation in international Peace Sup- port Operations, and it will focus towards development and maintenance of the ca- pabilities of professional composition and for practice of the Reserve as a basis for growth of the Forces. Training priorities in this planning period will be put on development and mainte- nance of the capabilities for defense of the national territory and implementation of the NATO Capability Targets in order to ensure capabilities for participation in on-going operations and to maintain the Level of Ambition regarding participation of the deployable forces in NRF and EUBG and other UN/NATO/EU forces. Interoper- ability and development of the operational capabilities aimed to ensure elements of Combat Readiness for possible operations have remained the main training objec- tives. Interoperability will be achieved through joint training and exercises with Allies and declared forces will join NATO components and formations. Special em- phasis will be placed on participation of the members and units of the Armed forc- es in various forms of multinational train- ing and practice at all levels. These will provide intellectual, procedural and techni- cal interoperability and cohesion with Al- lied forces. Training will have an important role in support to multinational and regional co- operation. Stability and good neighborly relations will be strengthened through training, by focusing on support to coun- tries from the Region that expressed in- terest in joining into NATO and/or EU, passing on their own experiences. Focus will also be placed on development of the capabilities to provide support to civilian institutions in natural, technical and tech- nological disasters. Development of the Training System and Improvement of Training Infrastructure The organization, contents, standards and methodology of implementing training will be affected by reform of the Armed Forc- es, application of modern techniques and technologies that are being introduced gradually and by establishment of Re- serve composition training. New training programs will be developed in conform- ity with tactical-technical requirements of the new equipment and contemporary tactics, techniques and procedures. Further development and adoption of new VIII. TRAINING AND DOCTRINE T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 methods and equipping with new training assets (simulators, simulations, modern shooting ranges, drill grounds and other training facilities) will reduce training costs. However, high level of realism and challenge will be retained. Capabilities that are not cost-effective or do not have relevance of being developed or main- tained independently, will be developed within NATO initiatives and projects and in cooperation with partners. For the purpose of development of capa- bilities of the Armed Forces, the projects of equipping, modernization and construc- tion will be aimed towards development of the training infrastructure and procure- ment of training aids and assets, mainly simulators and simulation systems. Drill grounds and shooting ranges will be built for individual and joint training up to the level of platoon/company for weap- ons/firearms handling. Barracks will also be equipped with labs and training simulators. Conditions will be created for distance learning aimed to accelerate gaining of new knowledge and skills and faster exchange of information. Equipping and modernization projects of the training infrastructure will be devel- oped as a integral part of the develop- ment projects for the barracks and mili- tary training areas, taking into account the type, kind and required operational capabilities of the units. Projects will also include requests for development of the training infrastructure that are based on Allied documents and international agree- ments. Individual Training The goal of individual training will be train- ing for a prompt and qualified inclusion in unit’s training at all levels, integration of gained knowledge and skills into multi- branch training and taking over the role of trainers. It is expected of each individual to adapt to technological progress and changes in security environment. The fo- cus of individual training will be training aimed at gaining personal Military-Occu- pational Specialty. Manning of the Armed Forces that is based on voluntary principle enables train- ing with motivated personnel and an easi- er achievement of the training goals. Basic military training will be exercised through voluntary training for all categories of military personnel. The goal of conduct- ing voluntary military training is to gain basic military knowledge and skills and to improve physical and psychological readi- ness for service in the Armed Forces. Training for personal Military Occupation- al Specialty (MOS) will be organized in the following manner: • Branch Specialty Training of the Croa- tian Army will be organized in centers 61 and branch units of the Croatian Army, • Branch Specialty Training and special- ties of the Croatian Navy within techni- cal service will be conducted at the Navy Training Centre, • Branch Specialty Training and techni- cal service of the Croatian Air Force and Air Defense will be carried out in the Air Force Training Centre, • for acquiring Military Occupational Specialty of the Support services and occupations, logistics training will be organized in the Logistics Training and Doctrine Center, • for acquiring Military Occupational Spe- cialty of the Signal branch, training will be organized in the CIS Centre and at the Signal Battalion of the Croatian Army, • for acquiring Military Occupational Spe- cialty of the Military-Intelligence branch, training will be organized in the Centre for Intelligence Operations • for acquiring Military Occupational Spe- cialty of the MP branch training will be organized in the Military Police Regiment. Centers and branch units that conduct individual training for acquiring MOS in the branches/support services are also responsible for implementing functional courses and other forms of training of Sol- diers/Seamen, NCOs and officers for the purpose of their professional development in the branch/support service. Collective Training Collective training (Commander train- ing, Staff training, and unit training) of all levels will be mission focused and based on doctrine and experiences of the pre- sent time operations. The goal will be to attain excellence of the unit as a whole and readiness for active participation within the higher level of units. Efficiency of joint training will be provided through further equipping with modern teaching assets and aids, development of training infrastructure at barracks, drill grounds, shooting ranges and training areas and upgraded training for Commander and Staff. An integrated environment will cre- ate conditions for realistic evaluation and certification of the units designated for participation in NATO-led operations and exercises. Joint Training Joint training will be oriented towards training of the Commands for planning, conduct and participation in joint opera- tions. Single Commands, units, groups and individuals will be trained and prepared accordingly for efficient planning, organi- zation and participation in joint systems. General Staff will lead the joint training in the Armed Forces and it will be carried out through joint exercises. Training Doctrine of the Armed Forces will be revised with the particular emphasis on further decentralization of training. Reserve Training Training of Reserve units will be managed according to the same standards as training of the professional composition, with the em- ployment of the same doctrine and training process. It will differ only in various degrees of readiness for conduct of the mission. Focus of the Contract Reserve training will be on an individual, or rather refresher training and maintaining of individual capabilities and skills and on pre-deployment training for Peace Support Operations. Individual training of the Assigned Reserve will be focused on refresher training of basic soldier’s skills and maintaining of the training for Mili- tary Occupational Specialty, especially of the critical ones. Training of the units will be concentrated on firing and tactical tasks of the squads and platoons in addition to conduct of tactical exercises. Training of the Non-assigned reserve will be composed according to train- ing phases for development of individual capabilities and skills, mainly basic military skills and training for Military Occupational Specialty. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Doctrine Doctrine represents the doctrinal foundation and fundamental princi- ples of operations and a guide for the military forces in support of national goals. It deals with missions, functions and capabilities and represents a common frame of reference for operations that are con- ducted or could be conducted in the very near future. Although this doctrine should be seen in its entirety, and not only as a publication alone, in this planning period the emphasis will be placed on doctrinal organization of the entire system that will be obtained through con- sistent doctrinal hierarchy, from the top to the bottom. This will ensure consistency in using unified terminology and harmonization of doctri- nal standpoints at all levels. In conformity with defined hierarchy of doctrinal publications, the process of developing Joint, Functional and Service doctrinal publications will con- tinue. This will also apply to publications that, in terms of their content, are aimed at integral understanding of military terms and symbols. Joint and Service doctrinal publications will describe the use of opera- tional component of the Armed Forces in operations (campaigns, major operations and tactical activities), whereas preparation of the Armed Forces will be standardized through administrative, technical, training and teaching publications. An exception is Training Doctrine that will, although it belongs to the field of preparation of the Armed Forces, be included in doctrine hierarchy due to the commitment that we will conduct training in the manner we conduct operations. By the year 2017 Joint and Service doctri- nal publications will be prepared - ZDP-1: Croatian Armed Forces Doctrine (2nd edi- tion), ZDP-10: Human Resource Manage- ment, ZDP-35: Special Operations, ZDP- 36: Psychological Operations, ZDP-40: Logistics Support Doctrine, ZDP-70: Train- ing, DPM-100: Maritime Doctrine, DPK- 200: Land Forces Doctrine, ZDP-S: Mili- tary Symbols, ZDP-30: Joint Operations, ZDP-50: Operations Planning, and ZDP-60: Communication and Information Systems. Drafting and adoption of doctrinal and other publications will be in function of establishing procedures and processes in the Armed Forces that are not regulated by legislative or by-law provisions. Development of the branch doctrinal pub- lications, particularly those that prescribe tactics, techniques and procedures of single commands and units, falls solely within na- tional jurisdiction, while individuals, units and temporary compositions that have been pre- paring for participation in NATO Command Structure and Force Structure and NATO led operations will use original NATO doctrine. By the year 2020 publications will be de- veloped for operations of Naval, Land and Air Forces or their parts in support of joint operations, functional joint concepts and service doctrinal publications for staff func- tions and tactics of the units and employ- ment of the units of service support. Guidance given through doctrinal publica- tions will be built into teaching and train- ing processes. In that manner, in addition to adoption and understanding doctrinal principles, their feasibility and application in practice will be verified. Lessons Learned The process of recognizing, processing and applying positive experiences/best practices in the Armed Forces is distinc- tive to a military organization and it is one of the obligations of the Command- ers and Heads of the organizational units at all levels. In the forthcoming period, the system of Lessons Learned with clearly defined tasks, competencies and respon- sibilities will be established in terms of or- ganization and its structure. In development of the Lessons Learned System, focus will be on establishment of the processes, building structure and de- velopment of tools at all levels that will contribute to enhancement of the interop- erability of forces, or rather overall develop- ment of the Armed Forces’ capabilities. 63 PRIORITY LEVEL PLANNING PERIOD I.

LESSONS LEARNED By the end of 2017 By the end of 2020 By the end of 2024 To build the capability for Lessons Learned that con- sists of: - establishment of the process - building structure - development of the tools in support to the process that enables monitoring of the development of observa- tion into recognized and learned lesson: - Lessons Learned database (LLDB) - gateway for exchange of Lessons Learned To establish business processes in the field of Lessons Learned, to simplify procedures and to remove excessive complexity, over- lapping and lengthiness of the observation process and to bring forward and deter- mine the model of observa- tion (2015). To increase the number of Staff Officers for Lessons Learned, to plan positions in new organization for Staff Officers for Lessons Learned to the level of independent battalion (by the end of 2018). To maintain the achieved capability for Lessons Learned and to establish a Learning Organization, Knowledge Management from the scope of its work and from experi- ences of other organiza- tional entities and from other NATO members. To insert in the Curricula at all levels of sequential-pro- gressive education contents of familiarization with the process of Lessons Learned and thus upgrade the level of training for conduct, par- ticipation and monitoring the process of Lessons Learned To advance and upgrade the Lessons Learned Database (transition to Shared Point), for monitor- ing the state and develop- ment of the observation into Lessons Learned (by the end of 2018). To introduce Long-Term Planning based on realisti- cally available funds for implementation and applica- tion of the Lessons Learned System (2015). 65 Despite improvements that have been made in single areas in recent years, in reference to implemented projects of Equipping and Modernization, material as- sets and equipment at the disposal of the Armed Forces are at present partly obso- lete. That affects efficiency and hinders full interoperability with the Allies. Due to the complex process of procurement and modernization and lengthy service life of the weaponry and military equipment, decisions that are made regarding Equip- ping and Modernization of the Armed Forc- es will significantly affect capabilities in the forthcoming 30 years and more. Limited funds for defense requirements have resulted in decisions on retaining or abandoning certain capabilities. Some of the capabilities have already been sig- nificantly limited and without new invest- ments in Equipment or Modernization, they would practically be lost. With the aim to retain key capabilities and bear- ing in mind the uncertainty of long-term challenges of the Security environment, plans will also be developed for Equipping and Modernization to begin at the end of the planning period. Their completion and financial effect mostly extend to the next planning period. Projects that are singled out due to their high financial demands and due to the importance of the capa- bilities that are realized within them are: 1. Croatian Army a. Armored Vehicles • A total of 48 tanks will be retained in operational use in the Armed Forces and they will be subjected to revision process; one Tank Company will be modernized; • End of equipping and phasing into op- erational use of the APC Patria with other weapon and military systems (anti-armor system, remote weapon station of 30 mm, communication equipment); • Maintenance and modernization of the infantry combat vehicle BVP M-80, in- cluding modernization with new anti- armor systems; • Equipping with new mobile anti-armor system. b. Air Defense Assets • Equipping with Man Portable Short Range Air Defense System (MAN- PADS). c. Enginery • Further development of the Engineer branch and phasing in of the mines with self-destruction or self-deactivation, the system of distance mine planting, the system of quick opening of passag- es in mine fields and replacement of the launching systems for quick bridg- ing over and floating bridges systems; IX. EQUIPPING AND MODERNIZATION T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 • Equipping with engineer assets and equipment for general and combat support and explosive ordnance dis- posal (EOD). 2. Croatian Navy a. Equipping with Coastal Patrol Boat; b. Equipping with Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV); c. Equipping with Anti-Ship Missile System. 3. Croatian Air Force and Air Defense a. By the end of the year 2016 de- cision will be made regarding retaining or abandoning Autono- mous Protection of the Air Space; b. Equipping with Air Defense sys- tem of mid-range. Equipping and Modernization policy is oriented towards development and maintenance of the targeted capabilities of the Armed Forces defined by basic documents in Defense Sector. Addition- ally, equipping and modernization policy will include monitoring and analyzing possibilities of national and foreign ca- pacities involvement in equipping and modernization processes. Priorities in equipping and modernization are aimed at achieving and maintaining the capabilities in support of the mis- sions and tasks of the Armed Forces, re- alization of the NATO Capability Targets and completion of the initiated projects. Equipping and modernization will be im- plemented in accordance with require- ments, technical and economic validity of requirement, available budget alloca- tions and applicable regulations. Wher- ever possible manufacturing capacities of the domestic Defense Industry as the sources of equipping and modernization will be taken into consideration to the maximum extent as well as international agreements under which equipping and modernization could be realized through donation or procurement of weapons and military equipment under favorable financial conditions. As one of the methods of financing equipping and modernization, consid- eration will also be given to the possi- bility of using EU funds (EU funding for Dual Use), with focus on procurement of equipment necessary for development and achievement of the targeted capa- bilities of using Armed Forces in support of civilian structures. Research and Development in support of equipping and modernization will be im- plemented in cooperation with Croatian scientific research institutions, as well as institutions of NATO and European Defense Agency. Their resources and po- tentials can contribute to research and development of weapons and military equipment for the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. In addition, coop- eration with NATO institutions and Euro- pean Defense Agency will be considered as well. Their developmental projects for weapons and military equipment are available and of interest for develop- ment and achieving of the targeted ca- pabilities of the Armed Forces. Projects of equipping and modernization shown in the Long Term Development Plan are mostly divided in two priority levels, and some in three levels. Projects of the first level represent absolute prior- ity because they comprise projects that 67 are of key importance in building capa- bilities, through which NATO Capability Targets are reached. Therefore, they are necessary for the efficient execution of the missions and tasks. Projects of the second priority level are important for Armed Forces activities; they upgrade capabilities, and affect dynamics and quality of single capabilities. However, the scope and dynamics of their realiza- tion are to the certain degree subject to corrections. Priorities of the third level are subject to significant corrections in the scope and dynamics of realization. Croatian Army Priorities The priority of the Croatian Army is mod- ernization and equipping of the key ma- neuver units of the Armed Forces. In the period till the year 2020 priority will be given to equipping of the Mechanized Guard Brigade and that represents a di- rect contribution to realization of the NATO Capability Targets. The second priority in the period till the year 2020 is equipping other declared units. In the period from 2021 till the end of 2024 and even beyond that period, projects of equipping and modernization of the Guards Armored-Mechanized Brigade will be initiated as indispensable for retaining and increasing the level of its capabilities. Infantry Weapons and Equipment The quantities of serviceable infantry weapons in the Armed Forces meet re- quirements of the proposed structure. These weapons are technologically ob- solete and their calibers and mainte- nance requirements do not provide for harmonization of the operational activi- ties with the Armed Forces of NATO and EU members. In the previous planning period the Armed Forces began equipping with the new VHS assault rifle and accompanying equipment (of NATO caliber) in a quantity of 6,000 pieces. Equipping will continue in the first two planning periods in order to complete equipping of the CAF Active Duty component by late 2020. Equipping of the CAF Reserve component with the VHS assault rifle is planned for the third planning period. By late 2020 it is necessary to equip other units of the Croatian Army declared for the NATO Pool of Forces with machine guns and uni- versal machine guns of NATO caliber. Equipping of the Active Duty component with this type of weapon should be completed by the end of the entire planning period. Given the fact that the Armed Forces have no ammunition of NATO caliber in stock, along with procure- ment of the new assault rifles, machine guns and light machine guns, it is necessary to equip the CAF with accompanying ammunition. Within the planning period, priority is given to continued equipping the troops with individual equipment until the Armed Forces are fully equipped, includ- ing renewal of the following equipment: camouflage uniforms with digital press, military boots and combat helmets, combat modular vests, backpacks and individual night vision devices. CAF units declared for NATO and EU op- erations should be equipped to oper- ate under extreme weather conditions. The project of equipping troops with upgraded systems of performance, pro- tection and communication will begin in the second part of the planning pe- riod. Priority in equipping with infantry weapons and equipment will be given to units scheduled for deployment to NATO / EU operations. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Support Artillery The Armed Forces are equipped with ar- tillery weapons of various origin and ca- liber (105, 120, 122, 130, 152, 155 mm). They are technologically obsolete; com- puting of the initial elements is slow as well as correction of fire and velocity of reaction. Features regarding range and precision are also unsatisfactory. In view of the new requested capabili- ties, it is necessary to begin a process of equipping with new artillery systems of unified 155 mm caliber. In that way, mo- bility and interoperability in joint opera- tions with NATO and EU forces members will be increased. Putting new artillery systems into operational use will enable implementation of the NATO Capabil- ity Targets to operate at distances up to 40 km by using various types of pre- cise ammunition, fire control system and exchange of information with Partners. Equipping and putting the system into operational use will be completed by the year 2019, and full operational capability will be reached by the year 2022. Anti-Armor Combat Assets Armed Forces are equipped with ob- solete anti-armor systems of unsatis- factory performance regarding range, guidance and penetrability. Anti-armor guided missile system (POVRS) has a range of 2, 5 km, and mobile anti-armor system Maljutka has been declared non- prospective. The capability of anti-tank combat will be upgraded in the forthcoming period by equipping of the armored personal carrier Patria (APC), with modern anti- tank systems of the 3rd generation. Re- placement of the mobile systems Fagot and Metis with more advanced ones will be also taken into consideration, or the existing systems will be equipped with modern/advanced ammunition of great- er range and greater penetrability and easier launching of anti-tank projectiles. Armor Assets Armed Forces are equipped with the tank M-84, which has (after the revision pro- cess) fulfilled requirements for the plan- ning period. Mechanized infantry of the Croatian Army is equipped with full tracked infan- try combat vehicle BVP M80A for which modernization will be considered at the end of the planning period. Equipping with modern armor vehicle on wheels APC Patria (in 7 various ver- sions) and phasing into operational use of 126 carriers will end in the year 2016. The combat armor vehicle (BOV) will be equipped with modern communication system and remote controlled machine gun of 12, 7 mm caliber. By the end of 2016 part of the vehicles will be equipped with remote controlled gun of 30 mm ca- liber and advanced anti-armor system. 69 Light Armor Vehicle (Combat) By the end of 2017 equipping and phas- ing into operational use of the light armor vehicles (M-ATV, MRAP) will be carried out in cooperation with bilateral partner. Air Defense Assets Weapons of the Croatian Army comprise of Air Defense guns of 20 mm caliber, self-propelled surface to air missile sys- tems S-10 CRO and S-10M and shoulder launched “IGLA” and “S2M” light missile systems. All artillery AD systems as well as man- portable, shoulder-fired low altitude surface-to-air missile system S-2M have been proclaimed non-prospective. For re- quirements of the Air Defense capability for protection of maneuver units, Croa- tian Army will be equipped with systems of short range for Air Defense of the ma- neuver units (MANPADS). Engineering Assets The existing bridging and pontoon as- sets and equipment are tactically and technically outdated and are not meet- ing the new requirements. Consequently, there is a high level of malfunctioning, high maintenance costs and the inability to provide full engineering combat sup- port in the segment of ensuring mobility of the maneuver units in operations. In conformity with the new operational requirements for maintaining operation- al tempo in high mobility operations, in the forthcoming period priority for the Armed Forces will be to finish equipping of the declared Engineering forces for NATO (one Platoon and one Company for general engineering support, one platoon for engineering combat support and one EOD platoon) with engineering machines, trucks, EOD equipment and special EOD vehicles. The Armed Forces will also begin equipping with new en- gineering systems necessary for reali- zation of the accepted NATO Capability Targets. Signal Assets and Systems The priority in the forthcoming period will be equipping of the Croatian Army units with assets that provide conditions for implementation of the NATO Capa- bility Targets. Signal assets and systems will also be provided simultaneously with the equipping with combat armor vehi- cles, self-propelled artillery systems, light armor combat vehicles, Air Defense sys- tems and BVP vehicles.

Firstly, it will develop ca- pabilities that are recognized as critically important for conduct of the basic mis- sions of the defense and protection of national interests at sea. These are: • Capability to act against surface targets, • Capability for mine and anti-mine op- erations, • Capability for Command and Control, Information-Communication network- ing, data gathering and sea monitoring. Having in mind the responsibility of the Croatian Navy for the safety at sea in peace-time, the priority of equipping and modernization of the Croatian Navy is aimed at developing the capability of the Coast Guard through continuation of the project of equipping the Coast Patrol Boats. By the year 2017 another two projects have been defined as priority-projects: (1) Achieving full capability of control of the sea surface through modernization of the radar system Enhanced Peregrine and procurement of the alternate radars for obsolete GEM radars. The priority of this project is to achieve integration of Equipping with equipment and Role 1 assets.

It will also give support to execution of the Coast Guard’s mis- sions, helicopter air transportation, sup- port to paratrooper training and light air transportation, support to aerial fire-fight- ing, aeronautical-technical logistic support to its own forces and Allied forces as well; execute all types of training of individuals and units for conduct of missions of the Armed forces’ services in the Republic of Croatia and in Peace Support Operations and assistance to civilian institutions in the Republic of Croatia. As the service life cycle of the overhauled airplanes MiG-21 expires by the end of 2024, the priority is to find a permanent solution for protection of the air space. Possible solution for protection of the air space lays in development of the multina- tional approach based on the principles of cooperation, sharing resources and capa- II.

Decisi- on regarding possibilities and modalities for development of this capability will be made by the end of 2016. Having in mind specific features of the existing transport helicopter capabili- ties that are currently in operational use, during the planning period consideration will be given to options and modalities for replacement of transport helicop- ters, and depending on the resources, for the beginning of the process of transi- tion and introduction of new helicopters which will ensure sustainability of the CAF transport helicopter capabilities. In addition to the above stated, within the framework of available programs of cooperation with strategic partners, possibilities will be further explored for continuous improvement of the overall helicopter capabilities by putting into op- erational use other types of helicopters in addition to transport helicopters. Such projects will be implemented if they would present a significant contribution to the overall capabilities of the Armed Forces and if at the same time they would not create such a resource burden that could affect the implementation of other planned projects. 75 PRIORITY LEVEL PLANNING PERIOD By the end of 2017 By the end of 2020 By the end of 2024 I.

Informa- tization of the Command and Control System (C2) is among the priorities at tactical, operational and strategic level. Such systems integrate traditional distri- bution in stationary and deployable (mo- bile) systems. Integration of information from other sources and sensors has also progressively developed. Informatization of the single processes in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces has been carried out with continuity. However, the greatest challenge in the future period will be their integration and consolidation into an integral system capable of imme- diate mutual exchange of information according to requirements and authori- zations.

Support Command Priorities Overview of the Support Command Equipping and Modernization Projects of the Support Command 77 tion will be given to security and defense of that system. Building of an integral system will be carried out gradually and it will include integration, optimization and consolidation of the existing systems and upgrading of their capabilities. The framework for construction of the Communication-Information sys- tem comprises a mobile system, the system of basic and the system of functional services. The mobile sys- tem includes technical levels of signal transmission, and the system of basic services includes those services that are common for the entire Defense field. They contain systems for trans- mission of messages and circulation of documents, systems for text process- ing, systems of identity authorization and verification and access to other basic services. Functional part of the system is specific for single functional areas and it is built on basis of the ser- vices and capabilities of the database and of the basic layer. The focus on development will be placed on consolidation and modernization of the mobile system and the system of ba- sic services on which functional services will perform. Functional services will be built accord- ing to requirements of single functional areas and in conformity with solutions that are accepted and used by NATO. Applications will be developed with the aim to be mutually open for data ex- change and open for capabilities to con- nect with adequate systems of the Allied countries. In the Defense Sectors worldwide an in- creasing importance has been given to the defense of the information area, due to the growing importance of the Com- munication-Information systems and their vulnerability. Systems for defense of the communication-information sys- tem will be developed in Defense Sector. Development of the information systems and their modernization and consolidation will ensure the basic elements of information systems reliability: confidentiality (secrecy), integrity and continued availability and elements of their security as, for example, authenti- cation (verification of identity), authorization (verification of authori- zation) and irrevocability of all transactions in the entire informa- tion system of the Defense Sector. This requires development and constant upgrading of the system of cryptographic protection and digital signature throughout the entire Communication-Information System according to the level of secrecy. Modernization of Data Centers makes the specific part of infor- mation protection and defense of the IT space that will allow for more efficient physical and technical protection of the file Server and other central network equipment, as well as for security of data and information systems. Building of the detached Redundant Data Centre will allow for separate secure Data Backup and Data Recov- ery systems, as special security function of the information systems against threats that could come either from the information area (Cyber attack) or classical kinetic attack or rather natural threat to the Data Centre. At the same time, this will also correct or remove observed deficiencies of the current Data Centre. In addition to stationary and deployable communication capabilities, a system will be developed that allow communica- tion (voice and data) with members of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces who are deployed on assign- ments abroad, either in missions and op- erations or on Defense Attaché duties or similar tasks. In order to achieve these goals it will be necessary to continuously carry out equipping and modernization of the ex- isting Communication-Information Sys- tems that have progressively short life cycle before becoming technologically obsolete.

Continuous, quality, reliable and suffi- cient protection for all types of the Com- munication-Information services will be necessary in the area of fixed communi- cations, mobile communications (mobile GSM networks, mobile radio networks), satellite communications and all types of information services and services that use networks for data transmission. This includes equipping with assets and sig- nal systems earmarked for troops, team leaders, commanders of all levels, as well as systems that provide contribution to the common operational picture, distri- bution of data in real time and use of indispensable functional services. In addition to the modernization of equipment and consolidation of the data and processes, high level of expertise of the specific cadre and organizational so- lutions of their positioning in the system must be ensured.

These military properties are categorized as follows: • prospective military properties (proper- ties built for military purpose, utilized by the Ministry of Defense), • temporarily prospective military proper- ties (properties that are built for military purpose and used by the Ministry of De- fense, and are in the process of being abandoned), and • Non-prospective military properties (properties built for military purpose and not utilized by the Ministry of Defense). Through the rationalization process of uti- lizing military properties, the Ministry of Defense will use only prospective proper- ties whereas all non-prospective and tem- porarily prospective military properties (after abandonment) will be given to the management by the State Office for State Property Management. By the transfer of the non-prospective and temporarily prospective military proper- ties, the Ministry of Defense will reduce the costs of passive standby regime, pro- tection, and guarding of such properties whereas the State Office for State Prop- erty Management may initiate the pro- cedure of their conversion to for different utilization in accordance with the physical planning documentation. Course of Development in the Area of Facilities and Infrastructure Construction, renovation and reconstruction of the facilities and the infrastructure at the locations that are foreseen for the planned deployment of the Armed Forces will mainly adhere to the principle that main barracks having no capacity for development for more than 2000 persons and do not have exercise areas or training facilities will be considered to be non-prospective. With the purpose to increase effectiveness, at pro- spective locations, first of all the accom- modation capacities, training and logistics in training areas and barracks will be im- proved. The total number of non-prospec- tive properties will be rationalized and the abandoning and transfer of non-prospec- tive properties will be intensified aiming at decreasing the costs for their insurance and maintenance. The standards of work, accommodation and training at the prospective locations will be raised continually, and the renovation of the facilities will be in accordance with the legal X. FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 81 regulations of the Republic of Croatia in the field of physical planning, construction, fire protection, work safety, environment pro- tection and technical safety. Systems of technical safety for protec- tion of military locations will be built dur- ing the construction of new facilities and reconstruction of the existing buildings and infrastructure, which enables ration- alization of military personnel guarding military locations. In order to achieve faster accommoda- tion of the Armed Forces at prospective military locations, the concept of building housing facilities, logistic and other facili- ties in the form of prefabricated, modular buildings and fast build systems. During construction, reconstruction, and adaptation, the Energy Efficiency and Waste Management procedures will be applied. Funding will be accomplished through Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund subvention for building and reconstruction of military fa- cilities. Biomass Energy Plants will be de- signed and built at military training ranges and other military locations where there are resources and possibilities of biomass preparation. In the upcoming planning period the focus will be on rationalization and downsizing of non-prospective properties through the following actions: • transfer of non-prospective properties to the State Office for State Property Man- agement, • selling the part of military properties in accordance with the legal prerequisites, and • increasing and centralizing accommoda- tion capacities, administrative, storing, training and other capacities, as well as through targeted move of the Armed Forces for which building and organizing of the needed capacities at the prospec- tive locations is required. Pursuant to the Act on Management and Disposal of the Property Owned by the Re- public of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense is no longer required to pay utility fee which reduces the costs of using prospec- tive properties. The financial means obtained from selling non-prospective and temporarily prospec- tive military properties will be invested in the modernization of the Ministry of De- fense infrastructure. The European Union funds and other pos- sible resources will be taken into consid- eration when financing projects of infra- structure building and modernization. Military Geographic Information System Military Geographic Information System will develop topographic and cartographic database of geospatial data for the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and printed charts of new military topographic maps in the range of 1:50.000 and 1:250.000 scale in accordance with NATO standards. The goal of Military Geo Information System is to equip the Armed Forces with updated, digital, standardized, functional and interoperable geospatial data. Geospatial data obtained through the project of the Military Geographic Infor- mation System are in direct support of the NATO Capability Targets. Standardization of geospatial data and products, will allow their ex- change with other NATO members.

The present concept of the logistic support has been developed through the transformation and abandonment of the territorial placement and organizational structure of the Armed Forces. The main features of this system are numerous stationary logistic elements that offer logistic support in the barracks, mobile capacities of field logistics and abandonment of certain logistic activi- ties and some of civil logistics personnel separation. Food services, catering and cleaning have been singled out and are now being performed by newly established company Pleter-usluge d.o.o. and the over- haul tasks are being done by Aeronautics Technical Centre Ltd. Logistics system has fulfilled the require- ments of accomplishing tasks on the ter- ritory of the Republic of Croatia, while the field logistics capabilities have not been fully developed in accordance with the planning. The process of abandoning lo- gistics catering services has not ended yet and more civil persons have been retained than previously planned. Goals of the Logistics System Development The goal is to develop the process orient- ed, reliable and adaptable logistics system with greater emphasis on mobile capaci- ties of field logistics and more efficient lifecycle management of combat tech- nique. Logistics system will acquire new capabilities regarding the integration of new combat resources that are obtained through the equipping programs. Rationalization of the organizational structure will be conducted and similar lo- gistic activities will be linked together and that way the number of personnel will be decreased and their competencies will be XI. LOGISTICS SYSTEM 89 equaled/balanced. Greater efficiency will be achieved, resource e expenditure will be reduced, supplies will be optimized, and the quality of logistic information will be raised. Moreover, the speed of their ex- change will be increased and the capabili- ties for integration into collective logistics will be enhanced in accordance to NATO Logistics Doctrine. The objectives of the Logistics Systems development are: 1. To ensure the logistics readiness and continuation of logistics support to the Armed Forces pertinent to missions, tasks and the level of ambition; 2. To rationalize logistics support by inte- gration of logistic activities and appli- cation of new organizational solutions; 3. To optimize logistics processes in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces by developing logistic standards and criteria, codification, quality con- trol, and automatization of the logistics information exchange process; 4. To reform the procurement system and supply chain management; 5. To maintain combat resources in terms of readiness requirements; 6. To develop capabilities for operations within collective logistics. Logistics Readiness Logistic readiness refers to the timely availability of armament and military equipment, availability of classes of sup- plies, efficiency of the procurement sys- tem and the sustainability capability of the forces participating in operations. Capa- bility of the logistics system is expressed through the ratio of logistics readiness in relation to the amount of invested fi- nancial resources. Funding for logistics support is intended for maintenance of armament and military equipment, energy supplies, accommodation, food and other types of logistics support. In the past five years, financial means invested in logistic support had a tendency of decreasing and amounted to an average of less than 15% of Defense Budget. In order to keep logis- tic readiness according to its missions and tasks, and to enable logistics to respond to challenges and needs while supporting the Armed Forces, the objective is to keep the logistic share at the same level in the following three years, and after that to gradually increase to optimal 20% of the overall value of Defense Budget. Rationalization of Logistics Support Personnel structure will be balanced within combat support services, i.e., the number of personnel will be downsized in Army Service Corps, construction and transport services. Technical and medical service will be improved by intensified specialization of capabilities and capaci- ties corresponding with the major requirements of combat service and combat service support. Measures and ways of rationalization of logis- tics system organization are as follows: • Transfer of the remaining operational and technical functions of lo- gistics support from the Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the Armed Forces to the Armed Forces units which will be accomplished in accordance with changes of Regulations on Material Procurement of the Armed Forces; • Logistics functions of procurement will be unified as well as transport and construction support in the Support Command which will be ac- complished within the re-organization of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces; • Downsizing of personnel working within stationary logistics system in all combat service support units. • Abandonment of tasks related to direct maintenance and logistics support to units and locations of the military facilities. Infrastructure maintenance and military facility management will be outsourced to contractors, and the existing personnel will be reorganized within the existing or within a new company. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Optimization of Logistics Processes Optimization will contribute to faster and more efficient logistics sys- tem that will remove redundant parallel activities at several manage- ment levels. The goal is to establish a process, organization and func- tioning of logistics and to clearly define the purpose and tasks of the organizational units. This will be achieved by several measures and ways through the procedure of procurement, acquisition and distribu- tion, by defining and informatisation of process documentation as well as through the better contracting of logistics support including the contracting abroad. Within the optimization of the logistics system, the following initiatives have been taken: • Optimization of public procurement through harmonizing competencies and responsibilities of organizational units and by conducting automated opera- tional-technical communication within procurement procedure. The objective is to obtain and maintain complete trans- parency of public procurement and to shorten the duration of procedures for obtaining funding for the Armed Forces including procurement in the Area of Operations. • Reform of the standards of materiel sup- plying. Legal and regulatory framework of materiel supplying will be reformed in view of future cooperation with business entities of domestic military industry and providers of logistic support services. The goals of equipment and modernization will be linked to the strategy of equipping with the purpose of better cooperation of all state institutions involved in pro- curement of combat systems. In terms of increasing international defense cooper- ation, the strategy of equipping will bring harmonized and a unique approach of all national stakeholders being a part of the international Defense market. There will be a transparent decision making on the procurement of combat systems and their efficiency. • Codification and optimization of the procurement and distribution system and the inventory monitoring. The new procurement system based on mod- ern codification and informatization is introduced with the purpose of afford- able management of the resources and shortened period of distribution to a unit as the end user. The goal is to reform the Codification System in accordance with NATO standards, and to develop organi- zational and technical capacities in the Ministry of Defense for the systematic codification of weaponry and military equipment. • Implementation of the Quality Manage- ment System in accordance with NATO standards. The purpose is to conduct weaponry and military equipment quality management in its entire life cycle. The implementation of the Quality Manage- ment System will bring better technical specification for procurement and main- tenance, more transparent procurement procedure, better quality equipment and weaponry procurement for the Armed Forces in terms of the invested money and greater interoperability of military equipment and weaponry. • Automatization of the logistic informa- tion exchange and the knowledge about logistic situational awareness informa- tion is a basic prerequisite for the plan- ning of the logistics support. Therefore, it is necessary to develop logistics in- formation system that will give logistics information and be compatible within a unique information system of the De- fense Sector. With the purpose of logis- tic operational reporting at the national level, the NATO program tools will be used. Implementation of logistic infor- mation system will enable the complete 91 control and visibility of material assets and will support material and financial operations in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. Supply and Supply Chain Management The goal of material inventory manage- ment is to reduce the cost of obtaining and keeping the supplies by providing lo- gistic readiness of the Armed Forces. Supply of Fuel and Lubricants. The goal is to enable independent activities of the Armed Forces in the period of 30 days through their planning, storing and distri- bution system. A strategic and operational level location is designated for storing the fuel and lubricant supplies and several lo- cations are being designated at the tacti- cal level. The goal is to build and improve the conditions for safe storage of fuel and oil derivatives in compliance with the Envi- ronment Protection standards. In the next planning period, the implemen- tation of the Concept of One Type of Fuel in the Armed Forces will be finalized. The Armed Forces will withdraw the majority of the equipment that uses petrol as a fuel. Supplies of Lethal Ordnance. The goal is to ensure funds for the procurement of new lethal ordnance by decreasing the costs of keeping the inventory. Lethal ord- nance reserve will be optimized according to caliber and types and the total of the required quantities. By the end of 2017 all perspective lethal ordnance will be kept in the functional storage facilities with high standards of counter-explosive protection and environment protection. In modern warehouses better atmospheric conditions are achieved with which resource life cycle is prolonged and the costs of maintenance are optimized as well as the reliability of lethal ordnance. NATO standards will be respected in dealing with lethal ordnance. Supplies for the Reserve Compo- nent. Strategic Defense Review has fore- seen the establishing of mechanisms for the enhancement of Defense Capabilities by developing the Reserve component for which the weaponry and equipment will be obtained and stored. This means that needs/requirements should be defined and logistics requirements fulfilled at the national level. All material resources for the needs of the Assigned Reserve will be stored by the Support Command. Func- tional storage and garage facilities will be built in the perspective barracks for stor- ing and keeping the weaponry and basic means for the Reserve component. Logistic Distribution Center. In order to reduce the costs of storage and dis- tribution, a Central Logistic Distribution Center will be built in Zagreb. The objec- tive is to achieve organizational savings in personnel and decrease of operational costs in distribution and manning. Moreo- ver, better overview of the inventory will be achieved as well as monitoring of the T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 inventory and the status of military equip- ment taken out. The costs of storing the supplies of medi- cal material and equipment will be ana- lyzed and consequently, the surpluses will be determined, the obsolete items will be defined as well as the way of their dispos- ing in affordable and ecologically accept- able way. Maintenance of Combat Assets The goal is to improve the present way of maintenance in conceptual and organizational terms. The integrated model of quality keeping for certain technical means or platform and upgrading in its life cycle will be established. Maintenance capacities will be organized in accord- ance with specific maintenance procedure conducted by the staff and users of material resources, organic logistic units for maintenance, and Support Command units for maintenance, Depot Overhaul Center or outside suppliers of maintenance services. The emphasis will be on military capacities for the overall maintenance of all types of weap- ons whereas the maintenance of other technique will be conducted by combined military and civilian capacities of maintenance. Military capacities and maintenance capabilities will be defined for the designated preventive maintenance and repair of combat tech- nique and means in field conditions as well as for the repair shop maintenance and servicing. The size and the distribution of capacities will be determined according to the types and number of technique that are being maintained including technical means for the Reserve component. The capacities for wider repair shop main- tenance and overhaul of combat platforms will be developed in Economic Sector through the program of strategic partner- ship and will be provided by contract. The Armed Forces will develop technical and engineer capabilities for the quality con- trol of the work in civil maintenance com- panies. The capacities of the maintenance of technical materials for civil purpose and the overhaul of non-combat vehicles will not be developed. Depot Overhaul Center of the Support Command will be transformed having the capacities of maintenance and overhaul of combat vehicles, weaponry, target and measuring devices, military electronics and capabilities of weapons modifica- tion except for the vessel artillery weap- onry and platforms. In the Depot Overhaul Center there will be new capabilities for technical testing, measurements, assess- ments, control and other expertise of the weaponry and lethal ordnance, expertise to test the reliability of weapons and technical expertise in management pro- cesses of the life cycle of the combat systems. Depot Overhaul Center will pro- vide military and technical assistance to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff and participate in programs of Re- search and Development in cooperation with civilian scientific and technical insti- tutions. Maintenance of ships and other naval technical resources will be carried out mainly by entities from the corporate sector, with the exception of specific as- sets to be maintained in the Croatian Navy capacities. Organization of aviation maintenance will be implemented in accordance with the regulations governing the airworthiness and maintenance of military aircraft. Ca- pacities for maintenance in the Air Force and Air Defense will be modernized and rationalized through specialization and optimization. Aeronautical Technical In- stitute is a strategic partner in the main- tenance of military aircraft and its engi- neering. The integration of new weapons systems that are introduced in the Armed Forces will require systematic rethinking of or- ganizational solutions and establishing of structures that will be responsible for the 93 logistic support of the new systems, the capacities for the maintenance and loca- tions of these capacities. The Croatian Army and The Support Command shall be organized in a way to enable capacities for maintenance and servicing and the light overhaul of Armored Personnel car- rier Patria and all Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs). Capabilities to Operate as a Part of Collective Logistics The Armed Forces will not develop all lo- gistics capacities for logistics support and sustainability within the operations abroad. According to the principles of cost effectiveness and cooperation, and in ac- cordance with NATO Logistics Doctrine, comprehensive logistics support is pro- vided through collective logistics. In ac- cordance with the tasks and the overall Capability Targets of the Armed Forces, national capabilities of the non-stationary (mobile) logistics will be developed. The Logistics units will be equipped with mo- bile logistics modules. For those logistics capabilities that cannot be developed by the Republic of Croatia, multinational solu- tions will be found. Therefore, the Armed Forces will intensify cooperation with lo- gistics agencies and other organizations of NATO and the EU. The Republic of Croatia will not develop its own strategic transport capabilities, but, by participating in NATO and other inter- national initiatives, bilateral agreements and commercial contracts, it will ensure timely access to facilities of strategic de- ployment, in accordance with the needs and decisions on the engagement of the units of the Armed Forces outside Croa- tian territory. Development of Medical Support Capabilities The development of medical support capabilities will focus on provid- ing continuous medical and veterinary protection for the needs of all activities and planned goals of the Armed Forces target capabilities alongside with the rationalization of material and human resources. Combat branches develop their own medical support. The lowest tacti- cal levels will train and organize Combat Rescue Team as additional combat capability with their task to provide emergency first response until the arrival of professional medical help. Special operation units will train and organize combat medics. Medical support of the maneuver units will be carried out primarily relying on the organic unit at the Role 1 level that provides health care for their members in the Theatre of Operations. For the purpose of providing medical support to the activi- ties and tasks of the Support Command and providing medical support to the units that do not have their own elements of medical support, the Military Health Center has been established as a military health institution. Military Health Center is responsible for the implementa- tion of health care at the primary level and specific health care, and is responsible for the development of medical support at the Role 2 level. Through the project of equipping and modernization the pool of vehi- cles will be expanded and modernized having medical equipment in ac- cordance with applicable standards, and the Role 1 maneuver units will be equipped. Military Health Center will carry out veterinary preventive activities and veterinary care for service animals and will continuously monitor monitoring of safety and hygienic standards of food, water and work surfaces at home and abroad. Military Health Center will have capabilities of deploying individuals and teams to sup- port the conduct of operations and other specific activities of the Armed Forces at home and abroad, especially in cases when it comes to operations of consequence management/mitigation of impacts of natural and technical disasters. Proper training capabilities will be de- veloped as well as training programs for medical staff and personnel who provide health care support, primarily in the Lo- gistics Doctrine and Training Center of the Support Command as well as in other or- ganizational units of the Armed Forces. T H E C R O AT I A N A R M E D F O R C E S L O N G − T E R M D E V E L O P M E N T P L A N 2 0 1 5 − 2 0 2 4 Appropriations for Defense for the pe- riod covered by the Long Term Devel- opment Plan will depend on real annual growth rate of the Gross Domestic Prod- uct (GDP). The starting point of this Plan is to stop the multi-year trend of falling Defense Budget and to keep it, in the initial three year period, within the real amount at the level of the year 2014. Financial analysis and assessments from the ex- isting perspective suggests that in order to complete the project and reach the capabilities defined by this Plan, in the next 10 year period, the defense fund- ing should amount to at least 48 bil- lion Kuna. Therefore, the objective is to maintain the existing level of Defense Budget within real amount until 2017, and together with the economic recovery and GDP growth make prerequisites for significant real growth of Defense Budg- et in the continuation of the planning period which implies gradually reaching the long term ambition of the Defense funding up to 2% of GDP. In this way the funding will be provided in the ten year period needed for the development of planned capabilities together with flex- ible and efficient conduct of operational tasks in the Defense Sector. Financially the most challenging final decision regarding the possibilities and the model of maintenance of the com- XII. FINANCIAL RESOURCES Figure 13: Projection of the growth of defense budget in the absolute amount per year (in bill. KN) 95 bat aircraft capabilities will be adopted by the end of 2016. The complexity of this capability, or the time required to introduce the new aircraft, as well as calculations based on the ten years of investment, indicate that there is a need for such a process, which will begin in 2019 and the continued investment in the next planning period. Consequently, this decision will affect the sheer size of the Defense Budget in 2019. Projected total Defense Budget in the ten-year pe- riod covered by this Plan is increased, de- pending on the variants of the financing capability of combat aircraft in amount varying between 2.4 and 4.2 billion HRK. Figure 13 shows projections of the De- fense Budget with three versions of its growth from the year 2019. In addition to the basic version that implies around LEGEND: Operation costs Equipping and construction Salary Other expenses related to personnel Costs of international missions and operations 2014 2024 Figure 14: The costs of personnel, operational costs and equipping and construction costs ratio in 2014.

The overview as such is indica- tive and it implies a multi-year funding model requiring further, more in-depth and detailed analysis that will be pre- pared by the end of 2016 to support final decision-making. During the planning period, together with the end of the declining period and with the gradual growth of the Defense Budg- et, special emphasis will be put on the improved budget structure underlining the direction and increase of the availa- ble resources in equipping and construc- tion6 which amounts to 67:21:12 in the year 2014 (Figure 14), and it will change gradually in the direction of 46:33:21 ra- tio at the end of the period comprised in this Plan (Figure 15). Downsizing of the total number of personnel in the Armed Forces and administration in the Ministry of Defense will gradually decrease the annual expenditure for personnel by the end of the planning period. In projections that include means for retaining combat aircraft capabilities in one or the other option, anticipated cost ratio would be even more favorable (Fig- ure 16 and Figure 17). 6 Costs of the personnel comprise salaries, fiscal giv- ing, different allowances, such as allowances for participation in international missions and operations Operational costs comprise costs of regular functioning of the Armed Forces units and the Ministry of Defense organizational units and they include costs of equipment and infrastructure maintenance, procurement costs of materiel and raw materials, energy, services, membership fee etc., costs of the support to civil institutions and other expendi- tures for the employees. Equipping and construction costs comprise the costs of major projects of equipping and modernization, supporting projects that are in support of introducing major projects, and costs of construction and modernization of facilities and infrastructure defined in chapters: Equipping and Modernization, and Facilities and Infrastructure.

(Independent financing of combat aircraft capabilities) 97 Realization of the goals and ambitions of the Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP) requires continuous management of its im- plementation with clear division of compe- tencies and responsibilities. Croatian Parlia- ment will regularly monitor implementation of the LTDP through examination of the An- nual Report on Defense and of the Defense Budget proposal within the framework of the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia. To support the role of the Croatian Parlia- ment, the Ministry of Defense will, during the preparation of the Annual Report on Defense, report in a separate chapter about the LTDP implementation. Government of the Republic of Croatia will establish dynamics and priorities of the LTDP implementation through the Strategy of the Governmental Programs and Guide- lines of the Economical and Fiscal Policy. The Ministry of Defense will ensure opera- tionalization of the LTDP through the De- fense Planning Process. Analyses will also be carried out and proposals will be put forward of all regulations that represent normative presumptions for the efficient implementation of the LTDP. Regulations regarding Defense Plan- ning will be of special importance in operationalization of the LTDP. It is particularly important in this pro- cess, to sustain and improve three planning processes: 1. To determine the state of capabilities, or rather, identify missing or unsatisfactory elements of individual capabilities and priorities in their development and financing. 2. To identify a starting point and priorities of the realization and fi- nancing of the projects in mid-term period. 3. To establish Financial and Human Resources framework for mid- term and short-term period. Fundamental risks that could occur during management of the LTDP im- plementation are: • Insufficient resources for financing prior- ities of the highest level in defined time frame • Occurrence of new, higher level priorities, than those for which realization has en- tered the phase of significant financial expenditures. Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Ministry of Defense will manage the process of overcoming the risks connected with realiza- tion of priorities. The LTDP will be reviewed every third year. In the case of major and more significant changes in strategic and security environment, in fa- cilitating social and economic processes, primarily connected with the state of financial resources or with the occurrence of other circum- stances that could indicate a requirement for a substantial revision of the document, the process of Strategic Defense Review will be previ- ously carried out as established by the Defense Act. With the aim to ensure an optimal level of implementation and adaptability to changes that could have implications on planning solutions identified within this document, the Government of the Republic of Croatia could, if required, propose its minor amendments on annual basis.

In the past three years processes in the Defense Sector were focused on the implemen- tation of appropriate reforms and adjustments related to the ambiguous strategic and  regional environment. Functioning of the Defense Sector that was determined by limited  Defense Budget and requirements to have capabilities to respond to current and future  threats in a dynamic and complex security environment, were the main driving force in  reviewing of the existing plans and functioning of Defense. An obsolete and outdated conceptual-normative framework prevented reform processes  and therefore this segment was targeted for radical reforms. The Long-Term Develop- ment Plan reflects strategic shift toward a new, modern deliberation of Defense and its  conceptual and institutional positioning in modern geopolitical and geostrategic realities.  This is the first Long-Term Development Plan since we become members of NATO and  the European Union, and this fact creates an essential framework for our efforts aimed  at positioning defense functions in relation to the contemporary security architecture.  Although one of the biggest challenges is to achieve the necessary level of Defense  Capabilities in circumstances marked by reduced defense spending, the vision set out in  this document attempts to position and understand the Defense and the social role of  the Armed Forces in a far broader and more meaningful way. The Republic of Croatia will develop respectable Armed Forces that will be able to: ad- equately respond to the long-term period challenges; Forces capable of executing its  fundamental Constitutional role; Forces that are ready, trained and equipped to carry out  their part in joint operations with Allies, and Forces that will be available to provide as- sistance to affected civil population during disasters and crisis situations. At the same token, the Armed Forces will be developed as an important building block  of the overall potential of the country, support to security, stability and development of  society.

With the ac- cession to Euro-Atlantic integration, the  key strategic national goals have been  accomplished. In 2009 the Republic of  Croatia joined the NATO Alliance and in  2013 became the member of the Euro- pean Union. Through this membership a  stable and long-term security perspective  has been achieved. Concurrently, due to  economic crisis, the funds allocated for  defense have been reduced, whereas the  security environment at the global and  regional levels generates new security  and defense challenges and threats. This  altogether requires further adjustments  and transformation in the development  of Defense Capabilities. Reconsideration of conceptual solutions  and available capabilities has resulted  in decisions to elaborate and adopt the  new legal regulations (the Defense Act1,  the Act on Service in the Armed Forces of  the Republic of Croatia2), and a series of  strategic and planning documents in the  field of Defense that will direct further de- velopment of the Croatian Armed Forces  (hereinafter referred to as “the Armed  Forces”). After the implementation of the  Strategic Defense Review process, the fi-  nal document was adopted by the Govern- ment on 25th July 2013. The development  of the Croatian Armed Forces Long-Term  Development Plan 2015-2024 (hereinafter  referred to as “the LTDP”) is a continuation  of this process that puts into operation  conceptual approaches and the neces- sity for transforming defense capabilities  identified in the Strategic Defense Review. The LTDP is the basic defense plan- ning document defining the long-term  projection of development of military  capabilities and the required resources.  Having considered all aspects of strate- gic circumstances and available capabili- ties and resources, the analytical phase  played a key role in identifying Target Ca- pabilities to be developed in the upcom- ing planning period. Within this process, a  wide range of scenarios has been devel- oped that can generate the need for the  Armed Force engagement. The scenarios  were analyzed, along with the probability  of each scenario occurring, requirements,  security impacts on the state and society,  ambitions and possibilities for develop- ment of military capabilities that should  be employed. Finally, summarization and  prioritization were conducted, including  harmonization of the type and size of the  affordable capabilities which was taken  as a basis for defining the size and or- ganization of the Armed Forces.  I. INTRODUCTION   1   The Defense Act (Official  Gazette, No. 73/2013) 2   The Act on Service in the  Armed Forces of the Republic  of Croatia (Official Gazette, No.  73/2013)    9  Expressions used in this Plan which carry a  gender denotation, regardless of whether  they are used in the masculine or feminine  gender, encompass the male and female  gender equally.  SECURITY STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK  The global strategic environment is  marked by highly dynamic political, social  and economic changes that result in the  shift of power and influence generating  new instabilities, divisions, competitions  and opposition of the global actors. In a  narrow security sense, the environment  was characterized by disruption of secu- rity by non-traditional security threats,  such as new forms of international ter- rorism, trans-border organized crime, and  proliferation of Weapons of Mass De- struction, disruption of energy supply sys- tems, potential dangers from missile and  cyber-attacks, and piracy. Although the  probability of conventional and nuclear  attack on the European Union and NATO  member states is not high, primarily due  to their capabilities for defense and deter- rence built through the combined efforts  of the Allies, instabilities arising in the  close vicinity of the Allies’ borders could  have far-reaching impacts on the global  security architecture, thus reaffirming the  importance of a balanced approach to the  Alliance’s core tasks – Collective Defense,  Crises Management and Cooperative Se- curity. Numerous conflicts and crisis areas,  emerging failed and unstable states and  various types of threats caused by the rise  of extremist ideologies impose the need  for the development of key capabilities  and launching of international operations  directed towards improving security.  An effective response to a broad spectrum  of global threats is possible only through  a strong and comprehensive cooperation  with the Allies and Partners, and through  integration of civilian and military capa- bilities. The tasks that are set before the  Armed Forces impose the need for their  further transformation and modernization,  i.e. building and development of capabili- ties for a balanced approach to the Alli- ance’s core tasks. In order to respond to  modern challenges and threats, the Armed  Forces should be capable of performing  non-traditional tasks. They should be ad- justable, mobile, interoperable, deployable  and sustainable in the Area of Operations.  Armed conflicts from the recent past that  took place in the Southeast European  Region have been replaced by a wide  range and an extensive network of multi- lateral and bilateral cooperation. This has  mostly been a result of a strong influence  of external factors and aspirations of all  countries in the Region to establish close  connections with the Euro-Atlantic com-    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  munity. Countries in the Southeast Europe- an Region have recognized the importance  of the regional cooperation and, with the  support of the Euro Atlantic community,  have established a series of initiatives for  cooperation. As a result of the years long  successful cooperation, the states of the  Region have gradually taken over the own- ership over regional initiatives, as for ex- ample the US-Adriatic Charter (A-5), South- east Europe Defense Ministerial – SEDM,  RACVIAC – The Center for Security Coopera- tion and have taken over the implemen- tation of the Agreement on Sub regional  Arms Control (Article IV, Annex  1-B of the  General Framework Agreement for Peace  in  Bosnia and Herzegovina  – Dayton Ac- cord). The results of such efforts have been  positive and are reflected in a wide range   of mutual cooperation between the coun- tries in the Region focused on multilateral  solutions to security problems, i.e. in the  readiness to settle interstate and interior  disputes through an open dialogue.  The aspiration to connect with the Euro- Atlantic community, to a greater or lesser   degree has been present in all countries  of the Region, and every step towards  Euro-Atlantic integration has further re- duced the likelihood of new crises or re- newed conflicts. However, in spite of the aforementioned  positive characteristics of the security  environment, there have still been poten- tial security threats resulting from open  regional issues caused by the legacy of  the 1990s. In the spectrum of potential  regional threats we cannot exclude the  probability of armed conflicts, so there is  still a need for international military and  police presence in some countries of the  Region.  While the Republic of Croatia could be in- directly exposed to implications of poten- tial regional conflicts, there is no danger  from direct armed aggression on its terri- tory in the context of the existing strategic  circumstances. Starting from the considerably strength- ened international position of the Republic  of Croatia, unquestionably determined by  its affiliation with NATO and the EU, the  Armed Forces will participate more actively  in multilateral and bilateral regional coop- eration projects by strengthening regional  stability and good neighborly relationships  and by helping the countries in the Region  to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, not  neglecting multilateral and bilateral coop- eration with all Allies and Partners in the  Euro-Atlantic community and beyond. In  accordance with the strategic orientation  of the Republic of Croatia, the Armed Forc- es have given a significant contribution to  international peace and security for more  than a decade by participating in NATO,  EU and UN missions and operations which  required a gradual development of the en- tire spectrum of new capabilities. These     11  capabilities of the Armed Forces will be  further developed, inter alia, through vari- ous types of international training, courses  and exercises. The commitments of the  Armed Forces resulting from the new Se- curity and Defense architecture of the Re- public of Croatia governed by the Defense  Act that envisages assistance provided to  Allied countries, declaring their forces for  Multinational Response Forces, joining the  multinational military structures and en- gagement in Peace Support Operations,  Crisis Response Operations, Humanitarian  Operations, and other activities abroad. Participation in the UN Peace Support  Missions will remain one of the priorities  of the Croatian contribution to maintain- ing international peace and security.  With  its own war experience, the Republic of  Croatia has acquired expertise in manag- ing UN Peace Missions that have become  an important mechanism that can stop  international conflicts. In that context, the  Republic of Croatia has gained additional  credibility and globally applicable sub- stantial knowledge. It has also assumed  responsibility to apply its excellence in  implementation of the international peace  activities and to pass on practical expe- riences. Participation in the UN Peace  Missions and operations, in addition to  maintaining world order based on obeying  the international law, is also useful in the  context of strengthening strategic part- nerships with key partners.  NATO membership obligates the Repub- lic of Croatia to give full contribution to the  Collective Defense of the Allies under Arti- cle V of the North Atlantic Treaty according  to its capabilities, and to engage its forces  to actively participate in the execution of  other tasks in accordance with the NATO  Strategic Concept, including the activi-  ties related to Crisis Management and the  contribution to international peace and se- curity. The Armed Forces have significant  obligations that are a result of declaring  their forces for NATO Response Forces  (NRF), improved military capabilities and  interoperability through participation in the  implementation of concepts used to de- velop mechanisms for mutual cooperation  on building, maintaining and strengthening  Defense Capabilities. Capability Targets  that the Republic of Croatia assumed in the  NATO Defense Planning Process play a cru- cial role as direct indicators of the dedica- tion to the development of the Alliance, and  their implementation will form a backbone  of the Armed Forces development. The European Union strives to struc- ture its Security and Defense dimension  more firmly through a series of initiatives  and activities within Common Security and  Defense Policy. Therefore, the accession  of the Republic of Croatia to the European  Union implies a new commitment to the  development of the Armed Forces capabili- ties. The Republic of Croatia will continue  to give contribution to the Peace Support  Operations within the EU framework and  the EU Battle Group (EU BG), and partici- pate in the Pooling and Sharing initiative  and in the activities of the European De- fense Agency (EDA). As a full-fledged mem- ber, the Republic of Croatia has taken over  the commitments of potential employment  of the Armed Forces in providing assis- tance to the EU member states regarding  their defense and their employment in ac- cordance with the Solidarity Clause. Common affiliation of the majority of  NATO and EU member states, common  values and strategic interests present a  new challenge to the Republic of Croatia,  its Defense Sector and the Armed Forces.     T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  years the Defense Budget will remain  at the level of Fiscal Year 2014, i.e., the  total Defense Budget will be 4.3 billion  HRK, and this will, in a real sense, put an  end to its year-long continuous decrease.  With the recovery of the economy and the  GDP growth, and in accordance with the  European Union procedures related to  the excessive deficit, the conditions for a  gradual increase in the Defense Budget  will be met, that is, the prerequisites for a  gradual accomplishment of the long-term  ambition to increase the Defense spend- ing by 2 percent of the country’s GDP.  Long-term planning in the Defense Sec- tor under the conditions of uncertain eco- nomic movements and continuous budget  restructuring has been accompanied by a  series of challenges and risks which re- quire intensive short-term management  and fast adaptations.   This means a possibility and an obligation  to participate in numerous initiatives and  activities arising from the need for enhanc- ing the complementarities and coordina- tion of these two organizations, particularly  in the area of practical cooperation in mis- sions and operations and cooperation in  the development of Defense Capabilities.  FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK  Due to the economic crisis, the Defense  Sector has been faced with a reduced De- fense Budget, and with the imperative to  adapt to financing under the conditions of  fiscal rationalization and savings. Emanat- ing from the macroeconomic reality that  is currently not capable of producing reli- able medium and long-term forecasts of  GDP dynamics, this Document is based  on the assumption that for the next three     13  and Pooling and Sharing initiatives are  the key elements of such approach.  In the context of EU membership, EU  structural funds will be used accordingly,  in order to build the capabilities of the  Armed Forces envisaged for the civil- military dual use, particularly in the area  of Search and Rescue, Medical Trans- portation, Border Control, coping with  the impacts of ecological disasters, etc.   •  Affordability: Defined priorities and  appropriate dynamics of Capability De- velopment will set up the balance be- tween the Capability Development re- quirements and resources provided by  the State.    •  Single Set of Forces: The Republic  of Croatia will develop a single set of  Forces for NATO and EU arrangements  and mechanisms deriving from the com- mitment to strengthen strategic partner- ship between these two organizations.  •  High Standards of Civil-Military  Relations: The Republic of Croatia will  provide the conditions for establishing  high standards of Civil-Military relations  that encourage the society to place the  high levels of trust in the Armed Forces,  build effective management and control  mechanisms, professional autonomy  and social responsibility of the Armed  Forces, effective prevention of all forms  of discrimination, continuous enhance- ment of integrity and transparency, pro- motion of Military Ethics and Gender  Awareness Policy.  •  Inter-Agency Cooperation: There  will be cooperation, coordination and  coordinated action between the Armed  Forces and other State bodies in the  development of capabilities to  conduct  missions and tasks, and to provide re- sponse to risk and threats.  PRINCIPLES OF THE ARMED  FORCES DEVELOPMENT  In the planning period defined in this Plan,  the Armed Forces will be organized ac- cording to the following principles: •  Strategic Coherence: the develop-  ment of Defense Capabilities will ensure  readiness to respond to present and fu- ture threats and security challenges.    •  Focus on Capabilities: Taking into  account threat diversity and risks result- ing from the complexity of the Security  environment, the Armed Forces should  have capabilities required for the execu- tion of various types of operations and  activities – the ones resulting from their  basic Constitutional role and commit- ments assumed under Article V of the  North Atlantic Treaty; Crisis Response  Operations outside the territory of the  Republic of Croatia that contribute to in- ternational security and stability; activi- ties for providing assistance to civilian  institutions and population, that is, vari- ous kinds of Humanitarian Operations at  home and abroad.  •  Flexibility: The Armed Forces will  undergo continuous adjustments and  transformation in accordance with the  complexity of Security environment.  •  Competence Based Approach:  Human resources of the Armed Forces  will be continuously strengthened as well  as the institutional prerequisites for the  professional development of the mem- bers of the Armed Force based on com- petencies.   •  Focus on the International Co- operation: The Republic of Croatia  will participate in common efforts of  NATO and the EU to build, maintain and  strengthen capabilities. Smart Defense,     T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  THE MISSSION OF THE ARMED  FORCES  In accordance with the provisions of the  Constitution of the Republic of Croatia,  there are three missions of the Armed  Forces: the Defense of the Republic of  Croatia and its Allies, the contribution to  international security and support to civil  institutions.   Support to Civil Institutions is a mis- sion in which the Armed Forces provide as- sistance to civil institutions and population  in the Crisis Management process and in  dealing with different types of risks and  threats of a non-military nature. This sup- port is accomplished through the support   The defense of territorial integrity, sovereignty and inde- pendence, and the defense of Allies is a primary mission of the  Croatian Armed Forces. Therefore, the Armed Forces should be ready:  to deter, halt and reject, independently, and with the help of the Allies,  the armed aggression on the Republic of Croatia; contribute to the  Defense of the Allies in the operations pertinent to Article 5 of the  North Atlantic Treaty and to protect the sovereignty of the Republic of  Croatia on land, at sea and in air.  Contribution to International Security is a mission of the Armed  Forces through which they contribute to international security and  to the creation and maintenance of the most suitable international  environment. This is accomplished by participation in Peace Support  Operations, Defense Diplomacy and Arms Control, Disarmament and  Prevention of Proliferation of Weapons.   to the Police and other state bodies, as well  as through the support in Protection and  Rescue, and the support to civil society.   VISION OF THE ARMED FORCES  At the end of the development period cov- ered within the Long Term Development  Plan, the Armed Forces will be managed,  well trained, and equipped, capable and  ready to carry out the defined missions  and tasks. Imbued with patriotism and  faced with the requirements of the 21st  century, radically different from the previ- ous ones, the military profession will de- velop in accordance with the principles of  high professionalism, expertise and social  responsibility. The Armed Forces are not only the in- strument for implementing missions and  tasks, but also one of the key elements  and an indicator of the identity of state  and society. Established in the Homeland  War, with a high social reputation based  on the successful, historically significant  mission of defending and liberating the  country, they will with the provision of ad- equate resources, continue to be one of  the  fundamental pillars of security, stabil- ity and development of the society. The Armed Forces will be developed as an  important integral element of the overall  potentials of the state, and one of the in-  II. DEVELOPMENT  VISION    15  dicators of integration of modern Croatian  society into contemporary European and  global developmental trends.  Their activity will continuously confirm the  social role, commitment of the country to  the Alliance and to the values underlying  the European and Euro-Atlantic community.  Extending the traditional role of the mili- tary in modern environment and the in- creasing complexity of conditions in which  its engagement is taking place have not  reduced but rather increased the demands  and the complexity of military vocation.  In addition, the economic crisis has sig- nificantly slowed down the development  processes and did prevent the allocation  of social resources to the Defense Sector  from being in line with its role in a signifi- cantly changed environment.  The development of the Armed Forces in  such circumstances is not based on the  growth of the Defense Budget3 taken out  of the social context, but on rationaliza- tion and effectiveness of the management  processes. Development of the Armed  Forces, together with the necessary budg- et funds, underlines that ideas and visions  could mitigate and partly compensate for  the lack of resources. Development of the  Armed Forces is based not only on new  weapons and military equipment but on  personnel too. Investment into personnel,  their education, overall care and improve- ment of their working and living conditions  is a presumption of making the vision of  their development real.  KEY LONG−TERM GOALS OF THE  ARMED FORCES DEVELOPMENT  Development of the Armed Forces, based  on such elaborated vision, will be focused  on the accomplishment of the following   key Long term goals: 1.  Building of the Armed Forces capabili-  ties for effective engagement in current  and future theater of operations.  2.  Optimizing the strength and structure  of the Armed Forces and increasing the  effectiveness of the management pro- cess, Command and Control.  3.  Credible and consistent activities in terms  of the system of Collective Defense and  arrangements within the EU Common  Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and  the UN Peacekeeping Missions.  4.  Developing the Armed Forces as an or- ganization based on competencies and  imbued with social accountability.  5.  Strengthening the capacity for the im- plementation of non-military tasks at  home and abroad that include provid- ing assistance to civil institutions and  population in Crisis Management and  Crisis Response Operations, in cases  of accidents, disasters and catastro- phes, Humanitarian Operations, Search  and Rescue operations on land, at sea  and in the air, that is, those capabilities  foreseen for civil-military dual use.  3 According to the regulations  for the elaboration of the  State Budget in the Republic  of Croatia, the official term  for the “defense budget“ is the  Financial Plan of the Ministry  of the Defense.    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  The Republic of Croatia refers to the de- fense against the armed aggression in  terms of Article 5 of North Atlantic Treaty.  In the defense of sovereignty and territori- al integrity, the Republic of Croatia will use  all available forces and resources includ- ing development of its own Armed Forces  and accepting the Allied forces up to the  required level. In defending the Allies, the  Armed Forces will participate primarily  with capabilities that have been developed  within NATO Defense Planning framework  as well as with the other available forces. The Republic of Croatia will develop the  Armed Forces whose primary mission will  be the defend sovereignty and territorial  integrity and to maintain capabilities for  initial response to a potential armed ag- gression and acceptance of Allied forces  in conducting Collective Defense on the  national territory. With this purpose, up to  20000 members of the Assigned Reserve  will be posted to the Reserve Armed Forc- es together with corresponding weapons  and equipment. The mechanisms of acti- vating Mobilization Reserve, together with  reactivating Compulsory Military Service  will ensure the growth of the forces up to  the level required for the successful coun- ter potential armed aggression on the na- tional territory.   The Republic of Croatia will develop ca- pabilities for sustainable participation in   operations abroad with up to 1000 Armed  Forces members. The required Defense  Budget funding will be planned for the  participation in operations with up to 200  Armed Forces members while the fund- ing of the possible participation above the  stated number will be provided outside of  the Defense Budget.  The Republic of Croatia will keep on con- tributing with its forces to the NATO Re- sponse Forces (NRF) and European Union  Battle Groups (EU BG). Overall declared  forces of the Republic of Croatia for the  NATO Response Forces will make up to 1%  of the NATO Immediate Response Forces  (IRF).4 Within the Immediate Response  Forces, the Armed Forces will participate  contributing with a Company-size unit of a  Mechanized infantry or equivalent forces.  The Armed Forces will participate with de- clared forces within the NATO Response  Forces Pool (RFP). In addition to the ambition to contribute in  filling in the share of the NATO Command  Structure, the Republic of Croatia will con- tinuously join the NATO Force Structure.  Parallel to this, the Republic of Croatia re- mains open to joining forces through other  initiatives and multilateral arrangements  beyond the framework of NATO and EU,  especially in the regional environment. Participation in the EU BG will range from  a significant contribution in the time span   III. LEVEL OF AMBITION  4 The Immediate Response  Forces (IRF) are part of NATO  Response Forces. Their size is  up to 13,000 members of the  land, air and naval forces. The  Armed Forces will participate  with up to 130 members or  the equivalent of a maneuver  company.    17  of every three to four years (up to 300  Armed Forces members), to lesser con- tributions to combat groups within these  intervals.  Additionally, participation in NRF and EU  BG, does not exclude the possibility of  joining other multinational formations in- tended for Immediate Response to crisis  situations. Contribution to missions and operations  under the auspices of the United Nations  will be provided through appropriate par- ticipation of units, teams and individual  members. By the end of 2018, the Land forces will  be capable of sending sustainable forces  of a Combat group size within Mecha- nized battalion to the Peace Support  Operations. In order to achieve this level  of ambition, the Land forces will be de- veloped in a way that 50% of total Land  forces is structured, trained and equipped  for participation in Peace Support Opera- tions, and 10% of forces are sustainable  in operations. Naval forces will develop capabilities to  protect sovereignty and to control and  protect legal rights and interests of the  Republic of Croatia at sea. In the first part  of the planning period, the capabilities for  the execution of traditional naval tasks will  remain at the existing level. Their further  development will be planned for the period  after the year 2017. Although the focus  will be on the execution of tasks at the  Adriatic Sea, naval forces will continue to  develop capabilities in NATO, EU and UN  operations outside the Adriatic as well. Naval forces will improve their capabilities  of control and protection of legal rights  and interests of the Republic of Croatia at  sea in cooperation with other state bodies  and Allies relying upon the development   of Coastal patrol boats and capabilities  of creating integrated picture of the naval  situation at the Adriatic Sea. In addition  to the mentioned capabilities, naval forces  will develop capabilities of counter-mine  activities, capabilities for the protection of  merchant ships from piracy and criminal  activities during navigation and capabili- ties for naval interception.  In the process of developing capabilities of the naval forces, NATO  and the EU Maritime Strategy will be taken into consideration in an  appropriate manner.  Capability of controlling and protecting the airspace of the Republic of  Croatia within NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATI- NAMDS) will be accomplished primarily by existing combat aircrafts until  the end of the resource lifecycle, with the support of Surveillance, Com- mand and Control System. By the end of 2016, the possibilities to retain  this capability will be determined, including a multinational approach to  its maintenance or abandonment of certain elements of this capability  and searching for the solution within the Collective Defense of NATO.   By 2018, the Air Forces will have capabilities to deploy helicopter  forces (up to eight medium transport helicopters) for Peace Support  Operations, sustainable for six months (without rotation). They will be  capable of sending and maintaining helicopter forces up to the size of  four mid transport helicopters on rotation basis. In order to accomplish  the Level of Ambition, the Air Forces will be developed in a way that  40% of total Air Forces are structured, trained and equipped for par- ticipation in Peace Support Operations, and 8% of the forces will be  sustainable in Peace Support Operations.  In the process of developing particular capabilities, the Republic of  Croatia will join the initiatives within the framework of Allied and Part- nership arrangements. At the same time, in certain initiatives, depend- ing on the real possibilities, Croatia will take the leading role. When  conducting international operations the Republic of Croatia will focus  on Joint forces generated within NATO and the EU. Capabilities of the Armed Forces in assisting civil institutions will be  developed through the enhancement of institutional capabilities in the  Republic of Croatia that will, by synergy strengthen the resilience of  the society to disasters and crisis situations, and will be also used in  international Humanitarian Operations.   Existing capabilities of the Air Forces will be the backbone of maintenance  and development of the national capabilities for aerial firefighting.    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Possessing and developing relevant ca- pabilities is a prerequisite of successful  accomplishment of the Armed Forces  missions and tasks. Dynamic security  environment characterized by series of  hardly predictable specific threats and  challenges considering form and effec- tiveness together with a low degree of  possibility of a traditional threat by armed  aggression, determines the approach  to the capability based planning of the  Armed Forces development. Successful  response to a threat or challenge requires  capabilities that are tailored and built  with regards to types and the nature of  threats or challenges and act accordingly.  Since the acquiring of the capabilities is  accomplished by means of organization  and other elements of capabilities5, the  requirements that define the capabilities  direct all aspects of organization and de- velopment of the Armed Forces.  Capabilities that the Armed Forces should  possess and develop are to be considered  through seven main areas:  1. Prepare,  2.  Communications, command and   control (C3),  3. Project,  4. Engage,   5. Inform/Situational Awareness,   6. Logistics and Sustain,  7. Protect.  Prepare  Preparation comprises capabilities needed  for continuous improvement of effective- ness, before and during operations.  The following types of capabilities will be  developed: •  Defense Planning Capability will be   continually enhanced and will follow  processes of Strategic Planning in the  Republic of Croatia. National Defense  Planning will be harmonized with pro- cesses within the system of NATO De- fense Planning;  •  The achieved level of capability regard-  ing the evaluation of forces and capa- bility review will be maintained in order  to ensure effective mechanisms of feed- back information in the process of de- veloping capabilities at the national and  international level and to ensure interop- erability of the NATO and EU declared  forces; •  The achieved level of training and exer-  cise will be improved in order to ensure  a higher degree of integrity of other ca- pability elements and to continue with  validation of the achievements regard- ing required capabilities;  •  Capabilities of generating forces will be   improved as well as timely force avail- ability through the better planning of the  use of the Armed Forces, relevant equip-  IV. CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  5 According to the Joint  Doctrine of the Armed Forces  of the Republic of Croatia,  based on NATO doctrinaire  postulates, the following ca- pability elements of the Armed  Forces are defined: doctrine;  organization; materiel; person- nel; management; infrastruc- ture; education and training.

The ultimate goal  is to maintain more operational, highly- trained and well-equipped Armed Forces  that are smaller in size, but able to carry  out all assigned missions and tasks.  The Armed Forces will be organized into  headquarters, commands, units, institu- tions and other organizational units, and  with regard to their role and functions,  they will be clearly divided into two com- ponents - Operational and Institutional  component.  The Armed Forces operational component  will be composed of organizational units  that will be organized and prepared to im- plement combat and non-combat opera- tions (Operational Commands, Guard Bri- gades, Flotilla and Croatian Coast Guard,  Air Force, Special Operations Forces Com- mand, etc.). The Armed Forces Institutional Compo- nent will be composed of organizational   units whose purpose is to build capabili- ties or support capability building of the  Operational Component (Support Com- mands, Military Schools, Training Centers,  Service Units, etc.).  In the following period the Armed Forces  will implement reorganization measures in  order to downsize their administrative and  command structure in relation to the oper- ational forces. Through functional integra- tion or separation of organizational units,  the Armed Forces will consolidate and/or  establish new organizational units, create  a more efficient command structure and  achieve decentralization of the command  system.  Special Operations Battalion will be reor- ganized into the Special Operations Forc- es Command in order to fulfill the commit- ment to improve capabilities to conduct  special operations.  Croatian Army Military Police Regiment  (Land Forces) and Military Police platoons  (the Croatian Navy, Air Force and Air De- fense) will be reorganized and combined  into a single General Staff sub-staff unit.  The Personnel Management Center will  be extracted from the Support Command  unit. It will be reorganized as a General  Staff sub-staff unit.   V.

Signal Battalion will become a subordinate  unit under the command of the Army Com- mander.  The Center for Electronic Reconnaissance  as a General Staff sub-staff unit and a part  of the Croatian Army Military Intelligence  Battalion will be reorganized and combined  into a General Staff sub-staff unit rede- signed as the Intelligence Operations Cent- er. The remainder of the Croatian Army  Military Intelligence Battalion will be reor- ganized and become a part of the Guard  Brigade Military Intelligence Companies.  By the end of 2017 the reorganized Armed  Forces will comprise up to 15,000 employ- ees and up to 400 military Cadets. The current Branch and Service structure  of the Armed Forces will be basically re- tained, apart from downsizing and organi- zational changes referred to above. The  Armed Forces will consist of the Croatian  Army (CA), Croatian Navy (CN), Croatian Air   Force and Air Defense (CAF&AD), Croatian  Defense Academy (CDA), Support Com- mand (SC), Special Operations Forces  Command (SOFCOM), Court Martial (CM),  Military Representations (MRs) and the fol- lowing Sub-Staff Units (SSUs): • Intelligence Operations Center (IOC), • Military Police Regiment (MPR), • Honor Guard Battalion (HGB), •  Center for Communication and Informa-  tion Systems (CCIS), • Personnel Management Center (PMC)  •  CAF General Staff Support Unit (CAF GS   SU).   ARMED FORCES STRUCTURE   Based on the findings and recommenda- tions of the Strategic Defense Review, the  Armed Forces Organizational Structure will  be formed as shown in Figure 1.  CAF General Staff (CAF GS) is a joint  body of the Croatian Armed Forces organ- ized within the Ministry of Defense. It has  a responsibility to prepare command, use  and employ the Armed Forces.   Figure 1: CAF Organizational  Structure     25  CAF Service Commands have a respon- sibility to enable the functioning of the CAF  Services and to prepare subordinate com- mands and units to carry out their tasks.  Service commands participate in profes- sional development and have a responsibil- ity to provide training for Active Duty and  Reserve personnel.  Croatian Defense Academy (CDA) pro- vides military education for Armed Forces  requirements. It is responsible for conduct- ing scientific research and publishing ac- tivities.  Support Command (SC) provides contin- ued logistics, medical and other support to  CAF commands and units when executing  their tasks at home and abroad. It also pro- vides functional training to CAF members  in the field of Logistics.  Special Operations Forces Command  (SOFCOM) plans and conducts special  operations and activities in order to sup- port and protect national interests. The  Special Operations Forces Command will  be responsible for training and equipping  Special Operations Forces, doctrine devel- opment and it will also coordinate prepara- tions for Special Operations training.  Military Representations (MRs) repre- sent the Croatian Armed Forces and per- form other professional tasks related to  participation in the activities and supervi- sion of different Boards, Working Groups,  Standing and Interim bodies of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Eu- ropean Union, the Allied Command Op- erations (ACO) and the Allied Command  Transformation (ACT).  Court Martial (MC) represents an auton- omous and independent body who decides  on disciplinary liability of CAF members for  committing a disciplinary offence and ma- terial liability of CAF members. It will con-  sist of General Court Martial in Zagreb and  District Courts Martial in Osijek and Split.  Sub-Staff Units are established for the  purpose of developing capabilities to carry  out different tasks and support activities  that other CAF components, due to its  specificity or scope, cannot provide within  their organic entities.  CAF General Staff   Croatian Armed Forces General Staff will  be organized into the following organiza- tional units shown in Figure 2. The Chief of the General Staff is the Head  of the CAF General Staff. He is superior to  commands, units and institutions of the  Armed Forces, the Croatian Military Rep- resentative to NATO and the EU as part of  the Permanent Representation of Croatia  to NATO, the Croatian National Military   Figure 2: The CAF General Staff  structure    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Representative to Allied Command Op- erations (ACO) and the Allied Command  Transformation (ACT). The Chief of the General Staff is the prin- cipal Military Advisor to the Croatian Presi- dent and Croatian Defense Minister.  The Chief of the General Staff reports to  the Croatian President for execution of  orders and decisions. He reports to the  Croatian Defense Minister for execution of  decisions and informs both (the President  and the Minister) regarding their execution  under the provisions of the Defense Law.  The Chief of the General Staff can trans- fer parts of command authority to Deputy  Chief of the General Staff and/or Director  of the General Staff.  The Chief of General Staff has a Deputy  who performs the duties of the Chief of  the General Staff in the event of his ab- sence.  The Director of the General Staff is directly  in charge of the General Staff Directorates.  He performs the duties of the Chief of the  General Staff in the event of his or his Dep- uty’s absence.  Advisor to the Chief of the General Staff  for Health Affairs is the principal advisor to  the Chief of the General Staff for all mat- ters related to force health protection and  medical support. He is responsible for doc- trinal organization and functioning of the  CAF Health Care service.   The CAF Command Sergeant Major is di- rectly responsible to the Chief of the Gen- eral Staff for performance and develop- ment of the NCO Corps. He participates  in directing professional development of  privates, Seamen and NCOs.  The Cabinet of the Chief of the General  Staff is organized to create the necessary  preconditions for the regular performance  of official duties of the Chief of the Gen- eral Staff, Deputy Chief of the General  Staff, Director of the General Staff, Advi- sor for Health Affairs and CAF Command  Sergeant Major.  The Command Operations Center (COS)  has a command authority over assigned  forces in Peace Support Operations abroad  and in providing of assistance to civilian in- stitutions and population affected by natu- ral, technical and technological disasters,  also in ecological incidents, Search and  Rescue operations, firefighting activities  and transportation of the sick or injured  people in accordance with the approved  Plans for Employment of the Croatian  Armed Forces and Executive Orders issued  by the Chief of the General Staff. It is also  responsible for preparing Orders and de- velopment of other implementation docu- ments required for CAF functioning. The  Command Operations Center is headed  by a commander who exercises command  over a part of the Croatian Armed Forces  placed under his authority.  The Military Police Division (MPD) is re- sponsible for military police activities. It is  headed by Chief of Division who manages  the Military Police Division, organizes and  conducts its activities.  The CAF General Staff has directorates that  are responsible for doctrinal organization  of a certain functional area. They provide  direction for and supervise its functioning.     27  Further development of functional areas  will result in the development of a Func- tional Management Model that will enable  Chiefs of the General Staff Directorates  who are responsible for certain functional  areas to serve as commanders of the Gen- eral Staff Sub-Staff units that are respon- sible for task execution in the particular  functional area. This model will enable a  reduction in the number of executive com- mand functions.   The General Staff Sub-Staff  Units  The General Staff Sub-Staff units will be  organized into the following organizational  units shown in Figure 3. Intelligence Operations Center will  continue to conduct strategic electronic  surveillance for the purposes of Security  and Intelligence Agencies of the Republic  of Croatia in accordance with the Secu- rity and Intelligence System Act, and will  provide joint intelligence support to the  Croatian Armed Forces in carrying out  peacetime tasks and in the execution of  combat and non-combat operations.

Situation in the Area of Human Resources  One of the main characteristics of the  area of Human Potentials is harmoniza- tion of the personnel structure aimed to  create an optimal ratio of officers, NCOs  and Soldiers/Seamen in addition to down- sizing the number of civil employees.  Planned admission provides for gradual  improvement of the age structure of the  Active Duty military personnel.  Obligatory conscription has been suspend- ed since the year 2008 and Voluntary con- scription has been established. However,  the annual number of voluntary conscripts  (from 500 to 800) is significantly smaller  compared to the planned (2000), primarily  due to the insufficient funds.  A new personnel category of Military Spe- cialists has been introduced through the  system in early 2014 whereas Contract and  Mobilization Reserve are being established.  The system of Deployment to Internation- al Operations and appointments to duties  abroad has been established at satisfac- tory level.  The portion of female officers in Active  Duty military composition has reached the  targeted strength of 10% (on June 1, 2014  a total of 10.34%, female officers 15.66%,  female NCOs 11.27%, and female Soldiers  5.71% respectively). Designated strength of the Armed forces  amounts to a total of 17,504 Active Duty  military personnel and 1,905 civil employ- ees. The real strength as of January 1,  2014 is shown in the following table.   Direction of Human Resources Development  Targeted Personnel Strength  and Structure  Total targeted strength of the Armed  Forces is 15,000 employees (Active Duty  military personnel and Civil employees)  and up to 400 Cadets by the end 2017. Of  the stated number there will be 14,380  Active Duty military personnel and 620  civil employees. By the end of the year  2020 a ratio from 1: 3 to 1: 5 should be   VI.

Within the category of Active Duty mili- tary personnel a newly established sub- category of Military Specialists will be  fully developed. Their career will be regu- lated by separate regulations and a spe- cial system of salaries will be established  for them. This way the need to staff es- pecially demanding positions with experts  will be solved. In the first part of the planning period up   to 2,000 conscripts annually will undergo  voluntary military training for the purpose  of manning Active Duty personnel posi- tions and Assigned Reserve. That number  will be increased respectively as required  for manning Active Duty component and  Assigned Reserve. With the aim to provide for manning Active  Duty military composition with officers,  up to 400 Cadets will receive education  at the CDA study programs in accordance  with requirements of the Branches and  Services of the Armed Forces.

Reserve component will be formed  of the Contract and Mobilization Reserve  that will provide for growth of the Forces.  Part of the Active Duty military personnel  will be deployed to additional duties, ful- filling the key organizational positions in  Reserve units in conformity with the War- time Formation.  Contracted reserve will fulfill insufficient  Military-Occupational Specialties that are  not adequate or cost-effective for organi- zation in Active Duty composition. A part  of the Contract Reserve members will be  assigned to organizational positions in Re- serve units, as required.  Mobilization Reserve will be formed of the  Assigned and Non-assigned reserve. Assigned reserve will be formed of the  conscripts assigned to Military Occupa- tional Specialty, after conscription, volun- tary military training or Active Duty mili- tary service.  Non-assigned Reserve members will be  listed in military records and in the case  of required development of Defense Capa- bilities; they will have to undergo medical  examinations and evaluation of their capa-  Figure 12: Organizational chart of  the Assigned Reserve.  bility for military service. They will also be  able to enter Active Duty military service.  Engagement of the Reserve component  will result in growth of the overall De- fense Capabilities of the Armed Forces to  conduct missions and tasks at home and  abroad.  Contracted and Assigned reserve mem- bers will be evaluated during training and  execution of duties and will be upgraded  or rather promoted to higher rank.  A special concept of military education  will be developed for Contracted and As- signed Reserve members (for candidates  for Reserve Officers and NCOs, for Re- serve Officers and NCOs, as well as for  more demanding Military Occupational  Specialties).  For requirements of the Reserve Compo- nent, the Armed Forces will keep/store  weapons and equipment.   Contracted Reserve  Contract Reserve will number up to 1,000  members, and for the most part it will  comprise of organizational positions for  specific Military Occupational Specialties  indispensable for conduct of operations  that, for some particular reasons, are not  suitable for manning Active Duty military  component of the Armed Forces. These  will mainly be highly specialized medical  personnel for ROLE-2 and other person-  6. 5.  4. 3.  2. 2.

Recruitment of the Contracted Reserve  will be carried out for requirements of the  Armed Forces. Upon selection, the Ministry  of Defense will sign a contract with Con- tracted Reserve that will regulate rights  and duties of the Contracted Reserve  member. Appropriate compensation will  be given to Contracted Reserve members  in conformity with the signed contract.  Training of the Contracted Reserve mem- bers will be organized and exercised in the  Armed Forces and Contracted Reserve will  participate in the organizational structure  of the Armed Forces units, in missions and  tasks at home and abroad.   Assigned Reserve  Assigned Reserve will be formed of the  draftees who underwent training for  Military Occupational Specialty during  conscription, voluntary military training,  in Active Duty military service or through  some other forms of in-service train- ing. Of the total number of Assigned  Reserve members, 20,000 of them will  be assigned to Reserve Units (Infan- try, Artillery, Air Defense and Logistics  regiments, Engineering and Signal Bat- talions) deployed to the territory of the  Republic of Croatia.  Training of the Assigned Reserve will be  organized and exercised in the Armed  Forces. Together with other organization- al units of the Armed Forces, Assigned  Reserve will participate in conduct of the  missions and tasks in our country.   Non-Assigned Reserve  Non-assigned Reserve will be formed of  draftees listed in military records (who were  not conscripts and did not undergo voluntary   training). Only in the case of the required  growth of the Armed Forces, their capabili- ties will be evaluated; they will undergo train- ing and enter Active Duty military service.  Calling up of the Non-assigned Reserve  will be carried out when professional  composition and Assigned Reserve would  not be sufficient to conduct missions and  tasks in our country. Non-assigned Re- serve will take part in conduct of the mis- sions and tasks of the Armed Forces in  our country. It will not be organized within  mobilization-development of the Armed  Forces nor will organizational positions  of the Non-assigned Reserve be shown in  Organizational Structure of the units and  commands of the Armed Forces.   Improvements Personnel Management  Based on the analysis of the existing organizational framework and  competences in Personnel Management, a more efficient and more  simplified business processes and intensified procedures will be es- tablished in order to eliminate overlaps.  Management of civilian and military personnel will be improved by  introduction of the Long-Term Personnel Planning based on available fi- nancial resources and on principles of equal opportunities and on clearly  established standards and incentives for Professional Development.  Consistent, measurable and transparent criteria of advancement and  retention in service will be established and applied as well as efficient  protection from violation of individual rights. Career advancement of  Active Duty military personnel will be harmonized with requirements of  the future strength and structure of the Armed Forces. Participation in Allied and other international operations will become  an inseparable part of professional obligations and requirements. In- stead of the previous voluntary nature of participation, future partici- pation will be determined by the requirements of the Service.

This model pre- sents a combination of the modified and  upgraded ‘’Cadet’’ model, granting schol- arships in support of lacking Services and  Occupations, admission from labor mar- ket, admission among employees from the  category of NCOs and contract soldiers/ seamen, education in foreign countries.  The possibility of contract based admis- sion will also be taken into consideration.  Soldiers/seamen will be, as so far, admit- ted to Contract service and NCOs solely  from the ranks of the best soldiers/sea- men who served at least one contract. Standards for professional/contract sol- dier/seaman will be defined taking into ac- count the heterogeneity of requirements  and obligations resulting from missions  of individual services of the Armed Forces,  operations in international environment  and roles of the Armed Forces in society.  Stimulating measures will be developed  for unavailable, i.e., critical specialties of  Active Duty military personnel aimed at  more efficient attraction/recruitment and  retention in service. A particular status  and consideration will be given to the phy- sicians, that is, to a model of attraction  and retention that will be established and  suitable for requirements of the military  system and specific characteristics of the  medical profession. Up to 100 NCOs, 350 to 1000 soldiers/ seamen and up to 80 officers will be annu- ally admitted in service. Annual number for  admission of Cadets and Contract Reserve  will be established according to require- ments for individual occupations and ca-  pacities of education. The number of con- scripts will be up to 2,000 annually with  increase in the second part of the planning  period for the manning purposes of the  Active Duty military composition and As- signed Reserve. Personnel who underwent  military training or have given up Active  Duty military service will enter Assigned  Reserve on annual basis, and an equal  number will be discharged. Exceptionally, a  minimal number of candidates for officer  and NCO duties of military specialists will  be admitted directly from labor market  and this will apply also to civil employees.   Professional Development  Professional Development of Active Duty  military personnel during their service will  be based on training and education, car- rying out of duty, and continuous life-long  learning and self-development. Education- al system will be harmonized with national  educational standards and with NATO rec- ommendations. Advancement in service  will be based on acquiring new knowledge  and skills that will be evaluated, on build- ing and maintaining capabilities that are  necessary for carrying out duties at higher  level. The existing system of Military-oc- cupational specialties will be upgraded in  support of development.  Personnel Support  Particular attention will be paid to quality  of living and the implementation of spe- cific measures in the area of Support to  Readiness, Welfare and Recreation of the  members of the Armed Forces and protec- tion of their rights. That will contribute to  attracting and retaining quality-personnel  as well as development and maintenance  of appropriate organizational culture that  should be monitored and systematically     51  built. In the forthcoming period, in the  area of Personnel Support projects will  be implemented with the aim to provide  for conditions that can guarantee reten- tion and attraction of quality, qualified and  motivated personnel. The existing systems  of selection, monitoring the state of per- sonnel and support will be improved and  upgraded, respecting medical, psychologi- cal and physical requirements and its sci- entific and professional foundation.  Through direct cooperation with Religious  communities/unions and on the basis of  signed Agreements, the implementation of  the policy of openness in the area of spir- itual guidance will continue, ensuring the  freedom of religious expression and reali- zation of the members’ spiritual needs.   Health Care Health care of the employees of the Minis- try of Defense and members of the Armed  Forces will be developed within the inte- gral Health Care System of the Republic of  Croatia and will be implemented through  the system of Medical Support as part  of the comprehensive system of logistics  support of the Armed Forces. Military Health Centre of the Ministry of  Defense and Armed Forces, as a military  health institution, will provide health care  to employees of the Ministry of Defense  and members of the Armed Forces at pri- mary level. Health care of the employees  of the Ministry of Defense and members of  the Armed Forces not provided by capaci- ties of the Armed Forces will be provided  by the Public Health Service or through the  network of Occupational Medicine physi- cians in the Republic of Croatia. In operations abroad, Health Care of the  members of the Armed Forces shall be  provided and implemented through their   own system of medical support and will  also relay on Allied forces and their capa- bilities, based on contracts and technical  agreements.   Transition and Separation of Personnel  The specificity and complexity of the military service will be followed  by solutions that provide Active Duty military personnel retirement un- der the special conditions, which should go side by side with quality  preparation for leaving the service, while respecting the principles of  equality and fairness.  In order to achieve the strength of the Armed Forces of 15,000 employ- ees and up to 400 Cadets that was also planned in the Strategic De- fense Review from the year 2013, the planned downsizing has already  begun in the year 2014. Within this downsizing about 4,200 Active Duty  military personnel and 1,500 civil employees will be separated by the  end of 2017. Separation of civil employees will be mostly carried out  through outsourcing of the jobs of Supply and Maintenance of military  locations and structures and Logistic services in barracks.  The program for preparation of the personnel for separation will be  further developed. The program of transition and separation of the Con- tract Soldiers/Seamen who will be discharged from military service af- ter one, two or three contracts will be developed. Moreover, special pro- gram of transition of civil employees will be taken into consideration.

T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Demands placed before the Armed Forc- es and the entire Defense Sector involve  training of the personnel for undertaking  actions in the new and increasingly com- plex circumstances, intricate/complicated  Defense and Security structures and new  technologies. Therefore, training of the  new and in-service training of the existing  personnel in the field of Defense and Se- curity is of primary importance. Having in  mind the vision of the Armed Forces where  the military profession is being developed  in accordance with the high professional  principle, expertise and social responsibil- ity, education for the needs of the Armed  Forces and the Defense Sector respective- ly, as well as activities within the Science   Sector -represent the core areas of the  Long Term Development Plan.  This Plan is oriented towards increasing  the quality of military education at all lev- els and categories of personnel. However,  the capability to execute various programs  of training has already been developed to  a great extent, as e.g., Military-Occupa- tional Training of NCOs and soldiers, vari- ous forms of functional training, learning  foreign languages, etc., and the emphasis  is placed on activities within higher level of  education and science for requirements of  the Armed Forces and the Defense Sector.   Higher Military Education  and Science   In the period comprised within this Plan,  higher education for defense require- ments will be transformed. This process  will be implemented in three phases: 1.  The first phase will establish Under-  graduate university study programs  within Croatian Defense Academy, in  cooperation with and in conformity  with regulations that govern the Sci- entific Sector and higher education  in the Republic of Croatia or rather  Bologna Process. The academic year  2014/2015 begun with the implemen- tation of two Undergraduate Study  programs - Military Engineering and   VII. EDUCATION AND SCIENCE    55  Military Leadership and Management  that will include the current program  of Basic Officer Education. Afterwards,  two Undergraduate Study programs  for requirements of the Croatian Navy  will be established (Military Nautical  Science and Military Marine Engineer- ing), and one Undergraduate Study for  requirements of the Croatian Air Force  and Air Defense (Military Aerospace  Engineering). Development of these  programs would place emphasis on de- velopment of Basic Military Competen- cies and adoption of the Officer’s Code  of Conduct by future Officers. Through  the influence and contribution of the  educative component of the Program,  Officers will be prepared to respond to  future challenges of the security envi- ronment.  2.  In the second phase, also in coopera- tion with the University community,  study programs at Undergraduate level  will be established. They will comprise  the current program of inter service  Command and Staff education and Mil- itary Occupational Specialty education  for Officers in functional area, and pro- grams at Post-graduate level that will  comprise the former program of stra- tegic education (War College). These  study programs will be established in  the year 2018.   3.  In the third phase, by the year 2020 at  the latest, higher education for defense  requirements at the Petar Zrinski CDA  will be institutionalized, i.e., Croatian  Defense Academy as an institution of  higher level education and scientific- research institution organized in con- formity with regulations governing  higher education and scientific activi- ties in the Republic of Croatia.  This process will be followed by further in- vestments that will upgrade the standard  of living and work of the students at all  levels of education.  Selection and education of the teach- ing cadre represents the key element for  implementation of all study programs,  stimulation for earning higher academic  degrees, selection to scientific-teaching  and teaching professions and creating  conditions to retain scientific-teaching  cadre within Defense Sector.  Programs of Education and Training with  other governmental bodies will concurrently  be developed, focused on achieving capa- bility for common response to challenges  and threats, joint participation in opera- tions and assistance to civilian institutions. In addition to meeting the defense needs  and to ensure the high-quality, also the  mobility of the personnel from military  environment to civilian and vice versa is  being achieved in this manner. Higher lev- el of education for Defense requirements  should be organized in a way to provide  training to future officers of the Croatian  Armed Forces and more broadly, for ex- perts in the Ministry of Defense and other  government bodies whose activities are  related to Defense and National Security,  researchers in scientific research institu- tions and research institutions who con- duct research in the field of Defense, and  other entities outside the State adminis- tration system.  Furthermore, partner relations with edu- cational institutions in other countries,  primarily with NATO and the EU will be  developed. These will provide for acquiring  new knowledge, skills and capabilities that  will contribute to more efficient develop- ment of the Armed Forces and fulfillment  of their basic missions and assignments.     T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Institutionalization of education for De- fense and Security requirements accord- ing to principles that govern scientific ac- tivities and higher level of education in the  Republic of Croatia has created presump- tions for a greater degree of integration  and compatibility with NATO institutions  and programs, harmonization with stand- ards of the Bologna Process and use of  NATO and EU resources.  In the recent years NATO has undertaken  important steps directed towards har- monization of the education and training  in educational institutions of the NATO  member and Partner countries with stand- ards of the Bologna Process.  The goal of these processes is to improve  quality in education and training, as well as  confidence and transparency, both among  the states and within the states between  the Armed Forces and society. Harmonization of the education for De- fense requirements in NATO member  states with Bologna Process presumes  that Defense educational institutions are  integrated in scientific-educational sys- tems of their countries. Attainment of the  goals of this Plan provides for efficient ap-  plication of the mechanisms developed to  upgrade the quality of education, enable  mobility of students and teachers and  contribute to mutual confidence. Examples  of such mechanisms are represented by: •  ERASMUS, educational program of the   European Union for promotion of mobil- ity of the European students and profes- sors that has become a core factor in in- ternationalization and ‘Europeanization’  of higher education in European Union.  •  European Initiative for Exchange of Young  Officers Inspired by Erasmus Program  (“Military Erasmus”) – a concept aimed at  improving quality of education and train- ing of the military personnel in the EU  member countries. As a general goal of  the “Military Erasmus” prominence is giv- en to increased interoperability among  European Armed Forces, development of  the Common Security culture and shar- ing of same values.   •  European Defense Agency (EDA) with  numerous programs that include educa- tional component.  •  European Security and Defense College  (ESDC) as a platform for connecting and  networking of the institutions of higher  level education for Defense and Security  requirements of member states.  •  NATO Security through Science Pro- gramme that contributes to security,  stability and solidarity by application of  science in problem solving.   •  NATO concept of the Centers of Excel- lence that provides for development of  expert opinions in areas that are of core  importance for the Alliance, and in which  a single nation can give its most visible  contribution.   Scientific-research activity (work) will be  primarily developed within Croatian De- fense Academy. Strengthening scientific-    57  teaching potentials concurrently develops  the capability of implementation of the  study programs, as well as the capability  of conducting scientific-research activity,  particularly in areas of special interest,  such as military technology, strategy re- search and military history.  In the other segment, Scientific and Re- search activities will enhance the devel- opment of the functions of articulating  directions and the need for Research and  Development, whereas implementation  will be provided in cooperation with re- search potentials of the civilian sector.  Cooperation will be established with sci- entific institutions within their scope of  work and activities during implementation  of Research and Development projects  needed in Defense field. They will contrib- ute to development of the studies and ex- pert opinions. Research and development  for defense requirements will be directed  toward a specific purpose and in support  of development of the core capabilities.    Lifelong Education and Military Vocational Training  Acquiring competencies should be a con- tinuous process, made relevant through  activities of all forms of learning during  life time and aimed to upgrade knowledge,  skills, independence and responsibility for  professional, social and personal require- ments. Development of an individual dur- ing his/her working life in the Ministry of  Defense and the Armed Forces should be,  not only in function of upgrading overall  capabilities, but also in acquiring compe- tence that can be used for the well-being  of the entire society. It is possible that  an individual acquires competencies and  continues to develop at the end of his/her   military career through use of supportive  Transition programs. Requirements for implementation of mili- tary education in support of professional  development, particularly officer’s, are  significantly greater than the present ca- pacities. Therefore, the level of capabilities  necessary to increase the level needed for  enhancement of the present educational  capacities will be continually developed. For requirements of manning Reserve units  in the later planning period, education of  Reserve officers and NCOs will be initiated. Learning foreign languages will be intensi- fied, both within capacities of the Armed  Forces (Foreign Language Centre, Foreign  Languages Training in units), and through  civilian capacities. Equipping units with  multimedia language classrooms will also  be continued. Validation of the Training efficiency in com- parison to operational/working require- ments will be carried out on regular basis.

To define and adopt the  Concept of Lifelong Educa- tion (by 2016).  To improve publishing and li- brary activities.  To establish priorities and  directions of research for  requirements of the Defen- se Sector (by 2016).  Education and Science Area Tasks Review    59  Training   Training in the Armed forces will be im- plemented on the single doctrinal princi- ples, regardless of whether it is training  for execution of tasks in our country or for  participation in international Peace Sup- port Operations, and it will focus towards  development and maintenance of the ca- pabilities of professional composition and  for practice of the Reserve as a basis for  growth of the Forces. Training priorities in this planning period  will be put on development and mainte- nance of the capabilities for defense of  the national territory and implementation  of the NATO Capability Targets in order  to ensure capabilities for participation in  on-going operations and to maintain the  Level of Ambition regarding participation  of the deployable forces in NRF and EUBG  and other UN/NATO/EU forces. Interoper- ability and development of the operational  capabilities aimed to ensure elements of  Combat Readiness for possible operations  have remained the main training objec- tives. Interoperability will be achieved  through joint training and exercises with  Allies and declared forces will join NATO  components and formations. Special em- phasis will be placed on participation of  the members and units of the Armed forc- es in various forms of multinational train-  ing and practice at all levels. These will  provide intellectual, procedural and techni- cal interoperability and cohesion with Al- lied forces. Training will have an important role in  support to multinational and regional co- operation. Stability and good neighborly  relations will be strengthened through  training, by focusing on support to coun- tries from the Region that expressed in- terest in joining into NATO and/or EU,  passing on their own experiences. Focus  will also be placed on development of the  capabilities to provide support to civilian  institutions in natural, technical and tech- nological disasters.  Development of the Training  System and Improvement of  Training Infrastructure The organization, contents, standards and  methodology of implementing training will  be affected by reform of the Armed Forc- es, application of modern techniques and  technologies that are being introduced  gradually and by establishment of Re- serve composition training. New training  programs will be developed in conform- ity with tactical-technical requirements  of the new equipment and contemporary  tactics, techniques and procedures. Further development and adoption of new   VIII. TRAINING AND DOCTRINE    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  methods and equipping with new training  assets (simulators, simulations, modern  shooting ranges, drill grounds and other  training facilities) will reduce training  costs. However, high level of realism and  challenge will be retained. Capabilities  that are not cost-effective or do not have  relevance of being developed or main- tained independently, will be developed  within NATO initiatives and projects and  in cooperation with partners. For the purpose of development of capa- bilities of the Armed Forces, the projects  of equipping, modernization and construc- tion will be aimed towards development  of the training infrastructure and procure- ment of training aids and assets, mainly  simulators and simulation systems. Drill grounds and shooting ranges will be  built for individual and joint training up to  the level of platoon/company for weap- ons/firearms handling.  Barracks will also be equipped with labs  and training simulators. Conditions will   be created for distance learning aimed to  accelerate gaining of new knowledge and  skills and faster exchange of information. Equipping and modernization projects of  the training infrastructure will be devel- oped as a integral part of the develop- ment projects for the barracks and mili- tary training areas, taking into account  the type, kind and required operational  capabilities of the units. Projects will also  include requests for development of the  training infrastructure that are based on  Allied documents and international agree- ments.  Individual Training  The goal of individual training will be train- ing for a prompt and qualified inclusion in  unit’s training at all levels, integration of  gained knowledge and skills into multi- branch training and taking over the role of  trainers. It is expected of each individual  to adapt to technological progress and  changes in security environment. The fo- cus of individual training will be training  aimed at gaining personal Military-Occu- pational Specialty. Manning of the Armed Forces that is  based on voluntary principle enables train- ing with motivated personnel and an easi- er achievement of the training goals. Basic  military training will be exercised through  voluntary training for all categories of  military personnel. The goal of conduct- ing voluntary military training is to gain  basic military knowledge and skills and to  improve physical and psychological readi- ness for service in the Armed Forces. Training for personal Military Occupation- al Specialty (MOS) will be organized in the  following manner: •  Branch Specialty Training of the Croa-  tian Army will be organized in centers     61  and branch units of the Croatian Army, •  Branch Specialty Training and special-  ties of the Croatian Navy within techni- cal service will be conducted at the Navy  Training Centre, •  Branch Specialty Training and techni-  cal service of the Croatian Air Force and  Air Defense will be carried out in the Air  Force Training Centre, •  for acquiring Military Occupational   Specialty of the Support services and  occupations, logistics training will be  organized in the Logistics Training and  Doctrine Center, •  for acquiring Military Occupational Spe-  cialty of the Signal branch, training will  be organized in the CIS Centre and at the  Signal Battalion of the Croatian Army, •  for acquiring Military Occupational Spe-  cialty of the Military-Intelligence branch,  training will be organized in the Centre  for Intelligence Operations  •  for acquiring Military Occupational Spe-  cialty of the MP branch training will be  organized in the Military Police Regiment.   Centers and branch units that conduct  individual training for acquiring MOS in  the branches/support services are also  responsible for implementing functional  courses and other forms of training of Sol- diers/Seamen, NCOs and officers for the  purpose of their professional development  in the branch/support service.  Collective Training  Collective training (Commander train- ing, Staff training, and unit training) of all  levels will be mission focused and based  on doctrine and experiences of the pre- sent time operations. The goal will be to  attain excellence of the unit as a whole  and readiness for active participation  within the higher level of units. Efficiency   of joint training will be provided through  further equipping with modern teaching  assets and aids, development of training  infrastructure at barracks, drill grounds,  shooting ranges and training areas and  upgraded training for Commander and  Staff. An integrated environment will cre- ate conditions for realistic evaluation and  certification of the units designated for  participation in NATO-led operations and  exercises.   Joint Training  Joint training will be oriented towards  training of the Commands for planning,  conduct and participation in joint opera- tions. Single Commands, units, groups and  individuals will be trained and prepared  accordingly for efficient planning, organi- zation and participation in joint systems.  General Staff will lead the joint training in  the Armed Forces and it will be carried out  through joint exercises.  Training Doctrine of the Armed Forces will  be revised with the particular emphasis on  further decentralization of training.  Reserve Training  Training of Reserve units will be managed according to the same  standards as training of the professional composition, with the em- ployment of the same doctrine and training process. It will differ only in  various degrees of readiness for conduct of the mission.  Focus of the Contract Reserve training will be on an individual, or rather  refresher training and maintaining of individual capabilities and skills  and on pre-deployment training for Peace Support Operations.  Individual training of the Assigned Reserve will be focused on refresher  training of basic soldier’s skills and maintaining of the training for Mili- tary Occupational Specialty, especially of the critical ones. Training of  the units will be concentrated on firing and tactical tasks of the squads  and platoons in addition to conduct of tactical exercises.  Training of the Non-assigned reserve will be composed according to train- ing phases for development of individual capabilities and skills, mainly  basic military skills and training for Military Occupational Specialty.    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Doctrine   Doctrine represents the doctrinal foundation and fundamental princi- ples of operations and a guide for the military forces in support of  national goals. It deals with missions, functions and capabilities and  represents a common frame of reference for operations that are con- ducted or could be conducted in the very near future. Although this  doctrine should be seen in its entirety, and not only as a publication  alone, in this planning period the emphasis will be placed on doctrinal  organization of the entire system that will be obtained through con- sistent doctrinal hierarchy, from the top to the bottom. This will ensure  consistency in using unified terminology and harmonization of doctri- nal standpoints at all levels.  In conformity with defined hierarchy of doctrinal publications, the process  of developing Joint, Functional and Service doctrinal publications will con- tinue. This will also apply to publications that, in terms of their content,  are aimed at integral understanding of military terms and symbols.  Joint and Service doctrinal publications will describe the use of opera- tional component of the Armed Forces in operations (campaigns, major  operations and tactical activities), whereas preparation of the Armed  Forces will be standardized through administrative, technical, training  and teaching publications. An exception is Training Doctrine that will,  although it belongs to the field of preparation of the Armed Forces,  be included in doctrine hierarchy due to the commitment that we will  conduct training in the manner we conduct operations.   By the year 2017 Joint and Service doctri- nal publications will be prepared - ZDP-1:  Croatian Armed Forces Doctrine (2nd edi- tion), ZDP-10: Human Resource Manage- ment, ZDP-35: Special Operations, ZDP- 36: Psychological Operations, ZDP-40:  Logistics Support Doctrine, ZDP-70: Train- ing, DPM-100: Maritime Doctrine, DPK- 200: Land Forces Doctrine, ZDP-S: Mili- tary Symbols, ZDP-30: Joint Operations,  ZDP-50: Operations Planning, and ZDP-60:  Communication and Information Systems. Drafting and adoption of doctrinal and  other publications will be in function of  establishing procedures and processes in  the Armed Forces that are not regulated  by legislative or by-law provisions.  Development of the branch doctrinal pub- lications, particularly those that prescribe  tactics, techniques and procedures of single  commands and units, falls solely within na- tional jurisdiction, while individuals, units and  temporary compositions that have been pre- paring for participation in NATO Command  Structure and Force Structure and NATO led  operations will use original NATO doctrine. By the year 2020 publications will be de- veloped for operations of Naval, Land and  Air Forces or their parts in support of joint  operations, functional joint concepts and  service doctrinal publications for staff func- tions and tactics of the units and employ- ment of the units of service support.  Guidance given through doctrinal publica- tions will be built into teaching and train- ing processes. In that manner, in addition  to adoption and understanding doctrinal  principles, their feasibility and application  in practice will be verified.  Lessons Learned   The process of recognizing, processing  and applying positive experiences/best  practices in the Armed Forces is distinc- tive to a military organization and it is  one of the obligations of the Command- ers and Heads of the organizational units  at all levels. In the forthcoming period, the  system of Lessons Learned with clearly  defined tasks, competencies and respon- sibilities will be established in terms of or- ganization and its structure.  In development of the Lessons Learned  System, focus will be on establishment of  the processes, building structure and de- velopment of tools at all levels that will  contribute to enhancement of the interop- erability of forces, or rather overall develop- ment of the Armed Forces’ capabilities.     63  PRIORITY  LEVEL PLANNING PERIOD   I.

LESSONS LEARNED   By the end of 2017 By the end of 2020 By the end of 2024 To build the capability for  Lessons Learned that con- sists of: - establishment of the   process  - building structure  -  development of the tools in   support to the process that  enables monitoring of the  development of  observa- tion into recognized and  learned lesson:  -  Lessons Learned database  (LLDB)  -  gateway for exchange of  Lessons Learned    To establish business  processes in the field of  Lessons Learned, to simplify  procedures and to remove  excessive complexity, over- lapping and lengthiness of  the observation process and  to bring forward and deter- mine the model of observa- tion (2015).  To increase the number of  Staff Officers for Lessons  Learned, to plan positions  in new organization for  Staff Officers for Lessons  Learned to the level of  independent battalion (by  the end of 2018).   To maintain the achieved  capability for Lessons  Learned and to establish  a Learning Organization,  Knowledge Management  from the scope of its  work and from experi- ences of other organiza- tional entities and from  other NATO members.  To insert in the Curricula at  all levels of sequential-pro- gressive education contents  of familiarization  with the  process of Lessons Learned  and thus upgrade the level  of training for conduct, par- ticipation and monitoring the  process of Lessons Learned   To advance and upgrade  the Lessons Learned  Database (transition to  Shared Point), for monitor- ing the state and develop- ment of the observation  into Lessons Learned (by  the end of 2018).  To introduce Long-Term  Planning based on realisti- cally available funds for  implementation and applica- tion of the Lessons Learned  System (2015).    65  Despite improvements that have been  made in single areas in recent years, in  reference to implemented projects of  Equipping and Modernization, material as- sets and equipment at the disposal of the  Armed Forces are at present partly obso- lete. That affects efficiency and hinders full  interoperability with the Allies. Due to the complex process of procurement  and modernization and lengthy service life  of the weaponry and military equipment,  decisions that are made regarding Equip- ping and Modernization of the Armed Forc- es will significantly affect capabilities in the  forthcoming 30 years and more.  Limited funds for defense requirements  have resulted in decisions on retaining or  abandoning certain capabilities. Some of  the capabilities have already been sig- nificantly limited and without new invest- ments in Equipment or Modernization,  they would practically be lost. With the  aim to retain key capabilities and bear- ing in mind the uncertainty of long-term  challenges of the Security environment,  plans will also be developed for Equipping  and Modernization to begin at the end of  the planning period. Their completion and  financial effect mostly extend to the next  planning period. Projects that are singled  out due to their high financial demands  and due to the importance of the capa- bilities that are realized within them are:  1. Croatian Army   a. Armored Vehicles •  A total of 48 tanks will be retained in   operational use in the Armed Forces  and they will be subjected to revision  process; one Tank Company will be   modernized; •  End of equipping and phasing into op-  erational use of the APC Patria with  other weapon and military systems  (anti-armor system, remote weapon  station of 30 mm, communication  equipment); •  Maintenance and modernization of the   infantry combat vehicle BVP M-80, in- cluding modernization with new anti- armor systems; •  Equipping with new mobile anti-armor   system.  b.

Equipping with Air Defense sys- tem of mid-range.  Equipping and Modernization policy  is oriented towards development and  maintenance of the targeted capabilities  of the Armed Forces defined by basic  documents in Defense Sector. Addition- ally, equipping and modernization policy  will include monitoring and analyzing  possibilities of national and foreign ca- pacities involvement in equipping and  modernization processes.  Priorities in equipping and modernization  are aimed at achieving and maintaining  the capabilities in support of the mis- sions and tasks of the Armed Forces, re- alization of the NATO Capability Targets  and completion of the initiated projects. Equipping and modernization will be im- plemented in accordance with require- ments, technical and economic validity  of requirement, available budget alloca-  tions and applicable regulations. Wher- ever possible manufacturing capacities  of the domestic Defense Industry as the  sources of equipping and modernization  will be taken into consideration to the  maximum extent as well as international  agreements under which equipping and  modernization could be realized through  donation or procurement of weapons  and military equipment under favorable  financial conditions.  As one of the methods of financing  equipping and modernization, consid- eration will also be given to the possi- bility of using EU funds (EU funding for  Dual Use), with focus on procurement of  equipment necessary for development  and achievement of the targeted capa- bilities of using Armed Forces in support  of civilian structures.  Research and Development in support of  equipping and modernization will be im- plemented in cooperation with Croatian  scientific research institutions, as well  as institutions of NATO and European  Defense Agency. Their resources and po- tentials can contribute to research and  development of weapons and military  equipment for the Ministry of Defense  and the Armed Forces. In addition, coop- eration with NATO institutions and Euro- pean Defense Agency will be considered  as well. Their developmental projects  for weapons and military equipment are  available and of interest for develop- ment and achieving of the targeted ca- pabilities of the Armed Forces. Projects of equipping and modernization  shown in the Long Term Development  Plan are mostly divided in two priority  levels, and some in three levels. Projects  of the first level represent absolute prior- ity because they comprise projects that     67  are of key importance in building capa- bilities, through which NATO Capability  Targets are reached. Therefore, they are  necessary for the efficient execution of  the missions and tasks. Projects of the  second priority level are important for  Armed Forces activities; they upgrade  capabilities, and affect dynamics and  quality of single capabilities. However,  the scope and dynamics of their realiza- tion are to the certain degree subject to  corrections. Priorities of the third level  are subject to significant corrections in  the scope and dynamics of realization.  Croatian Army Priorities  The priority of the Croatian Army is mod- ernization and equipping of the key ma- neuver units of the Armed Forces. In the  period till the year 2020 priority will be  given to equipping of the Mechanized  Guard Brigade and that represents a di- rect contribution to realization of the  NATO Capability Targets. The second  priority in the period till the year 2020  is equipping other declared units. In the  period from 2021 till the end of 2024  and even beyond that period, projects  of equipping and modernization of the  Guards Armored-Mechanized Brigade will  be initiated as indispensable for retaining  and increasing the level of its capabilities.  Infantry Weapons and Equipment  The quantities of serviceable infantry  weapons in the Armed Forces meet re- quirements of the proposed structure.  These weapons are technologically ob- solete and their calibers and mainte- nance requirements do not provide for  harmonization of the operational activi-  ties with the Armed Forces of NATO and  EU members.  In the previous planning period the  Armed Forces began equipping with the  new VHS assault rifle and accompanying  equipment (of NATO caliber) in a quantity  of 6,000 pieces. Equipping will continue  in the first two planning periods in order  to complete equipping of the CAF Active  Duty component by late 2020. Equipping  of the CAF Reserve component with the  VHS assault rifle is planned for the third  planning period.   By late 2020 it is necessary to equip other units of the Croatian Army  declared for the NATO Pool of Forces with machine guns and uni- versal machine guns of NATO caliber. Equipping of the Active Duty  component with this type of weapon should be completed by the end  of the entire planning period. Given the fact that the Armed Forces  have no ammunition of NATO caliber in stock, along with procure- ment of the new assault rifles, machine guns and light machine guns,  it is necessary to equip the CAF with accompanying ammunition.   Within the planning period, priority is  given to continued equipping the troops  with individual equipment until the  Armed Forces are fully equipped, includ- ing renewal of the following equipment:  camouflage uniforms with digital press,  military boots and combat helmets,  combat modular vests, backpacks and  individual night vision devices. CAF  units declared for NATO and EU op- erations should be equipped to oper- ate under extreme weather conditions.  The project of equipping troops with  upgraded systems of performance, pro- tection and communication will begin  in the second part of the planning pe- riod. Priority in equipping with infantry  weapons and equipment will be given  to units scheduled for deployment to  NATO / EU operations.     T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Support Artillery  The Armed Forces are equipped with ar- tillery weapons of various origin and ca- liber (105, 120, 122, 130, 152, 155 mm).  They are technologically obsolete; com- puting of the initial elements is slow as  well as correction of fire and velocity of  reaction. Features regarding range and  precision are also unsatisfactory.  In view of the new requested capabili- ties, it is necessary to begin a process of  equipping with new artillery systems of  unified 155 mm caliber. In that way, mo- bility and interoperability in joint opera- tions with NATO and EU forces members  will be increased. Putting new artillery  systems into operational use will enable  implementation of the NATO Capabil- ity Targets to operate at distances up  to 40 km by using various types of pre- cise ammunition, fire control system and  exchange of information with Partners.  Equipping and putting the system into  operational use will be completed by the  year 2019, and full operational capability  will be reached by the year 2022.   Anti-Armor Combat Assets Armed Forces are equipped with ob- solete anti-armor systems of unsatis- factory performance regarding range,  guidance and penetrability. Anti-armor  guided missile system (POVRS) has a  range of 2, 5 km, and mobile anti-armor  system Maljutka has been declared non- prospective.  The capability of anti-tank combat will  be upgraded in the forthcoming period  by equipping of the armored personal  carrier Patria (APC), with modern anti- tank systems of the 3rd generation. Re- placement of the mobile systems Fagot  and Metis with more advanced ones will  be also taken into consideration, or the  existing systems will be equipped with  modern/advanced ammunition of great- er range and greater penetrability and  easier launching of anti-tank projectiles.   Armor Assets Armed Forces are equipped with the tank  M-84, which has (after the revision pro- cess) fulfilled requirements for the plan- ning period.  Mechanized infantry of the Croatian  Army is equipped with full tracked infan- try combat vehicle BVP M80A for which  modernization will be considered at the  end of the planning period. Equipping with modern armor vehicle  on wheels APC Patria (in 7 various ver- sions) and phasing into operational use  of 126 carriers will end in the year 2016.  The combat armor vehicle (BOV) will be  equipped with modern communication  system and remote controlled machine  gun of 12, 7 mm caliber. By the end of  2016 part of the vehicles will be equipped  with remote controlled gun of 30 mm ca- liber and advanced anti-armor system.    69  Light Armor Vehicle (Combat) By the end of 2017 equipping and phas- ing into operational use of the light  armor vehicles (M-ATV, MRAP) will be  carried out in cooperation with bilateral  partner.   Air Defense Assets Weapons of the Croatian Army comprise  of Air Defense guns of 20 mm caliber,  self-propelled surface to air missile sys- tems S-10 CRO and S-10M and shoulder  launched “IGLA” and “S2M” light missile  systems.  All artillery AD systems as well as man- portable, shoulder-fired low altitude  surface-to-air missile system S-2M have  been proclaimed non-prospective. For re- quirements of the Air Defense capability  for protection of maneuver units, Croa- tian Army will be equipped with systems  of short range for Air Defense of the ma- neuver units (MANPADS).  Engineering Assets  The existing bridging and pontoon as- sets and equipment are tactically and  technically outdated and are not meet- ing the new requirements. Consequently,  there is a high level of malfunctioning,  high maintenance costs and the inability  to provide full engineering combat sup- port in the segment of ensuring mobility  of the maneuver units in operations.  In conformity with the new operational  requirements for maintaining operation- al tempo in high mobility operations, in  the forthcoming period priority for the  Armed Forces will be to finish equipping  of the declared Engineering forces for  NATO (one Platoon and one Company  for general engineering support, one  platoon for engineering combat support   and one EOD platoon) with engineering  machines, trucks, EOD equipment and  special EOD vehicles. The Armed Forces  will also begin equipping with new en- gineering systems necessary for reali- zation of the accepted NATO Capability  Targets.  Signal Assets and Systems  The priority in the forthcoming period  will be equipping of the Croatian Army  units with assets that provide conditions  for implementation of the NATO Capa- bility Targets. Signal assets and systems  will also be provided simultaneously with  the equipping with combat armor vehi- cles, self-propelled artillery systems, light  armor combat vehicles, Air Defense sys- tems and BVP vehicles.  NBCD Assets and Equipment Resource life cycle has expired for most of the personal Nuclear,  Biological and Chemical protective equipment (PPE), self-protection  and personal decontamination assets. Priority in the forthcoming  period will be given to equipping of the Armed Forces units with  individual protective equipment, treatments for the first self-help,  dosimeter, and equipment for personal decontamination of the skin,  clothes, personal gear and personal weapons as well as equipping of  the multifunctional NBC protection platoon.  The adopted Capability Targets also involve obligation of providing  networked chemical and radiological point-detectors, deployable as- sets for collective protection against NBC agents/hazards and as- sets for establishment and development of the NBC Warning and  Reporting System.

To complete equipping troops with  individual optoelectronic devices  and night vision devices and gear  for severe weather conditions.     71  Croatian Navy Priorities  Croatian Navy will be developed as a  navy with a limited range of combat ca- pabilities focused on Defense and Crises  Management. Firstly, it will develop ca- pabilities that are recognized as critically  important for conduct of the basic mis- sions of the defense and protection of  national interests at sea. These are:  •  Capability to act against surface targets,  •  Capability for mine and anti-mine op-  erations,  •  Capability for Command and Control,   Information-Communication network- ing, data gathering and sea monitoring.   Having in mind the responsibility of the  Croatian Navy for the safety at sea in  peace-time, the priority of equipping  and modernization of the Croatian Navy  is aimed at developing the capability of  the Coast Guard through continuation of  the project of equipping the Coast Patrol  Boats. By the year 2017 another two projects  have been defined as priority-projects:  (1) Achieving full capability of control of  the sea surface through modernization  of the radar system Enhanced Peregrine  and procurement of the alternate radars  for obsolete GEM radars. The priority of  this project is to achieve integration of   Equipping with equipment and  Role 1 assets.

It will also give support  to execution of the Coast Guard’s mis- sions, helicopter air transportation, sup- port to paratrooper training and light air  transportation, support to aerial fire-fight- ing, aeronautical-technical logistic support  to its own forces and Allied forces as well;   execute all types of training of individuals  and units for conduct of missions of the  Armed forces’ services in the Republic of  Croatia and in Peace Support Operations  and assistance to civilian institutions in  the Republic of Croatia. As the service life cycle of the overhauled  airplanes MiG-21 expires by the end of  2024, the priority is to find a permanent  solution for protection of the air space.  Possible solution for protection of the air  space lays in development of the multina- tional approach based on the principles of  cooperation, sharing resources and capa-  II.

Decisi- on regarding possibilities and modalities  for development of this capability will be  made by the end of 2016.  Having in mind specific features of the  existing transport helicopter capabili- ties that are currently in operational use,  during the planning period consideration  will be given to options and modalities  for replacement of transport helicop- ters, and depending on the resources, for  the beginning of the process of transi- tion and introduction of new helicopters  which will ensure sustainability of the  CAF transport helicopter capabilities.  In addition to the above stated, within  the framework of available programs  of cooperation with strategic partners,  possibilities will be further explored for  continuous improvement of the overall  helicopter capabilities by putting into op- erational use other types of helicopters  in addition to transport helicopters. Such  projects will be implemented if they  would present a significant contribution  to the overall capabilities of the Armed  Forces and if at the same time they  would not create such a resource burden  that could affect the implementation of  other planned projects.    75   PRIORITY  LEVEL  PLANNING PERIOD   By the end of 2017 By the end of 2020 By the end of 2024  I.

Informa- tization of the Command and Control  System (C2) is among the priorities at  tactical, operational and strategic level.  Such systems integrate traditional distri- bution in stationary and deployable (mo-  bile) systems. Integration of information  from other sources and sensors has also  progressively developed. Informatization  of the single processes in the Ministry of  Defense and the Armed Forces has been  carried out with continuity.

Support Command Priorities  Overview of the Support Command Equipping and Modernization Projects of  the Support Command    77  tion will be given to security and defense  of that system. Building of an integral  system will be carried out gradually and it  will include integration, optimization and  consolidation of the existing systems and  upgrading of their capabilities.  The framework for construction of  the Communication-Information sys- tem comprises a mobile system, the  system of basic and the system of  functional services. The mobile sys- tem includes technical levels of signal  transmission, and the system of basic  services includes those services that  are common for the entire Defense  field. They contain systems for trans- mission of messages and circulation of  documents, systems for text process- ing, systems of identity authorization  and verification and access to other  basic services. Functional part of the  system is specific for single functional  areas and it is built on basis of the ser- vices and capabilities of the database  and of the basic layer.   The focus on development will be placed  on consolidation and modernization of  the mobile system and the system of ba- sic services on which functional services  will perform.  Functional services will be built accord- ing to requirements of single functional  areas and in conformity with solutions  that are accepted and used by NATO.  Applications will be developed with the  aim to be mutually open for data ex- change and open for capabilities to con- nect with adequate systems of the Allied  countries.  In the Defense Sectors worldwide an in- creasing importance has been given to  the defense of the information area, due  to the growing importance of the Com-  munication-Information systems and  their vulnerability. Systems for defense  of the communication-information sys- tem will be developed in Defense Sector.   Development of the information systems and their modernization  and consolidation will ensure the basic elements of information  systems reliability: confidentiality (secrecy), integrity and continued  availability and elements of their security as, for example, authenti- cation (verification of identity), authorization (verification of authori- zation) and irrevocability of all transactions in the entire informa- tion system of the Defense Sector. This requires development and  constant upgrading of the system of cryptographic protection and  digital signature throughout the entire Communication-Information  System according to the level of secrecy.  Modernization of Data Centers makes the specific part of infor- mation protection and defense of the IT space that will allow for  more efficient physical and technical protection of the file Server  and other central network equipment, as well as for security of data  and information systems. Building of the detached Redundant Data  Centre will allow for separate secure Data Backup and Data Recov- ery systems, as special security function of the information systems  against threats that could come either from the information area  (Cyber attack) or classical kinetic attack or rather natural threat to  the Data Centre. At the same time, this will also correct or remove  observed deficiencies of the current Data Centre.   In addition to stationary and deployable  communication capabilities, a system  will be developed that allow communica- tion (voice and data) with members of  the Ministry of Defense and the Armed  Forces who are deployed on assign- ments abroad, either in missions and op- erations or on Defense Attaché duties or  similar tasks.  In order to achieve these goals it will  be necessary to continuously carry out  equipping and modernization of the ex- isting Communication-Information Sys- tems that have progressively short life  cycle before becoming technologically  obsolete.

Continuous, quality, reliable and suffi- cient protection for all types of the Com- munication-Information services will be  necessary in the area of fixed communi- cations, mobile communications (mobile  GSM networks, mobile radio networks),  satellite communications and all types  of information services and services that  use networks for data transmission. This   includes equipping with assets and sig- nal systems earmarked for troops, team  leaders, commanders of all levels, as well  as systems that provide contribution to  the common operational picture, distri- bution of data in real time and use of  indispensable functional services. In addition to the modernization of  equipment and consolidation of the data  and processes, high level of expertise of  the specific cadre and organizational so- lutions of their positioning in the system  must be ensured.

These military properties  are categorized as follows:  •  prospective military properties (proper-  ties built for military purpose, utilized by  the Ministry of Defense), •  temporarily prospective military proper-  ties (properties that are built for military  purpose and used by the Ministry of De- fense, and are in the process of being   abandoned), and •  Non-prospective military properties   (properties built for military purpose and  not utilized by the Ministry of Defense).  Through the rationalization process of uti- lizing military properties, the Ministry of  Defense will use only prospective proper- ties whereas all non-prospective and tem- porarily prospective military properties  (after abandonment) will be given to the  management by the State Office for State  Property Management. By the transfer of the non-prospective and  temporarily prospective military proper- ties, the Ministry of Defense will reduce  the costs of passive standby regime, pro- tection, and guarding of such properties   whereas the State Office for State Prop- erty Management may initiate the pro- cedure of their conversion to for different  utilization in accordance with the physical  planning documentation.  Course of Development in  the Area of Facilities and           Infrastructure  Construction, renovation and reconstruction  of the facilities and the infrastructure at the  locations that are foreseen for the planned  deployment of the Armed Forces will mainly  adhere to the principle that main barracks  having no capacity for development for  more than 2000 persons and do not have  exercise areas or training facilities will be  considered to be non-prospective. With the  purpose to increase effectiveness, at pro- spective locations, first of all the accom- modation capacities, training and logistics  in training areas and barracks will be im- proved. The total number of non-prospec- tive properties will be rationalized and the  abandoning and transfer of non-prospec- tive properties will be intensified aiming at  decreasing the costs for their insurance and  maintenance. The standards of work, accommodation and  training at the prospective locations will be  raised continually, and the renovation of the  facilities will be in accordance with the legal   X. FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE    81  regulations of the Republic of Croatia in the  field of physical planning, construction, fire  protection, work safety, environment pro- tection and technical safety. Systems of technical safety for protec- tion of military locations will be built dur- ing the construction of new facilities and  reconstruction of the existing buildings  and infrastructure, which enables ration- alization of military personnel guarding  military locations. In order to achieve faster accommoda- tion of the Armed Forces at prospective  military locations, the concept of building  housing facilities, logistic and other facili- ties in the form of prefabricated, modular  buildings and fast build systems.  During construction, reconstruction, and  adaptation, the Energy Efficiency and  Waste Management procedures will be  applied. Funding will be accomplished  through Environmental Protection and  Energy Efficiency Fund subvention for  building and reconstruction of military fa- cilities. Biomass Energy Plants will be de- signed and built at military training ranges  and other military locations where there  are resources and possibilities of biomass  preparation.  In the upcoming planning period the focus  will be on rationalization and downsizing  of non-prospective properties through the  following actions: •  transfer of non-prospective properties to   the State Office for State Property Man- agement,  •  selling the part of military properties in   accordance with the legal prerequisites,  and  •  increasing and centralizing accommoda-  tion capacities, administrative, storing,  training and other capacities, as well  as through targeted move of the Armed   Forces for which building and organizing  of the needed capacities at the prospec- tive locations is  required.  Pursuant to the Act on Management and  Disposal of the Property Owned by the Re- public of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense  is no longer required to pay utility fee  which reduces the costs of using prospec- tive properties.  The financial means obtained from selling  non-prospective and temporarily prospec- tive military properties will be invested in  the modernization of the Ministry of De- fense infrastructure. The European Union funds and other pos- sible resources will be taken into consid- eration when financing projects of infra- structure building and modernization.  Military Geographic Information System  Military Geographic Information System will develop topographic and cartographic database of geospatial data  for the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and printed charts of new  military topographic maps in the range of 1:50.000 and 1:250.000  scale in accordance with NATO standards. The goal of Military Geo  Information System is to equip the Armed Forces with updated, digital,  standardized, functional and interoperable geospatial data. Geospatial  data obtained through the project of the Military Geographic Infor- mation System are in direct support of the NATO Capability Targets.  Standardization of geospatial data and products, will allow their ex- change with other NATO members.

The present  concept of the logistic support has been  developed through the transformation and  abandonment of the territorial placement  and organizational structure of the Armed  Forces. The main features of this system  are numerous stationary logistic elements  that offer logistic support in the barracks,  mobile capacities of field logistics and  abandonment of certain logistic activi- ties and some of civil logistics personnel   separation. Food services, catering and  cleaning have been singled out and are  now being performed by newly established  company Pleter-usluge d.o.o. and the over- haul tasks are being done by Aeronautics  Technical Centre Ltd.  Logistics system has fulfilled the require- ments of accomplishing tasks on the ter- ritory of the Republic of Croatia, while the  field logistics capabilities have not been  fully developed in accordance with the  planning. The process of abandoning lo- gistics catering services has not ended yet  and more civil persons have been retained  than previously planned.  Goals of the Logistics      System Development   The goal is to develop the process orient- ed, reliable and adaptable logistics system  with greater emphasis on mobile capaci- ties of field logistics and more efficient  lifecycle management of combat tech- nique. Logistics system will acquire new  capabilities regarding the integration of  new combat resources that are obtained  through the equipping programs.  Rationalization of the organizational  structure will be conducted and similar lo- gistic activities will be linked together and  that way the number of personnel will be  decreased and their competencies will be   XI. LOGISTICS SYSTEM    89  equaled/balanced. Greater efficiency will  be achieved, resource e expenditure will  be reduced, supplies will be optimized, and  the quality of logistic information will be  raised. Moreover, the speed of their ex- change will be increased and the capabili- ties for integration into collective logistics  will be enhanced in accordance to NATO  Logistics Doctrine.  The objectives of the Logistics Systems  development are: 1.  To ensure the logistics readiness and   continuation of logistics support to the  Armed Forces pertinent to missions,  tasks and the level of ambition;  2.  To rationalize logistics support by inte- gration of logistic activities and appli- cation of new organizational solutions;  3.  To optimize logistics processes in the  Ministry of Defense and the Armed  Forces by developing logistic standards  and criteria, codification, quality con- trol, and automatization of the logistics  information exchange process;  4.  To reform the procurement system and  supply chain management;  5.  To maintain combat resources in terms  of readiness requirements;  6.  To develop capabilities for operations  within collective logistics.  Logistics Readiness  Logistic readiness refers to the timely  availability of armament and military  equipment, availability of classes of sup- plies, efficiency of the procurement sys- tem and the sustainability capability of the  forces participating in operations. Capa- bility of the logistics system is expressed  through the ratio of logistics readiness  in relation to the amount of invested fi- nancial resources. Funding for logistics   support is intended for maintenance of  armament and military equipment, energy  supplies, accommodation, food and other  types of logistics support. In the past five  years, financial means invested in logistic  support had a tendency of decreasing and  amounted to an average of less than 15%  of Defense Budget. In order to keep logis- tic readiness according to its missions and  tasks, and to enable logistics to respond  to challenges and needs while supporting  the Armed Forces, the objective is to keep  the logistic share at the same level in the  following three years, and after that to  gradually increase to optimal 20% of the  overall value of Defense Budget.  Rationalization of Logistics Support  Personnel structure will be balanced within combat support services,  i.e., the number of personnel will be downsized in Army Service Corps,  construction and transport services. Technical and medical service will  be improved by intensified specialization of capabilities and capaci- ties corresponding with the major requirements of combat service and  combat service support. Measures and ways of rationalization of logis- tics system organization are as follows:   •  Transfer of the remaining operational and technical functions of lo-  gistics support from the Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the  Armed Forces to the Armed Forces units which will be accomplished  in accordance with changes of Regulations on Material Procurement  of the Armed Forces; •  Logistics functions of procurement will be unified as well as transport   and construction support in the Support Command which will be ac- complished within the re-organization of the Ministry of Defense and  the Armed Forces;  •  Downsizing of personnel working within stationary logistics system in   all combat service support units.  •  Abandonment of tasks related to direct maintenance and logistics   support to units and locations of the military facilities. Infrastructure  maintenance and military facility management will be outsourced to  contractors, and the existing personnel will be reorganized within the  existing or within a new company.    T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  Optimization of Logistics Processes Optimization will contribute to faster and more efficient logistics sys- tem that will remove redundant parallel activities at several manage- ment levels. The goal is to establish a process, organization and func- tioning of logistics and to clearly define the purpose and tasks of the  organizational units. This will be achieved by several measures and  ways through the procedure of procurement, acquisition and distribu- tion, by defining and informatisation of process documentation as well  as through the better contracting of logistics support including the  contracting abroad. Within the optimization of the logistics system,  the following initiatives have been taken:  •  Optimization of public procurement  through harmonizing competencies and  responsibilities of organizational units  and by conducting automated opera- tional-technical communication within  procurement procedure. The objective is  to obtain and maintain complete trans- parency of public procurement and to  shorten the duration of procedures for  obtaining funding for the Armed Forces  including procurement in the Area of  Operations. •  Reform of the standards of materiel sup-  plying. Legal and regulatory framework  of materiel supplying will be reformed in  view of future cooperation with business  entities of domestic military industry and  providers of logistic support services. The  goals of equipment and modernization  will be linked to the strategy of equipping  with the purpose of better cooperation  of all state institutions involved in pro- curement of combat systems. In terms of  increasing international defense cooper- ation, the strategy of equipping will bring  harmonized and a unique approach of  all national stakeholders being a part of  the international Defense market. There  will be a transparent decision making on  the procurement of combat systems and  their efficiency.  •  Codification and optimization of the  procurement and distribution system  and the inventory monitoring. The new  procurement system based on mod- ern codification and informatization is  introduced with the purpose of afford- able management of the resources and  shortened period of distribution to a unit  as the end user. The goal is to reform the  Codification System in accordance with  NATO standards, and to develop organi- zational and technical capacities in the  Ministry of Defense for the systematic  codification of weaponry and military  equipment.   •  Implementation of the Quality Manage-  ment System in accordance with NATO  standards. The purpose is to conduct  weaponry and military equipment quality  management in its entire life cycle. The  implementation of the Quality Manage- ment System will bring better technical  specification for procurement and main- tenance, more transparent procurement  procedure, better quality equipment and  weaponry procurement for the Armed  Forces in terms of the invested money  and greater interoperability of military  equipment and weaponry. •  Automatization of the logistic informa-  tion exchange and the knowledge about  logistic situational awareness informa- tion is a basic prerequisite for the plan- ning of the logistics support. Therefore,  it is necessary to develop logistics in- formation system that will give logistics  information and be compatible within a  unique information system of the De- fense Sector. With the purpose of logis- tic operational reporting at the national  level, the NATO program tools will be  used. Implementation of logistic infor- mation system will enable the complete     91  control and visibility of material assets  and will support material and financial  operations in the Ministry of Defense  and the Armed Forces.  Supply and Supply Chain      Management  The goal of material inventory manage- ment is to reduce the cost of obtaining  and keeping the supplies by providing lo- gistic readiness of the Armed Forces.  Supply of Fuel and Lubricants. The  goal is to enable independent activities of  the Armed Forces in the period of 30 days  through their planning, storing and distri- bution system. A strategic and operational  level location is designated for storing the  fuel and lubricant supplies and several lo- cations are being designated at the tacti- cal level. The goal is to build and improve  the conditions for safe storage of fuel and  oil derivatives in compliance with the Envi- ronment Protection standards.  In the next planning period, the implemen- tation of the Concept of One Type of Fuel  in the Armed Forces will be finalized. The  Armed Forces will withdraw the majority of  the equipment that uses petrol as a fuel. Supplies of Lethal Ordnance. The goal  is to ensure funds for the procurement of  new lethal ordnance by decreasing the  costs of keeping the inventory. Lethal ord- nance reserve will be optimized according  to caliber and types and the total of the  required quantities. By the end of 2017 all  perspective lethal ordnance will be kept in  the functional storage facilities with high  standards of counter-explosive protection  and environment protection. In modern  warehouses better atmospheric conditions  are achieved with which resource life cycle  is prolonged and the costs of maintenance   are optimized as well as the reliability of  lethal ordnance. NATO standards will be  respected in dealing with lethal ordnance. Supplies for the Reserve Compo- nent. Strategic Defense Review has fore- seen the establishing of mechanisms for  the enhancement of Defense Capabilities  by developing the Reserve component for  which the weaponry and equipment will  be obtained and stored. This means that  needs/requirements should be defined  and logistics requirements fulfilled at the  national level. All material resources for  the needs of the Assigned Reserve will be  stored by the Support Command. Func- tional storage and garage facilities will be  built in the perspective barracks for stor- ing and keeping the weaponry and basic  means for the Reserve component. Logistic Distribution Center. In order  to reduce the costs of storage and dis- tribution, a Central Logistic Distribution  Center will be built in Zagreb. The objec- tive is to achieve organizational savings  in personnel and decrease of operational  costs in distribution and manning.  Moreo- ver, better overview of the inventory will  be achieved as well as monitoring of the     T H E  C R O AT I A N  A R M E D  F O R C E S  L O N G − T E R M  D E V E L O P M E N T  P L A N  2 0 1 5  −  2 0 2 4  inventory and the status of military equip- ment taken out. The costs of storing the supplies of medi- cal material and equipment will be ana- lyzed and consequently, the surpluses will  be determined, the obsolete items will be  defined as well as the way of their dispos- ing in affordable and ecologically accept- able way.  Maintenance of Combat Assets   The goal is to improve the present way of maintenance in conceptual  and organizational terms. The integrated model of quality keeping for  certain technical means or platform and upgrading in its life cycle will  be established. Maintenance capacities will be organized in accord- ance with specific maintenance procedure conducted by the staff and  users of material resources, organic logistic units for maintenance,  and Support Command units for maintenance, Depot Overhaul Center  or outside suppliers of maintenance services. The emphasis will be on  military capacities for the overall maintenance of all types of weap- ons whereas the maintenance of other technique will be conducted  by combined military and civilian capacities of maintenance.  Military capacities and maintenance capabilities will be defined for  the designated preventive maintenance and repair of combat tech- nique and means in field conditions as well as for the repair shop  maintenance and servicing. The size and the distribution of capacities  will be determined according to the types and number of technique  that are being maintained including technical means for the Reserve  component.   The capacities for wider repair shop main- tenance and overhaul of combat platforms  will be developed in Economic Sector  through the program of strategic partner- ship and will be provided by contract. The  Armed Forces will develop technical and  engineer capabilities for the quality con- trol of the work in civil maintenance com- panies. The capacities of the maintenance  of technical materials for civil purpose and  the overhaul of non-combat vehicles will  not be developed.    Depot Overhaul Center of the Support  Command will be transformed having the  capacities of maintenance and overhaul  of combat vehicles, weaponry, target and  measuring devices, military electronics  and capabilities of weapons modifica- tion except for the vessel artillery weap- onry and platforms. In the Depot Overhaul  Center there will be new capabilities for  technical testing, measurements, assess- ments, control and other expertise of the  weaponry and lethal ordnance, expertise  to test the reliability of weapons and  technical expertise in management pro- cesses of the life cycle of the combat  systems. Depot Overhaul Center will pro- vide military and technical assistance to  the Ministry of Defense and the General  Staff and participate in programs of Re- search and Development in cooperation  with civilian scientific and technical insti- tutions. Maintenance of ships and other  naval technical resources will be carried  out mainly by entities from the corporate  sector, with the exception of specific as- sets to be maintained in the Croatian  Navy capacities.  Organization of aviation maintenance will  be implemented in accordance with the  regulations governing the airworthiness  and maintenance of military aircraft. Ca- pacities for maintenance in the Air Force  and Air Defense will be modernized and  rationalized through specialization and  optimization. Aeronautical Technical In- stitute is a strategic partner in the main- tenance of military aircraft and its engi- neering.  The integration of new weapons systems  that are introduced in the Armed Forces  will require systematic rethinking of or- ganizational solutions and establishing of  structures that will be responsible for the     93  logistic support of the new systems, the  capacities for the maintenance and loca- tions of these capacities. The Croatian  Army and The Support Command shall be  organized in a way to enable capacities  for maintenance and servicing and the  light overhaul of Armored Personnel car- rier Patria and all Mine-Resistant Ambush  Protected vehicles (MRAPs).   Capabilities to Operate as a  Part of Collective Logistics  The Armed Forces will not develop all lo- gistics capacities for logistics support  and sustainability within the operations  abroad. According to the principles of cost  effectiveness and cooperation, and in ac- cordance with NATO Logistics Doctrine,  comprehensive logistics support is pro- vided through collective logistics. In ac- cordance with the tasks and the overall  Capability Targets of the Armed Forces,  national capabilities of the non-stationary  (mobile) logistics will be developed. The  Logistics units will be equipped with mo- bile logistics modules. For those logistics  capabilities that cannot be developed by  the Republic of Croatia, multinational solu- tions will be found. Therefore, the Armed  Forces will intensify cooperation with lo- gistics agencies and other organizations  of NATO and the EU.  The Republic of Croatia will not develop its  own strategic transport capabilities, but,  by participating in NATO and other inter- national initiatives, bilateral agreements  and commercial contracts, it will ensure  timely access to facilities of strategic de- ployment, in accordance with the needs  and decisions on the engagement of the  units of the Armed Forces outside Croa- tian territory.   Development of Medical Support Capabilities   The development of medical support capabilities will focus on provid- ing continuous medical and veterinary protection for the needs of all  activities and planned goals of the Armed Forces target capabilities  alongside with the rationalization of material and human resources.  Combat branches develop their own medical support. The lowest tacti- cal levels will train and organize Combat Rescue Team as additional  combat capability with their task to provide emergency first response  until the arrival of professional medical help. Special operation units will  train and organize combat medics. Medical support of the maneuver  units will be carried out primarily relying on the organic unit at the Role  1 level that provides health care for their members in the Theatre of  Operations. For the purpose of providing medical support to the activi- ties and tasks of the Support Command and providing medical support  to the units that do not have their own elements of medical support,  the Military Health Center has been established as a military health  institution. Military Health Center is responsible for the implementa- tion of health care at the primary level and specific health care, and is  responsible for the development of medical support at the Role 2 level. Through the project of equipping and modernization the pool of vehi- cles will be expanded and modernized having medical equipment in ac- cordance with applicable standards, and the Role 1 maneuver units will  be equipped. Military Health Center will carry out veterinary preventive  activities and veterinary care for service animals and will continuously  monitor monitoring of safety and hygienic standards of food, water  and work surfaces at home and abroad.   Military Health Center will have capabilities  of deploying individuals and teams to sup- port the conduct of operations and other  specific activities of the Armed Forces at  home and abroad, especially in cases when  it comes to operations of consequence  management/mitigation of impacts of  natural and technical disasters.  Proper training capabilities will be de- veloped as well as training programs for  medical staff and personnel who provide  health care support, primarily in the Lo- gistics Doctrine and Training Center of the  Support Command as well as in other or- ganizational units of the Armed Forces.

The starting point of this Plan is to stop  the multi-year trend of falling Defense  Budget and to keep it, in the initial three  year period, within the real amount at  the level of the year 2014. Financial  analysis and assessments from the ex- isting perspective suggests that in order  to complete the project and reach the  capabilities defined by this Plan, in the  next 10 year period, the defense fund- ing should amount to at least 48 bil- lion Kuna. Therefore, the objective is to   maintain the existing level of Defense  Budget within real amount until 2017,  and together with the economic recovery  and GDP growth make prerequisites for  significant real growth of Defense Budg- et in the continuation of the planning  period which implies gradually reaching  the long term ambition of the Defense  funding up to 2% of GDP. In this way the  funding will be provided in the ten year  period needed for the development of  planned capabilities together with flex- ible and efficient conduct of operational  tasks in the Defense Sector.

The complexity of  this capability, or the time required to  introduce the new aircraft, as well as  calculations based on the ten years of  investment, indicate that there is a need  for such a process, which will begin in  2019 and the continued investment in  the next planning period. Consequently,  this decision will affect the sheer size of   the Defense Budget in 2019. Projected  total Defense Budget in the ten-year pe- riod covered by this Plan is increased, de- pending on the variants of the financing  capability of combat aircraft in amount  varying between 2.4 and 4.2 billion HRK.  Figure 13 shows projections of the De- fense Budget with three versions of its  growth from the year 2019.

The overview as such is indica- tive and it implies a multi-year funding  model requiring further, more in-depth  and detailed analysis that will be pre- pared by the end of 2016 to support final  decision-making. During the planning period, together with  the end of the declining period and with  the gradual growth of the Defense Budg- et, special emphasis will be put on the  improved budget structure underlining   the direction and increase of the availa- ble resources in equipping and construc- tion6 which amounts to 67:21:12 in the  year 2014 (Figure 14), and it will change  gradually in the direction of 46:33:21 ra- tio at the end of the period comprised in  this Plan (Figure 15). Downsizing of the  total number of personnel in the Armed  Forces and administration in the Ministry  of Defense will gradually decrease the  annual expenditure for personnel by the  end of the planning period.  In projections that include means for  retaining combat aircraft capabilities in  one or the other option, anticipated cost  ratio would be even more favorable (Fig- ure 16 and Figure 17).  6 Costs of the personnel  comprise salaries, fiscal giv- ing, different allowances, such  as allowances for participation  in international missions and  operations  Operational costs comprise  costs of regular functioning  of the Armed Forces units  and the Ministry of Defense  organizational units and they  include costs of equipment and  infrastructure maintenance,  procurement costs of materiel  and raw materials, energy,  services, membership fee etc.,  costs of the support to civil  institutions and other expendi- tures for the employees. Equipping and construction  costs comprise the costs of  major projects of equipping  and modernization, supporting  projects that are in support  of introducing major projects,  and costs of construction and  modernization of facilities  and infrastructure defined  in chapters: Equipping and  Modernization, and Facilities  and Infrastructure.

(Independent financing of combat  aircraft capabilities)    97  Realization of the goals and ambitions of  the Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP)  requires continuous management of its im- plementation with clear division of compe- tencies and responsibilities. Croatian Parlia- ment will regularly monitor implementation  of the LTDP through examination of the An- nual Report on Defense and of the Defense  Budget proposal within the framework of  the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia.  To support the role of the Croatian Parlia- ment, the Ministry of Defense will, during  the preparation of the Annual Report on  Defense, report in a separate chapter about  the LTDP implementation.  Government of the Republic of Croatia will  establish dynamics and priorities of the  LTDP implementation through the Strategy  of the Governmental Programs and Guide- lines of the Economical and Fiscal Policy.  The Ministry of Defense will ensure opera- tionalization of the LTDP through the De- fense Planning Process. Analyses will also  be carried out and proposals will be put  forward of all regulations that represent  normative presumptions for the efficient  implementation of the LTDP. Regulations regarding Defense Plan- ning will be of special importance in  operationalization of the LTDP. It is  particularly important in this pro- cess, to sustain and improve three  planning processes:  1. To determine the state of capabilities, or rather, identify missing or  unsatisfactory elements of individual capabilities and priorities in their  development and financing.  2. To identify a starting point and priorities of the realization and fi- nancing of the projects in mid-term period.  3. To establish Financial and Human Resources framework for mid- term and short-term period.   Fundamental risks that could occur  during management of the LTDP im- plementation are: •  Insufficient resources for financing prior-  ities of the highest level in defined time  frame •  Occurrence of new, higher level priorities,   than those for which realization has en- tered the phase of significant financial  expenditures.  Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Ministry of Defense will  manage the process of overcoming the risks connected with realiza- tion of priorities.  The LTDP will be reviewed every third year. In the case of major and  more significant changes in strategic and security environment, in fa- cilitating social and economic processes, primarily connected with the  state of financial resources or with the occurrence of other circum- stances that could indicate a requirement for a substantial revision of  the document, the process of Strategic Defense Review will be previ- ously carried out as established by the Defense Act. With the aim to  ensure an optimal level of implementation and adaptability to changes  that could have implications on planning solutions identified within this  document, the Government of the Republic of Croatia could, if required,  propose its minor amendments on annual basis.

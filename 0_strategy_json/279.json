This strategy should be focused on the optimal use of opportunities created by the globalisation in terms of investment flows. In addition to the reinforcement of Moroccan companies and the promotion of added-value industrial investment, this strategy should also chart new ways for the Moroccan economy to invest in new industrial sectors that require innovative technologies and open up promising markets to export its products and services. We have both the ambition and the determination to ensure the insertion of Morocco, through its companies and universities, in the international economy of knowledge.

Modern and prosperous nations enjoy a high index for their capacity to produce and use information. • The IT sector accounts for 7% of the world GDP and attracts 25% of the world growth as well as 60% of jobs in the industrialised world. • However, there is a great imbalance between industrial and emerging nations. Industrial nations control around 85% of the sector activities with political, economic, social, and cultural consequences, the impact of which has only started to be analysed. iNtrodUctioN information is crucial to the development of nations • In accordance with the High Orientations of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, the IT sector is now one of the priority sectors of Moroccan economy, given the contribution it can have on human and economic development. • In the IT sector, the challenge for Morocco in the coming years is not only to build on the progress that has already been made, but to achieve the integration of Morocco in the global economy of knowledge, by integrating and extending IT to all entities within the society: state, administrations, companies, and individual citizens. • Facing this challenge, the national strategy for the information society and digital economy: • focuses on defining priorities and actions with strong impact, that will be gradually improved; • sets ambitious but realistic objectives that can be achieved by putting in place a sustainable system of governance and by allocating adequate resources. 9D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 10 D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs Challenges Human and Economic Development • For Morocco, the major challenge regarding its transformation into an information society is to produce added-value and improve the standard of living and the well-being of its citizens. • IT is a key factor in human and economic development, based on: • effective and efficient use of information, the main factor in the production of added-value, after capital and labour; • the achievement of significant productivity gains, by creating new opportunities to produce, process, record, store and share information, as well as by providing easier access to information. • Thus, developing an efficient use of IT in all areas of economic and social life in Morocco is a priority to ensure sustainable national growth and competitiveness. 11D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs 12 D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 • In the 21st century, companies’ ability to collect, produce, and manage information, has become an essential factor for the economic growth, productivity and competitiveness. • Thus, the IT penetration rate within companies, particularly within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and very small enterprises (VSEs), and its widespread and effective use play a significant role in the emergence of an economy of knowledge, and in the capacity of companies to produce higher added-value and create further job opportunities. • In Morocco, the economic arena mainly comprises SMEs and VSEs which have low level of computerisation. As a result, work productivity remains limited. • The modernisation of the Moroccan entrepreneurial arena is one of the main challenges of the spread of IT. In opting to put in place an information system, the company embraces a dynamic step of technological and organisational modernisation, notably to: • meet the requirements of the industry in terms of quality, costs, and deadlines; • develop new job processes; • achieve better productivity. Industry Challenges Productivity Improvement chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs Individual Citizens Challenges Access to Knowledge • IT and access to the internet facilitate communication and provide access to knowledge. Besides providing easy and quick access to information, they enable individual citizens to considerably save time, especially with the availability of online services. • It is essential to introduce the benefits of IT to individual citizens, to provide them with opportunities to access these technologies and purchase equipment, and enable them to acquire the necessary skills for the appropriate use of these technologies. • In this context, after the progress made regarding individual citizens’ access to mobile phone technology, the next stage should be to accelerate the process of democratisation of home internet, and to encourage individual citizens to take up and use new technology on a daily basis. • This is particularly relevant in difficult access areas, where a computer connected to the internet remains the sole mean of link to the world of knowledge. 13D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs 14 D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 • Morocco has made significant progress in promoting R&D in recent years: • The number of partnerships with foreign universities and research centers has increased, highlighting the credibility enjoyed by Moroccan academics and researchers; • Moroccan researchers are leading R&D teams in innovative areas, such as microelectronics, biotechnology and nanotechnology; • A support fund for technology innovation has been set up. • The challenge for the future is to ensure the continuation and to reinforce the cooperation between the research institutes and the private sector to turn this existing national research potential into marketable technology and products. • A great interaction between academic researchers and private companies will lead to a greater focus on concrete projects, while enjoying the support of industrialists, and balancing fundamental and applied research that are oriented toward marketable openings. • Furthermore, openness to the world is necessary, given the limited size of the local market to justify a significant investment in R&D. Sector Challenges R&D Promotion chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs Sector Challenges Growth of local IT industry Added-value increase of IT offshoring services • Morocco has become a leading destination for investment from francophone countries in the field of call centres, IT offshoring, as well as in the outsourcing of business processes. The main offshoring actors have started operating in Morocco, and have further ambition for their development plans. • Morocco has significantly contributed to this success by making the offshoring business as one of the pillars of its industrial strategy, and has put in place a dynamic policy to enhance the attractiveness of Morocco for foreign clients. Overall, some 50 multinational companies have already launched operations in the country. • For the future, the challenge resides in the consolidation of our francophone market leadership and our current mature experience in offshoring in order to expand to new markets and to increase the added-value of the services offered in Morocco. IT Industry Export Growth • International companies are also interested in the skills and know-how available in Morocco in several professional areas related to information systems: monetics, engineering consultancy and information systems integration, geographical information systems, development of digital content in Arabic and decision systems • Morocco should identify and profit from the existing opportunities to rapidly position itself as a reference country in the sector, and to achieve higher added-value. 15D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 visioN, objEctivEs, ANd strAtEgic oriENtAtioNs chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs 16 D i g i t a l M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013 • Public services and their efficiency have an important impact on the country economic and social aspects of living. Thus, it is very important to provide these services in an integrated, transparent and secure manner so that the Moroccan society can be gradually transformed into an information society, thanks to IT and in respect to the needs and expectations of the citizens and compagnies. • In Morocco, the public sector expenditures represent a significant portion of the budget of the State. The public sector will certainly achieve important profits in terms of effectiveness and effficiency as a result of the implementation of E-government services via simplified and automated information processing. • Therefore, for instance, the online Tax declaration for compagnies will allow the Moroccan State to achieve productivity gains by using simplified collection and automated information processing. In counterpart, it will allow compagnies and their partners to considerably save time by accessing information that have been already filed while being assisted with the online declaration process.

This strategy should be focused on the  optimal use of opportunities created by the globalisation in terms of investment flows. In addition  to the reinforcement of Moroccan companies and the promotion of added-value industrial  investment, this strategy should also chart new ways for the Moroccan economy to invest in new  industrial sectors that require innovative technologies and open up promising markets to export  its products and services.  We have both the ambition and the determination to ensure the insertion of Morocco, through  its companies and universities, in the international economy of knowledge.

Modern  and prosperous nations enjoy a high index for their capacity to produce and use information.   • The IT sector accounts for 7% of the world GDP and attracts 25% of the world growth as well as 60% of jobs in the industrialised world.  •  However, there is a great imbalance between industrial and emerging nations. Industrial nations control around 85% of the sector activities with political,  economic, social, and cultural consequences, the impact of which has only started to be analysed.           iNtrodUctioN       information is crucial to the development of nations  •  In accordance with the High Orientations of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, the IT sector is now one of the priority sectors of Moroccan economy,  given the contribution it can have on human and economic development.   •  In the IT sector, the challenge for Morocco in the coming years is not only to build on the progress that has already been made, but to achieve the  integration of Morocco in the global economy of knowledge, by integrating and extending IT to all entities within the society: state, administrations,  companies, and individual citizens.  • Facing this challenge, the national strategy for the information society and digital economy: •  focuses on defining priorities and actions with strong impact, that will be gradually improved;  •  sets ambitious but realistic objectives that can be achieved by putting in place a sustainable system of governance and by allocating adequate   resources.   9D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013    10 D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs    chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  Challenges  Human and Economic Development  •  For Morocco, the major challenge regarding its transformation into an information society is to produce added-value and improve the standard of living  and the well-being of its citizens.  • IT is a key factor in human and economic development, based on: • effective and efficient use of information, the main factor in the production of added-value, after capital and labour; •  the achievement of significant productivity gains, by creating new opportunities to produce, process, record, store and share information, as well   as by providing easier access to information.   •  Thus, developing an efficient use of IT in all areas of economic and social life in Morocco is a priority to ensure sustainable national growth and  competitiveness.   11D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs    chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  12 D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013     •  In the 21st century, companies’ ability to collect, produce, and manage information, has become an essential factor for the economic growth, productivity  and competitiveness.   •  Thus, the IT penetration rate within companies, particularly within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and very small enterprises (VSEs), and its  widespread and effective use play a significant role in the emergence of an economy of knowledge, and in the capacity of companies to produce higher  added-value and create further job opportunities.  •  In Morocco, the economic arena mainly comprises SMEs and VSEs which have low level of computerisation. As a result, work productivity remains  limited.   •  The modernisation of the Moroccan entrepreneurial arena is one of the main challenges of the spread of IT. In opting to put in place an information  system, the company embraces a dynamic step of technological and organisational modernisation, notably to:  • meet the requirements of the industry in terms of quality, costs, and deadlines; • develop new job processes;  • achieve better productivity.  Industry Challenges   Productivity Improvement    chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  Individual Citizens Challenges   Access to Knowledge  •  IT and access to the internet facilitate communication and provide access to knowledge. Besides providing easy and quick access to information, they  enable individual citizens to considerably save time, especially with the availability of online services.   •  It is essential to introduce the benefits of IT to individual citizens, to provide them with opportunities to access these technologies and purchase equipment,  and enable them to acquire the necessary skills for the appropriate use of these technologies.  •  In this context, after the progress made regarding individual citizens’ access to mobile phone technology, the next stage should be to accelerate the  process of democratisation of home internet, and to encourage individual citizens to take up and use new technology on a daily basis.   •  This is particularly relevant in difficult access areas, where a computer connected to the internet remains the sole mean of link to the world of  knowledge.  13D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013    chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  14 D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  •  Morocco has made significant progress in promoting R&D in recent years: •  The number of partnerships with foreign universities and research centers has increased, highlighting the credibility enjoyed by Moroccan   academics and researchers;  •  Moroccan researchers are leading R&D teams in innovative areas, such as microelectronics, biotechnology and nanotechnology; •  A support fund for technology innovation has been set up.   •  The challenge for the future is to ensure the continuation and to reinforce the cooperation between the research institutes and the private sector to turn  this existing national research potential into marketable technology and products.   •  A great interaction between academic researchers and private companies will lead to a greater focus on concrete projects, while enjoying the support  of industrialists, and balancing fundamental and applied research that are oriented toward marketable openings.   •  Furthermore, openness to the world is necessary, given the limited size of the local market to justify a significant investment in R&D.      Sector Challenges   R&D Promotion    chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  Sector Challenges  Growth of local IT industry  Added-value increase of IT offshoring services  •  Morocco has become a leading destination for investment from francophone countries in the field of call centres, IT offshoring, as well as in the outsourcing  of business processes. The main offshoring actors have started operating in Morocco, and have further ambition for their development plans.   •  Morocco has significantly contributed to this success by making the offshoring business as one of the pillars of its industrial strategy, and has put in  place a dynamic policy to enhance the attractiveness of Morocco for foreign clients. Overall, some 50 multinational companies have already launched  operations in the country.   •  For the future, the challenge resides in the consolidation of our francophone market leadership and our current mature experience in offshoring in order  to expand to new markets and to increase the added-value of the services offered in Morocco.     IT Industry Export Growth  •  International companies are also interested in the skills and know-how available in Morocco in several professional areas related to information systems:  monetics, engineering consultancy and information systems integration, geographical information systems, development of digital content in Arabic and  decision systems...  •  Morocco should identify and profit from the existing opportunities to rapidly position itself as a reference country in the sector, and to achieve higher  added-value.  15D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013    visioN, objEctivEs, ANd strAtEgic oriENtAtioNs  chAllENgEs ANd opportUNitiEs  16 D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  •  Public services and their efficiency have an important impact on the country economic and social aspects of living. Thus, it is very important to provide  these services in an integrated, transparent and secure manner so that the Moroccan society can be gradually transformed into an information society,  thanks to IT and in respect to the needs and expectations of the citizens and compagnies.     •   In Morocco, the public sector expenditures represent a significant portion of the budget of the State. The public sector will certainly achieve important  profits in terms of effectiveness and effficiency as a result of the implementation of E-government services via simplified and automated information  processing.    •   Therefore, for instance, the online Tax declaration for compagnies will allow the Moroccan State to achieve productivity gains by using simplified  collection and automated information processing. In counterpart, it will allow compagnies and their partners to considerably save time by accessing   information that have been already filed while being assisted with the online declaration process.

Social Change  Initiatives and Actions  •  The information and knowledge society will be only developped if the younger generation acquires the know-how of technology at an early stage.  Computers and internet are the powerful educational tools which can speed up human, economic, and social development.   •  Actions designed to provide pupils and students with computer equipment are multiplying worldwide, and their efficiency has been clearly proven.  •  To further promote computer equipment and internet use by actors in the education sector, the Moroccan government will implement a leader action to  provide engineering students and their similars with subsidised laptops and internet access.   •  This initiative will supplement the ‘Génie’ program for the equipment of primary and high public schools, and the Nafid@ program to subsidise mobile  computers and internet access for teaching staff, launched respectively in September 2005 and May 2008.     strAtEgic prioritiEs  Social Change  Initiatives and Actions  initiative 1 : Extending and generalising it use and equipment to education and teaching entities.  31D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  1.  provide hardware, internet  access and multimedia resources  to public educational institutions  2.  provide multimedia resources  and internet access to public  higher education institutions  3.  subsidise computer equipment  and internet connection for  teaching staff   4.  subsidise mobile computers  and internet connection for  engineering students or similars   measures/Actions description   •  Proceed with the ‘Génie’ program by providing public educational institutions (9 260 institutions)  with multimedia resources connected to internet, over the 2009-2013 period;  •  Alongside equipment and infrastructure, 200 000 IT teachers must be trained and pedagogical  digital content suitable for learning must be developed.  •  Press ahead with the IT generalisation program in education, and introduce digital work environments  (DWE) in higher education institutions.   •  Proceed with the Nafid@ program designed to subsidise computer equipment and internet  connection for teaching staff, helping them use and integrate multimedia resources in teaching  and learning.   •  Provide offers to enable engineering students and similars in science and IT to purchase subsidised  laptops and internet connection;  •  Over the 2009-2013 period, around 80 000 engineering students and similars will benefit from this   action.    strAtEgic prioritiEs  32 D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013  initiative 2 :  mobilising public and private actors around attractive it access opportunities for each socio- professional category  Social Change  Initiatives and Actions  •  The rapid introduction of internet broadband infrastructure should be considered in relation to an optimal digital development of the territory, and to  reduced cost for internet broadband access, especially in moderately populated zones.    •  Given that cost, for a large section of the population, is one of the major barriers to computer purchasing and internet access, within the framework of   the public-private partnership, the government will ensure that attractive and suitable offers, such as computer plus internet, are available to different  sections of the population.  •  Similarly, the introduction of public community access centres, drawing on existing telecom infrastructure, will extend access to new technologies to a  wider range of citizens.   •  These facilities will focus notably on zones where offers of household internet access are not available or financially inaccessible.       strAtEgic prioritiEs  Social Change  Initiatives and Actions  initiative 2 :  mobilising public and private actors around attractive it access opportunities for each socio- professional category  33D i g i t a l  M o r o c c o  The National Strategy for Information  Society and Digital Economy - 2009-2013     5.

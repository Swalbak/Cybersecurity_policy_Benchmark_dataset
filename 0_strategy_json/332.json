We are heavily inter- connected and networked, a fact that enhances our quality of life, but also creates vulnerabilities. From commercial supply chains to the critical infrastructure that underpins our economy and our society, the risks in the cyber world have multiplied, accelerated, and grown increasingly malicious. Major corporations, industries and our international allies and partners are engaged in the global cyber challenge. But many others are not — representing a significant risk, but also a missed opportunity in this rapidly growing global industry. While it is important to be keenly aware of cyber threats, Canada’s cyber security policy cannot be driven by fear and defensiveness. With this in mind, the renewal of the existing Cyber Security Strategy has been undertaken with an emphasis on the enormous potential of Canada’s increased leadership in this field. In partnership with the Ministers of Defence, Innovation, Infrastructure, Public Services and the Treasury Board, we consulted directly with Canadians and key stakeholders about how the new strategy could best serve their security needs, while allowing them to benefit from the opportunities that the digital economy offers. Informed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy directly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada’s current cyber security climate. The Strategy’s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018’s substantial investments in cyber security – totaling more than $500 million dollars over five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made by the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment to safety and security in the digital age. THE HONOURABLE RALPH GOODALE Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada iii of iii • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Among the new measures introduced: • Funding for the new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to support leadership and collaboration between different levels of government and international partners, while providing a clear and trusted resource for Canadian citizens and businesses. • The creation of the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to expand the RCMP’s capacity to investigate cybercrime, establishing a coordination hub for both domestic and international partners. • Funding to foster innovation and economic growth, and the development of Canadian cyber talent. The Strategy is the roadmap for Canada’s path forward on cyber security, and is designed to meet the objectives and priorities of Canadians. We are proud to be leading the way. 1 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Executive Summary Canada’s Place in a Digital World Our world has been transformed by digital innovation. Digital technologies are now an integral part of our daily lives, with new developments emerging every day. From running our businesses, accessing government services, to interacting with our friends and families, these technologies connect Canadians from coast to coast to coast while linking us into a dynamic global network. This is just the beginning. There is endless potential for new and revolutionary ideas. We will continue to see digital innovation pushed to new heights — to the benefit of our communities, our societies, and our planet. 2 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The Importance of Cyber Security As we embrace digital technologies for their tremendous benefits, we can open ourselves up to threats. Criminals and other malicious cyber threat actors — many of which operate outside our borders — take advantage of security gaps, low cyber security awareness, and technological developments in an effort to compromise cyber systems. They steal personal and financial information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. They disrupt and sometimes destroy the infrastructure that we rely on for essential services and our way of life. In 2010, the Government of Canada launched a national effort to defend against these threats with Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy. The progress made and accomplishments achieved under the 2010 Strategy are the basis for future action. Our new approach reflects the extent to which digital technologies have become essential to our way of life. With a new Cyber Security Strategy, we can proceed with confidence in our digital age. In this reality, cyber security is the companion to innovation and the protector of prosperity. The Vision of the National Cyber Security Strategy: Security and prosperity in the digital age Strong cyber security is an essential element of Canadian innovation and prosperity. Individuals, governments, and businesses all want to have confidence in the cyber systems that underpin their daily lives. The Government of Canada envisions a future in which all Canadians play an active role in shaping and sustaining our nation’s cyber resilience. Executive Summary 3 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY To realize our vision, the Government of Canada and its partners will work together across three themes: Security and Resilience Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical government and private sector systems. Cyber innovation By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will position Canada as a global leader in cyber security. Leadership and Collaboration The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces, territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment in Canada’s favour. Executive Summary 4 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY In a dynamic cyber security environment, the Government of Canada’s approach will be rooted in a sustained commitment to: • Protect the safety and security of Canadians and our critical infrastructure • Promote and protect rights and freedoms online • Encourage cyber security for business, economic growth, and prosperity • Collaborate and support coordination across jurisdictions and sectors to strengthen Canada’s cyber resilience • Proactively adapt to changes in the cyber security landscape and the emergence of new technology Scope of the Strategy The scope of this Strategy starts with the work that the Government of Canada is already undertaking. This includes ongoing and future efforts to protect Government of Canada systems, to extend our network of partnerships to help protect critical infrastructure, and to help Canadians to be safe online. In a more diverse and dynamic global cyber security landscape, however, Canada’s new approach will be more extensive and inclusive. This document outlines the key elements of the global cyber security environment and articulates some of the ways that the Government of Canada will respond to an array of new challenges and opportunities in cyberspace. Executive Summary 5 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Implementing the Strategy Recognizing that the pace of change we see today will only accelerate, this Strategy is designed as the mainstay of the Government’s continuous efforts to enhance cyber security in Canada. The Government’s actions will evolve alongside the ground-breaking technological developments and resulting paradigm shifts that have become common in our connected world. Cyber security action plans will supplement this Strategy. These will detail the specific initiatives that the federal government will undertake over time, with clear performance metrics and a commitment to report on results achieved. They will also outline the Government’s plan for working with internal and external partners to achieve its vision. The implementation of this Strategy will align with other cyber-related Government of Canada initiatives. These include: the Minister of Democratic Institutions’ mandate to defend the electoral process from cyber threats; cyber foreign policy in Canada’s international agenda; the Canadian military’s use of cyber; and the Innovation and Skills Plan. Executive Summary 6 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The Government of Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy allocated $431.5 million over ten years, with three pillars of action and wide- ranging accomplishments: I. Securing Government systems The Government of Canada increased its capacity to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The number of data breaches has steadily declined since 2010 — despite an increase in the number and sophistication of state-sponsored and non-state cyber activities against Government networks. II. Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government Partnerships were forged with owners and operators of Canada’s critical infrastructure, the private sector, and provincial and territorial governments. The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) expanded its operations, with over 1300 organizations receiving regular alerts and communications. III. Helping Canadians to be secure online Through the Get Cyber Safe campaign, the Government of Canada supported cyber security awareness with outreach, activities, and development of targeted resources. Efforts made under the 2010 Strategy also improved the capacity of the RCMP and law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime, including initial investments in cybercrime intelligence, investigations, and training. Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy 2010 7 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Introduction Building on Canada’s Accomplishments in a Dynamic Cyber Landscape What is Cyber Security? Cyber security is the protection of digital information and the infrastructure on which it resides. Cyber security was once the domain of technical experts, but now, in our digital world, we all have a role to play in our individual and collective cyber security. From the Margins to the Mainstream The degree to which digital technology is now integrated into our daily lives would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. From social media, smartphone applications, online shopping, networked devices, the cloud, and beyond, we rely on digital technologies for more than personal enjoyment — they are integral to the systems that underpin our economy and our way of life. These interdependent systems include the 8 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY communications networks that connect across the country and around the world, energy to heat our homes and power our industry, and air, train, and road travel we use every day. We tend to take this connectivity for granted, without pausing to reflect on its implications. Cyber security cannot be taken for granted. As the benefits and opportunities of technologies continue to grow, it is increasingly crucial to secure these technologies. Taking Stock of a Changing Landscape In 2016, the Government of Canada took the first step toward developing a new Cyber Security Strategy. The Cyber Review was launched to understand the cyber security implications of being a connected nation, and to position the Government of Canada to establish a new approach that reflects the challenges and opportunities we face. The Cyber Review sought to take stock of the evolving threats in cyberspace, to understand and explore the ways that cyber security is becoming a driver of economic prosperity, and to determine the appropriate federal role in this digital age. The Cyber Review included in-depth engagement within the federal government cyber security community, an evaluation of our performance under the 2010 Strategy, as well as Canada’s first public consultation on cyber security. The Government of Canada obtained insights and advice from experts, key stakeholders, and engaged citizens. Introduction CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: THE BENEFITS OF BACKING UP Jacqueline is a small business owner who sells crafts through an online store. One day, Jacqueline receives an email from a customer who is complaining about a broken piece. The customer attaches a picture of the product, but when Jacqueline opens the attachment she finds that she is locked out of her computer. A message appears indicating that her computer will only be unlocked if she pays a ransom of $1,000 to the perpetrator. Fortunately, Jacqueline regularly backs up her computer. She wipes her hard drive, eliminating the malware that was delivered through the email attachment and restores the backup, which allows her to access all her documents. 9 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Our Response This new Cyber Security Strategy reflects the perspectives from the Cyber Review. It also recognizes that while cyber threats are growing in sophistication and magnitude, there is enormous potential for Canadian digital innovation and expertise in cyber security. It is designed to be adaptable and to account for a continuously changing cyber landscape. Our National Cyber Security Strategy establishes three goals in response to evolving threats, emerging opportunities, and the need for collaborative action: • Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems • An Innovative and Adaptive Cyber Ecosystem • Effective Leadership and Collaboration The federal government will lead the effort to achieve these goals in an era when cyber security is not just a necessity, but a competitive advantage for Canada. Introduction CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: PASSWORD SMARTS Christine loves the convenience of the cloud. She created one central account online that manages everything from her computer, her smartphone, her fitness tracker, and even her home security system. Through the cloud, her email and social media accounts are linked, her photos and videos are uploaded automatically, and any updates to her calendar appear across all her devices. Christine always uses the same password so that it’s easy for her to remember. When she hears about a data breach affecting her email account, she realizes that someone could use her email password to access her cloud account. Concerned about protecting her privacy and her information, Christine creates a new, strong password, which she varies slightly for other online services. 10 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The input received through the Cyber Review was comprehensive, sophisticated, and insightful. Responses came from the federal government cyber community, cyber security experts, business leaders, government officials, law enforcement, academics, and engaged citizens. The Cyber Review revealed three main trends: There is support for law enforcement’s efforts to address cybercrime while protecting privacy in cyberspace • There is recognition that cyber security serves to protect personal information — and by extension, privacy. Canadians support efforts to safeguard their privacy online. • Canadians acknowledge that law enforcement faces challenges addressing cybercrime, and are concerned by the rising threat of cybercrime for individuals, private and public sector organizations, and governments. There is a wide ranging need for improved cyber security knowledge and skills • Better cyber security knowledge and skills are needed. This extends from our children to our elderly and from our small and medium business owners to our law enforcement agencies and corporate executives. • A shortage of cyber security talent makes it difficult for organizations — including the federal government — to attract and retain the people they need to improve their cyber security or to disrupt cyber threats. About the Cyber Security Review 11 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY There are calls for strong federal leadership on cyber security: • External partners want a reliable focal point of federal government leadership on cyber security. • Partners want consistent messaging, advice, guidance from the Government of Canada. • Organizations have asked for cyber security standards or legislation in Canada to clarify requirements and expectations to improve their cyber security. • Stakeholders want to see federal leadership in cyber security to foster national collaboration, drive investment, facilitate information sharing and safeguard rights and freedoms. About the Cyber Security Review 12 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Security and Resilience Strategic Context: The Evolution of the Cyber Threat The threats we face in cyberspace are complex and rapidly evolving. Governments, businesses, organizations, and Canadians are vulnerable. With more of our economy and essential services moving online every year, the stakes could not be higher. Cybercrime and Advanced Cyber Threats Perpetrators of malicious cyber activity are extremely diverse, with varying aims and a wide array of techniques. Malicious cyber actors include individual hackers and insider threats, criminal networks, nation states, terrorist organizations, and state-sponsored actors. Sophisticated cyber attacks are often technically challenging to understand, with significant expertise required to do so. 13 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Any organization or individual can be a victim of malicious cyber activity. Victims may be individually targeted or part of a campaign affecting millions of internet users. As Canadians put more information online, they become increasingly attractive targets for malicious cyber actors. Canadian law enforcement agencies’ ability to protect Canadians from these actors, who may be anywhere in the world, is a growing challenge. Malicious cyber activity is often conducted for monetary gain. For example, phishing emails that appear to come from financial institutions can deceive people into providing their banking information. Ransomware can be deployed to encrypt files on a device or system, with a hacker demanding payment to restore access. Data breaches can result in personal and financial information (such as social insurance numbers, credit card information) being stolen from organizations’ online databases and subsequently sold in criminal marketplaces for activities like fraud, identity theft, or extortion. Malicious cyber actors can also be motivated by a specific cause — sometimes called “hacktivists” — such as exposing wrongdoing, protesting, or provoking embarrassment. They can also be enthusiasts, attempting to demonstrate their skill at hacking and to gain notoriety. On a larger scale, nation states and state-sponsored actors have the capability to steal our intellectual property or confidential business strategies to give their own economies a competitive advantage. Some nation states are also developing advanced cyber tools with hostile aims. There are risks to Canada’s national security and public safety if Security and Resilience 14 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY the threat is to the computer systems that underpin government systems, critical infrastructure, and democratic institutions. Terrorist organizations are also interested in acquiring advanced cyber tools to conduct attacks. The Growing Impact As malicious cyber tools become increasingly accessible and as rates of cybercrime continue to rise, there is a real threat to Canada’s economic well-being. Furthermore, as more of Canada’s critical infrastructure can be controlled remotely and essential services are managed online, cyber incidents have the potential to compromise national security and public safety. From a financial perspective, victims of cyber compromise face immediate costs to recover and restore their systems. They also face long-term costs to replace or upgrade cyber systems, as well as untold reputational costs. While start-ups are particularly vulnerable, the loss of intellectual property has contributed to financial ruin for businesses of all sizes. Cyber incidents can also be profoundly destabilizing. They can erode trust in e-commerce and government institutions and can lead people to question their continued use of digital technologies if they feel that their safety or privacy is at risk. The internet-of-things (IoT) refers to objects and devices that are connected to the internet to communicate with one another and provide Security and Resilience CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: EMAIL SCAMS It’s tax season and Mohsen recently filed his taxes online. A few days later, he receives an email from someone claiming to be a tax official, informing him that there is information missing from his file. The official makes an urgent request for additional personal information to complete his file, including his address and social insurance number. The email notes that failure to provide this information could lead to steep penalties and even jail time. Mohsen feels suspicious about the email, and so before providing the information, he checks the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website. He reads that the CRA would never send emails asking individuals to divulge personal or financial information. He follows the CRA’s advice by ignoring the email. 15 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY more efficient and customized services. The IoT is growing rapidly, with over 25 billion connected devices expected by 2020. Connecting devices to the internet opens the door to new cyber security risks. Cyber security gaps can be exploited to disrupt services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) campaigns or to gain entry to wider systems or private data. In October 2016, millions of unsecured devices were used to overwhelm the servers of Dyn, an internet infrastructure company, which then took popular websites and online services offline internationally. As digital innovation is pushed further and as new technologies are developed, the nature of cyber threats will constantly change. For instance, internet-connected technologies are increasingly popular, from thermostats and healthcare devices like pacemakers to cars and the systems that run our critical infrastructure and services. Without adequate cyber security, connected devices are vulnerable to being hacked on an unprecedented scale. Similarly, many Canadians rely on encryption to secure their online communications and data. The arrival of quantum computing will undercut the security of traditional encryption, requiring that Canadians have quantum-resistant solutions at their disposal. A forward-looking and flexible cyber security posture will be necessary to keep pace with these changes. Security and Resilience CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: RESILIENCE THROUGH INFORMATION SHARING Beom-Jun works in the IT Department for a large financial institution. He has noticed that there have been a lot of attempts to hack into the system. While they have been unsuccessful, he decides to send the technical information to the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) for their analysis. He knows that CCIRC relies on critical infrastructure organizations, like his bank, to report cyber incidents so that they can notify other sectors and international partners of trends and threats. He appreciates that by working together, they are increasing the cyber security of the organizations that Canadians rely on. 16 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Public Consultation on Cyber Security What We Heard “The #1 cyber challenge for Canada is that there are an increasing number of incidents that are causing harm to the economy and society, ranging from breaches, crimes, disruption of essential services, and destruction of corporate and country assets” “Privacy and security are not a zero-sum game and we can have both. There is no security without privacy. And liberty requires both security and privacy” “Canadian law enforcement should centralize their cybercrime resources… A single window centre will make it easier for businesses to know who to call when their systems have been compromised, and will help law enforcement investigate and respond to cybercrime across jurisdictions” About the Cyber Security Review 17 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Security Strategy Goals Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical government and private sector systems. The Government of Canada will maintain and improve cyber security across all federal departments and agencies to protect the privacy of Canadians’ information held by the federal government and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical services for Canadians. The Government of Canada will enhance law enforcement capacity to respond to cybercrime. It will support coordination across law enforcement agencies and with federal, provincial, territorial, and international partners. The Government will enhance cybercrime investigative capacity and make it easier for Canadians to report cybercrime. Small and medium organizations often lack the knowledge and resources to implement cyber security regimes, even if doing so would offer a competitive advantage. The Government of Canada will help support these organizations — making cyber security more accessible. In response to cyber threats of increasing sophistication, the Government of Canada will consider how its advanced cyber capabilities could be applied to defend critical networks in Canada and deter foreign cyber threat actors. 18 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Security Strategy Goals Some cyber systems — such as electricity grids, communications networks, or financial institutions — are so important that any disruption could have serious consequences for public safety and national security. The federal government will work with provinces, territories, and the private sector to help define requirements to protect this digital infrastructure. 19 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Innovation Strategic Context: Expanding Frontiers of Cyber Security Digital innovation has become the engine of economic growth in the 21st century. Cyber security is not only essential for protecting the sources of Canada’s digital innovation — it has become a source of innovation in its own right. New Horizons of Technology and Business Development Cyber security is increasingly driving innovation and economic activity in Canada. It already contributes $1.7 billion to Canada’s GDP and consists of over 11,000 well-paying jobs.1 With the global cyber security industry forecasted to grow by 66% by 2021, thousands of additional jobs could 1 International Data Corporation (IDC) Canada , “2016 Canadian ICT Predictions and Forecast: Digital Transformation and Disruption,” December 2015 Information and Communications Technology Council (ICTC), “Critical Infrastructure in a Hyperconnected Economy,” August 2016. CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE Marc is looking for possible summer camps for his daughters. He wants to find something that allows them to try something different while developing new skills. In his search, he comes across a summer program designed to help children develop basic coding skills, which would give them the tools they need to build websites and develop their own programs. With Marc’s encouragement they register for the camp, opening the door to a new hobby and an exciting skillset. 20 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Innovation be created for Canadians in the years ahead.2 Governments, academia, and members of the private sector can work together to create new opportunities, drive investment, and foster leading-edge research and development. Canada is already a leader in cyber security research and development. Breakthroughs in cyber security research are not only beneficial for Canadian cyber security firms, but for the economy as a whole. Government has a role to play to support advanced research and to help innovative companies scale up to bring cyber security technologies and services to the global marketplace. Building on the Benefits of Digital Technology Canada’s participation in digital life has generated immense prosperity and benefits, and has opened a new gateway to the world. Governments, businesses and other organizations play a central role in protecting these benefits by establishing strong security for their online platforms, products, and services. Cyber security is only as strong as its weakest link. Small and medium enterprises — and indeed many organizations in Canada — face similar challenges securing their systems and networks as their much larger counterparts, but must do so with less expertise and fewer resources. Governments can help correct this asymmetry by providing advice and guidance and enhancing access to cyber security information and tools. 2 Research and Markets, “Cyber Security Market – Global Forecast to 2021,” August 2016. CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: STREAMLINING SERVICE DELIVERY Stuart was relieved when he found out that he could access his Canada Pension Plan (CPP) account online without having to remember another password. All he has to do is go to the CPP log-in page, click on the logo for his bank, and enter his information. He uses the same username and password as he does for his online banking, since his bank is a sign-in partner for the Government of Canada’s online services. He really likes the convenience, and since he trusts his bank’s security measures, he knows his information is protected. As his son David keeps telling him, his banking information will be safer as long as he uses a secure Wi-Fi — like his password-protected network at home. Apparently, hackers can intercept traffic over unsecured Wi-Fi, like in a coffee shop or airport. 21 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Innovation This helps Canadian organizations in both public and private sectors to successfully adopt digital technologies. Individual knowledge goes a long way in cyber security, from digital literacy all the way to coding and threat mitigation skills. Initiatives in Canadian communities, schools, and post-secondary institutions help to equip Canadians with skills for the digital age. The Government of Canada is playing its part through long-term investments to help Canadians of all backgrounds to get the education and work experience they need to participate in an increasingly digital economy. Quantum science and technology allows information to be processed and secured much more rapidly and more securely. Quantum devices could have revolutionary benefits across a range of fields, such as helping to understand how diseases develop or optimizing medical treatments. While quantum can secure information and push technology to new limits, its use may also threaten many forms of encryption used today to protect systems and applications in Canada and around the world. Recognizing the opportunities and challenges of quantum computing, Canadian efforts have established a strong base of expertise and leadership in quantum computing, like that seen at the Institute of Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo. 22 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Advancing 21st Century Skills and Knowledge The demand for qualified cyber security professionals is surging. A global shortage of qualified professionals represents an immediate and growing opportunity for Canada’s highly educated workforce. We can encourage more students to move into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We can encourage graduates from both STEM programs and other disciplines (such as psychology, sociology, or management) to specialize in the skills needed for cyber security jobs. Attracting this multidisciplinary talent, both domestically and from abroad, is essential for Canadian governments and businesses. It also helps to ensure that Canadian companies are able to safely grow and innovate as they expand their use of digital technology. As the cyber security environment continues to evolve, there is a constant need for reliable and up-to-date information. Canadian statistics and research in the area of cyber security will provide a more accurate view of the cyber issues our nation faces in a global context. This information can be used by academics, researchers, and policy makers to understand trends, manage risk, inform future investments, and adjust course when appropriate. Cyber Innovation 23 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Public Consultation on Cyber Security What We Heard “We must work to ensure that start-ups and innovation born in Canada stay in Canada” “The federal government can play a unique role in ensuring businesses see Canada as a location where they can thrive in a cyber safe environment” “Few appreciate the strategic relevance of cyber security intelligence. You can’t manage what you don’t measure” About the Cyber Security Review 24 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Security Strategy Goals An Innovative and Adaptive Cyber Ecosystem By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will position Canada as a global leader in cyber security. The Government of Canada will work with partners to drive investment and foster cyber research and development. The Government will focus on emerging areas of Canadian excellence, such as quantum computing and blockchain technologies. The federal government is already making progress in this regard, with Budget 2017 announcing the creation of a Pan- Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy for research and talent. Together, we will explore initiatives to ensure that Canadian companies can bring their products to a global market. The Government will explore initiatives to drive domestic demand for cyber security technologies and services. The Government of Canada will explore new ideas for making businesses and Canadians of all ages and backgrounds more cyber secure. The federal government has already committed investments to improve digital skills, such as coding education for kids. Working together across governments, academia, and the private sector is necessary to address the cyber skills gap. Taking action now will allow us to build the labour force of the future, one that will help to support Canadian cyber security and that will contribute to Canada’s future prosperity. 25 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The quality of information at our disposal shapes our ability to understand cyber trends. The federal government will support Canadian research and statistics efforts to improve our collective understanding of cyber threats and opportunities. Cyber Security Strategy Goals 26 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Leadership and Collaboration Strategic Context: Collaborating to Realize the Benefits of Digital Life Advances in technology benefit our communities and our societies. They contribute to our quality of life today, and will be instrumental in meeting the challenges of tomorrow. We all have a responsibility to secure these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to do so. Raising Baseline Cyber Security in Canada The vast majority of Canada’s digital systems are owned by individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. From individuals that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect 27 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY themselves and recover from cyber incidents. Even those that recognize the importance of securing their information may find it hard to identify affordable and effective measures to protect themselves. The Government of Canada is taking on a leadership role in cyber security to help organizations and Canadians recognize the value of cyber security and to support efforts to raise the baseline of cyber security in Canada. It will complement these domestic efforts by working with international partners and allies, seeking to reduce the threat to Canada from cybercriminals and also from state actors and their proxies that may seek to harm us. Moreover, the federal government is aiming for national cyber security excellence. Reaching this target will involve enhancing and growing cyber security capabilities in government and industry. It will entail supporting Canada’s leading edge research and development, as well as the range of organizations and businesses that do not have strong cyber security measures in place. Private sector leaders will have a central role to play, as a collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all Canadians are as equipped as possible to prevent and respond to cyber threats. Blockchain technology allows for the creation of online ledgers or records. Often associated with virtual currencies, there are many possible applications of blockchain. It could be used to provide public services like issuing passports, creating records of contracts or legal documents, and processing payments for services rendered. The technology improves efficiency by reducing processing time for activities and reduces the risk of fraud and compromise, as no one party can modify, delete or append any records. Leadership and Collaboration 28 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The Government of Canada recognizes the potential of blockchain for secure service delivery and for wider economic and societal benefits. Ensuring the smart application of blockchain technologies in Canada will require a collaborative approach and a collective effort. Federal Cyber Security Leadership in a Dynamic Environment The Government of Canada is in a unique position to play a leadership role in cyber security. This stems from extensive relationships with private and public sectors, a history of working with provinces, territories, and international officials on a range of cyber security issues, and advanced cyber security expertise and capabilities. Federal leadership in cyber security was established through the 2010 Strategy and the nation-wide initiatives it introduced. In today’s cyber security environment, however, the federal government must deepen collaboration with partners to strengthen Canada’s cyber security. Concerted and integrated action by all parties is needed to build cyber resilience in Canada. Establishing a clear focal point for cyber security within the federal government is one of the ways that the Government will demonstrate leadership while also enhancing its capacity to collaborate with partners. The Government will ensure that partners receive unified advice and guidance on cyber security and that they know where to go for assistance. Leadership and Collaboration 29 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Smart cities use digital technologies to enhance quality of life by making services more efficient, cost-effective, and responsive for urban residents. For example, “smart” traffic lights will measure and adapt timing to improve traffic flows and connected sewer systems will detect leaks and monitor real-time water flow. To accelerate the development of smart cities in Canada, the federal government announced the Smart Cities Challenge initiative in Budget 2017. The federal government will make smart investments in cyber security, while also advocating for its partners in the private sector and in other jurisdictions to do the same. Private sector organizations in Canada have world-class cyber security capabilities that can be leveraged to benefit all sectors of the Canadian economy. There are also great ideas and strong leadership in our schools and our post-secondary institutions that will be instrumental in shaping the future of cyber security in Canada. The Government will work to bridge Canada-wide efforts to develop cyber skills, advance new solutions, and strengthen cyber security. We will be an example to the world of what can be achieved through a cohesive and coherent National Cyber Security Strategy. Leadership and Collaboration CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: COLLABORATING TO SOLVE CYBER SECURITY PROBLEMS Augustine received an invitation to participate in the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre’s (CCIRC) annual Geek Week. He attended last year and enjoyed working with cyber professionals and academics from Canada and other countries to solve cyber security problems. Augustine found that the skills and professional connections he gained during Geek Week benefitted him when he returned to work. At last year’s event, his team experimented with CCIRC’s prototype tools to perform automated analysis of mobile-based malware and ransomware, and also examined how encryption on such devices can be exploited by attackers. He likes that the work they did can have a real-world benefit and that after the event the team was able to take the tool they worked on back to their own organizations to develop further. 30 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Public Consultation on Cyber Security What We Heard “The Government of Canada can provide much needed leadership by creating, adopting and modeling best practices for cyber security, and making efforts to transfer this knowledge to the private sector” “[There is a] need for more centralized governance and strategic planning … for modern legislation and regulations, and leadership in identifying, prioritizing, endorsing and disseminating the latest international standards of cyber security technology” “Collectively, we need to create an effective framework for cyber security governance, spanning principles, roles, and responsibilities within the government and across the public and private sectors” About the Cyber Security Review 31 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Effective Leadership, Governance, and Collaboration The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces, territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment in Canada’s favour. Responding to calls for decisive federal leadership, the Government of Canada will streamline the way it works and collaborates with external partners and stakeholders by establishing a clear focal point for authoritative advice, guidance, and cyber incident response. This approach will improve information sharing and make it easier for the private sector to obtain the support it needs. The Government of Canada will reinvigorate public awareness and engagement efforts and establish new forums for collaboration. The federal government will work in consultation with a cross-section of Canadian stakeholders to ensure that we collectively enhance cyber security in Canada. The federal government will lead, in partnership with provinces, territories, and the private sector, the development of a national plan to prevent, mitigate and respond to cyber incidents, one that ensures efficient coordination and effective action.

We are heavily inter-  connected and networked,  a fact that enhances our quality of life, but   also creates vulnerabilities. From commercial supply chains to the critical   infrastructure that underpins our economy and our society, the risks in the   cyber world have multiplied, accelerated, and grown increasingly malicious.   Major corporations, industries and our international allies and partners   are engaged in the global cyber challenge. But many others are not —   representing a significant risk, but also a missed opportunity in this    rapidly growing global industry. While it is important to be keenly aware    of cyber threats, Canada’s cyber security policy cannot be driven by fear   and defensiveness.   With this in mind, the renewal of the existing Cyber Security Strategy has   been undertaken with an emphasis on the enormous potential of Canada’s   increased leadership in this field.  In partnership with the Ministers of   Defence, Innovation, Infrastructure, Public Services and the Treasury   Board, we consulted directly with Canadians and key stakeholders about   how the new strategy could best serve their security needs, while allowing   them to benefit from the opportunities that the digital economy offers.   Informed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy   directly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada’s current   cyber security climate.     The Strategy’s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018’s substantial   investments in cyber security – totaling more than $500 million dollars   over five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made   by the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment   to safety and security in the digital age.   THE HONOURABLE RALPH GOODALE  Minister of Public Safety and Emergency   Preparedness Canada     iii of iii  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Among the new measures introduced:  • Funding for the new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to support   leadership and collaboration between different levels of government and   international partners, while providing a clear and trusted resource for   Canadian citizens and businesses.   • The creation of the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to expand the   RCMP’s capacity to investigate cybercrime, establishing a coordination hub   for both domestic and international partners.   • Funding to foster innovation and economic growth, and the development   of Canadian cyber talent.   The Strategy is the roadmap for Canada’s path forward on cyber security,   and is designed to meet the objectives and priorities of Canadians. We are   proud to be leading the way.       1 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Executive Summary  Canada’s Place in a Digital World  Our world has been transformed by digital innovation.  Digital technologies are now an integral part of our daily lives, with new   developments emerging every day. From running our businesses, accessing   government services, to interacting with our friends and families, these   technologies connect Canadians from coast to coast to coast while linking   us into a dynamic global network.  This is just the beginning. There is endless potential for new and   revolutionary ideas. We will continue to see digital innovation pushed    to new heights — to the benefit of our communities, our societies, and    our planet.     2 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The Importance of Cyber Security   As we embrace digital technologies for their tremendous benefits, we can   open ourselves up to threats.  Criminals and other malicious cyber threat actors — many of which   operate outside our borders — take advantage of security gaps, low   cyber security awareness, and technological developments in an effort to   compromise cyber systems. They steal personal and financial information,   intellectual property, and trade secrets. They disrupt and sometimes destroy   the infrastructure that we rely on for essential services and our way of life.   In 2010, the Government of Canada launched a national effort to defend   against these threats with Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy. The   progress made and accomplishments achieved under the 2010 Strategy are   the basis for future action.  Our new approach reflects the extent to which digital technologies have   become essential to our way of life. With a new Cyber Security Strategy,   we can proceed with confidence in our digital age. In this reality, cyber   security is the companion to innovation and the protector of prosperity.  The Vision of the National Cyber Security  Strategy: Security and prosperity in the digital age  Strong cyber security is an essential element of Canadian innovation   and prosperity. Individuals, governments, and businesses all want to   have confidence in the cyber systems that underpin their daily lives. The   Government of Canada envisions a future in which all Canadians play an   active role in shaping and sustaining our nation’s cyber resilience.   Executive Summary     3 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  To realize our vision, the Government of Canada and its partners will work   together across three themes:  Security and Resilience   Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber   security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from   cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical   government and private sector systems.  Cyber innovation  By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and   developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will   position Canada as a global leader in cyber security.   Leadership and Collaboration  The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces,   territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to   advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with   allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment   in Canada’s favour.  Executive Summary     4 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  In a dynamic cyber security environment, the Government of Canada’s   approach will be rooted in a sustained commitment to:  • Protect the safety and security of Canadians and our critical infrastructure  • Promote and protect rights and freedoms online  • Encourage cyber security for business, economic growth, and prosperity  • Collaborate and support coordination across jurisdictions and sectors to   strengthen Canada’s cyber resilience  • Proactively adapt to changes in the cyber security landscape and the   emergence of new technology  Scope of the Strategy  The scope of this Strategy starts with the work that the Government of   Canada is already undertaking. This includes ongoing and future efforts   to protect Government of Canada systems, to extend our network of   partnerships to help protect critical infrastructure, and to help Canadians   to be safe online. In a more diverse and dynamic global cyber security   landscape, however, Canada’s new approach will be more extensive   and inclusive. This document outlines the key elements of the global   cyber security environment and articulates some of the ways that the   Government of Canada will respond to an array of new challenges and   opportunities in cyberspace.   Executive Summary     5 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Implementing the Strategy  Recognizing that the pace of change we see today will only accelerate, this   Strategy is designed as the mainstay of the Government’s continuous efforts   to enhance cyber security in Canada. The Government’s actions will evolve   alongside the ground-breaking technological developments and resulting   paradigm shifts that have become common in our connected world.  Cyber security action plans will supplement this Strategy. These will detail   the specific initiatives that the federal government will undertake over   time, with clear performance metrics and a commitment to report on   results achieved. They will also outline the Government’s plan for working   with internal and external partners to achieve its vision.   The implementation of this Strategy will align with other cyber-related   Government of Canada initiatives. These include: the Minister of   Democratic Institutions’ mandate to defend the electoral process from   cyber threats; cyber foreign policy in Canada’s international agenda; the   Canadian military’s use of cyber; and the Innovation and Skills Plan.   Executive Summary     6 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The Government of Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy allocated   $431.5 million over ten years, with three pillars of action and wide-  ranging accomplishments:   I. Securing Government systems The Government of Canada increased its capacity to prevent, detect,   respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The number of data   breaches has steadily declined since 2010 — despite an increase in the   number and sophistication of state-sponsored and non-state cyber   activities against Government networks.  II. Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside  the federal government  Partnerships were forged with owners and operators of Canada’s   critical infrastructure, the private sector, and provincial and territorial   governments. The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC)   expanded its operations, with over 1300 organizations receiving regular   alerts and communications.  III. Helping Canadians to be secure online  Through the Get Cyber Safe campaign, the Government of Canada   supported cyber security awareness with outreach, activities, and   development of targeted resources. Efforts made under the 2010 Strategy   also improved the capacity of the RCMP and law enforcement agencies   to combat cybercrime, including initial investments in cybercrime   intelligence, investigations, and training.  Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy 2010     7 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Introduction   Building on Canada’s Accomplishments in a  Dynamic Cyber Landscape  What is Cyber Security? Cyber security is the protection of digital information and the   infrastructure on which it resides.  Cyber security was once the domain of technical experts, but now, in our   digital world, we all have a role to play in our individual and collective    cyber security.  From the Margins to the Mainstream   The degree to which digital technology is now integrated into our daily   lives would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. From social   media, smartphone applications, online shopping, networked devices,   the cloud, and beyond, we rely on digital technologies for more than   personal enjoyment — they are integral to the systems that underpin our   economy and our way of life. These interdependent systems include the      8 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  communications networks that connect across the country and around the   world, energy to heat our homes and power our industry, and air, train, and   road travel we use every day.   We tend to take this connectivity for granted, without pausing to reflect on   its implications. Cyber security cannot be taken for granted. As the benefits   and opportunities of technologies continue to grow, it is increasingly   crucial to secure these technologies.  Taking Stock of a Changing Landscape  In 2016, the Government of Canada took the first step toward developing   a new Cyber Security Strategy. The Cyber Review was launched to   understand the cyber security implications of being a connected nation,   and to position the Government of Canada to establish a new approach that   reflects the challenges and opportunities we face.  The Cyber Review sought to take stock of the evolving threats in   cyberspace, to understand and explore the ways that cyber security   is becoming a driver of economic prosperity, and to determine the   appropriate federal role in this digital age. The Cyber Review included   in-depth engagement within the federal government cyber security   community, an evaluation of our performance under the 2010 Strategy,   as well as Canada’s first public consultation on cyber security. The   Government of Canada obtained insights and advice from experts, key   stakeholders, and engaged citizens.   Introduction  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   THE BENEFITS OF BACKING UP  Jacqueline is a small business owner who   sells crafts through an online store. One day,   Jacqueline receives an email from a customer   who is complaining about a broken piece. The   customer attaches a picture of the product,   but when Jacqueline opens the attachment   she finds that she is locked out of her   computer. A message appears indicating that   her computer will only be unlocked if she   pays a ransom of $1,000 to the perpetrator.    Fortunately, Jacqueline regularly backs up   her computer.  She wipes her hard drive,   eliminating the malware that was delivered   through the email attachment and restores   the backup, which allows her to access all    her documents.      9 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Our Response  This new Cyber Security Strategy reflects the perspectives from the   Cyber Review. It also recognizes that while cyber threats are growing in   sophistication and magnitude, there is enormous potential for Canadian   digital innovation and expertise in cyber security. It is designed to be   adaptable and to account for a continuously changing cyber landscape.   Our National Cyber Security Strategy establishes three goals in response to   evolving threats, emerging opportunities, and the need for collaborative action:  • Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems  • An Innovative and Adaptive Cyber Ecosystem  • Effective Leadership and Collaboration  The federal government will lead the effort to achieve these goals in an    era when cyber security is not just a necessity, but a competitive advantage   for Canada.  Introduction  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   PASSWORD SMARTS  Christine loves the convenience of the cloud.   She created one central account online that   manages everything from her computer, her   smartphone, her fitness tracker, and even   her home security system. Through the   cloud, her email and social media accounts   are linked, her photos and videos are   uploaded automatically, and any updates to   her calendar appear across all her devices.   Christine always uses the same password   so that it’s easy for her to remember. When   she hears about a data breach affecting her   email account, she realizes that someone   could use her email password to access her   cloud account. Concerned about protecting   her privacy and her information, Christine   creates a new, strong password, which she   varies slightly for other online services.     10 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The input received through the Cyber Review was comprehensive,   sophisticated, and insightful. Responses came from the federal government   cyber community, cyber security experts, business leaders, government   officials, law enforcement, academics, and engaged citizens.   The Cyber Review revealed three main trends:  There is support for law enforcement’s efforts to address cybercrime while   protecting privacy in cyberspace  • There is recognition that cyber security serves to protect personal   information — and by extension, privacy. Canadians support efforts to   safeguard their privacy online.  • Canadians acknowledge that law enforcement faces challenges   addressing cybercrime, and are concerned by the rising threat of   cybercrime for individuals, private and public sector organizations, and   governments.  There is a wide ranging need for improved cyber security knowledge    and skills   • Better cyber security knowledge and skills are needed. This extends from   our children to our elderly and from our small and medium business   owners to our law enforcement agencies and corporate executives.   • A shortage of cyber security talent makes it difficult for organizations —   including the federal government — to attract and retain the people they   need to improve their cyber security or to disrupt cyber threats.  About the Cyber Security Review     11 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  There are calls for strong federal leadership on cyber security:   • External partners want a reliable focal point of federal government   leadership on cyber security.   • Partners want consistent messaging, advice, guidance from the   Government of Canada.  • Organizations have asked for cyber security standards or legislation in   Canada to clarify requirements and expectations to improve their cyber   security.  • Stakeholders want to see federal leadership in cyber security to foster   national collaboration, drive investment, facilitate information sharing   and safeguard rights and freedoms.   About the Cyber Security Review     12 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Security and Resilience  Strategic Context: The Evolution of the Cyber  Threat  The threats we face in cyberspace are complex and rapidly evolving.   Governments, businesses, organizations, and Canadians are vulnerable.   With more of our economy and essential services moving online every year,   the stakes could not be higher.  Cybercrime and Advanced Cyber Threats  Perpetrators of malicious cyber activity are extremely diverse, with varying   aims and a wide array of techniques. Malicious cyber actors include   individual hackers and insider threats, criminal networks, nation states,   terrorist organizations, and state-sponsored actors. Sophisticated cyber   attacks are often technically challenging to understand, with significant   expertise required to do so.      13 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Any organization or individual can be a victim of malicious cyber activity.   Victims may be individually targeted or part of a campaign affecting   millions of internet users. As Canadians put more information online, they   become increasingly attractive targets for malicious cyber actors. Canadian   law enforcement agencies’ ability to protect Canadians from these actors,   who may be anywhere in the world, is a growing challenge.  Malicious cyber activity is often conducted for monetary gain. For example,   phishing emails that appear to come from financial institutions can   deceive people into providing their banking information. Ransomware   can be deployed to encrypt files on a device or system, with a hacker   demanding payment to restore access. Data breaches can result in personal   and financial information (such as social insurance numbers, credit   card information) being stolen from organizations’ online databases and   subsequently sold in criminal marketplaces for activities like fraud, identity   theft, or extortion.   Malicious cyber actors can also be motivated by a specific cause —   sometimes called “hacktivists” — such as exposing wrongdoing, protesting,   or provoking embarrassment. They can also be enthusiasts, attempting to   demonstrate their skill at hacking and to gain notoriety.  On a larger scale, nation states and state-sponsored actors have the   capability to steal our intellectual property or confidential business   strategies to give their own economies a competitive advantage.   Some nation states are also developing advanced cyber tools with hostile   aims. There are risks to Canada’s national security and public safety if   Security and Resilience     14 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  the threat is to the computer systems that underpin government systems,   critical infrastructure, and democratic institutions. Terrorist organizations   are also interested in acquiring advanced cyber tools to conduct attacks.  The Growing Impact  As malicious cyber tools become increasingly accessible and as rates of   cybercrime continue to rise, there is a real threat to Canada’s economic   well-being. Furthermore, as more of Canada’s critical infrastructure can   be controlled remotely and essential services are managed online, cyber   incidents have the potential to compromise national security and    public safety.   From a financial perspective, victims of cyber compromise face immediate   costs to recover and restore their systems. They also face long-term costs   to replace or upgrade cyber systems, as well as untold reputational costs.   While start-ups are particularly vulnerable, the loss of intellectual property   has contributed to financial ruin for businesses of all sizes.  Cyber incidents can also be profoundly destabilizing. They can erode   trust in e-commerce and government institutions and can lead people to   question their continued use of digital technologies if they feel that their   safety or privacy is at risk.  The internet-of-things (IoT) refers to objects and devices that are   connected to the internet to communicate with one another and provide   Security and Resilience  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   EMAIL SCAMS   It’s tax season and Mohsen recently filed his   taxes online. A few days later, he receives   an email from someone claiming to be a   tax official, informing him that there is   information missing from his file. The official   makes an urgent request for additional   personal information to complete his file,   including his address and social insurance   number.  The email notes that failure to   provide this information could lead to steep   penalties and even jail time. Mohsen feels   suspicious about the email, and so before   providing the information, he checks the   Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website. He   reads that the CRA would never send emails   asking individuals to divulge personal or   financial information.  He follows the CRA’s   advice by ignoring the email.      15 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  more efficient and customized services. The IoT is growing rapidly, with   over 25 billion connected devices expected by 2020.   Connecting devices to the internet opens the door to new cyber security   risks. Cyber security gaps can be exploited to disrupt services through   distributed denial of service (DDoS) campaigns or to gain entry to wider   systems or private data. In October 2016, millions of unsecured devices were   used to overwhelm the servers of Dyn, an internet infrastructure company,   which then took popular websites and online services offline internationally.    As digital innovation is pushed further and as new technologies are   developed, the nature of cyber threats will constantly change. For instance,   internet-connected technologies are increasingly popular, from thermostats   and healthcare devices like pacemakers to cars and the systems that run   our critical infrastructure and services. Without adequate cyber security,   connected devices are vulnerable to being hacked on an unprecedented   scale. Similarly, many Canadians rely on encryption to secure their online   communications and data. The arrival of quantum computing will undercut   the security of traditional encryption, requiring that Canadians have   quantum-resistant solutions at their disposal. A forward-looking and flexible   cyber security posture will be necessary to keep pace with these changes.  Security and Resilience  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   RESILIENCE THROUGH INFORMATION  SHARING  Beom-Jun works in the IT Department for   a large financial institution. He has noticed   that there have been a lot of attempts to   hack into the system. While they have   been unsuccessful, he decides to send the   technical information to the Canadian Cyber   Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) for their   analysis. He knows that CCIRC relies on   critical infrastructure organizations, like his   bank, to report cyber incidents so that they   can notify other sectors and international   partners of trends and threats. He appreciates   that by working together, they are increasing   the cyber security of the organizations that   Canadians rely on.     16 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Public Consultation on Cyber Security   What We Heard   “The #1 cyber challenge for Canada is that there are an increasing number   of incidents that are causing harm to the economy and society, ranging   from breaches, crimes, disruption of essential services, and destruction of   corporate and country assets”  “Privacy and security are not a zero-sum game and we can have both. There   is no security without privacy. And liberty requires both security    and privacy”  “Canadian law enforcement should centralize their cybercrime resources…   A single window centre will make it easier for businesses to know who   to call when their systems have been compromised, and will help law   enforcement investigate and respond to cybercrime across jurisdictions”   About the Cyber Security Review     17 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Security Strategy Goals  Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems  Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber   security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from   cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical   government and private sector systems.   The Government of Canada will maintain and improve cyber security   across all federal departments and agencies to protect the privacy   of Canadians’ information held by the federal government and the   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical services for Canadians.  The Government of Canada will enhance law enforcement capacity to   respond to cybercrime. It will support coordination across law enforcement   agencies and with federal, provincial, territorial, and international partners.   The Government will enhance cybercrime investigative capacity and make   it easier for Canadians to report cybercrime.   Small and medium organizations often lack the knowledge and resources   to implement cyber security regimes, even if doing so would offer a   competitive advantage. The Government of Canada will help support these   organizations — making cyber security more accessible.   In response to cyber threats of increasing sophistication, the Government   of Canada will consider how its advanced cyber capabilities could be   applied to defend critical networks in Canada and deter foreign cyber   threat actors.      18 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Security Strategy Goals  Some cyber systems — such as electricity grids, communications networks,   or financial institutions — are so important that any disruption could have   serious consequences for public safety and national security. The federal   government will work with provinces, territories, and the private sector to   help define requirements to protect this digital infrastructure.     19 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Innovation  Strategic Context: Expanding Frontiers   of Cyber Security  Digital innovation has become the engine of economic growth in the 21st   century. Cyber security is not only essential for protecting the sources of   Canada’s digital innovation — it has become a source of innovation in its    own right.  New Horizons of Technology and Business  Development  Cyber security is increasingly driving innovation and economic activity in   Canada. It already contributes $1.7 billion to Canada’s GDP and consists   of over 11,000 well-paying jobs.1  With the global cyber security industry   forecasted to grow by 66% by 2021, thousands of additional jobs could   1 International Data Corporation (IDC) Canada , “2016 Canadian ICT Predictions and Forecast: Digital Transformation and Disruption,” December 2015   Information and Communications Technology Council (ICTC), “Critical Infrastructure in a Hyperconnected Economy,” August 2016.  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE  Marc is looking for possible summer camps   for his daughters. He wants to find something   that allows them to try something different   while developing new skills. In his search, he   comes across a summer program designed   to help children develop basic coding skills,   which would give them the tools they need   to build websites and develop their own   programs. With Marc’s encouragement they   register for the camp, opening the door to a   new hobby and an exciting skillset.      20 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Innovation  be created for Canadians in the years ahead.2 Governments, academia,   and members of the private sector can work together to create new   opportunities, drive investment, and foster leading-edge research    and development.  Canada is already a leader in cyber security research and development.   Breakthroughs in cyber security research are not only beneficial   for Canadian cyber security firms, but for the economy as a whole.   Government has a role to play to support advanced research and to help   innovative companies scale up to bring cyber security technologies and   services to the global marketplace.   Building on the Benefits of Digital Technology  Canada’s participation in digital life has generated immense prosperity   and benefits, and has opened a new gateway to the world. Governments,   businesses and other organizations play a central role in protecting these   benefits by establishing strong security for their online platforms, products,   and services.  Cyber security is only as strong as its weakest link. Small and medium   enterprises — and indeed many organizations in Canada — face similar   challenges securing their systems and networks as their much larger   counterparts, but must do so with less expertise and fewer resources.   Governments can help correct this asymmetry by providing advice and   guidance and enhancing access to cyber security information and tools.   2 Research and Markets, “Cyber Security Market – Global Forecast to 2021,” August 2016.  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:    STREAMLINING SERVICE DELIVERY  Stuart was relieved when he found out that   he could access his Canada Pension Plan   (CPP) account online without having to   remember another password. All he has to   do is go to the CPP log-in page, click on the   logo for his bank, and enter his information.   He uses the same username and password as   he does for his online banking, since his bank   is a sign-in partner for the Government of   Canada’s online services.  He really likes the   convenience, and since he trusts his bank’s   security measures, he knows his information   is protected. As his son David keeps telling   him, his banking information will be safer   as long as he uses a secure Wi-Fi — like   his password-protected network at home.   Apparently, hackers can intercept traffic    over unsecured Wi-Fi, like in a coffee shop    or airport.     21 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Innovation  This helps Canadian organizations in both public and private sectors to   successfully adopt digital technologies.   Individual knowledge goes a long way in cyber security, from digital   literacy all the way to coding and threat mitigation skills. Initiatives in   Canadian communities, schools, and post-secondary institutions help to   equip Canadians with skills for the digital age. The Government of Canada   is playing its part through long-term investments to help Canadians of   all backgrounds to get the education and work experience they need to   participate in an increasingly digital economy.  Quantum science and technology allows information to be   processed and secured much more rapidly and more securely.    Quantum devices could have revolutionary benefits across a range   of fields, such as helping to understand how diseases develop   or optimizing medical treatments. While quantum can secure   information and push technology to new limits, its use may also   threaten many forms of encryption used today to protect systems   and applications in Canada and around the world.  Recognizing the opportunities and challenges of quantum   computing, Canadian efforts have established a strong base of   expertise and leadership in quantum computing, like that seen at   the Institute of Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo.     22 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Advancing 21st Century Skills and Knowledge  The demand for qualified cyber security professionals is surging. A   global shortage of qualified professionals represents an immediate and   growing opportunity for Canada’s highly educated workforce. We can   encourage more students to move into science, technology, engineering,   and mathematics (STEM) fields. We can encourage graduates from both   STEM programs and other disciplines (such as psychology, sociology,   or management) to specialize in the skills needed for cyber security jobs.   Attracting this multidisciplinary talent, both domestically and from abroad, is   essential for Canadian governments and businesses. It also helps to ensure that   Canadian companies are able to safely grow and innovate as they expand their   use of digital technology.  As the cyber security environment continues to evolve, there is a constant   need for reliable and up-to-date information. Canadian statistics and   research in the area of cyber security will provide a more accurate view of   the cyber issues our nation faces in a global context. This information can   be used by academics, researchers, and policy makers to understand trends,   manage risk, inform future investments, and adjust course when appropriate.  Cyber Innovation     23 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Public Consultation on Cyber Security   What We Heard “We must work to ensure that start-ups and innovation born in Canada stay   in Canada”  “The federal government can play a unique role in ensuring businesses see   Canada as a location where they can thrive in a cyber safe environment”  “Few appreciate the strategic relevance of cyber security intelligence. You can’t   manage what you don’t measure”  About the Cyber Security Review     24 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Cyber Security Strategy Goals  An Innovative and Adaptive Cyber Ecosystem  By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and   developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will   position Canada as a global leader in cyber security.   The Government of Canada will work with partners to drive investment   and foster cyber research and development. The Government will focus   on emerging areas of Canadian excellence, such as quantum computing   and blockchain technologies. The federal government is already making   progress in this regard, with Budget 2017 announcing the creation of a Pan-  Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy for research and talent.    Together, we will explore initiatives to ensure that Canadian companies can   bring their products to a global market. The Government will explore initiatives   to drive domestic demand for cyber security technologies and services.  The Government of Canada will explore new ideas for making businesses   and Canadians of all ages and backgrounds more cyber secure. The federal   government has already committed investments to improve digital skills,   such as coding education for kids.  Working together across governments, academia, and the private sector is   necessary to address the cyber skills gap. Taking action now will allow us to   build the labour force of the future, one that will help to support Canadian   cyber security and that will contribute to Canada’s future prosperity.     25 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The quality of information at our disposal shapes our ability to understand   cyber trends. The federal government will support Canadian research and   statistics efforts to improve our collective understanding of cyber threats    and opportunities.   Cyber Security Strategy Goals     26 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Leadership and Collaboration  Strategic Context: Collaborating to Realize the  Benefits of Digital Life    Advances in technology benefit our communities and our societies.   They contribute to our quality of life today, and will be instrumental in   meeting the challenges of tomorrow. We all have a responsibility to secure   these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the   Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to   do so.  Raising Baseline Cyber Security in Canada  The vast majority of Canada’s digital systems are owned by individuals   and organizations outside of the federal government. From individuals   that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted   in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of   cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect      27 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  themselves and recover from cyber incidents. Even those that recognize   the importance of securing their information may find it hard to identify   affordable and effective measures to protect themselves.   The Government of Canada is taking on a leadership role in cyber security   to help organizations and Canadians recognize the value of cyber security   and to support efforts to raise the baseline of cyber security in Canada.   It will complement these domestic efforts by working with international   partners and allies, seeking to reduce the threat to Canada from   cybercriminals and also from state actors and their proxies that may seek to   harm us.   Moreover, the federal government is aiming for national cyber security   excellence. Reaching this target will involve enhancing and growing cyber   security capabilities in government and industry. It will entail supporting   Canada’s leading edge research and development, as well as the range   of organizations and businesses that do not have strong cyber security   measures in place. Private sector leaders will have a central role to play, as   a collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all Canadians are as equipped   as possible to prevent and respond to cyber threats.   Blockchain technology allows for the creation of online ledgers or   records. Often associated with virtual currencies, there are many   possible applications of blockchain. It could be used to provide   public services like issuing passports, creating records of contracts   or legal documents, and processing payments for services rendered.   The technology improves efficiency by reducing processing time for   activities and reduces the risk of fraud and compromise, as no one   party can modify, delete or append any records.  Leadership and Collaboration     28 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The Government of Canada recognizes the potential of blockchain   for secure service delivery and for wider economic and societal   benefits. Ensuring the smart application of blockchain technologies in   Canada will require a collaborative approach and a collective effort.   Federal Cyber Security Leadership in a  Dynamic Environment  The Government of Canada is in a unique position to play a leadership   role in cyber security. This stems from extensive relationships with private   and public sectors, a history of working with provinces, territories, and   international officials on a range of cyber security issues, and advanced   cyber security expertise and capabilities.   Federal leadership in cyber security was established through the 2010   Strategy and the nation-wide initiatives it introduced. In today’s cyber   security environment, however, the federal government must deepen   collaboration with partners to strengthen Canada’s cyber security.   Concerted and integrated action by all parties is needed to build cyber   resilience in Canada.   Establishing a clear focal point for cyber security within the federal   government is one of the ways that the Government will demonstrate   leadership while also enhancing its capacity to collaborate with partners.   The Government will ensure that partners receive unified advice and   guidance on cyber security and that they know where to go for assistance.  Leadership and Collaboration     29 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Smart cities use digital technologies to enhance quality of life by   making services more efficient, cost-effective, and responsive for   urban residents. For example, “smart” traffic lights will measure and   adapt timing to improve traffic flows and connected sewer systems   will detect leaks and monitor real-time water flow.   To accelerate the development of smart cities in Canada, the federal   government announced the Smart Cities Challenge initiative in   Budget 2017.  The federal government will make smart investments in cyber security,   while also advocating for its partners in the private sector and in other   jurisdictions to do the same. Private sector organizations in Canada have   world-class cyber security capabilities that can be leveraged to benefit all   sectors of the Canadian economy. There are also great ideas and strong   leadership in our schools and our post-secondary institutions that will be   instrumental in shaping the future of cyber security in Canada.   The Government will work to bridge Canada-wide efforts to develop cyber   skills, advance new solutions, and strengthen cyber security. We will be   an example to the world of what can be achieved through a cohesive and   coherent National Cyber Security Strategy.  Leadership and Collaboration  CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT:   COLLABORATING TO SOLVE CYBER SECURITY  PROBLEMS   Augustine received an invitation to   participate in the Canadian Cyber Incident   Response Centre’s (CCIRC) annual Geek   Week. He attended last year and enjoyed   working with cyber professionals and   academics from Canada and other countries   to solve cyber security problems. Augustine   found that the skills and professional   connections he gained during Geek Week   benefitted him when he returned to work.   At last year’s event, his team experimented   with CCIRC’s prototype tools to perform   automated analysis of mobile-based malware   and ransomware, and also examined how   encryption on such devices can be exploited   by attackers. He likes that the work they   did can have a real-world benefit and that   after the event the team was able to take   the tool they worked on back to their own   organizations to develop further.     30 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Public Consultation on Cyber Security   What We Heard “The Government of Canada can provide much needed leadership by creating,   adopting and modeling best practices for cyber security, and making efforts to   transfer this knowledge to the private sector”  “[There is a] need for more centralized governance and strategic planning   … for modern legislation and regulations, and leadership in identifying,   prioritizing, endorsing and disseminating the latest international standards of   cyber security technology”  “Collectively, we need to create an effective framework for cyber security   governance, spanning principles, roles, and responsibilities within the   government and across the public and private sectors”  About the Cyber Security Review     31 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  Effective Leadership, Governance, and  Collaboration  The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces,   territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to   advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with   allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment in   Canada’s favour.  Responding to calls for decisive federal leadership, the Government   of Canada will streamline the way it works and collaborates with   external partners and stakeholders by establishing a clear focal point for   authoritative advice, guidance, and cyber incident response. This approach   will improve information sharing and make it easier for the private sector   to obtain the support it needs.  The Government of Canada will reinvigorate public awareness and   engagement efforts and establish new forums for collaboration. The    federal government will work in consultation with a cross-section of   Canadian stakeholders to ensure that we collectively enhance cyber   security in Canada.   The federal government will lead, in partnership with provinces, territories,   and the private sector, the development of a national plan to prevent,   mitigate and respond to cyber incidents, one that ensures efficient   coordination and effective action.  Cyber Security Strategy Goals     32 of 35  •  NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY  The Government of Canada will work with its international partners to   advance Canadian interests. This includes advocating for an open, free,    and secure internet and enhancing our international cooperation to    combat cybercrime.

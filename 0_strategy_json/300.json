Since then, Malawi has seen the growth of access and usage of ICT services, including an increasing number of online transactions for services. The increasing demand for the ICT applications and services coupled with the provision of high-capacity fibre backbone connectivity across the nation has resulted in the creation of substantial opportunities for further growth in the ICT sector. It is also expected that these developments will drive significant socio-economic growth in Malawi. Consequently, and in an effort to create a conducive environment for the sustained growth and use of ICTs in Malawi, as well as address the threats that come with increased adoption of ICTs, the Government of Malawi undertook a review of existing legislation and developed the Communications Act (2016) and the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016). ICT has become a critical driver for socio-economic development, with the deployment and adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy improvements in all aspects of lives and institutional operations in the nation. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have emerged that restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the socio-economic development of the nation. This Strategy aims to provide a national framework for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in cyberspace by Malawians, by describing the high level strategic goals and specific objectives that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes actions that need to be taken. Chapter 1 of the strategy provides an introduction to cybersecurity in Malawi while chapter 2 details the guiding principles upon which the Strategy is built on, and which will underpin the implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 3 outlines the core components of the National Strategy including the vision mission statement, high-level strategic goals and specific objectives. It further describes the various actions necessary for achieving the Specific objectives and strategic goals of the strategy. Chapter 4 describes the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders in the implementation of the strategy and further proposes an approach for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the strategy. The implementation logical Page | 5 frameworks for the strategy which provide details on Deliverables, Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Timeframes, Lead Organisations and Funding options are described in the Appendix. This NCS Strategy therefore outlines the Government of Malawi’s approach to ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace that can be fully leveraged by citizens and institutions. Consequently, driving further growth of the ICT sector, as well as socio-economic development across Malawi. Page | 6 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Major reforms in the ICT Sector of Malawi go as far back as the 1990s with the advent of sector liberalisation through the separation and commercialisation of the then incumbent Telecommunications operator, Malawi Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (MPTC) into the Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC). Subsequent major reforms include the implementation of the Communications Sector Policy (1998) and the Communications Act (1998) that led to the establishment of the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA). Due to advances in technology over the years, the Communications Act (1998) was reviewed to the Communications Act (2016) and also the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) were enacted. These are the two current legislations for the sector. Currently, the mobile penetration rate in Malawi is quite low in comparison to the average African penetration rates, highlighting the tremendous potential for further growth in Malawi. The broadband access prices in Malawi are among the highest in the region due to high cost and limited availability of international bandwidth. However, the internet sector has about 50 licensed ISPs out of which only 20% are active. The mobile penetration and broadband are expected to grow exponentially over the next couple of years. Since, the current mobile market in Malawi is a duopoly, the government of Malawi has introduced a converged licensing regime in an effort to encourage further market competition and growth. It is expected that the converged licensing regimes will introduce new entrants into the sector and enhance competition resulting in lower prices. In addition, service providers in Malawi have launched 3G services, invested in LTE infrastructure or continued to extend their WIMAX wireless broadband networks. Furthermore, Malawi gained access to international submarine cables recently following the completion of a transit link via neighbouring countries and is currently deploying a national fibre backbone. As a result of these recent developments within the sector, as well as the high potential for further rapid proliferation of ICTs within Malawi, it is evident that Malawians will increasingly get connected to the Internet and use ICTs overtime. This increased connectivity and use of ICT’s Page | 7 come with increased threats to activities of businesses and people in Malawi. If Malawi is to fully leverage ICTs to spur socio-economic development of the nation, it has to be ready and capable of addressing these threats. NCS 2017-2021 sets out a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring Malawians can access and use cyberspace with trust and confidence, and ensuring the nation responds to threats to ICT systems and services in a coherent and effective manner. 1.2 Situational Analysis 1.2.1 National Development and the Role of ICT The Government of Malawi in its last development and growth strategy (MGDS 2011 -2016) recognized how critical a well-developed ICT system is in the development of Malawi. The Government embarked on implementing a number of strategies resulting in a number of desired outcomes including improved ICT broadband infrastructure; increased access and usage to ICT services; improved postal and broadcasting services; improved ICT governance; and enhanced ICT capacity for the general public. This is consistent with the Government’s current overarching Policy Goal for ICTs in Malawi, as described within the National ICT Policy (2013) which is “to contribute to socio-economic development through maximum integration of ICT in all sectors and the provision of ICT services to the rural areas”. The development of the MGDS follows a phased approach to address the ICT development needs of the country in support of the prevailing policies and the legal framework. The MGDS was developed to be the overarching operational medium-term strategy for Malawi in the attainment of its set vision. The main thrust of the MGDS is to create wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means of achieving poverty reduction. The MGDS I was developed to lay the framework while MGDS II was tasked with putting in place the operational mechanism. The NCS therefore feeds into MGDS II as well as the plans for development of MGDS III thereby addressing Government goals of universal ICT access within a safe and secure operational environment. This policy direction is quite consistent with global research studies and evidence that clearly demonstrates the connection between ICT adoption and usage of ICT services with national GDP growth. In fact, the World Bank has demonstrated the greater development impact of broadband specifically on emerging economies as compared to high-income countries. Page | 8 Currently, Malawi’s broadband penetration has risen from 6% in 2013 to around 17.1% in 2016, which is relatively low compared to other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries and the rest of the world. However, with the rapid development of the ICT sector, the Government of Malawi through the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS 2011- 2016), recognizes the potential broadband growth which puts the users of ICT services at a cyber risk. Thus, the Government of Malawi needs to be prepared and deploy effective strategies or measures to create a conducive environment that builds trust and confidence in the use of ICTs by Malawian businesses and citizens. 1.2.2 Cybercrime in Malawi The Government of Malawi recognizes that high levels of crime across the nation results in significant socio-economic damage and nullifies significant developmental activities. In fact, in the National ICT Policy (2013), the Government set out to establish sufficient national capacity to deal with national security, the violation of human rights, and the undesirable impacts of ICTs such as the privacy violations, cybercrimes, digital frauds and terrorism. Despite the government’s position, and like other nations across the world, cybercrime continues to be a real threat and facet of life in Malawi. Cyber criminals continue to commit cybercrimes of larger scales and sophistication across various countries, including Malawi. Many of these cyber criminals seek to make use of confidential and sensitive information and usually have detrimental effects on individuals, businesses and government institutions in the country. Consistent with global trends, a major sector targeted by cyber criminals in Malawi is the financial sector. Other key cybercrime incidents that have been observed in the country include identity theft, various email scams, distribution of compromising images, attacks on computer data and systems. Therefore, it is critical that Malawi develops a strategy that protects its citizens and institutions from these cyber criminals and enhances the nation’s ability to detect, prosecute and prevent cybercrimes in Malawi. The high levels of ICT access and usage in the country coupled with the absence of specific legislation dealing with cyber security issues in Malawi proved a big challenge in the fight against common forms of cybercrime namely—true cybercrimes, which are committed against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computers, computer systems and networks, hacking, malware and website defacement among others. Secondly, traditional crimes, which Page | 9 are committed through the instrumentality of computers, computer systems and data e.g. child pornography, sexual harassment, fraud, forgery, crime recorded and posted online and others. However, the enactment of the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016) has provided a platform to harness all the efforts that were being hampered by lack of appropriate legislation. Malawi is also benefiting from regional initiatives and harmonization of strategies to provide a model standard for the region. 1.2.3 Malawi’s Cybersecurity Related Activities Understanding the current cybersecurity-related activities of Malawi is critical to ensuring the effective cooperation between Malawi’s stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related mandates and activities. Therefore, this Strategy considers the various functions and activities of the different stakeholders in Malawi relating to cybersecurity. Noteworthy cybersecurity-related activities undertaken in Malawi over the past year include the recent promulgation of the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) and the development of this National Cybersecurity Strategy. The recently promulgated Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) address a number of ICT security issues like cybercrime, data protection, and privacy among others. For instance, the Electronic-Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) will enable citizens to undertake various electronic transactions with the full protection of the law, as well as ensure citizens are protected from computer related harms like cybercrimes, viruses and hacks. Part 6 of the Electronic-Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) provides details of offences; Clause 87, for instance, addresses events where an individual knowingly introduces or spreads a software code that damages computer, computer system or network. Other issues addressed in the Act include cryptography, Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD), the establishment of the Malawi National CERT and the appointment of cyber inspectors. However, efforts to address challenges within the cyberspace in Malawi were fragmented due to the absence of a coordinated strategic approach by all key stakeholders. The NCS will therefore provide a link among all these stakeholders to provide effective solutions to the identified challenges. The NCS as an overarching strategy provides a platform for: the Ministry of Justice to deal with the legal issues related to the cyberspace in conjunction with all law enforcement Page | 10 agencies; the regulatory authorities to review the effectiveness of the legal and regulatory framework; and the academia to review the curricula and offer training suited to the trends in addressing challenges in the cyberspace. The extent of cyber issues entails generic actions to specific sectors that eventually feeds into the national strategy. For instance the. banking sector has embarked on sector specific training to address the needs of the banks, likewise the academia has also incorporated various courses for cybersecurity in order to enhance the level of knowledge and awareness for cybersecurity. 1.2.4 Linkages with other National Policies and Programmes The National Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with and will complement the following Government of Malawi policies and legislations:  Science and Technology Policy (2002)  The National ICT Policy (2013)  The National ICT Master Plan (2014 – 2031)  Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016)  Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II (2011 -2016)  Vision 2020  Communications Act (2016) Additionally, the NCS will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to be aligned to future national strategies/plans. Page | 11 2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES The National Cybersecurity Strategy is built on the following Guiding Principles: i.

Strategic Goal (ii): Develop and enhance cybersecurity-related capacity, infrastructure, legal, regulatory and other related frameworks The limitation of cybersecurity capacity, infrastructure, and other related frameworks is recognized as a key challenge for Malawi which impairs the nation’s efforts in ensuring high levels of cybersecurity. Aligned to the national vision of creating information driven and knowledge based society, the Government of Malawi will seek to ensure that there is an available pool of highly skilled and knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals in Malawi. The Government will also seek to promote research and development in cybersecurity as well as create an enabling environment where innovation and creativity in cybersecurity can be fostered. Considering that all ICT users including individuals, public or private sector are required to take necessary steps in ensuring their cybersecurity including investing in infrastructure or technology, the Government will facilitate the deployment of, and usage of requisite infrastructure/technology necessary to ensure good levels of cybersecurity nationwide. The Government will also seek to establish and strengthen a range of cybersecurity-related frameworks which will enhance the cybersecurity of Malawi. For instance, the Government will seek to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework of Malawi to support the cybersecurity landscape and create a conducive environment for the effective use of cyberspace by individuals, the public and private sector. 3.4.3 Specific Objective 3: Strengthen Malawi’s legal and regulatory frameworks to enhance cybersecurity in Malawi Actions: Page | 18 3.4.3.1 Undertake a gap analysis to identify gaps in current ICT Security Legal and Regulatory Framework and develop requisite instruments to address Gaps including issues relating to privacy and data protection. 3.4.3.2 Develop and publish a cybersecurity policy and standards consisting of general and sector-specific cybersecurity controls that would be recognized as a national standard 3.4.3.3 Create a national programme to promote the adaptation and adoption of cyber standards across government institutions and CII in Malawi 3.4.4 Specific Objective 4: Stakeholder capacity building for law enforcement and judiciary to implement cybersecurity related laws Actions: 3.4.4.1 Identify needs and then provide training and education to develop the capacities of the law enforcement agencies, judiciary and the legal fraternity on how to interpret and enforce the policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on cybersecurity in Malawi 3.4.5 Specific objective 5: Enhance technical and procedural measures for implementing cybersecurity for CIIs 3.4.5.1 Establish mandatory and minimum technology and security requirements for CIIs 3.4.5.2 Develop a national government programme to deploy and manage government ICT infrastructure 3.4.5.3 Develop a national programme to enhance internet infrastructure development and resilience. 3.4.5.4 Develop National Contingency plans which identify emergency response asset priorities and standard operating procedures (SOPs) 3.4.5.5 Review and update the map of current emergency response assets 3.4.5.6 Ensure communication channels are deployed across emergency response functions, geographic areas of responsibility, public and private responders, and command authority.

Strategic Goal (iv): Enable and continuously improve the safety of vulnerable groups in cyberspace, especially the safety of children The Government of Malawi recognizes its responsibility in protecting vulnerable groups, especially children as they usually lack the capacity to do so themselves. For instance, children are susceptible to cyber bullying, pornography, and other harmful content, and meeting online contacts offline, sexual solicitation and grooming. Therefore, the Government will seek to ensure that vulnerable groups, especially children, use ICTs and cyberspace in a safe and responsible manner. The Government will deploy measures that ensure that vulnerable groups especially children, as well as their minders or guardians, are informed and aware of cyber threats and risks. Furthermore, it will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop and deploy measures and tools to protect the vulnerable and ensure they stay safe online. 3.4.10 Specific Objective 10: Ensure online safety for vulnerable groups, especially children Actions: 3.4.10.1 Develop and disseminate online safety guidelines and best practices to protect vulnerable groups in Malawi, especially children, from cyber threats Page | 23 3.4.10.2 Deploy special awareness programmes to target and inform children and other vulnerable groups about safe and responsible use of the internet 3.4.11 Specific Objective 11: Deploy tools to ensure that vulnerable groups, especially children are safe online Actions: 3.4.11.1 Promote the deployment of technical measures or web filtering tools that prevent access to harmful content by children and other vulnerable groups 3.4.11.2 Encourage ISPs and other services providers to make their clients, especially parents and guardians aware of how to leverage available tools, technologies to manage potential risks to vulnerable groups while accessing services online Page | 24 V. Strategic Goal (v): Enhance and coordinate the fight against all forms of cybercrime It is evident that cybercrime has several detrimental effects on the Malawian nation. Some of these impacts include economic losses, reputation damage, reduced confidence in ICT services, etc. The Government of Malawi appreciates the severity of the evolving threat of cybercrime to the nation and the numerous challenges in combating cybercrime across the nation. The Government aims to enhance the detection, investigation, and prosecution of cybercrimes in Malawi. This will require Malawi to strengthen the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks relating to Cybercrime in Malawi, as well as to build the capacity of the stakeholders responsible for the detection, investigation, and prosecution of cybercrimes. The Government also recognizes the need for coordination and collaboration in the national response to cybercrime, and will develop strong partnerships to combat cybercrime. 3.4.12 Specific Objective 12: Enhance Cybercrime detection Actions: 3.4.12.1 Establish the requisite framework to establish and operationalize a Digital Forensics Laboratory 3.4.12.2 Develop mandatory digital forensics and evidence handling courses for the judiciary, law enforcement and personnel from other related agencies involved in the detection and prosecution of cybercrime 3.4.12.3 Build and enhance capacity to detect cybercrime incidents 3.4.13 Specific Objective 13: Enhance cooperation and awareness in the fight against cybercrimes Page | 25 Actions: 3.4.13.1 Develop and continuously update an information sharing, governance and collaboration framework for the fight against cybercrime which will include links that ensure direct and timely collaboration between judiciary, law enforcement and personnel from other related agencies, service providers, CII entities, Malawi CERT and other government institutions on issues that concern cybercrime and Cybersecurity 3.4.14 Specific Objective 14: Promote international collaboration in the fight against cybercrime Actions: 3.4.14.1 Strengthen collaboration with regional, international states and partners in combating cybercrime through treaties, conventions (e.g. Budapest) and bilateral agreements, especially through frameworks such as the 24/7 cybercrime Network, mutual legal assistance frameworks, etc. 3.4.14.2 Develop a clear plan that outlines how to manage international collaboration across multiple strategy areas such as law enforcement, incidence response, research and innovation in cybersecurity. 3.4.14.3 Subscribe to and participate in all relevant regional and international forums on cybersecurity. VI. Strategic Goal (vi): Promote use of secure cyberspace to drive social and economic development The Government of Malawi recognizes the multiplier effect of the cyberspace on several aspects of its society, including social and economic development. In fact, with more and more individuals and organizations adopting and utilizing ICT technologies and applications, there is extensive evidence that illustrates the positive impacts of ICTs including cyberspace. The Government seeks to create a secure and reliable environment which facilitates the secure use of cyberspace, promotes trust in cyberspace, increased usage of e-government and e- Page | 26 commerce services, and consequently driving further social and economic development in Malawi. Page | 27 3.4.15 Specific Objective 15: Cooperate with the private sector to ensure that cyberspace, reliably and securely, supports information sharing, R&D, and entrepreneurship Actions: 3.4.15.1 Undertake the transition from IPV4 to IPV6 protocol and disseminate information on the benefits of the transition, especially IPV6 security features relating to confidentiality, authentication and data integrity 3.4.16 Specific Objective 16: Foster trust and confidence in cyberspace, especially in applications relating to e-government and e-commerce.

They will further be expected to utilize the information and messages available on the safe use of the cyberspace. 4.2 Funding and Resources The successful implementation of Malawi’s NCS is fully dependent on adequate funds and resources. Considering that ICTs and Cyberspace spur socio-economic growth, the National Cybersecurity Strategy implementation logical frameworks have identified possible lead organization and funding sources for various measures proposed in the NCS. 4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation The implementation of the NCS will require a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that:  supports the attainment of the NCS Vision and Strategic Goals; and  enables accurate reporting on progress and identification of lessons learned and challenges encountered for informed decision making and effective planning. Page | 31 This can be used to elaborate new measures as well as amend and tailor existing initiatives under the strategy. This section of the Strategy details the proposed systematic approach to monitoring and evaluating progress as an integral part in implementing the NCS of Malawi. The monitoring is scheduled to be periodic in order to track the progress of implementation of the NCS. The monitoring will, therefore, focus on periodic and objective assessment of progress towards the attainment of the set objectives. The key objectives of the monitoring and evaluation approach are:  Establishment of Performance Targets for various governmental institutions or relevant stakeholders responsible for implementing specific actions of the NCS.  Development of performance plans to establish a shared understanding of the expected end results, the approach to achieving these end results and identify the resources necessary to ensure a successful implementation. The plans will be based on the KPIs, Performance Targets and Deadlines provided in the Implementation Logical Framework  Monitoring and reporting performance and progress in achieving expected end results by identifying and promptly reporting observed or likely deviations.  Periodically evaluating institutional or individual performance against established performance targets  An independent stakeholder will be commissioned to undertake the mid-term and long- term review of the strategy to determine the long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews, and if necessary effect remedial actions to keep implementation on track. The mid-term review will be undertaken at the end of 3rd Quarter of Year 3 of the Strategy and the long term review at the end of the 4th year. MACRA and all relevant Stakeholders will develop a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation Plan which will be based on the proposed approach within 3 months of the adoption of the Strategy. The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will enable the assessment of the operational issues encountered during the implementation of the strategy, as well as the assessment of the Page | 32 long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews. The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will also provide mechanisms or tools for data collection and reporting, and further information on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and frequency of reports.

Since then,   Malawi has seen the growth of access and usage of ICT services, including an increasing   number of online transactions for services. The increasing demand for the ICT applications and   services coupled with the provision of high-capacity fibre backbone connectivity across the   nation has resulted in the creation of substantial opportunities for further growth in the ICT   sector. It is also expected that these developments will drive significant socio-economic growth   in Malawi. Consequently, and in an effort to create a conducive environment for the sustained   growth and use of ICTs in Malawi, as well as address the threats that come with increased   adoption of ICTs, the Government of Malawi undertook a review of existing legislation and   developed the   Communications Act (2016) and the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security   Act (2016).   ICT has become a critical driver for socio-economic development, with the deployment and   adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy improvements in all aspects of lives   and institutional operations in the nation. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have   emerged that restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the   socio-economic development of the nation. This Strategy aims to provide a national framework   for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in   cyberspace by Malawians, by describing the high level strategic goals and specific objectives   that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes   actions that need to be taken.      Chapter 1 of the strategy provides an introduction to cybersecurity in Malawi while chapter 2   details the guiding principles upon which the Strategy is built on, and which will underpin the   implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 3 outlines the core components of the National   Strategy including the vision   mission statement, high-level strategic goals and specific   objectives. It further describes the various actions necessary for achieving the Specific   objectives and strategic goals of the strategy. Chapter 4 describes the roles and responsibilities   of the key stakeholders in the implementation of the strategy and further proposes an approach   for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the strategy. The implementation logical     Page | 5      frameworks for the strategy which provide details on Deliverables, Key Performance Indicators   (KPI), Timeframes, Lead Organisations and Funding options are described in the Appendix.   This NCS Strategy therefore outlines the Government of Malawi’s approach to ensuring a safe   and secure cyberspace that can be fully leveraged by citizens and institutions. Consequently,   driving further growth of the ICT sector, as well as socio-economic development across Malawi.            Page | 6      1 INTRODUCTION   1.1 Background   Major reforms in the ICT Sector of Malawi go as far back as the 1990s with the advent of sector   liberalisation through the separation and commercialisation of the then incumbent   Telecommunications operator, Malawi Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (MPTC) into   the Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC).   Subsequent major reforms include the implementation of the Communications Sector Policy   (1998) and the Communications Act (1998) that led to the establishment of the Malawi   Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA). Due to advances in technology over the years,   the Communications Act (1998) was reviewed to the Communications Act (2016) and also the   Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) were enacted. These are the two current   legislations for the sector.   Currently, the mobile penetration rate in Malawi is quite low in comparison to the average   African penetration rates, highlighting the tremendous potential for further growth in Malawi.   The broadband access prices in Malawi are among the highest in the region due to high cost   and limited availability of international bandwidth. However, the internet sector   has about 50   licensed ISPs out of which only 20% are active.    The mobile penetration and broadband are expected to grow exponentially over the next couple   of years. Since, the current mobile market in Malawi is a duopoly, the government of Malawi   has introduced a converged licensing regime in an effort to encourage further market   competition and growth. It is expected that the converged licensing regimes will introduce new   entrants into the sector and enhance competition resulting in lower prices.  In addition, service   providers in Malawi have launched 3G services, invested in LTE infrastructure or continued to   extend their WIMAX wireless broadband networks. Furthermore, Malawi gained access to   international submarine cables recently following the completion of a transit link via   neighbouring countries and is currently deploying a national fibre backbone.    As a result of these recent developments within the sector, as well as the high potential for   further rapid proliferation of ICTs within Malawi, it is evident that Malawians will increasingly get   connected to the Internet and use ICTs overtime. This increased connectivity and use of ICT’s     Page | 7      come with increased threats to activities of businesses and people in Malawi. If Malawi is to   fully leverage ICTs to spur socio-economic development of the nation, it has to be ready and   capable of addressing these threats.    NCS 2017-2021 sets out a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring Malawians can access and   use cyberspace with trust and confidence, and ensuring the nation responds to threats to ICT   systems and services in a coherent and effective manner.    1.2 Situational Analysis   1.2.1 National Development and the Role of ICT    The Government of Malawi in its last development and growth strategy (MGDS 2011 -2016)   recognized how critical a well-developed ICT system is in the development of Malawi. The   Government embarked on implementing a number of strategies resulting in a number of desired   outcomes including improved ICT broadband infrastructure; increased access and usage to ICT   services; improved postal and broadcasting services; improved ICT governance; and enhanced   ICT capacity for the general public. This is consistent with the Government’s current   overarching Policy Goal for ICTs in Malawi, as described within the National ICT Policy (2013)   which is “to contribute to socio-economic development through maximum integration of ICT in   all sectors and the provision of ICT services to the rural areas”.     The development of the MGDS follows a phased approach to address the ICT development   needs of the country in support of the prevailing policies and the legal framework. The MGDS   was developed to be the overarching operational medium-term strategy for Malawi in the   attainment of its set vision. The main thrust of the MGDS is to create wealth through   sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means of achieving poverty   reduction. The MGDS I was developed to lay the framework while MGDS II was tasked with   putting in place the operational mechanism. The NCS therefore feeds into MGDS II as well as   the plans for development of MGDS III thereby addressing Government goals of universal ICT   access within a safe and secure operational environment.   This policy direction is quite consistent with global research studies and evidence that clearly   demonstrates the connection between ICT adoption and usage of ICT services with national   GDP growth. In fact, the World Bank has demonstrated the greater development impact of   broadband specifically on emerging economies as compared to high-income countries.     Page | 8      Currently, Malawi’s broadband penetration has risen from 6% in 2013 to around 17.1% in 2016,   which is relatively low compared to other Southern African Development Community (SADC)   countries and the rest of the world. However, with the rapid development of the ICT sector, the   Government of Malawi through the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS 2011-  2016), recognizes the potential broadband growth which puts the users of ICT services at a   cyber risk. Thus, the Government of Malawi needs to be prepared and deploy effective   strategies or measures to create a conducive environment that builds trust and confidence in   the use of ICTs by Malawian businesses and citizens.    1.2.2 Cybercrime in Malawi   The Government of Malawi recognizes that high levels of crime across the nation results in   significant socio-economic damage and nullifies significant developmental activities. In fact, in   the National ICT Policy (2013), the Government set out to establish sufficient national capacity   to deal with national security, the violation of human rights, and the undesirable impacts of   ICTs such as the privacy violations, cybercrimes, digital frauds and terrorism. Despite the   government’s position, and like other nations across the world, cybercrime continues to be a   real threat and facet of life in Malawi. Cyber criminals continue to commit cybercrimes of larger   scales and sophistication across various countries, including Malawi. Many of these cyber   criminals seek to make use of confidential and sensitive information and usually have   detrimental effects on individuals, businesses and government institutions in the country.   Consistent with global trends, a major sector targeted by cyber criminals in Malawi is the   financial sector. Other key cybercrime incidents that have been observed in the country include   identity theft, various email scams, distribution of compromising images, attacks on computer   data and systems. Therefore, it is critical that Malawi develops a strategy that protects its   citizens and institutions from these cyber criminals and enhances the nation’s ability to detect,   prosecute and prevent cybercrimes in Malawi.        The high levels of ICT access and usage in the country coupled with the absence of specific   legislation dealing with cyber security issues in Malawi proved a big challenge in the fight   against common forms of cybercrime namely—true cybercrimes, which are committed against   the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computers, computer systems and networks,   hacking, malware and website defacement among others. Secondly, traditional crimes, which     Page | 9      are committed through the instrumentality of computers, computer systems and data e.g. child   pornography, sexual harassment, fraud, forgery, crime recorded and posted online and others.      However, the enactment of the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016) has   provided a platform to harness all the efforts that were being hampered by lack of appropriate   legislation. Malawi is also benefiting from regional initiatives and harmonization of strategies to   provide a model standard for the region.      1.2.3 Malawi’s Cybersecurity Related Activities   Understanding the current cybersecurity-related activities of Malawi is critical to ensuring the   effective cooperation between Malawi’s stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related mandates   and activities. Therefore, this Strategy considers the various functions and activities of the   different stakeholders in Malawi relating to cybersecurity. Noteworthy cybersecurity-related   activities undertaken in Malawi over the past year include the recent promulgation of the   Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) and the development of this National   Cybersecurity Strategy.  The recently promulgated Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security   Act (2016) address a number of ICT security issues like cybercrime, data protection, and   privacy among others. For instance, the Electronic-Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016)   will enable citizens to undertake various electronic transactions with the full protection of the   law, as well as ensure citizens are protected from computer related harms like cybercrimes,   viruses and hacks. Part 6 of the Electronic-Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) provides   details of offences; Clause 87, for instance, addresses events where an individual knowingly   introduces or spreads a software code that damages computer, computer system or network.    Other issues addressed in the Act include cryptography, Country Code Top Level Domain   (ccTLD), the establishment of the Malawi National CERT and the appointment of cyber   inspectors.       However, efforts to address challenges within the cyberspace in Malawi were fragmented due to   the absence of a coordinated strategic approach by all key stakeholders. The NCS will therefore   provide a link among all these stakeholders to provide effective solutions to the identified   challenges. The NCS as an overarching strategy provides a platform for: the Ministry of Justice   to deal with the legal issues related to the cyberspace in conjunction with all law enforcement     Page | 10      agencies; the regulatory authorities to review the effectiveness of the legal and regulatory   framework; and the academia to review the curricula and offer training suited to the trends in   addressing challenges in the cyberspace.       The extent of cyber issues entails generic actions to specific sectors that eventually feeds into   the national strategy. For instance the. banking sector has embarked on sector specific training   to address the needs of the banks, likewise the academia has also incorporated various courses   for cybersecurity in order to enhance the level of knowledge and awareness for cybersecurity.         1.2.4 Linkages with other National Policies and Programmes   The National Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with and will complement the following   Government of Malawi policies and legislations:    Science and Technology Policy (2002)    The National ICT Policy (2013)    The National ICT Master Plan (2014 – 2031)    Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016)    Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II (2011 -2016)    Vision 2020    Communications Act (2016)   Additionally, the NCS will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to be aligned to   future national strategies/plans.             Page | 11      2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES   The National Cybersecurity Strategy is built on the following Guiding Principles:   i. Risk-based approach: The Cybersecurity Strategy will ensure that a risk-based   approach is adopted by the private sector, the government, academia and civil society in   assessing and responding to cyber-related threats or issues.      ii.

Strategic Goal (i): Identify and manage the Critical Information   Infrastructure of Malawi      Protecting the information infrastructure of Malawi is of critical to the Government of Malawi,   especially as successful cyber attacks on them will have severe impacts on the country. These   impacts could include destabilization of Malawi’s economy and stability or reputational damages   to individuals.  Therefore, it is vital that Malawi prioritizes the cybersecurity of its critical   information infrastructures (CIIs) which are key for the provision of essential services to Malawi   by ensuring these CIIs are secure and resilient.   The protection of Malawi’s information   infrastructure including CIIs necessitates collaboration of all relevant stakeholders including   public and private institutions that own or operate the information infrastructure which supports   the well-functioning of the Malawian society. Consequently, the Government of Malawi will work   with all relevant stakeholders to identify and understand the vulnerabilities and levels of   cybersecurity of Malawi’s information infrastructure, especially CIIs. The Government will also   work with relevant stakeholders to establish measures that will address current and future   cyber threats and risks to the national information infrastructure, and drive improvements   where necessary.        3.4.1 Specific Objective 1: Identify and protect the Critical Information   Infrastructure of Malawi.

Strategic Goal (ii): Develop and enhance cybersecurity-related capacity,   infrastructure, legal, regulatory and other related frameworks     The limitation of cybersecurity capacity, infrastructure, and other related frameworks is   recognized as a key challenge for Malawi which impairs the nation’s efforts in ensuring high   levels of cybersecurity. Aligned to the national vision of creating information driven and   knowledge based society, the Government of Malawi will seek to ensure that there is an   available pool of highly skilled and knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals in Malawi. The   Government will also seek to promote research and development in cybersecurity as well as   create an enabling environment where innovation and creativity in cybersecurity can be   fostered.       Considering that all ICT users including individuals, public or private sector are required to take   necessary steps in ensuring their cybersecurity including investing in infrastructure or   technology, the Government will facilitate the deployment of, and usage of requisite   infrastructure/technology necessary to ensure good levels of cybersecurity nationwide.   The Government will also seek to establish and strengthen a range of cybersecurity-related   frameworks which will enhance the cybersecurity of Malawi. For instance, the Government will   seek to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework of Malawi to support the cybersecurity   landscape and create a conducive environment for the effective use of cyberspace by   individuals, the public and private sector.      3.4.3 Specific Objective 3: Strengthen Malawi’s legal and regulatory frameworks to   enhance cybersecurity in Malawi             Actions:     Page | 18      3.4.3.1 Undertake a gap analysis to identify gaps in current ICT Security Legal and Regulatory   Framework and develop requisite instruments to address Gaps including issues relating   to privacy and data protection.    3.4.3.2 Develop and publish a cybersecurity policy and standards consisting of general and   sector-specific cybersecurity controls that would be recognized as a national standard   3.4.3.3 Create a national programme to promote the adaptation and adoption of cyber   standards across government institutions and CII in Malawi   3.4.4 Specific Objective 4: Stakeholder capacity building for law enforcement and   judiciary to implement cybersecurity related laws    Actions:   3.4.4.1 Identify needs and then provide training and education to develop the capacities of the   law enforcement agencies, judiciary and the legal fraternity on how to interpret and   enforce the policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on cybersecurity in Malawi   3.4.5 Specific objective 5: Enhance technical and procedural measures for   implementing cybersecurity for CIIs   3.4.5.1 Establish mandatory and minimum technology and security requirements for CIIs   3.4.5.2 Develop a national government programme to deploy and manage government ICT   infrastructure   3.4.5.3 Develop a national programme to enhance internet infrastructure development and   resilience.   3.4.5.4 Develop National Contingency plans which identify emergency response asset priorities   and standard operating procedures (SOPs)   3.4.5.5 Review and update the map of current emergency response assets   3.4.5.6 Ensure communication channels are deployed across emergency response functions,   geographic areas of responsibility, public and private responders, and command   authority.

Page | 21      III. Strategic Goal (iii): Promote awareness, information sharing and   collaboration on cyber security       A significant proportion of cybersecurity incidents can be prevented by being aware of, and   understanding the threat. It is critical that individuals and organizations in Malawi are aware of   the threat, and are taking the appropriate measures to protect themselves from cyber attacks.   It is paramount that the Government of Malawi and other stakeholders aim to undertake   various awareness building programmes which not only provide information and advice to   individuals and organizations on how to protect themselves but also create a national   cybersecurity culture and mindset.       Recognizing the shared responsibilities of various stakeholders in improving cybersecurity in   Malawi, as well as the borderless nature of cyberspace, it is imperative the Government of   Malawi promotes information sharing and collaboration in the nation’s efforts in addressing   cyber threats and cyber incidents.  The Government of Malawi will seek to establish measures   that promote a culture of information sharing and collaboration across all relevant stakeholders   nationally, regionally or internationally.       3.4.8 Specific Objective 8: Enhance cyber security awareness across the general   public and national institutions   Actions:   3.4.8.1 Undertake a nationwide assessment to determine level of awareness of cybersecurity   across the nation   3.4.8.2 Develop and implement a national roadmap for improving awareness of current cyber   security trends and threats   3.4.8.3 Develop and disseminate National Cybersecurity Best Practices to engrain a   cybersecurity mindset in the public   3.4.8.4 Undertake mandatory training of Board Members of different organizations to enhance   their understanding of cyber issues and how their organizations address these threats.

Considering that ICTs and Cyberspace spur socio-economic growth, the National   Cybersecurity Strategy implementation logical frameworks have identified possible lead   organization and funding sources for various measures proposed in the NCS.       4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation   The implementation of the NCS will require a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that:       supports the attainment of the NCS Vision and Strategic Goals; and       enables accurate reporting on progress and identification of lessons learned and   challenges encountered for informed decision making and effective planning.         Page | 31      This can be used to elaborate new measures as well as amend and tailor existing initiatives   under the strategy.  This section of the Strategy details the proposed systematic approach to   monitoring and evaluating progress as an integral part in implementing the NCS of Malawi. The   monitoring is scheduled to be periodic in order to track the progress of implementation of the   NCS. The monitoring will, therefore, focus on periodic and objective assessment of progress   towards the attainment of the set objectives.       The key objectives of the monitoring and evaluation approach are:       Establishment of Performance Targets for various governmental institutions or relevant   stakeholders responsible for implementing specific actions of the NCS.        Development of performance plans to establish a shared understanding of the expected   end results, the approach to achieving these end results and identify the resources   necessary to ensure a successful implementation. The plans will be based on the KPIs,   Performance Targets and Deadlines provided in the Implementation Logical Framework        Monitoring and reporting performance and progress in achieving expected end results by   identifying and promptly reporting observed or likely deviations.        Periodically evaluating institutional or individual performance against established   performance targets       An independent stakeholder will be commissioned to undertake the mid-term and long-   term review of the strategy to determine the long-term impact and outcomes of the   strategy based on periodic reviews, and if necessary effect remedial actions to keep   implementation on track. The mid-term review will be undertaken at the end of 3rd   Quarter of Year 3 of the Strategy and the long term review at the end of the 4th year.    MACRA and all relevant Stakeholders will develop a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation   Plan which will be based on the proposed approach within 3 months of the adoption of the   Strategy. The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will enable the assessment of the operational   issues encountered during the implementation of the strategy, as well as the assessment of the     Page | 32      long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews. The Monitoring and   Evaluation Plan will also provide mechanisms or tools for data collection and reporting, and   further information on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and frequency of reports.

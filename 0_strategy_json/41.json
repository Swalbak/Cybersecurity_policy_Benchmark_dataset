With regard to digital society, there still persists an ambition to use information and communication technology, i.e. digital solutions as astutely and as much as possible in order to achieve the objectives of ‘Estonia 2035’1. Namely, contributions are made via the following sub-objectives: + The Estonian economy is innovative and knowledge-based, using new technologies and business models as well as flexible forms of work. The contribution of the development plan lies in the creation of favourable conditions for business research and development and innovation. The Estonian economic environment invites people to work here, establish companies or do business virtually, invest, create and test new solutions which benefit the society at large. + The needs of all people are taken into account when shaping the living environment and the foundations of high-quality spaces and principles of inclusive design are consistently followed when making decisions in order to ensure the accessibility and convenience of spiritual, physical and digital space for everyone. The activities of the development plan contribute through the use of innovative technologies and environmentally friendly solutions which reduce the impact of climate change and the time required for covering distances and ensure a good living environment all across Estonia. + Estonia is an innovative country which values the creation and use of knowledge and where social life is organised by means of new human-centric and efficient technologies. The contribution of the development plan is reflected in the fact that the governance set-up promotes social cohesion, the adoption of new solutions, innovation and flexible governance. Public services function in the background and are proactive, and the data space is protected. The organisation of governance and people’s participation in it in Estonia is trendsetting and sets an example to other countries. According to the vision of the Digital Agenda 2030, Estonia should be full of digital power. This encompasses the following: + our way of life is impressive – it is easy to accomplish what we need or want; + we are protected by the power of digitalisation – our digital life is safe and we make bold advances in digital development; + our economy is empowered by digitalisation – digital solutions are the engine of the entire economy; + supported by the power of digitalisation, we value every person and contribute to co-creation; + fertile conditions have been established for the creation of future solutions in Estonia. To implement the vision, more specific goals have been set in this development plan and lines of action have been planned in three areas: + the development of digital government, i.e. the use of digital solutions in the public sector, since no other development plan includes the general development of digital government and the public sector also leads and sets the direction for the development of the Estonian digital society. The main goal is to strive for the best experience when using public services, so that our way of life can be impressive, as has been highlighted in the vision. For this purpose, we plan to take the next leaps in the development of digital government and ensure the sustainability of the established solutions; + the development of electronic communication, i.e. connectivity, because the sufficient availability of connections forms the foundation of the use of digital solutions, be it in everyday life or business. The main goal is the availability of fast and affordable connections throughout Estonia. + the development of national cyber security, since we can boldly move forward on the journey of digital development formulated in the vision if sufficient trust has been guaranteed. This area includes the provision of cyber security in the public sector and more broadly in the economy. The main goal is to keep the Estonian cyberspace reliable and secure. Considering the growing risks and the established basis, it is a rather ambitious target on its own. 5 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 The authority generally responsible for the implementation of the programme and therefore also the development plan is the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC) or in the case of specific activities its subsidiary bodies and/or other state authorities or participants. Vision of Estonia’s digital society 2030 Principles of implementing the vision Organisation of management Digital government sub-objective Connectivity sub-objective The total cost, i.e. the overall funding needs of the development plan make up around 1.2 billion euros over ten years. Expectations in connection with other development plans Cyber security sub-objective The implementation of the vision of digital society also depends on a number of other areas and policies covered by other development plans. Therefore, this development plan also separately formulates expectations for other policy areas because development plans should not overlap, but at the same time it is reasonable to partially address the measures of other areas. The expectations constitute a ‘request’ stemming from the broader vision of digital society, so that we should clearly outline the needs and foundations, on the basis of which we can plan support activities for the implementation of other development plans or direct their alignment with one another. This development plan does not include specific targets or activities for promoting the introduction of ICT in various walks of life and business fields because all development plans of specific fields must encompass such plans. When implementing the vision, it is important to consistently follow the principles highlighted in this development plan with regard to all of the sub- objectives. The implementation and updating of this Agenda and its alignment with other development plans is guaranteed by means of the organisation of management which has a steering group at its centre, headed by the minister responsible for the development of digital society. An advisory committee including state authorities and other partners directs the accomplishment of the sub-objectives of this Agenda. In addition, the Cyber Security Council is active in the field of cyber security as a subgroup of a government committee. When it comes to implementation, various formats are used to organise cooperation, plan activities and carry out monitoring. The development plan is implemented by means of a digital society programme which is prepared for four years and updated along with the budget strategy once a year. The programme includes specific measures, metrics, responsible agents and a budget, etc. which are required as an action plan for achieving the targets and aims of the Agenda in the coming years. Advisory committees of specific fields and, naturally, the steering group of this development plan update the programme and monitor its implementation. A more specific analysis of the current situation and the justification for the selected lines of action are presented in the chapters of the main part of the development plan. However, we present the ‘larger picture’ of the current situation in the development of the Estonian digital society here – the main conclusions of the baseline analysis for the Agenda, including an international comparison, where possible. 6 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 A more specific analysis of the current situation and the justification for the selected lines of action are presented in the chapters of the main part of the development plan. However, we present the ‘larger picture’ of the current situation in the development of the Estonian digital society here – the main conclusions of the baseline analysis for the Agenda, including an international comparison, where possible. The main characteristics and challenges of the Estonian digital society are currently the following: 1) Estonia has achieved a lot with regard to the development of digital government, but a great deal remains to be done: we have to reach a new level and maintain what we have already created. Estonia ranks among the first in many international comparisons (e.g. the DESI 20202 ranking of EU Member States or the eGovernment Benchmark 20203, the United Nations E-Government Survey 2024, etc.). What differentiates us is the fact that we have an actually functioning and widely used digital government. Digital services and solutions are broadly used by back-office officials in public administration as well as private persons and entrepreneurs when dealing with state authorities. The proportion of the users of digital government services is among the largest in the EU (93%) (DESI 2020). Nearly all direct public services have been digitalised one way or another by now, i.e. they are now available via digital channels. The Estonian digital government has been established on a strong foundation, such as our national digital identity and the X-Road which has made the development of digital services in various fields safer, quicker and more affordable. However, there are also concerns: + the ease of use of services does not meet the expectations of users, requirements or best practices – even if digital services are used, the processes are often cumbersome and the value they produce is therefore limited; + the sustainability of services, i.e. their constant renewal and maintenance at the required level has not been guaranteed when it comes to technology, procedures or resources; + the arrival of new larger updates in digital government has not been sufficiently known or has not been as fast and widespread as necessary; + cross-border services are underdeveloped, including at the level of the European Union, and there are still obstacles with regard to data exchange between countries and the establishment of common services. However, it should be taken into consideration that states inevitably compete with one another when it comes to talents, export or investments. The quality of the business environment and services is an increasingly important factor which has been in favour of Estonia this far. If we fail to resolve the concerns of digital government, we will be left behind in the competition – many EU and other countries in the world have taken powerful steps to launch the digital transformation of their public sector in recent years, which has been propelled even further by the COVID-19 pandemic. Current state of the development of digital society 93% The proportion of digital government users (DESI 2020) 7 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 2) Estonia has a developed telecommunications market, but a fast Internet connection is far from being available to everyone and everywhere across the country. The telecommunications market is highly competitive despite its small size. It is particularly noticeable with regard to mobile communications where the prices are among the lowest in Europe and the number of users is large (there are one and a half times more mobile broadband users than on average in the EU according to DESI 2020). Estonia was among the first to deploy 4G. The deployment of 5G has been somewhat delayed due to legal reasons but is starting up. We are close to the average of the EU with regard to the general availability of high-speed Internet: 57% of households have access to very high capacity networks (DESI 2020), even though large investments have been made in the relevant backhaul network and more than 7000 km have been added with the support of the state in the last decade. There is a market failure outside larger urban areas: building a network is extremely expensive and often requires support from the state due to dispersed housing and a small population. Consumers themselves still use the possibilities of high-speed Internet very little. 14% of households have a fixed broadband subscription of at least 100 Mbit/s (DESI 2020). The demand and actual need for higher speeds is likely to increase in the future. 3) Estonia has skilfully ensured cyber security, but the risks are increasing and basic abilities must be considerably improved. Digital services are actively used in the Estonian digital government and society owing to great trust in them and service providers. Among others, the secure structure of the Estonian digital government, the comprehensive approach to cyber security, the awareness of the significance of risk prevention and reduction and their gradual development have contributed to it. However, there are significant gaps in the organisation of cyber security and the basic abilities if we take into account the fact that risks are increasing. Both cybercrime and geopolitical attacks in cyberspace are on the rise – technology is increasingly used to attain political interests. At the same time, we rely on the solutions of external technology creators and providers to a considerable extent. If we cannot foresee and manage risks, we are made vulnerable by the vulnerability of such providers. It is inevitable that we cannot do and check everything ourselves, which is why it is important to be able to choose reliable partners and solutions. Maintaining a high-level basic cyber-security capacity is unavoidable for Estonia, since otherwise we cannot continue to rely on digital solutions to the extent we have done so far. Estonia has a highly developed digital society which, unlike many other countries, is already vitally dependent on digital services and the infrastructure enabling them every day: network and information systems, hardware and software, the devices of ordinary users and other technology. Digital dependence also concerns the providers of vital services, a large part of whom consider their technological dependence critical. Furthermore, various information systems are interconnected, using data from one another. International cooperation is much-needed because incidents spread across state borders and hazards are growing in general in the world. Collective action in the field of cyber security has increased at the EU level, but we have a long journey ahead to secure an equally high level of digital safety across the entire EU. 57% of households have access to very high capacity networks (DESI 2020) 14% with a fixed broadband subscription of at least 100 Mbit/s (DESI 2020) The number of mobile broadband users exceeds the average of the EU by one and a half times (DESI 2020) of households 8 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 4) The Estonian economy has not undergone a larger digital transformation yet, but we have a strong IT sector and community of technology- based start-ups. The Estonian digital society has been marked by controversy for a long time: although we have a highly developed digital government, i.e. digital solutions are widely used in the public sector, the same has not taken place more broadly in the economy. At the EU level, the Estonian private sector ranks average or sometimes even below average in terms of its general digital development and the use of the opportunities of e-commerce (export) (DESI 2020). Nevertheless, there are signs that the situation is about to change. For example, the demand for the support measures of digital transformation has increased and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant advances in e-commerce. Next to the traditional economy with a low level of digitalisation, there is a strong, internationally outstanding and thriving IT sector and community of start-ups in Estonia. The IT sector has been one of the drivers of economic growth in the last ten years and the field of start-ups has overtaken agriculture in terms of volume by now. 5) The greatest obstacle to development is the lack of IT competences and specialists. At the EU level, we are at the forefront when it comes to the digital skills of residents and the proportion of ICT specialists (DESI 2020). Nevertheless, there is a chronic lack of sufficient numbers of IT specialists, hindering digital transformation in the economy, the development of technology companies and the enhancement of digital government or cyber security. The more the entire economy and the world move along the digital road, the greater this shortage will be in the future. In short, we have more ideas and development opportunities than people and IT skills to use these opportunities and turn the ideas into services or products. The basic digital knowledge of residents is sufficient for the Internet to be used widely. At the same time, there has been no significant increase in recent years: it has stabilised at 90% and international surveys (e.g. PIAAC) reveal that higher digital skills are an issue of concern. For instance, it hinders participation in the digital transformation at the workplace or the introduction of newer technologies in various sectors or may cause structural unemployment. The lack or incompatibility of digital skills is one of the largest obstacles for companies when making digital investments (DESI 2020). 6) Technology continues to develop – it opens new opportunities, but also poses risks There is an unbreakable megatrend in the world: the rise of digital technology continues. New solutions and technological opportunities are added more and more quickly and exponentially. On the one hand, it provides Estonia with the opportunity to continue making progress in its digital development, since new technology creates new areas of use or opportunities to recreate something that has been digitalised to make it even better. At the same time, technological innovation is always accompanied by new cyberthreats. It should be noted that digital solutions become increasingly complex and specialised. Seeing, preventing and mitigating related risks thus requires more and more (special) competence. Complex risks caused by the rise of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cryptography, quantum computers, the Internet of things, augmented reality and robotics, etc. can no longer be sufficiently resolved with the help of universal experts. At the EU level, we are at the forefront when it comes to the digital skills of residents and the proportion of ICT specialistss (DESI 2020) There is an unbreakable megatrend in the world: the rise of digital technology continues. 9 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Vision: Estonia, empowered by digitalisation The vision is to have Estonia full of digital “vägi”‘. The closest word to vägi in English is ‘power’. Vägi is an evocative word with a long history as it is among the 300 oldest words in the Estonian language. In Estonian mythology, many things can have “vägi”: trees, songs and words, even rocks. It’s an invisible and somewhat magical power that the item or person possesses. And so it is an appropriate word to describe a digital society: aided by invisible and intangible power that gives us tools to be more. It is somewhat even magical and a power that needs to be carefully mastered. With digital “vägi” or “power” we wish to keep the valuable things we have established but believe that the Estonian digital society can be further improved. Estonia is already known as a strong digital society in the world, but we are capable of so much more. We want Estonia to be full of digital power - competent and more powerful than anyone could otherwise expect for such a small country. Therefore, we can always make the best use of the possibilities of digital technology. 10 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Our way of life powered by digitalisation – it is easy to accomplish what we need or want + Services function exactly according to my needs, and are available when I need them and in the manner I prefer. + Unnecessary procedures are a thing of the past both in the private and public sector, leaving me more time to carry out more valuable work or enjoy a more pleasant everyday life. The complexity of the functioning of the state is invisible for private persons and entrepreneurs. + I can access necessary services with a good connection everywhere and at any time, irrespective of whether I am in Tallinn, a remote village called Obinitsa or travelling around the world. We are protected by the power of digitalisation – our digital life is safe and we make bold advances in digital development + My data are secure, but at the same time data can be easily used to create new smart solutions. + It is safe to use digital space; there is no need to fear misinformation, cyberbullying or cybercrime. I behave in a manner that does not involve digital risks; at the same time, I am unnoticeably provided with protection in the background. + The Estonian state and important services are always protected in cyberspace. It also gives our economy a competitive advantage. Our economy is powerful thanks to digitalisation – digital solutions are the engine of the entire economy + The core companies of all sectors have completed the digital transformation in their operation or offer digital products and services. We have also made the economy environmentally friendly with the help of digital solutions. + Transactions are made, invoices are paid and reports are prepared completely digitally, automatically and in an instant – it saves us time and money. + People and companies from all over the world find it easy to do business in Estonia thanks to convenient procedures. Estonia has more active e-residents than permanent residents. We empower people by valuing every person and their contribution to co- creation + We are a technological nation: always and in all aspects ready to create new solutions and use them everywhere. We acquire new knowledge and skills eagerly and quickly throughout our lives. + Smart solutions make us even more connected and integrated, enable us to close gaps and support everyone in the required manner, where necessary. We contribute to the welfare of the state and the community; we are a society. + Estonian culture is easily accessible via digital channels throughout the world, preserved for the future and actively (re)used. The Estonian language is alive and developing in digital space. Fertile foundation for the creation of future solutions in Estonia + There are excellent conditions for creating and testing innovative solutions in Estonia and taking them to the world – it is like a smart village of the world. People come here from other parts of the world to create solutions for the future; new producers emerge and existing ones continue to operate eagerly. A digitally powerful Estonia is characterised by the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 11 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 We adhere to the following principles when developing our digital society and planning and implementing activities within the framework of this development plan: Principles We protect and promote the fundamental rights of people. We ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in digital society and we maintain indispensable freedoms, starting with Internet freedom. We guarantee that people have the opportunity to manage the use of their personal data and protection of privacy. We preserve the Estonian language and culture. We promote the viability of the Estonian language and culture in digital society and space. It is particularly important that everyday devices and services can be used in familiar Estonian. We maintain our reliability. When launching initiatives and development activities, we immediately consider the related risks, and plan and carry out activities to reduce them – this way, we can make bold advances in the development of digital society. We prevent and resolve concerns in a transparent manner. We prefer to focus on prevention instead of dealing with consequences. We are technology-neutral. In our initiatives and development activities we concentrate on results and choose the best technology to achieve them. If at all possible, we prefer open standards and solutions based on them. We establish common policy instruments (support, legal acts, etc.) which apply to all suitable solutions. We build our digital society together. We join forces as early as possible to make the best decisions and find the most suitable solutions using our collective knowledge, resources and efforts. It may involve cooperation with domestic and foreign technology companies and universities, public sector institutions, various government levels and the third sector or other countries. We reuse good solutions and share our own. We are innovative. When tackling challenges, we always consider whether and what we could do differently. Where possible, we test a new approach because it may yield more later on. We know that solutions are never complete; they can and must be constantly developed and designed to be flexible for this purpose. We are climate and environmentally friendly. We do things digitally, promoting the conservation of the environment, contributing to the mitigation of climate change and helping to adapt to its impacts. 12 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Based on the vision, the goal for the next decade in terms of the development of digital society is to increase Estonia’s digital power: digital government guarantees the best experience, high-speed Internet is available to all those who request it in Estonia and our cyberspace is safe and reliable. We measure the achievement of this objective on the basis of the development of four metrics as follows: General objective and metrics Objective for 2030: (90% + 90% + 100% + 96%)/4 = 94 Initial situation of the develop- ment plan: (69% + 47% + 58% + 96%)/4 = 67,5 avail- ability of high- speed Internet resilience and trustwor- thiness of cyberspace satisfaction of entrepreneurs with public digital services satisfaction of private persons with public digital services /4 = X+++( ) 13 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Target based on the general objective: to ensure the best digital government experience by 2030. This sub-objective is directly related to the implementation of one of the axes of the vision of digital society 2030: creating an impressive way of life in Estonia by means of digital solutions. While the previous aim set for the development of digital government was to primarily increase the efficiency of public administration, the quality and human-centricity of services is the next level of maturity in digital government. This does not mean that things should not or cannot still be done more efficiently – it must be done in addition to and while improving the quality of services. In addition, the implementation of this objective contributes to the progress of other axes of the vision. Public services that provide the best experience and are of high quality help to make the economy more digitally powered because they simplify procedures for all entrepreneurs – among other things, it increases the number of e-residents. In order to ensure the best experience of digital government, steps have to be taken to establish favourable conditions for the creation of future solutions that improve our experience, as has been highlighted in the vision. I sub-objective. Digital government5 metric: Satisfaction with public digital services6 69% 47%90% 90% As of 2019 As of 2019Objective for 2030 Objective for 2030 Among private persons: Among entrepreneurs: This metric measures the satisfaction of private persons and companies with public services which have been used via electronic channels (electronic self- service, websites, e-mails, applications, social media).7 The result is sent as an extract from the catalogue of public services8 and it is measured once a year. The lines of action required for achieving the sub- objective are divided in two because we are tackling two challenges at once: taking digital government to the next stage of development by means of new solutions and keeping the established solutions sustainable and updated. 14 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Promises: the greatest results by 2030 at the latest Line of action In Estonia, public services reach you just when you need them and you can complete all procedures at once. Switch to life and business event based and proactive services All procedures concerning the public sector can be carried out using chatbots in Estonia AI-powered government Another leap has been taken in increasing efficiency in the public sector by means of AI AI-powered government The fundamental rights of people are protected in digital government and people and companies have control over their data and the opportunity to actually share them Human-centric digital government Estonia is the greenest digital government in the world Green digital government 1.

Targeted international cooperation 15 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + We develop an event service for every life event included in the development plan of event services for private persons and constantly update the development plan12. + We support the development of business event services for entrepreneurs, including e-residents (i.e. improving the business environment according to the Estonian Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Plan 2021-2035). + We initiate and carry out a programme for developing proactive services in order to make other services apart from those gathered under event services proactive. 1. Switch to life and business event based and proactive services Next leaps in the development of digital government Activities: Current situation: + For people, services do not seem to be or function as a seamless service, based on their life and business events (e.g. childbirth, marriage, founding a company). Instead, they are fragmented between state, local government and private services. Information concerning public services is available and services are offered in various channels and there is no common approach from the viewpoint of users. It is often difficult to understand where to find information about or how to use a certain service. + Public services are generally provided at the initiative of users and the same data are unnecessarily requested a number of times. At the same time, the state often has all the data required for offering a service, e.g. for the proactive provision of aid. + Although life and business event services10 have been discussed as a goal for a number of years, we are still at the beginning of our journey when it comes to creating them. The situation is similar with proactive services11 where only one proactive service based on offers (provision of family benefits) has been launched in addition to a few automated services (e.g. aid to retired people living alone). Results: + In Estonia, public services reach you when you need them. Where possible, the state notifies people and entrepreneurs if they have the right to receive certain benefits or must fulfil an obligation. Proactive services are provided automatically or with the consent of a person, giving them the opportunity to withdraw from using the service or select the manner in which it is used. + Public services are provided to people and entrepreneurs as a single seamless service based on their life or business events; the complexity of the functioning of the state (e.g. cooperation between various authorities and levels) is invisible to the recipients of services. + When using public services, users are asked the same data only once, except if repeated data requests are reasonably justified. 16 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 2. AI-powered government13 + We implement the concept of Bürokratt to make public services available via virtual assistants. Activities: + We implement and constantly update the national artificial intelligence strategy, i.e. our action plan in order to expand the use of AI applications (including robots) in the public sector and increase the relevant capability. Among other things, we engage in active cross- border and EU-level cooperation to share and reuse experiences and AI solutions. + We develop the legal space to enable a more widespread and reliable use of AI applications (including guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights). We also advocate this in AI-related policy and law-making at the European Union and international level. Current situation: + Artificial intelligence has been adopted in the public sector on the basis of Estonia’s national artificial intelligence strategy14 and the first results have been achieved. As of the end of 2020, approximately 80 AI projects have been implemented or are ongoing. Nevertheless, competences related to artificial intelligence and data science are lacking, the level of implementation of Estonian language technology is still low and there are legal obstacles to the use of data (for example in connection with interpreting data protection requirements). Algorithmic trustworthiness has not been systematically guaranteed in the implementation of AI yet. + The possibilities to use AI are much wider than those that have been implemented so far – it requires changes in work processes and information systems. AI is a great opportunity for Estonia to take user experience and the functioning of the state to a new level of development, as has been reflected in the first experiences. + Public services, the environments where they are provided and the websites of institutions have been designed and developed based on a different kind of logic and style. Therefore, users find it confusing and difficult to navigate between various portals and environments. People expect simplicity and support from the state, but it is still too difficult to find information on where to turn to if you need to contact the state. Digital communication with the state requires a good level of digital literacy but it should not be like this. At the same time, the technology of virtual assistants and other AI applications to tackle problems like this is developing rapidly in the world. Results: + Estonia is a leading user of AI solutions in the provision of public services in the world: our digital government is AI-powered. Another leap has been taken in increasing efficiency in the public sector by means of AI and other modern routine automation technologies, and the AI applications deployed are trustworthy15. + All procedures concerning the public sector can be carried out using virtual assistants in Estonia. The major digital services of all administrative fields meant for people or entrepreneurs have been linked to the national ecosystem of virtual assistants called Bürokratt16. As such, users can access all public without special knowledge, using any common form of communication, channel or device. 17 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 3. Human-centric digital government17 Current situation: + Users usually have a high degree of confidence in the Estonian digital government but it is not guaranteed. The awareness of people and the general public of the functioning of digital solutions (including data processing) and the transparency of solutions has been low, which may reduce trust in the future and create a digital divide (a growth in the proportion of non-users and sceptics). + It is especially important to ensure transparency and reliability when implementing new technology with great potential which may have an adverse impact on the fundamental rights of people (e.g. AI, data analytics, etc.). Trust in digital government is dependent on whether fundamental rights are guaranteed but not enough attention has been paid to ensuring and promoting such rights when introducing digital solutions. + Estonia has stood out with the fact that people get an overview of who uses the data included in some important databases and how such data are used (e.g. health information in the Patient Portal). A Personal Data Usage Monitor has been created but is still in its early stages. The state does not provide a complete overview of when and how the data of private persons or companies are used. Users thus have an incomplete overview of who uses their data and when and how they are used. + Private persons have the opportunity of requesting access to and obtaining their data in order to provide access to other parties. However, it is not possible to give your consent to other parties, so that they can request data automatically. In addition, no profit can be made when allowing the use of your data, which could encourage the private sector to create new solutions. Therefore, it is difficult for the private sector to use the data of private persons and the collection of their data is duplicated, which slows down the development of the digital economy. + There is no functioning solution for managing and withdrawing given consents. Therefore, it is rather difficult or even impossible for private persons and entrepreneurs to find out whether and how their data are used for the purposes of decision-making (including decisions concerning them) or service provision. Results: + The society’s trust in the use of digital solutions in the provision of public services is maintained and grows. It is based on people’s increased awareness of the connections between technology and fundamental rights, the reliability of technology and their role in service design as well as the transparency of the creation and use of digital solutions. + When developing and implementing digital solutions in the public sector, the fundamental rights of people, democracy and the rule of law are protected and the opportunities provided by technology are used to promote them. + When developing and offering public services, it is guaranteed that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in digital society and use digital services. + Private persons and entrepreneurs are in control of their data and can actually share them in Estonia. They have an overview of the data collected by the state in connection with all services and the purposes of the use of their data. + Private persons and entrepreneurs can use digital solutions to decide who can use the data shared by them and determine the purposes and conditions of use (for a fee if they wish). 18 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + We develop the Estonian legal space to ensure the human-centricity of digital government and the reliability of digital solutions and promote the fast-paced introduction of new technologies for the benefit of the society. + We raise the awareness of people and the general public of human-centric digital government and the reliability of technology. + We increase the ability of the owners and creators of digital services to develop and offer human-centric and reliable digital solutions. + We develop and implement relevant risk management measures to ensure the reliability and human-centricity of digital solutions, and manage the impacts on fundamental rights. Activities: + We introduce the opportunity to obtain a complete overview of all of your data held by the state in the state portal. + We introduce a consent service19 all across the state and expand it to include the data of entrepreneurs. + We adopt a Personal Data Usage Monitor18 all across the state and expand it to include the data of entrepreneurs. + We shape EU and other international activities, promoting the cross-border and global exchange of (personal) data between countries in a manner that provides people with more control over their data (e.g. within the framework of international treaties), and activities which help us advance and ensure the global development and use of human-centric and reliable technology. 19 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 4. Green digital government + We analyse the environmental impact of the Estonian digital government and ways to reduce it. + We initiate and implement the climate and environmental friendliness and green IT20 action plan. Activities: Current situation: + No attention has been paid to the environmental compatibility of solutions and climate change when developing digital government in Estonia. The environmental footprint of the use of digital solutions is constantly increasing in Estonia and elsewhere in the world. The ICT sector together with data centres makes up an estimated 2% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which is comparable to the proportion of the aviation sector. If this tendency persists, the proportion of the ICT sector in GHG emissions may rise above 14% by 2040. The awareness of customers, users and developers of technology and their attempts to act in a more environmentally sound manner are lacking. + The exchange of information on paper has decreased and environmental monitoring has become more efficient thanks to digital solutions, but the environmental impact of the Estonian digital government (water, energy and resource consumption more widely, GHG emissions, impact on nature and waste generation) and ways of reducing it have not been analysed. + A green way of thinking is increasingly popular in the world (including the technology sector) and provides Estonia with the opportunity to become a pioneer as a green, environmentally friendly country with digital government. In terms of user experience, it is also more and more important whether services are provided in an environmentally sound manner. Results: + Estonia has the greenest digital government in the world and sets an example to others. + This does not imply the greenwashing of current solutions, but rather the development and management of digital government are based on climate and environmental friendliness. Where possible, the option that is more climate and environmentally friendly is chosen when introducing a new solution and the environmental footprint of digital government is reduced. 20 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Directions which enable us to take a leap in development and ensure the sustainability of digital government 1. Introduction of the management and user-centricity of public services Current situation: + The fragmentation of the provision of public services and unnecessary bureaucracy show that public services either have not been designed or provided in a user- centric manner or the quality of the services of various institutions is uneven in relation to this. There is no common standard for services, focusing on users. The requirements concerning the design, development, management and measurement of services are fragmented or inadequate. + It is more difficult to access and use services if a person lacks skills, has special needs, comes from a foreign country or has a different cultural background;; there is also a greater risk that they miss important services. + Public services often do not have an owner or if an owner has been assigned, it is a mere formality and the services lack substantial management. Furthermore, most ministries have a coordinator of such services but service development is not systematically managed at the level of the area of government. + The quality of public services is measured by means of various methodologies and solutions which do not allow for comparisons. The quality of services is often measured manually or left unmeasured, since it is regarded as an additional obligation and expense, rather than something of value. A catalogue of public services has been created to measure and compare services but it has limited functionality and finds little use. Therefore, data are mostly updated in the catalogue only once a year during a special campaign. In addition, it does not include all services and institutions. + Due to all these reasons, there is no clear understanding of the quality of services within public sector institutions or all across the country. Decisions concerning the development of services are based more on subjective perceptions than actual (monitoring) data. 21 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Activities: Results: + All public services are human-centric – designed and provided on the basis of users and their needs and preferences, while guaranteeing their fundamental rights. The needs of people with poorer digital skills or special needs as well as foreigners residing in Estonia and e-residents are taken into account. + The practices of service design, development and management are at a high level across the public sector. All public services are measured and monitored in a comparable way throughout the country. Decisions concerning service development are made on the basis of (monitoring) data. + Every public service has a substantive owner who is responsible for the day-to-day development and quality of the service, including measuring and monitoring it. In addition, the services are centrally developed and the portfolio is managed in every ministry. + The central catalogue of public services is easy to use and data are forwarded automatically. Data of higher quality have enabled comparison of services and their quality across the country. Furthermore, abundant tools are available to the owners of services. + We develop and introduce a common standard for user- centric services which includes the design, development, management and measurement of services. + We create and provide service owners with service management tools; among others, we make the state-wide central catalogue of services easy to use. + We promote the removal of obstacles in the development of cross-border services on the EU internal market. We invest in the cross-border availability of Estonian digital services and participate in relevant joint initiatives, especially in the framework of Nordic cooperation and within the EU. + We introduce the practice of measuring services and a common methodology in public sector institutions. + We further develop the role, knowledge and skills of service owners and coordinators and service management in public sector institutions. + We invest in improving the user-centricity and accessibility of services, including the development of digital services for e-residents as a special focus. 22 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 2. Data-driven governance and reuse of data Current situation: + The possibilities of data analysis are far from being sufficiently used for decision-making in governance. Uneven data literacy among managers and specialists is one of the reasons behind it, i.e. the inability to see data as the source of answers. Another reason is the fact that even though a large amount of data has been collected in digital government over the years, their findability and quality are points of concern. + The overview of data collected by state authorities and local governments is insufficient. It is available in databases but even there the descriptions of data are uneven and the timeliness or meaning of data is frequently difficult to identify. The tools meant for managing data descriptions are not sufficiently implemented. This makes the reuse of data more difficult and is the reason why the ‘once-only’ principle has not been consistently implemented. The opportunities related to ‘linked data’ which would enable us to make advances in the development of service design and provision have not been used. + The quality and degree of development of data management, including responsibility, organisation and competences, are highly uneven among institutions. The content and quality of too little data can be determined. There are many procedural systems but the data are based on statements almost everywhere and it may happen that they are not trusted by other data users and are therefore insufficiently reused. The data life cycle has not been implemented; therefore, destruction deadlines are not observed systematically and inspected unnecessary data are not destroyed. + Legal and information security restrictions are applied to the cross-usage and reuse of data, particularly in connection with personal data. Technology itself should be implemented more to reuse these and other sensitive data to a greater extent but securely and privately: so-called privacy technology21 solutions should be developed, tested and adopted. First steps have been taken in Estonia for this purpose, albeit slowly. + Many public sector institutions still exchange (digital) documents instead of machine-readable data and the primary focus is on structured data. This hinders the introduction of machine learning and modern data analytics. + There is an insufficient overview of the raw data of state decisions and analyses and of calculations, decreasing the transparency of the state. Changing this would help restrict the spread of misinformation. Results: + We make all the decisions of the state using high- quality data. The findability, quality and speed of use of data provide decision-makers with analytical support and make processes more efficient. + There is an updated and complete overview of data at the level of databases and datasets. Data can be linked to one another. The ‘once-only’ and data reuse principles22 are applied. + The reuse of personal and sensitive data in service provision and decision-making increases significantly with the implementation of privacy technologies. + The public sector uses data in a transparent manner. The basic data of public sector decisions and analyses, and calculations are published as much as possible. 23 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Activities: + We develop the legal space for the purposes of data science and analytics, including relevant instructions. + We develop the competence of data science and analytics and their use in the public sector. + We develop the competence and organisation of data governance and introduce best practices in all public sector institutions. We create and offer necessary tools, including for the adoption of linked data. + We develop an interinstitutional data governance and data science competence centre to gather and make available relevant know-how and offer support to institutions. + We develop further and expand the use of the administrative system of the technical services and databases of the state information system, which ensures an updated overview of data and the state information system. + We support and, where necessary, initiate EU and international activities promoting cross-border and global data sharing and reuse among states and sectors. + We develop and introduce a system of guaranteeing the transparency of the source data of state decisions and analyses, and of calculations. + We initiate and carry out a national privacy technology implementation programme. 24 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 3. Future-proof digital government platforms 68% of Estonian residents would prefer it if all digital services were accessible in a single central state portal. Current situation: + One of the foundations and success factors of the Estonian digital government has been development based on strong platforms, i.e. central infrastructure components and services. This has sped up the development and introduction of digital services throughout the country and society. Existing platforms must constantly be adapted to the development of technology and the needs of users, and developed further. + Digital identity is a good example here. Identity cards and Mobile-ID have withstood the test of time so far and are the safest eID carriers but users prefer simpler solutions. Their usability is also influenced by the development of user interfaces and devices, which makes it more difficult to rely on a separately issued physical medium or request special devices for users. Technology provides access to potential new options for authentication and signing, for instance by means of biometrics. eID is an important enabler of international business and cross-border services but its implementation at the EU level is still in early stages. The basic software of eID must be compatible with primary software and hardware platforms for our digital services to function but these solutions are constantly updated. + The X-Road23 is a long-term mandatory data exchange layer of digital government. Making the X-Road compatible with the world of cloud computing and big data or establishing it as a cornerstone of AI-powered services is a challenge to be tackled when future-proofing the X-Road. At the same time, the X-Road is used more and more widely across the world. Estonia has joined forces and combined its resources with Finland to develop this core technology, establishing a relevant consortium called NIIS24. This makes it easier to find solutions. + 68% of Estonian residents would prefer it if all digital services were accessible in a single central state portal. However, the development of the state portal has been project-based and several attempts of relaunching it have been left unfinished. In a world based on search engines or Bürokratt, the state portal still has a place as a single back-up platform for the information and services of the state. In addition, the state portal does not meet the needs of entrepreneurs at the moment, so they do not have a single service channel. When looking towards the future, eesti.ee has been determined as a reference point for Estonia in developing the single European digital gateway, which creates a basic cross-border interoperability of digital services at the EU level. 25 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Activities: + Based on eesti.ee, an initial version of a state digital mailbox has been created but it currently functions as a voluntary address for forwarding e-mails. Solutions for a central delivery service are being developed. + In order to make digital government function better and more (cost-)efficiently, other common needs can be met by means of platform solutions or services but the creation and development of platforms has not been consciously managed. Platform services have not been provided at an evenly high and sustainable level. Results: + The basic platforms of the Estonian digital government are future-proof: they are sustainable and change flexibly according to the changing needs of users and technological possibilities. + The Estonian national digital identity does not have a physical medium and it can be used in all common devices and environments, including all over Europe. + The X-Road is still better for domestic and international data exchange than its alternatives when it comes to quality and compatibility. + Eesti.ee is an updated service and information gateway for private persons and entrepreneurs, and also a single contact point in cross-border operations. + All notices and documents that need to be forwarded are delivered by default via the state mailbox and are always accessible to people. + The common needs of state authorities and sectors have been met by means of platforms and the management of platform services is at a high level. + We develop the eesti.ee state portal further, including as a joint service channel for entrepreneurs and a single point of contact for the EU digital gateway. + We continue to develop the core software of the X-Road and promote its domestic use. + We support the joint development and reuse of digital government platforms in the EU and Nordic countries, especially for promoting cross-border data exchange. We ensure the compatibility of the Estonian digital government with the European interoperability framework and contribute to the further development of this framework. + We implement and update the action plan concerning digital identity. Based on this, we continue to develop the national digital identity, its carriers, basic software and applications in order to move towards a convenient and secure manner of identification without using tools. + We prepare, implement and constantly update a development plan for new platform services. We improve the quality of the management of platform services. + We develop a state mailbox and legalise it as the main channel for delivering notices and documents from the state instead of letters on paper. + We contribute to the legal space of digital identity and digital signatures in the EU, and the further development of interoperability and common solutions to increase cross-border usability. 26 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 4. Centrally provided basic IT services Current situation: + The provision of a number of standardised IT services, such as computer workstations and server hosting services, has been organised separately in each area of government. The competences in the provision of these services and their quality are uneven and it is difficult to combine services, which hampers cooperation between authorities and the reorganisation of tasks in the course of state reform. The level, volume and capacity of outsourcing services to the private sector is uneven. + Standard IT services are too costly for the state in their current dispersed state. At the same time, the technological and financial sustainability of digital government is a more general point of concern, encouraging us to look for opportunities to increase efficiency. Servers, data centers, licenses and qualified staff are required for every new digital government service. + A large part of the core infrastructure of digital government is not state-of-the art; for example, modern cloud solutions and opportunities to link to the common infrastructure of the EU are underused. Cloud competency is poor in the public sector. Furthermore, the implementation of modern cloud services in information systems or the readiness to do that is lacking. The quality of public services is therefore also reduced (e.g. availability and accessibility at peak times). + A data embassy25 pilot project has been implemented in digital government, ensuring the secure storage of data which are vital for the functioning of the state outside its territory. The functionality of the data embassy has been minimal so far and it does not function as an extension of quickly switchable public server infrastructure yet. + Access rights, roles and identity management are unevenly dispersed across administrative fields in digital government and are not compatible, hindering the use of services beyond single administrative fields. This also causes security risks because there is no overview of who has access to various systems and whether access rights change upon changes in the role of a person. + Although the provision of public communications services has been consolidated, it has been undermanaged and the quality of services has not met the expectations of users. The future directions for the development of public communications (the concept) have been determined and await implementation. 27 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Activities: Results: + Standardised IT services are centrally provided. As a result, the quality of services related to computer workstations and server hosting, including the user experience of public sector employees, has improved (making joint work easier). In addition, the provision of these services is more (cost-)efficient and the introduction of modern technologies is quicker. Standard services are outsourced to the private sector to a greater extent. + Digital government is in the cloud: every new development is designed to be cloud-native and all older digital services have been transferred to cloud infrastructure, unless contradicting information security. + The data embassy functions as a complete service and can be used as a technical extension of critical digital services in the case of major interruptions. + Digital government infrastructure is compatible with EU and other international cross-border initiatives, e.g. the infrastructure for cloud and blockchain services. + Rights and roles have been determined in a uniform manner in digital government. Changes of user roles in decentralised systems are made uniformly and according to similar principles across the country. + Public communications services are guaranteed to users at a sufficient level (including availability, integrity, confidentiality, coverage, data speed and volume). + We consolidate the provision of computer workstation and server hosting services, so that it is organised by a single competency centre across the public sector in order to ensure the best possible quality and cost-efficiency of the base layer of digital government services. In relation to that we introduce integrated administration of central roles and rights management. + We launch a digital government marketplace26 in order to outsource standard services and software solutions to the private sector uniformly, more broadly and quickly. + We adopt cloud solutions in the public sector as a whole, also combining public and private solutions according to needs and opportunities. + We cooperate at the EU level and invest in the interoperability of our digital government infrastructure with the common EU infrastructure. + We implement and update the data embassy action plan. + We implement the concept of developing public communications: we build capacity with regard to managing public communications and improve the quality of services. 28 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 5. Systematic experimentation with new ways Activities: Current situation: + Even though Estonia is esteemed as a digital country in the world, our attention and resources are largely directed to the management and development of existing digital services. As a result, the proportion of new approaches, technologies and experiments, i.e. disruptive innovation27 in digital government has decreased. + There is no systematic development of new skills or mapping of technological development in the public sector. At the same time, the private and academic sectors offer knowledge and solutions which could be more broadly deployed in the development of digital government, including in the rapidly growing Estonian start-up community. Results: + New technology and approaches are eagerly adopted in the Estonian digital government: Estonia is a pioneer in the world when it comes to implementing new solutions. We address and resolve major social and economic concerns in an entirely innovative way. + Estonia is one of the first countries to test the possible use and value of emerging technologies28 in the ecosystem of digital government and the development of digital services. + The public sector collaborates to a greater extent and more systematically with the academic and private sector to create new knowledge and competences. The Estonian technology community is more competent in developing digital government owing to this. + We initiate and fund pilot projects, promote relevant innovation-related cooperation with the private sector and participate in international initiatives where possible. Among others, we launch mission-based29 initiatives for the adoption of entirely innovative solutions. + We increase and coordinate the commissioning of digital government- related research and development activities across the country and disseminate and put to use their results. Among others, we carry out systematic monitoring of the development and adoption of technology. + We initiate and implement programmes for the adoption of new technologies that have a significant impact, and participate in joint initiatives at the EU level. 29 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 6. Open innovation30 and development of govtech community development of govtech community Current situation: + The technical components and developments of digital government are largely non-transparent between administrative fields and for the private sector. Too little is known of what already exists or is being developed in the public or private sector, what is duplicated or what lacks the necessary synergy. + The current manner of developing digital government and the organisation of service management in the public sector restrict the private sector’s opportunities of providing components and services which the state could outsource instead of developing and managing them. The private sector community using digital government developments is small, which hampers competition and the spread of competence. + Separate working environments which are incompatible or do not meet the state’s expectations are used within the public sector and when partnering with the private sector. Expectations and requirements regarding developments are fragmented and insufficiently communicated, rendering cooperation and developments inefficient. + The services and components developed for digital government find little reuse. The solutions that have been created for digital government so far, particularly business services and related information systems, are exportable to a very limited extent. + The amount of open data has been rapidly increasing in recent years, but making them available has not become a widespread everyday practice, nor do they find much reuse. Results: + The quality of Estonian digital services has been taken to a new level in cooperation with the private sector: the private sector makes a major contribution to digital government innovation with joint developments, sectoral links and complete solutions. + The govtech community is active and growing. Participants use tools that ensure the required information security and allow for flexible cooperation at the same time. + There is a transparent, exhaustive and updated overview of digital government services and technical components, relevant requirements and frameworks. 30 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + We expand the govtech community, in other words the information field and the circle of foreign experts involved in development, relevant joint activities and information exchange. + We introduce modern architectural principles and patterns which enhance reuse and support scaling in the architecture of digital government. Among others, we adopt the approach of event-driven microservices and domain-driven design31 as well as the API-first principle32. + We promote cooperation and forms of cooperation with the private sector (including start-ups and foreign companies), and outsource more solutions as full services. + We establish a single information space for publishing the principles of the development of digital government services and technology, including a development and interoperability framework that provides guidelines. We keep the information space and frameworks updated. + We adopt and continue to develop tools and platforms for reuse and cooperation, including a technical services and database management system (the current RIHA), a code repository33 and artifactory34, collaborative applications, etc. + We implement and constantly update the action plan for the reuse of data with the aim of supporting the improved accessibility and reuse of data, including the use of confidential data for scientific purposes, the availability of open data and consent-based data processing. Activities: + Separate software developed for digital government which is funded using taxpayers’ money and includes intellectual property of the public sector is published with an open source license – as long as it is not significant with regard to national security. + The development of digital government relies on an architectural principles that allow for reuse. Solutions created for the Estonian state based on this can be adapted more easily both with regard to business and technology (including by means of cloud technology), increasing the export of digital government solutions. + All machine-readable open data are available and reused as actively as possible. 31 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 7. Empowering digital change in public sector The continued development of technology keeps creating new opportunities Current situation: + Paper-based service provision has been replaced with digital services in Estonia but we can put digital solutions to even better use to improve public services and provide them more efficiently. Large-scale digital changes still have to be made in a number of fields: using digital possibilities, we can reform the logic behind the functioning of public administration and services. + We lack the knowledge and skills required for the initiation and successful completion of more substantial digital changes. The competences of public sector employees which are required for digital management and development have not been systematically increased or taken into account in recruitment decisions. + Another problematic issue is the uneven level of the adoption of digital services and solutions among local governments. There is a shortage of funds and people, making it impossible to do it at an equally good level separately in every city and municipality. The establishment of a single centre of competence on the basis of the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities has been launched to create and implement a common digital strategy of local governments but the capacity and tasks of this entity are still limited. + The continued development of technology keeps creating new opportunities of taking current information systems and services to a new level. In addition, new business needs keep emerging due to policies and the evolution of the state, e.g. in connection with overcoming cross-sectoral barriers to development. Therefore, it pays off to continuously develop and invest in digital government services and solutions + Keeping existing information systems and IT infrastructure up to date presents another challenge, and consistent attention and investments are required to update and maintain them. + In order to maintain the sustainability of the established digital government and introduce new solutions in the best way possible, it is practical to join forces across the state and share experiences and solutions with one another. Common guidelines and requirements must also be in place to ensure interoperability, avoid duplication and make sure that the solutions being created have the best possible technological basis. There have been renewed attempts to strengthen the management of the state information system and its architecture in recent years but only the first steps have been taken. 32 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + We carry out a reform for the sustainable funding of digital government. + We support the development of a centre of IT competence for local governments and the implementation of the IT strategy at the level of local governments through it. + We support the implementation of digital changes in public sector institutions with consultation and funding. The focus is on programmes of large-scale digital changes in various fields, state- wide joint developments and the updating or redevelopment of legacy systems that reduce the quality of digital government. + We promote the knowledge and skills required for the development of digital government in the public sector at the level of managers and specialists as well as basic knowledge and special skills. + We manage the development of digital government architecture and organise cooperation within the community. + Among others, we establish and continue to update a single information space for the principles of the development of digital government services and technology, which includes a development and interoperability frameworks that provide guidelines. Activities: Results: + Digital government is maintained sustainably: important information systems are up to date and continue to be developed; relevant consistent funding is guaranteed. At the same time, a new wave of digital transformation has taken place in various fields (new large-scale changes have been launched and carried out). Among other things, the quality and sustainability of the digital services of local governments has improved. + We have the competences, support and funds required for bold and needed digital changes and the development and maintenance of services. The focus has shifted to the creation of value and especially to user-centricity and user experience, including cross- sectoral cooperation for this purpose. However, efforts are also still made to increase efficiency. + The directions of the development of digital government are known throughout the public sector and work is carried out to follow them in a uniform manner across the country. The functioning of digital government is based on common principles, and interoperable and compatible solutions (technologies). 33 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 8. Targeted international cooperation + Where necessary and possible, we support the Estonian IT sector with the export of digital government solutions, and state authorities in the field of business diplomacy by sharing content knowledge to other countries and providing state experts. + We participate in the forms of cooperation of OECD and Digital Nations for the purpose of knowledge exchange and launch joint initiatives with the countries at the forefront of the development of digital government. Activities: + We participate in the forms of cooperation, policy-making and law-making of the EU and Nordic countries according to the development needs of digital government. The focus is on promoting cross-border interoperability and ensuring the compatibility of common solutions and the architecture of digital government. Current situation: + Estonia is expected and wanted in all international cooperation formats in the field of digital technology and an esteemed contributor to international policy- making. Due to limited resources we have to choose where, on which topic, to which extent and how actively we participate, both in the European Union and elsewhere in the world. + People and companies operate internationally but still have to endure paper-based procedures – in the EU and among the Nordic countries as well as at a bilateral level, cross-border exchange of data and services have remained limited to pilot projects and individual initiatives. First and foremost, cross-border interoperability, including common approaches and supporting platforms, should be developed for this purpose. + Estonia has learned from the successful and unsuccessful digitalisation experiences of other countries. It has allowed us to take over good ideas and solutions and improve policy-making but it also needs purposeful activities in conditions where resources are limited. + The entire world is highly interested in the experiences and solutions of the Estonian digital government, opening up opportunities of exporting knowledge and solutions for Estonian experts and entrepreneurs. It is often useful or necessary that the state contributes in the early stages of the sales process by introducing its achievements and the actors in the sector. Results: + The trends and volumes of external cooperation are in accordance with the objectives and needs of the development of digital government. + Estonian digital solutions are interoperable with European trends. Estonian residents and entrepreneurs can carry out the main procedures digitally and at once when travelling or doing business in the European Union, including the Nordic countries and the Baltic region – there are more and more cross-border services. + Best global practices and new trends are always taken into account in digital government-related policy- making. + The export of Estonian digital government solutions and consultation services grows with the help of ‘opening doors’. 34 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Target based on the general objective: By 2030, ultrafast, reliable and affordable telecommunications connections are available in Estonia irrespective of your location, making it possible to create and use innovative services. This sub-objective is directly related to the implementation of one of the axes of the vision of digital society: creating an impressive way of life. As has been stated above, the vision sets out that services should be convenient and available all over Estonia, which is why relevant (telecommunications) connections are needed. The digital power of the economy, in turn, depends on the development of connectivity. The better the connections, the more digital solutions, products and services can serve as vehicles for development in various sectors and across Estonia. The quality and availability of connections also determines whether conditions are favourable for the creation of future solutions in Estonia and whether people from other countries come here with the same aspirations. II sub-objective. Connectivity metric: The proportion of Estonian households and companies who are able to access an Internet connection of at least 100 Mbit/s which can be increased up to 1 Gbit/s. 58% 100% Current situation (2021) Objective for 2030 The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority measures the results once a year. 35 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 1. Up-to-date and forward-looking legal space Trends in connectivity + We carry out consistent and efficient supervision of the functioning of the market + We make the frequency resources, which have been agreed on internationally and are freed up domestically, available to market participants as quickly as possible on the basis of competitions + We shape and represent the positions of Estonia in the discussions held in the European Union and the International Telecommunications Union + We promote innovative investment and cooperation models for developing communication infrastructure Activities: Current situation: + The single market communication regulation at the EU level sets a clear framework for the competition- based functioning of the Estonian communications market. Regulation must be consistent and legally certain: this turns Estonia into an attractive investment environment which, in turn, promotes the more rapid and efficient construction of communication infrastructure with a very high capacity35. The prices of mobile communications services are affordable. There are three major cable network operators and three mobile telephone operators and a number of smaller regional telecommunications companies on the Estonian communications market. A highly competitive retail services market proves that newcomers can easily enter the communication services market. + On the European and global scale, the Estonian communications market is small in terms of the number of consumers, which may lead to unexpected reorganisation or consolidation and in the end decrease efficient competition if unfavourable economic and regulatory circumstances coincide. + The experience of collectively developing a base network of high-speed Internet has provided favourable presumptions for the use of similar models in the future. + As a limited natural resource, the 3400-3800 MHz, 694-790 MHz and 24.25-27.5 GHz frequency bands (the so-called 5G frequencies) can be adopted in mobile communications as a next step. The possible use of the 40.5-43.5 GHz and 66-71 GHz frequency bands can be specified. Results: + The interests of the state and market participants have been taken into account when shaping the legal space, so that the regulatory environment stays as stable as possible and the market develops in a balanced manner. Among others, cooperation in building core infrastructure is promoted, also in market failure areas. + Frequency resources required for the rapid development of the mobile network and the creation of new services have been allocated to the market quickly and efficiently. + The decisions adopted by the European Union and the International Telecommunications Union are in accordance with Estonia’s interests. 36 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 2. Development of access networks + We support the development of very high capacity access networks in rural areas where telecommunications companies do not invest under the conditions of competition. Activities: Current situation: + In addition to networks established by telecommunications operators, a broadband backhaul network of 7000 km has been created with state support, evenly covering the entire country. It is available to all telecommunications companies and state authorities on an equal basis and at affordable prices in order to improve the availability of communication services and the affordability of joining networks in rural areas. + All three mobile networks offer adequate average and maximum speeds across Estonia which are sufficient for using modern services. The upload and download speeds of mobile Internet have increased by 70% on average within the last two years in Estonia. + Estonia is currently below the average of the EU with regard to the availability of fixed broadband subscriptions in rural areas and the adoption of ultra-fast broadband. The importance of a modern communications network has increased and will continue to increase in connection with remote working and learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. + As of 2021, there are an estimated 120,000 households and companies without a fast fixed connection in rural areas. More than 45,000 of them will get a fibre-optic access network by the end of 2023 which is in line with the 2025 Gigabit Society targets of the EU. Nevertheless, at least 75,000 addresses remain in market failure areas, i.e. the ‘white area’, which require investments made by the state in cooperation with telecommunications companies. Results: + Opportunities to join access networks have been established for all companies and authorities as well as households that are inhabited throughout the year in rural areas. + Households, companies and authorities that have joined an access network can use and ultra-fast (at least 100 Mbit/s) broadband connection which can be increased up to 1 Gbit/s. 37 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 3. Development of 5G and 6G core infrastructure + We support the coverage of selected residential and business areas with 5G. + We make the necessary preparations for the adoption of 6G when the relevant technology arrives on the market. We support reaching an agreement on the legal framework and support measures of the adoption of 6G at the EU level as soon as possible. + We support the establishment of core infrastructure in the main transport corridors in Estonia, allowing for uninterrupted 5G coverage. Activities of the development plan: Current situation: + The existing core infrastructure including broadband backhaul networks and the towers connected to them provides a good basis for necessary investments in additional infrastructure and services in order to take a new leap in the development of mobile communications. + The widespread adoption of smart networks requires considerable investments from telecommunications companies, not only in connection with specific 5G/6G infrastructure, but also additions to the backhaul network and base stations. In order to make use of the potential of technology, it is important that services are not merely made available as pilot projects, but are also widely accessible in areas where business investments do not promise quick profits. + Balanced regional development and the availability of modern services may be hampered if there is no very high capacity broadband infrastructure and 5G coverage outside larger cities. At the same time, investing in new core infrastructure outside larger cities is not financially beneficial for telecommunications companies in the short term. ‘White areas’ can still be found along the primary movement corridors of people, i.e. the main and secondary roads. + At the moment there is no specific timeframe concerning the arrival of the next generation of mobile communications, i.e. 6G, but it can be assumed that it will begin at least before 2030. Results: + The entire Estonia is covered by 5G. 5G core infrastructure has been built by the state in cooperation with telecommunications companies in market failure areas, allowing for the adoption of new technologies. + When 6G arrives on the market, Estonia is ready to adopt these networks. 38 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 4. Development of new content and business services newest technologies are meant for the provision of services at a new level + We support the planning, analysis and development of services that attract widespread public interest. + We participate in the work of international organisations with the purpose of protecting Internet freedom. + We support the activities of the development networks of innovative services. Activities of the development plan: Current situation: + While 4G and early 5G services focused on consumer applications, newest technologies are meant for the provision of services at a new level (including communications and business services). The advances in the adoption of 5G and 6G are no longer viewed in terms of adding and counting connections. Instead, the success of their adoption is determined by the number and spread of content and business services (i.e. cases of use). + Solutions concerning the environment, energy, the industry of smart regions, connected mobility, communications security, social services and healthcare as well as free broadcasting may be of interest to Estonia. In other words, Estonia may gain economic and social advantages by developing use cases in these areas. + Estonia has the opportunity to be a pioneer by innovating content and business services based on new broadband technologies. Estonia would be able to take advantage of global 5G trends and support structural changes primarily in the areas of use of 5G business services. + The protection and upholding of the principles of Internet freedom continues to be important in Estonia in order to ensure the availability of modern content and business services. Results: + Content and business services with significant public influence are in daily use, resolving important social and economic problems. + The level of Internet freedom remains high in Estonia. 39 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 The cyber security sub-objective makes a direct contribution to the implementation of the vision of digital society 2030, since the aim is to guarantee the protection of our digital government, economy and digital way of life more broadly. In a safe environment, we can make bold advances in our digital development: the development of services, the digital transformation in the economy and the creation of future solutions. The cyber security sub-objective thus consistently supports the entire vision, also keeping in mind and promoting national security interests. III sub-objective. Cyber security Target based on the general objective: The Estonian cyberspace is safe and reliable. metric: Estonia’s cyberspace is resilient to cyberthreats and trusted. For this purpose, we assess the state of two aspects or metrics: 1. 2. Service providers (within the meaning of the Estonian Cybersecurity Act) have met the requirements of cyber security at a level with no considerable potential damage. Current situation: starting level unknown. The metric is being developed. The first result should be available in 2022 (we will add the metric to the calculation of the general objective once it has been developed and we have the first result). The use of digital services has not been avoided due to the existence of security risks. Current situation: starting level (2019): 96.2% Objective for 2030: above or equal to 96% Metric: Internet users in the age of 16-74 who have refrained from communicating with public sector institutions or service providers via the Internet due to security risks in the last 12 months (Statistics Estonia, IT 44). The inverse response is used as the metric: the result is the number of people who have not refrained from communication. The result is measured by Statistics Estonia. Results have been measured at an interval of a couple of years so far. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications will commission a measurement once a year from now on. 40 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 1. Relevant national cyber security set-up Trends in cyber security Activities: + Where necessary, we carry out an organisational restructuring based on the updated national cyber security administration model. + We amend and specify legal acts, contracts, crisis-response plans and other regulatory documents, which set out the roles, responsibility, tasks and cooperative relations of authorities and organisations. + We constantly analyse changes in digital trends and cyberthreats and their impact on cyber security in Estonia and its organisation. + We prepare and update a cyber security administration model based on risk analyses, determining the roles, responsibilities and tasks of authorities and organisations with a national cyber security function. Current situation: + The responsibility for ensuring cyber security is largely decentralised in Estonia. All information system owners and electronic service providers must take care of the security of their systems and incident management on their own and have the abilities required for that. At the same time, the cyber security field is increasingly specialised and owners of systems find it very difficult to obtain all the competences required for the protection of their systems. It creates an excessive burden for them and reduces the level of cyber security. + Some tasks related to guaranteeing cyber security are centralised. For instance, these include cyberspace monitoring and safety warnings, the development of the standard of information security measures, supervision and policy-making, etc. In addition, certain state functions are centralised, such as the investigation of cybercrime, crisis management and cyber operations for the purposes of national defence. + In order to ensure that the cyber security field is coordinated, a system involving a leading ministry and a cyber security authority is implemented. The leading ministry in the field of national cyber security is the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC) and the cyber security authority is the Information System Authority (RIA). The Ministry of the Interior and its subsidiary bodies are responsible for investigating cybercrime and ensuring internal security. The Ministry of Defence and the authorities in its area of government are assigned cyber security tasks related to national defence. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs deals with cyber diplomacy. This general management system has evolved over the years but the roles, responsibilities and allocation of work are unclear in a number of cases and insufficiently regulated by law. + The roles, responsibilities and tasks related to ensuring cyber security must be determined according to current needs and they must be comprehensive. Changes and growth in cyberthreats and additional tasks (certification, technology assessment, operational cooperation, etc.) have to be taken into consideration when updating the organisation of cyber security. + The current arrangements for resolving cyber incidents and crises must be supplemented. Various incidents and situations (including COVID-19) have highlighted shortcomings in the national crisis management system. For example, the tasks and responsibilities of various levels are unclear, ranging from the institutions and public authorities influenced by the incident to the responsible ministry of the field and the Government of the Republic. Results: + A clear, comprehensive national cyber security administration model that meets the needs of Estonia (including risks and trends) is in place. + The responsibility and tasks of authorities and organisations have been appropriately laid down in existing legal acts. 41 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 2. Analysis capacity for trends, risks and impacts cyber security must support innovation and innovation must support cyber security Current situation: + In order to ensure the sustainable development of digital society and the safe implementation of innovation, we have to improve our understanding of global trends and the development of technology. This means that we must be able to understand the risks associated with technology and their impact, and develop risk management measures. Cyber security must support innovation and innovation must support cyber security. More attention must be paid to accomplishing it than has been done so far. + Information system owners are responsible for mitigating risks related to their information systems and services. A number of authorities and organisations support the compilation of risk assessments and the development of security measures with analyses and instructions: the Information System Authority, security authorities, educational and research institutions and national and international centres of competence. The capacity to constantly analyse the situation needs to be developed in order to update existing security requirements and prepare practical recommendations and instructions for information system owners. This also requires the development of a relevant basic competence, among others at academic institutions. + The analysis of the trends, risks and impacts of digital society is not carried out entirely proactively and systematically yet. Developments in the field of artificial intelligence, cloud technology, robotics, augmented reality, communication technology, the Internet of things and many other technological trends bring along with them changes which we need to prepare for. Our analysis capacity is still insufficient for an appropriate interpretation of the impacts of global developments in the Estonian context and the development of necessary security measures. Results: + Decision-makers, policy-makers and the owners of networks and information systems have a good situational awareness of the trends and risks of global digital development and cyber security and their impact on Estonia. + Risks have been thought through and mitigated when planning and implementing digital innovation. + We can develop and implement cyber security measures that are suitable or the Estonian context quickly enough, among others by engaging the competences of various authorities, companies and experts. 42 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + In order to support policy- making related to cyber security, we establish a network-based think tank which takes technological, security policy, economic, foreign policy and other relevant aspects into account in its prospective assessments and recommendations. + We increase the capacity of academic institutions and development centres in implementing cyber security-related research and development projects of national importance. + We establish a work process for security considerations in planning digital innovation. + strategic risks related to the reliability of technology which may have an impact on society via the use of and dependence on technology. + We establish sustainable arrangements for defining and funding the research and development needs, programmes and projects of cyber security. We develop and implement a national plan concerning research and development activities related to cyber security. + We increase the capacity of the public sector in assessing the cyber security situation and risks and developing security measures across the state and in various sectors. We also increase the relevant awareness and competence. + ensuring the security of the basic services and platforms of the Estonian digital government, and artificial intelligence and cloud computing; Activities: In the aforementioned activities, we pay more attention to and focus on: + We support an increase in funding for research and development and joint actions related to cyber security at the EU level and actively participate in them in order to collectively generate and share knowledge in the EU. 43 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Current situation: + The current cyber security capacity of the state is insufficient for preventing and reducing the risks that endanger networks and information systems. The consistent growth and development of cyberthreats creates the need of rapidly developing our preventative capacity, and improving the monitoring and supervision of its implementation. + The implementation of cyber security measures is costly in the case of a decentralised administration model. Authorities and organisations need similar resources (experts, tools) to exercise their cyber security functions, which makes it more expensive to guarantee cyber security. Not all authorities have sufficient capacity for procuring specific competences and taking measures at an adequate level due to limited resources. + Cyber incidents occur and we have to be ready for them. The Estonian digital ecosystem has an extremely complex infrastructure, rendering it financially impractical to implement all kinds of preventive security measures. The use of security measures must be optimised and residual risks must be taken into account. This means that it is not possible to prevent all incidents. Instead, if they occur, we have to quickly identify them, respond and resolve them. + The capacity for managing and resolving cyber incidents and crises is insufficient, considering the digital dependence of the Estonian state. The crisis management system faces greater demands due to the growth in the number of cyberthreats and incidents. This concerns both organisational capacity and the use of cyber security products and services. Cyber security tools supporting the monitoring of networks and information systems, the development of a situational picture and the management of incidents must be constantly updated and improved. + There is a shortage of competent cyber security experts. The field of digitalisation and cyber security is more and more specialised. The increasingly rapid development of various technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cryptosystems, the Internet of things, robotics, augmented reality, etc. creates a need for specialised experts. It is required for national policies, the development of security measures and profitable international cooperation. + It is challenging to be an internationally trailblazing and leading country in the ever-changing and specialising field of cyber security. Estonia’s good reputation derives from the successful use of digital possibilities, accompanied by the skilful provision of cyber security. This reputation supports the export opportunities of companies and contributes to national security. A high degree of competence (i.e. experts and practical experience) is required in many fields in order to be able to direct international processes. Due to increasing complexity, it is not possible to be highly competent in all aspects; instead, clear areas of specialisation must be selected. Results: + Measures guaranteeing cyber security have been taken at the required level which has been determined in updated legal acts, standards and instructions. Guaranteeing the continuity, integrity and confidentiality of important services is the priority. + The state is capable of promptly resolving crises of various dimensions and participating in international crisis management. + There are enough specialised experts and tools to implement modern cyber security measures. + Estonia is a trailblazing and leading country in specific prioritised fields of cyber security in the EU and at a broader international level. 3. Increased capacity for maintaining cyber security The current cyber security capacity of the state is insufficient for preventing risks. 44 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + We increase the capacity of authorities and organisations performing public functions and providers of vital services in taking preventive measures: creating a safe architecture, implementing information security standards, certification, testing (including a considerable increase in the number of various tests), auditing, training, consultation and notification. + We increase the number of specialised experts in the public sector with regard to issues that are required for the provision of a high level of cyber security, the functioning of basic digital government services, the implementation of artificial intelligence and cloud computing and digital innovation. + We determine and develop as a priority the fields of cyber security where Estonia has the greatest international potential. We take the initiative at an international level in fields that are based on national priorities and substantive strengths. + We increase the capacity of government agencies that participate in the provision of national cyber security in monitoring and supervising the cyber security situation. We develop updated metrics and mechanisms for assessing the situation of national cyber security. + We advocate the provision of cyber security at a uniformly high level in the EU and promote cyber security- related cooperation between Member States in order to manage risks and increase our joint capacity of responding to incidents. + We increase the capacity of government agencies that participate in the provision of national cyber security in resolving cyber incidents. + We organise national and international exercises to practice resolving incidents. + We systematise and consolidate to a practical extent the functions of cyber security. Activities: 45 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 The following is required to achieve the targets of digital society by 2030: + The availability of a sufficient number of ICT specialists with an adequate level, including cyber specialists, is of critical importance. The number of ICT specialists must at least double in the economy by 2030 and the proportion of cyber specialists must increase among them to achieve future targets to the extent necessary. For this purpose, relevant learning opportunities must constantly be expanded and the quality of learning must be improved at all levels. Above all, this requires decisive steps with regard to increasing the volume and quality of teaching capacity, including ensuring a sufficient number of teachers. As the domestic education system does not suffice for realising our potential, we must make it easy for talents to come to Estonia – it must be a convenient and attractive destination. + In order to take the wider digital transformation in the economy and public administration to the next level of digital maturity, it is important to launch widespread reskilling and upskilling initiatives in connection with digital skills. This enables specialists of various fields to acquire required specialised digital knowledge in order to launch and manage or support digital changes in their organisations. Furthermore, the development of (specialised) digital skills must be a natural part of every level of education. These steps also facilitate the adaptation of employees to changes in the economy. In order to implement the vision of digital society 2030, this development plan needs to be supplemented in other policy fields in a number of ways. According to the procedure for compiling development plans in Estonia, it is not an obligation automatically conferred on other fields, but rather a request and expectation in connection with the content and direction of other policy measures, based on the vision of digital society established in the framework of this development plan. These create the basis for submitting opinions and coordinating activities between authorities when implementing and updating development plans. Expectations concerning other fields in implementing our vision 46 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + The need to address the wider digital literacy of the population persists The need to ‘attract people to the Internet’ is ever decreasing. Instead, it must be ensured that they have up-to-date skills to deal with digital solutions in a useful and safe manner. By 2030, all Estonian adults should be regular Internet users. This gives us the opportunity to guarantee their sufficient capabilities, including a basic level of awareness, so that they can make even better use of services following the leap in the development of digital government. +Within the field of research and development activities, investments have to be made in increasing the capacity of research and development (R&D) related to the development of digital society. This way, we can find people to create smart solutions and detect knowledge and solutions that can be promptly tested and implemented in the state and economy. The key is to guarantee sufficient funding of ICT-related R&D. + The best possible services need to be based on good Estonian language technology, so that domestic and global service providers can make their services as convenient as possible for the members of the Estonian digital society. This requires increasing investments in basic language technology solutions. + Enterprise policies must simultaneously focus on two targets: 1) supporting digital transformation in more traditional sectors (e.g. industry) by pulling the necessary levers - from improving knowledge and skills to supporting investments (including ensuring a cyber-secure digital transformation) 2) constantly developing a technology-based business environment. We must establish and guarantee excellent conditions in Estonia for developing smart products and services, founding and growing new companies creating such solutions and attracting relevant foreign talent. Developing the business environment plays a significant role in making Estonia the easiest place to conduct business in the entire world. As the next leap in our development, it is important to develop the organisation of real-time economy and solutions. + In order to guarantee the development of the business environment and more broadly the creation and adoption of new solutions, law-making must be flexible in the rapidly changing world and quickly respond to opportunities. At the same time, legislation must continue to protect the fundamental rights of people and ensure the ethical use of data. 47 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 + If public services become more and more invisible, i.e. proactive and automatic in the state, communication between people and the state and people’s understanding of the functioning of the state may decrease. To avoid this, the quality of information services and the openness of governance must be improved. In other words, people must be more and more actively involved in making public decisions and holding discussions. Among others, digital solutions can be smartly used for this purpose, ranging from supporting the functioning of communities to increasing the opportunities of participation at national level. + Using the support activities of business diplomacy and export, we must continue our efforts to provide Estonia with the reputation of an ambitious and smart digital society and state in the world. This opens doors to companies, allowing them to take their IT solutions to the world, and turns them into stronger partners in the creation of future solutions for Estonia. On the other hand, Estonia’s prominence also determines whether talents and global players consider Estonia as their next place of residence. + Social engagement, coherence and reduction of division highlighted in the vision is only possible if health, welfare and other development plans aimed at the development of society focus on an extensive and substantial digital transformation strategy, the development of content areas is strongly integrated and implementation is managed effectively. + In addition, we must continue the rapid digitalisation of our cultural legacy in the field of culture, improve the quality of the creation, preservation and availability of digital culture and promote the reuse and cross-usage of digital content. This way, we can accomplish the vision of promoting Estonian culture in the digital era. 48 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 Organisation of management The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (led by the Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology as of 2021) as the main body leading the development of digital society is responsible for implementing the development plan. The development plan is implemented by means of a digital society programme (hereinafter referred to asthe programme) which includes the development of digital government, connectivity and cyber security. The programme sets out the specific objectives for certain years and the activities required for accomplishing them together with the responsible entities, funds and metrics. The programme is prepared for four years according to the duration of the state budget strategy and updated once a year. There are plans to review the development plan more thoroughly at least twice during this period and update it in order to take into account the rapidly changing environment (e.g. the development of technology) and the success of the activities. The implementation of the development plan is previously assessed as one of the bases of the review. The updates are to be made in the first half of 2024 and by the end of 2027. In terms of organising the management of the development plan, the main task is to ensure synergy between the objectives and activities of various areas and authorities because the development of digital society (above all the implementation of the vision for 2030) depends on the common efforts of many participants. In order to ensure the required compatibility, the coordination of cooperation and a single information field, the management of the development plan and its various levels have been planned as follows.

An event service com- piles several services (hereinafter referred to as component services) related to the same event into a single service for the user. 11 Proactive services are direct public services provided by an authority on its own initiative in accordance with the presumed will of persons and based on the data in the databases belonging to the state information system. 12vThe first development plan was approved by the Cabinet in December 2020: uudised/ valitsus-kiitis-heaks-jargmised-sammud-sundmusteenuste-arendamisel 13 In Estonian, the word ‘kratt’ refers to a system of artificial intelligence. It is based on a software algorithm which is autonomous and capable of learning and carries out activities traditionally carried out by people. 14 Estonia’s national artificial intelligence strategy for 2019-2021 tikava_juuli2019.pdf 15 The reliability of artificial intelligence is based on ethical guidelines for AI which have been set as a goal at the EU level. 16 Bürokratt is an interoperable network of public and private sector AI applications which has been linked with state 52 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 information systems and functions as a single channel for direct and information services from the viewpoint of users. See the concept of Bürokratt at 17 A human-centred digital government is one where the use of digital solutions is not an end in itself but rather a tool for increasing the well-being of people. For people’s trust in digital government to become stable and grow, digital solutions have to be reliable. Reliable digital solutions are dependable, ethical and lawful, guaranteeing the fundamental rights and freedoms of all people. 18 The Personal Data Usage Monitor makes data processing transparent, improving people’s awareness and helping institutions respond to personal data enquiries. The Personal Data Usage Monitor provides a person with an over- view of what has been done with their data and what is displayed in the state portal eesti.ee. It is meant to be linked with public sector information systems which store and process personal data in their databases. 19 A consent service is a digital service linked to the database of an authority, enabling people to give their consent, and view and withdraw it. Data users can view the consents given to them for the issue of data; database adminis- trators can check whether a consent has been given when issuing personal data to the data users. 20 The aim of the green IT initiative is to reduce the negative impact of technologies by designing, producing, using and later processing technologies in an environmentally friendly manner. 21 Privacy technology is a technical measure for ensuring the privacy of a person in a proactive and preventive man- ner. 22 The ‘once-only’ principle means that the same data are not repeatedly requested from users. The principle of reuse refers to an agreement allowing the reuse of data collected by someone else or for another purpose in the creation of new knowledge. 2 The X-Road is a technological and organisational environment enabling a secure Internet-based data exchange between state authorities and the private sector, whereby evidential value is guaranteed. To exchange data, a member of the X-Road describes the shared data and other members can use that data based on an agreement.

With regard to digital society, there still persists an  ambition to use information and communication  technology, i.e. digital solutions as astutely and as  much as possible in order to achieve the objectives of  ‘Estonia 2035’1. Namely, contributions are made via the  following sub-objectives:  + The Estonian economy is innovative and  knowledge-based, using new technologies and  business models as well as flexible forms of work. The  contribution of the development plan lies in the creation  of favourable conditions for business research and  development and innovation. The Estonian economic  environment invites people to work here, establish  companies or do business virtually, invest, create and  test new solutions which benefit the society at large.  + The needs of all people are taken into account  when shaping the living environment and the  foundations of high-quality spaces and principles  of inclusive design are consistently followed when  making decisions in order to ensure the accessibility  and convenience of spiritual, physical and digital  space for everyone. The activities of the development  plan contribute through the use of innovative  technologies and environmentally friendly solutions  which reduce the impact of climate change and the  time required for covering distances and ensure a good  living environment all across Estonia.  + Estonia is an innovative country which values the  creation and use of knowledge and where social  life is organised by means of new human-centric  and efficient technologies. The contribution of the  development plan is reflected in the fact that the  governance set-up promotes social cohesion, the  adoption of new solutions, innovation and flexible  governance. Public services function in the background  and are proactive, and the data space is protected. The  organisation of governance and people’s participation  in it in Estonia is trendsetting and sets an example to  other countries.  According to the vision of the Digital Agenda  2030, Estonia should be full of digital power. This  encompasses the following:  + our way of life is impressive – it is easy to accomplish  what we need or want;  + we are protected by the power of digitalisation – our  digital life is safe and we make bold advances in digital  development;  + our economy is empowered by digitalisation – digital  solutions are the engine of the entire economy;  + supported by the power of digitalisation, we value  every person and contribute to co-creation;  + fertile conditions have been established for the  creation of future solutions in Estonia.  To implement the vision, more specific goals have been  set in this development plan and lines of action have  been planned in three areas:  + the development of digital government, i.e. the use  of digital solutions in the public sector, since no other  development plan includes the general development of  digital government and the public sector also leads and  sets the direction for the development of the Estonian  digital society. The main goal is to strive for the best  experience when using public services, so that our way  of life can be impressive, as has been highlighted in the  vision. For this purpose, we plan to take the next leaps  in the development of digital government and ensure  the sustainability of the established solutions;  + the development of electronic communication,  i.e. connectivity, because the sufficient availability of  connections forms the foundation of the use of digital  solutions, be it in everyday life or business. The main  goal is the availability of fast and affordable connections  throughout Estonia.  + the development of national cyber security, since  we can boldly move forward on the journey of digital  development formulated in the vision if sufficient trust  has been guaranteed. This area includes the provision  of cyber security in the public sector and more broadly  in the economy. The main goal is to keep the Estonian  cyberspace reliable and secure. Considering the  growing risks and the established basis, it is a  rather ambitious target on its own.    5 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  The authority generally responsible for  the implementation of the programme  and therefore also the development plan  is the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Communications (MEAC) or in the case of  specific activities its subsidiary bodies and/or  other state authorities or participants.  Vision of Estonia’s   digital society 2030  Principles of implementing the vision  Organisation of management  Digital government  sub-objective  Connectivity   sub-objective  The total cost, i.e. the overall   funding needs of the development   plan make up around 1.2 billion   euros over ten years.  Expectations  in connection   with other  development   plans  Cyber security   sub-objective  The implementation of the vision of digital society  also depends on a number of other areas and policies  covered by other development plans. Therefore,  this development plan also separately formulates  expectations for other policy areas because  development plans should not overlap, but at the same  time it is reasonable to partially address the measures  of other areas.  The expectations constitute a ‘request’ stemming  from the broader vision of digital society, so that we  should clearly outline the needs and foundations, on  the basis of which we can plan support activities for the  implementation of other development plans or direct  their alignment with one another. This development  plan does not include specific targets or activities for  promoting the introduction of ICT in various walks of  life and business fields because all development plans  of specific fields must encompass such plans.  When implementing the vision, it is important to  consistently follow the principles highlighted in this  development plan with regard to all of the sub- objectives.  The implementation and updating of this Agenda  and its alignment with other development plans  is guaranteed by means of the organisation of  management which has a steering group at its  centre, headed by the minister responsible for the   development of digital society. An advisory committee  including state authorities and other partners directs  the accomplishment of the sub-objectives of this  Agenda. In addition, the Cyber Security Council is  active in the field of cyber security as a subgroup  of a government committee. When it comes to  implementation, various formats are used to organise  cooperation, plan activities and carry out monitoring.  The development plan is implemented by means  of a digital society programme which is prepared  for four years and updated along with the budget  strategy once a year. The programme includes  specific measures, metrics, responsible agents and a  budget, etc. which are required as an action plan for  achieving the targets and aims of the Agenda in the  coming years. Advisory committees of specific fields  and, naturally, the steering group of this development  plan update the programme and monitor its  implementation.  A more specific analysis of the current situation and  the justification for the selected lines of action are  presented in the chapters of the main part of the  development plan. However, we present the ‘larger  picture’ of the current situation in the development of  the Estonian digital society here – the main conclusions  of the baseline analysis for the Agenda, including an  international comparison, where possible.    6 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  A more specific analysis of the current situation and  the justification for the selected lines of action are  presented in the chapters of the main part of the  development plan. However, we present the ‘larger  picture’ of the current situation in the development  of the Estonian digital society here – the main  conclusions of the baseline analysis for the Agenda,  including an international comparison, where possible.  The main characteristics and challenges of the  Estonian digital society are currently the following:  1) Estonia has achieved a lot with regard to the  development of digital government, but a great deal  remains to be done: we have to reach a new level  and maintain what we have already created.  Estonia ranks among the first in many international  comparisons (e.g. the DESI 20202 ranking of EU  Member States or the eGovernment Benchmark  20203, the United Nations E-Government Survey  2024, etc.). What differentiates us is the fact that we  have an actually functioning and widely used digital  government.  Digital services and solutions are broadly used by  back-office officials in public administration as well as  private persons and entrepreneurs when dealing with  state authorities. The proportion of the users of digital  government services is among the largest in the EU  (93%) (DESI 2020). Nearly all direct public services  have been digitalised one way or another by now,  i.e. they are now available via digital channels. The  Estonian digital government has been established on a  strong foundation, such as our national digital identity  and the X-Road which has made the development of  digital services in various fields safer, quicker and more  affordable.  However, there are also concerns:  + the ease of use of services does not meet the  expectations of users, requirements or best practices –  even if digital services are used, the processes are often  cumbersome and the value they produce is therefore  limited;  + the sustainability of services, i.e. their constant  renewal and maintenance at the required level has  not been guaranteed when it comes to technology,  procedures or resources;  + the arrival of new larger updates in digital  government has not been sufficiently known or has not  been as fast and widespread as necessary;  + cross-border services are underdeveloped, including  at the level of the European Union, and there are still  obstacles with regard to data exchange between  countries and the establishment of common services.  However, it should be taken into consideration that  states inevitably compete with one another when  it comes to talents, export or investments. The  quality of the business environment and services  is an increasingly important factor which has been  in favour of Estonia this far. If we fail to resolve the  concerns of digital government, we will be left behind  in the competition – many EU and other countries  in the world have taken powerful steps to launch the  digital transformation of their public sector in recent  years, which has been propelled even further by the  COVID-19 pandemic.  Current state of the  development of digital society  93% The proportion of digital   government users (DESI 2020)    7 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  2) Estonia has a developed telecommunications  market, but a fast Internet connection is far from  being available to everyone and everywhere across  the country.  The telecommunications market is highly competitive  despite its small size. It is particularly noticeable with  regard to mobile communications where the prices are  among the lowest in Europe and the number of users   is large (there are one and a half times more mobile  broadband users than on average in the EU according  to DESI 2020). Estonia was among the first to deploy  4G. The deployment of 5G has been somewhat  delayed due to legal reasons but is starting up.  We are close to the average of the EU with regard to  the general availability of high-speed Internet: 57%  of households have access to very high capacity  networks (DESI 2020), even though large investments  have been made in the relevant backhaul network  and more than 7000 km have been added with the  support of the state in the last decade. There is a  market failure outside larger urban areas: building a  network is extremely expensive and often requires  support from the state due to dispersed housing and a  small population. Consumers themselves still use the  possibilities of high-speed Internet very little.  14% of households have a fixed broadband  subscription of at least 100 Mbit/s (DESI 2020). The  demand and actual need for higher speeds is likely to  increase in the future.  3) Estonia has skilfully ensured cyber security, but  the risks are increasing and basic abilities must be  considerably improved.  Digital services are actively used in the Estonian  digital government and society owing to great trust  in them and service providers. Among others, the  secure structure of the Estonian digital government,  the comprehensive approach to cyber security, the  awareness of the significance of risk prevention  and reduction and their gradual development have  contributed to it.  However, there are significant gaps in the organisation  of cyber security and the basic abilities if we take  into account the fact that risks are increasing. Both  cybercrime and geopolitical attacks in cyberspace  are on the rise – technology is increasingly used to  attain political interests. At the same time, we rely  on the solutions of external technology creators and  providers to a considerable extent. If we cannot foresee  and manage risks, we are made vulnerable by the  vulnerability of such providers. It is inevitable that we  cannot do and check everything ourselves, which  is why it is important to be able to choose reliable  partners and solutions. Maintaining a high-level basic  cyber-security capacity is unavoidable for Estonia,  since otherwise we cannot continue to rely on digital  solutions to the extent we have done so far. Estonia  has a highly developed digital society which, unlike  many other countries, is already vitally dependent  on digital services and the infrastructure enabling  them every day: network and information systems,  hardware and software, the devices of ordinary  users and other technology. Digital dependence also  concerns the providers of vital services, a large part  of whom consider their technological dependence  critical. Furthermore, various information systems  are interconnected, using data from one another.  International cooperation is much-needed because  incidents spread across state borders and hazards are  growing in general in the world. Collective action in the  field of cyber security has increased at the EU level, but  we have a long journey ahead to secure an equally high  level of digital safety across the entire EU.  57% of households have  access to very high  capacity networks  (DESI 2020)  14% with a fixed broadband subscription of at   least 100 Mbit/s (DESI 2020)  The number of mobile  broadband users exceeds   the average of the EU by one  and a half times  (DESI 2020)  of households    8 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  4) The Estonian economy has not undergone a  larger digital transformation yet, but we have a  strong IT sector and community of technology- based start-ups.  The Estonian digital society has been marked by  controversy for a long time: although we have a highly  developed digital government, i.e. digital solutions  are widely used in the public sector, the same has not  taken place more broadly in the economy. At the EU  level, the Estonian private sector ranks average or  sometimes even below average in terms of its general  digital development and the use of the opportunities  of e-commerce (export) (DESI 2020). Nevertheless,  there are signs that the situation is about to change.  For example, the demand for the support measures  of digital transformation has increased and the  COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant advances in  e-commerce.  Next to the traditional economy with a low level  of digitalisation, there is a strong, internationally  outstanding and thriving IT sector and community of  start-ups in Estonia. The IT sector has been one of the  drivers of economic growth in the last ten years and  the field of start-ups has overtaken agriculture in terms  of volume by now.  5) The greatest obstacle to development is the lack  of IT competences and specialists.  At the EU level, we are at the forefront when it comes  to the digital skills of residents and the proportion of  ICT specialists (DESI 2020). Nevertheless, there is a  chronic lack of sufficient numbers of IT specialists,  hindering digital transformation in the economy,  the development of technology companies and the  enhancement of digital government or cyber security.  The more the entire economy and the world move  along the digital road, the greater this shortage will  be in the future. In short, we have more ideas and  development opportunities than people and IT skills to  use these opportunities and turn the ideas into services  or products.  The basic digital knowledge of residents is sufficient for  the Internet to be used widely. At the same time, there  has been no significant increase in recent years: it has  stabilised at 90% and international surveys (e.g. PIAAC)  reveal that higher digital skills are an issue of concern.  For instance, it hinders participation in the digital  transformation at the workplace or the introduction of  newer technologies in various sectors or may cause  structural unemployment. The lack or incompatibility  of digital skills is one of the largest obstacles for  companies when making digital investments (DESI  2020).  6) Technology continues to develop – it opens new  opportunities, but also poses risks  There is an unbreakable megatrend in the world: the  rise of digital technology continues. New solutions  and technological opportunities are added more and  more quickly and exponentially. On the one hand,  it provides Estonia with the opportunity to continue  making progress in its digital development, since new  technology creates new areas of use or opportunities  to recreate something that has been digitalised to  make it even better.  At the same time, technological innovation is always  accompanied by new cyberthreats. It should be noted  that digital solutions become increasingly complex  and specialised. Seeing, preventing and mitigating  related risks thus requires more and more (special)  competence. Complex risks caused by the rise of  cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cryptography,  quantum computers, the Internet of things, augmented  reality and robotics, etc. can no longer be sufficiently  resolved with the help of universal experts.  At the EU level, we are at  the forefront when it comes   to the digital skills of  residents and the proportion   of ICT specialistss (DESI 2020)  There is an  unbreakable   megatrend in the  world: the rise of   digital technology  continues.    9 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Vision:  Estonia, empowered  by digitalisation  The vision is to have Estonia full of digital “vägi”‘. The  closest word to vägi in English is ‘power’. Vägi is an  evocative word with a long history as it is among the  300 oldest words in the Estonian language. In Estonian  mythology, many things can have “vägi”: trees, songs  and words, even rocks. It’s an invisible and somewhat  magical power that the item or person possesses. And  so it is an appropriate word to describe a digital society:  aided by invisible and intangible power that gives us  tools to be more. It is somewhat even magical and a  power that needs to be carefully mastered. With digital   “vägi” or “power” we wish to keep the valuable things  we have established but believe that the Estonian  digital society can be further improved. Estonia is  already known as a strong digital society in the world,  but we are capable of so much more.  We want Estonia to be full of digital power - competent  and more powerful than anyone could otherwise  expect for such a small country. Therefore, we can  always make the best use of the possibilities of digital  technology.    10 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Our way of life powered by   digitalisation – it is easy to   accomplish what we need or want  + Services function exactly according to my needs, and   are available when I need them and in the manner I   prefer.  + Unnecessary procedures are a thing of the past   both in the private and public sector, leaving me   more time to carry out more valuable work or enjoy   a more pleasant everyday life. The complexity of the   functioning of the state is invisible for private persons   and entrepreneurs.  + I can access necessary services with a good   connection everywhere and at any time, irrespective of   whether I am in Tallinn, a remote village called Obinitsa   or travelling around the world.  We are protected by the power of   digitalisation – our digital life is   safe and we make bold advances in   digital development  + My data are secure, but at the same time data can be   easily used to create new smart solutions.  + It is safe to use digital space; there is no need to fear   misinformation, cyberbullying or cybercrime. I behave   in a manner that does not involve digital risks; at the   same time, I am unnoticeably provided with protection   in the background.  + The Estonian state and important services are always   protected in cyberspace. It also gives our economy a   competitive advantage.  Our economy is powerful thanks to   digitalisation – digital solutions are   the engine of the entire economy  + The core companies of all sectors have completed   the digital transformation in their operation or offer   digital products and services. We have also made the   economy environmentally friendly with the help of   digital solutions.  + Transactions are made, invoices are paid and reports   are prepared completely digitally, automatically and in   an instant – it saves us time and money.  + People and companies from all over the world find   it easy to do business in Estonia thanks to convenient   procedures. Estonia has more active e-residents than   permanent residents.  We empower people by valuing every   person and their contribution to co-  creation  + We are a technological nation: always and in all   aspects ready to create new solutions and use them   everywhere. We acquire new knowledge and skills   eagerly and quickly throughout our lives.  + Smart solutions make us even more connected   and integrated, enable us to close gaps and support   everyone in the required manner, where necessary.   We contribute to the welfare of the state and the   community; we are a society.  + Estonian culture is easily accessible via digital   channels throughout the world, preserved for the   future and actively (re)used. The Estonian language is   alive and developing in digital space.  Fertile foundation for the creation of   future solutions in Estonia  + There are excellent conditions for creating and testing   innovative solutions in Estonia and taking them to the   world – it is like a smart village of the world. People   come here from other parts of the world to create   solutions for the future; new producers emerge and   existing ones continue to operate eagerly.  A digitally powerful Estonia is  characterised by the following:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.    11 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  We adhere to the following principles   when developing our digital society   and planning and implementing   activities within the framework of this   development plan:  Principles  We protect and promote the fundamental rights of people. We ensure that everyone has an   equal opportunity to participate in digital society and we maintain indispensable freedoms, starting   with Internet freedom. We guarantee that people have the opportunity to manage the use of their   personal data and protection of privacy.  We preserve the Estonian language and culture. We promote the viability of the Estonian language   and culture in digital society and space. It is particularly important that everyday devices and services   can be used in familiar Estonian.  We maintain our reliability. When launching initiatives and development activities, we immediately   consider the related risks, and plan and carry out activities to reduce them – this way, we can make   bold advances in the development of digital society. We prevent and resolve concerns in a transparent   manner. We prefer to focus on prevention instead of dealing with consequences.  We are technology-neutral. In our initiatives and development activities we concentrate on results   and choose the best technology to achieve them. If at all possible, we prefer open standards and   solutions based on them. We establish common policy instruments (support, legal acts, etc.) which   apply to all suitable solutions.  We build our digital society together. We join forces as early as possible to make the best decisions   and find the most suitable solutions using our collective knowledge, resources and efforts. It may   involve cooperation with domestic and foreign technology companies and universities, public sector   institutions, various government levels and the third sector or other countries. We reuse good   solutions and share our own.  We are innovative. When tackling challenges, we always consider whether and what we could do   differently. Where possible, we test a new approach because it may yield more later on. We know that   solutions are never complete; they can and must be constantly developed and designed to be flexible   for this purpose.  We are climate and environmentally friendly. We do things digitally, promoting the conservation of   the environment, contributing to the mitigation of climate change and helping to adapt to its impacts.    12 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Based on the vision, the goal for the next decade  in terms of the development of digital society is to  increase Estonia’s digital power: digital government  guarantees the best experience, high-speed Internet  is available to all those who request it in Estonia and  our cyberspace is safe and reliable.  We measure the achievement of this objective on  the basis of the development of four metrics as   follows:  General objective and metrics  Objective for  2030:  (90% + 90% + 100% + 96%)/4 = 94  Initial situation  of the develop-  ment plan: (69% + 47% + 58% + 96%)/4 = 67,5  avail- ability  of high- speed  Internet  resilience  and trustwor- thiness of  cyberspace  satisfaction of  entrepreneurs  with public  digital services  satisfaction  of private  persons with  public digital  services  /4 = X+++( )    13 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Target based on the general objective: to ensure the   best digital government experience by 2030.  This sub-objective is directly related to the   implementation of one of the axes of the vision of   digital society 2030: creating an impressive way of   life in Estonia by means of digital solutions. While   the previous aim set for the development of digital   government was to primarily increase the efficiency of   public administration, the quality and human-centricity   of services is the next level of maturity in digital   government. This does not mean that things should   not or cannot still be done more efficiently – it must be   done in addition to and while improving the quality of   services.  In addition, the implementation of this objective   contributes to the progress of other axes of the vision.   Public services that provide the best experience and   are of high quality help to make the economy more   digitally powered because they simplify procedures for   all entrepreneurs – among other things, it increases   the number of e-residents. In order to ensure the best   experience of digital government, steps have to be   taken to establish favourable conditions for the creation   of future solutions that improve our experience, as has   been highlighted in the vision.

Switch to life and business event based and proactive services  Next leaps in the development  of digital government  Activities:  Current situation:  + For people, services do not seem to be or function  as a seamless service, based on their life and business  events (e.g. childbirth, marriage, founding a company).  Instead, they are fragmented between state, local  government and private services. Information  concerning public services is available and services are  offered in various channels and there is no common  approach from the viewpoint of users. It is often difficult  to understand where to find information about or how  to use a certain service.  + Public services are generally provided at the initiative  of users and the same data are unnecessarily requested  a number of times. At the same time, the state often  has all the data required for offering a service, e.g. for  the proactive provision of aid.  + Although life and business event services10 have been  discussed as a goal for a number of years, we are still at  the beginning of our journey when it comes to creating  them. The situation is similar with proactive services11  where only one proactive service based on offers  (provision of family benefits) has been launched in  addition to a few automated services (e.g. aid to retired  people living alone).  Results:  + In Estonia, public services reach you when you need  them. Where possible, the state notifies people and  entrepreneurs if they have the right to receive certain  benefits or must fulfil an obligation. Proactive services  are provided automatically or with the consent of a  person, giving them the opportunity to withdraw from  using the service or select the manner in which it is  used.  + Public services are provided to people and  entrepreneurs as a single seamless service based on  their life or business events; the complexity of the  functioning of the state (e.g. cooperation between  various authorities and levels) is invisible to the  recipients of services.  + When using public services, users are asked the  same data only once, except if repeated data requests  are reasonably justified.    16 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  2. AI-powered government13  + We implement the concept of  Bürokratt to make public services available via   virtual assistants.  Activities:  + We implement and    constantly update the national artificial   intelligence strategy, i.e. our action plan in   order to expand the use of AI applications   (including robots) in the public sector and   increase the relevant capability. Among   other things, we engage in active cross-  border and EU-level cooperation to   share and reuse experiences and AI   solutions.  + We develop the    legal space to enable a more   widespread and reliable use of AI   applications (including guaranteeing   the protection of fundamental rights).   We also advocate this in AI-related   policy and law-making at the European   Union and international level.  Current situation:  + Artificial intelligence has been adopted in the public  sector on the basis of Estonia’s national artificial  intelligence strategy14 and the first results have been  achieved. As of the end of 2020, approximately 80  AI projects have been implemented or are ongoing.  Nevertheless, competences related to artificial  intelligence and data science are lacking, the level of  implementation of Estonian language technology is still  low and there are legal obstacles to the use of data (for  example in connection with interpreting data protection  requirements). Algorithmic trustworthiness has not  been systematically guaranteed in the implementation  of AI yet.  + The possibilities to use AI are much wider than  those that have been implemented so far – it requires  changes in work processes and information systems.  AI is a great opportunity for Estonia to take user  experience and the functioning of the state to a new  level of development, as has been reflected in the first  experiences.  + Public services, the environments where they are  provided and the websites of institutions have been  designed and developed based on a different kind  of logic and style. Therefore, users find it confusing   and difficult to navigate between various portals  and environments. People expect simplicity and  support from the state, but it is still too difficult to find  information on where to turn to if you need to contact  the state. Digital communication with the state requires  a good level of digital literacy but it should not be  like this. At the same time, the technology of virtual  assistants and other AI applications to tackle problems  like this is developing rapidly in the world.  Results:  + Estonia is a leading user of AI solutions in the  provision of public services in the world: our digital  government is AI-powered. Another leap has been  taken in increasing efficiency in the public sector by  means of AI and other modern routine automation  technologies, and the AI applications deployed are  trustworthy15.  + All procedures concerning the public sector can  be carried out using virtual assistants in Estonia.  The major digital services of all administrative fields  meant for people or entrepreneurs have been linked  to the national ecosystem of virtual assistants called  Bürokratt16. As such, users can access all public without  special knowledge, using any common form of  communication, channel or device.    17 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  3. Human-centric digital government17  Current situation:  + Users usually have a high degree of confidence in the  Estonian digital government but it is not guaranteed.  The awareness of people and the general public of  the functioning of digital solutions (including data  processing) and the transparency of solutions has been  low, which may reduce trust in the future and create a  digital divide (a growth in the proportion of non-users  and sceptics).  + It is especially important to ensure transparency and  reliability when implementing new technology with  great potential which may have an adverse impact  on the fundamental rights of people (e.g. AI, data  analytics, etc.). Trust in digital government is dependent  on whether fundamental rights are guaranteed but  not enough attention has been paid to ensuring  and promoting such rights when introducing digital  solutions.  + Estonia has stood out with the fact that people get  an overview of who uses the data included in some  important databases and how such data are used (e.g.  health information in the Patient Portal). A Personal  Data Usage Monitor has been created but is still in its   early stages. The state does not provide a complete  overview of when and how the data of private persons  or companies are used. Users thus have an incomplete  overview of who uses their data and when and how  they are used.  + Private persons have the opportunity of requesting  access to and obtaining their data in order to provide  access to other parties. However, it is not possible to  give your consent to other parties, so that they can  request data automatically. In addition, no profit can be  made when allowing the use of your data, which could  encourage the private sector to create new solutions.  Therefore, it is difficult for the private sector to use the  data of private persons and the collection of their data is  duplicated, which slows down the development of the  digital economy.  + There is no functioning solution for managing and  withdrawing given consents. Therefore, it is rather  difficult or even impossible for private persons and  entrepreneurs to find out whether and how their data  are used for the purposes of decision-making (including  decisions concerning them) or service provision.  Results:  + The society’s trust in the use of digital solutions in the  provision of public services is maintained and grows.  It is based on people’s increased awareness of the  connections between technology and fundamental  rights, the reliability of technology and their role in  service design as well as the transparency of the  creation and use of digital solutions.  + When developing and implementing digital solutions  in the public sector, the fundamental rights of people,  democracy and the rule of law are protected and the  opportunities provided by technology are used to  promote them.  + When developing and offering public services, it is  guaranteed that everyone has an equal opportunity to  participate in digital society and use digital services.  + Private persons and entrepreneurs are in control of  their data and can actually share them in Estonia. They  have an overview of the data collected by the state in  connection with all services and the purposes of the use  of their data.  + Private persons and entrepreneurs can use digital  solutions to decide who can use the data shared by  them and determine the purposes and conditions of  use (for a fee if they wish).    18 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + We develop the Estonian legal   space to ensure the human-centricity   of digital government and the   reliability of digital solutions and   promote the fast-paced introduction   of new technologies for the benefit of   the society.  + We raise the awareness   of people and the general   public of human-centric digital   government and the reliability of   technology.  + We increase the ability of the   owners and creators of digital   services to develop and offer   human-centric and reliable digital   solutions.  + We develop and implement relevant   risk management measures to ensure   the reliability and human-centricity   of digital solutions, and manage the   impacts on fundamental rights.  Activities:  + We introduce the opportunity   to obtain a complete overview   of all of your data held by the   state in the state portal.  + We introduce a consent   service19 all across the state and   expand it to include the data of   entrepreneurs.  + We adopt a Personal Data   Usage Monitor18 all across the   state and expand it to include the   data of entrepreneurs.  + We shape EU and other international   activities, promoting the cross-border and global   exchange of (personal) data between countries in   a manner that provides people with more control   over their data (e.g. within the framework of   international treaties), and activities which help us   advance and ensure the global development and   use of human-centric and reliable technology.    19 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  4. Green digital government  + We analyse the   environmental impact of the   Estonian digital government and   ways to reduce it.  + We initiate and   implement the climate and   environmental friendliness   and green IT20 action plan.  Activities:  Current situation:  + No attention has been paid to the environmental  compatibility of solutions and climate change when  developing digital government in Estonia. The  environmental footprint of the use of digital solutions  is constantly increasing in Estonia and elsewhere in  the world. The ICT sector together with data centres  makes up an estimated 2% of global greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions which is comparable to the  proportion of the aviation sector. If this tendency  persists, the proportion of the ICT sector in GHG  emissions may rise above 14% by 2040. The  awareness of customers, users and developers  of technology and their attempts to act in a more  environmentally sound manner are lacking. + The  exchange of information on paper has decreased and  environmental monitoring has become more efficient  thanks to digital solutions, but the environmental  impact of the Estonian digital government (water,  energy and resource consumption more widely, GHG  emissions, impact on nature and waste generation)  and ways of reducing it have not been analysed.  + A green way of thinking is increasingly popular in the  world (including the technology sector) and provides  Estonia with the opportunity to become a pioneer  as a green, environmentally friendly country with  digital government. In terms of user experience, it is  also more and more important whether services are  provided in an environmentally sound manner.  Results:  + Estonia has the greenest digital government in the  world and sets an example to others.  + This does not imply the greenwashing of current  solutions, but rather the development and management  of digital government are based on climate and  environmental friendliness. Where possible, the option  that is more climate and environmentally friendly  is chosen when introducing a new solution and the  environmental footprint of digital government is  reduced.    20 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Directions which enable us to take a  leap in development and ensure the  sustainability of digital government  1. Introduction of the management and user-centricity of public services  Current situation:  + The fragmentation of the provision of public services  and unnecessary bureaucracy show that public services  either have not been designed or provided in a user- centric manner or the quality of the services of various  institutions is uneven in relation to this. There is no  common standard for services, focusing on users. The  requirements concerning the design, development,  management and measurement of services are  fragmented or inadequate.  + It is more difficult to access and use services if a  person lacks skills, has special needs, comes from a  foreign country or has a different cultural background;;  there is also a greater risk that they miss important  services.  + Public services often do not have an owner or if an  owner has been assigned, it is a mere formality and the  services lack substantial management. Furthermore,  most ministries have a coordinator of such services but  service development is not systematically managed at  the level of the area of government.  + The quality of public services is measured by means  of various methodologies and solutions which do  not allow for comparisons. The quality of services  is often measured manually or left unmeasured,  since it is regarded as an additional obligation and  expense, rather than something of value. A catalogue  of public services has been created to measure and  compare services but it has limited functionality and  finds little use. Therefore, data are mostly updated  in the catalogue only once a year during a special  campaign. In addition, it does not include all services  and institutions.  + Due to all these reasons, there is no clear  understanding of the quality of services within  public sector institutions or all across the country.  Decisions concerning the development of services  are based more on subjective perceptions than actual  (monitoring) data.    21 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Activities:  Results:  + All public services are human-centric – designed  and provided on the basis of users and their needs  and preferences, while guaranteeing their fundamental  rights. The needs of people with poorer digital skills or  special needs as well as foreigners residing in Estonia  and e-residents are taken into account.  + The practices of service design, development and  management are at a high level across the public  sector. All public services are measured and monitored  in a comparable way throughout the country. Decisions  concerning service development are made on the basis  of (monitoring) data.  + Every public service has a substantive owner  who is responsible for the day-to-day development  and quality of the service, including measuring and  monitoring it. In addition, the services are centrally  developed and the portfolio is managed in every  ministry.  + The central catalogue of public services is easy to  use and data are forwarded automatically.   Data of higher quality have enabled comparison  of services and their quality across the country.  Furthermore, abundant tools are available to the  owners of services.  + We develop and introduce a  common standard for user-  centric services which includes the  design, development, management   and measurement of services.  + We create and provide  service owners with service  management tools; among   others, we make the state-wide  central catalogue of services   easy to use.  + We promote the   removal of obstacles in the   development of cross-border  services on the EU internal market.   We invest in the cross-border  availability of Estonian digital services   and participate in relevant joint  initiatives, especially in the framework   of Nordic cooperation and   within the EU.  + We introduce the  practice of measuring   services and a common  methodology in public   sector institutions.  + We further develop the  role, knowledge and skills   of service owners and  coordinators and service   management in public sector  institutions.  + We invest in improving the  user-centricity and accessibility of  services, including the development  of digital services for e-residents as   a special focus.    22 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  2. Data-driven governance and reuse of data  Current situation:  + The possibilities of data analysis are far from being  sufficiently used for decision-making in governance.  Uneven data literacy among managers and specialists  is one of the reasons behind it, i.e. the inability to see  data as the source of answers. Another reason is the  fact that even though a large amount of data has been  collected in digital government over the years, their  findability and quality are points of concern.  + The overview of data collected by state authorities  and local governments is insufficient. It is available  in databases but even there the descriptions of data  are uneven and the timeliness or meaning of data  is frequently difficult to identify. The tools meant  for managing data descriptions are not sufficiently  implemented. This makes the reuse of data more  difficult and is the reason why the ‘once-only’  principle has not been consistently implemented. The  opportunities related to ‘linked data’ which would  enable us to make advances in the development of  service design and provision have not been used.  + The quality and degree of development of data  management, including responsibility, organisation and  competences, are highly uneven among institutions.  The content and quality of too little data can be  determined. There are many procedural systems but  the data are based on statements almost everywhere  and it may happen that they are not trusted by other  data users and are therefore insufficiently reused. The  data life cycle has not been implemented; therefore,  destruction deadlines are not observed systematically  and inspected unnecessary data are not destroyed.  + Legal and information security restrictions are applied  to the cross-usage and reuse of data, particularly  in connection with personal data. Technology itself  should be implemented more to reuse these and  other sensitive data to a greater extent but securely  and privately: so-called privacy technology21 solutions  should be developed, tested and adopted. First steps  have been taken in Estonia for this purpose, albeit  slowly.  + Many public sector institutions still exchange (digital)  documents instead of machine-readable data and the  primary focus is on structured data. This hinders the  introduction of machine learning and modern data  analytics.  + There is an insufficient overview of the raw data  of state decisions and analyses and of calculations,  decreasing the transparency of the state. Changing this  would help restrict the spread of misinformation.  Results:  + We make all the decisions of the state using high- quality data. The findability, quality and speed of use of  data provide decision-makers with analytical support  and make processes more efficient.  + There is an updated and complete overview of data  at the level of databases and datasets. Data can be  linked to one another. The ‘once-only’ and data reuse  principles22 are applied.  + The reuse of personal and sensitive data in service  provision and decision-making increases significantly  with the implementation of privacy technologies.  + The public sector uses data in a transparent manner.  The basic data of public sector decisions and analyses,  and calculations are published as much as possible.    23 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Activities:  + We develop the legal  space for the purposes   of data science and  analytics, including  relevant instructions.  + We develop the  competence of data   science and analytics  and their use in the   public sector.  + We develop the competence and  organisation of data governance and   introduce best practices in all public  sector institutions. We create and   offer necessary tools, including for the  adoption of linked data.  + We develop an interinstitutional  data governance and data science  competence centre to gather and  make available relevant know-how   and offer support to institutions.  + We develop further and expand  the use of the administrative   system of the technical services  and databases of the state   information system, which ensures  an updated overview of data and   the state information system.  + We support and, where  necessary, initiate EU and   international activities  promoting cross-border and   global data sharing and reuse  among states and sectors.  + We develop and introduce  a system of guaranteeing the  transparency of the source  data of state decisions and   analyses, and of calculations.  + We initiate and  carry out a national  privacy technology   implementation  programme.    24 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  3. Future-proof digital government platforms  68% of Estonian residents would prefer it if   all digital services were accessible in a   single central state portal.   Current situation:  + One of the foundations and success factors of the  Estonian digital government has been development  based on strong platforms, i.e. central infrastructure  components and services. This has sped up the  development and introduction of digital services  throughout the country and society. Existing platforms  must constantly be adapted to the development of  technology and the needs of users, and developed  further.  + Digital identity is a good example here. Identity  cards and Mobile-ID have withstood the test of time  so far and are the safest eID carriers but users prefer  simpler solutions. Their usability is also influenced  by the development of user interfaces and devices,  which makes it more difficult to rely on a separately  issued physical medium or request special devices for  users. Technology provides access to potential new  options for authentication and signing, for instance by  means of biometrics. eID is an important enabler of  international business and cross-border services but  its implementation at the EU level is still in early stages.  The basic software of eID must be compatible with  primary software and hardware platforms for our digital  services to function but these solutions are constantly  updated.  + The X-Road23 is a long-term mandatory data  exchange layer of digital government. Making the  X-Road compatible with the world of cloud computing  and big data or establishing it as a cornerstone of  AI-powered services is a challenge to be tackled  when future-proofing the X-Road. At the same time,  the X-Road is used more and more widely across the  world. Estonia has joined forces and combined its  resources with Finland to develop this core technology,  establishing a relevant consortium called NIIS24. This  makes it easier to find solutions.  + 68% of Estonian residents would prefer it if all  digital services were accessible in a single central  state portal. However, the development of the state  portal has been project-based and several attempts  of relaunching it have been left unfinished. In a world  based on search engines or Bürokratt, the state portal  still has a place as a single back-up platform for the  information and services of the state. In addition, the  state portal does not meet the needs of entrepreneurs  at the moment, so they do not have a single service  channel. When looking towards the future, eesti.ee has  been determined as a reference point for Estonia in  developing the single European digital gateway, which  creates a basic cross-border interoperability of digital  services at the EU level.    25 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Activities:  + Based on eesti.ee, an initial version of a state digital  mailbox has been created but it currently functions as a  voluntary address for forwarding e-mails. Solutions for  a central delivery service are being developed.  + In order to make digital government function better  and more (cost-)efficiently, other common needs can  be met by means of platform solutions or services but  the creation and development of platforms has not  been consciously managed. Platform services have not  been provided at an evenly high and sustainable level.  Results:  + The basic platforms of the Estonian digital  government are future-proof: they are sustainable and  change flexibly according to the changing needs of  users and technological possibilities.  + The Estonian national digital identity does not have  a physical medium and it can be used in all common  devices and environments, including all over Europe.  + The X-Road is still better for domestic and  international data exchange than its alternatives when  it comes to quality and compatibility.  + Eesti.ee is an updated service and information  gateway for private persons and entrepreneurs, and  also a single contact point in cross-border operations.  + All notices and documents that need to be forwarded  are delivered by default via the state mailbox and are  always accessible to people.  + The common needs of state authorities and sectors  have been met by means of platforms and the  management of platform services is at a high level.  + We develop the eesti.ee  state portal further, including  as a joint service channel for  entrepreneurs and a single  point of contact for the EU   digital gateway.  + We continue to develop  the core software of the  X-Road and promote its   domestic use.  + We support the joint   development and reuse of digital   government platforms in the EU and  Nordic countries, especially for promoting   cross-border data exchange. We  ensure the compatibility of the Estonian  digital government with the European   interoperability framework and contribute  to the further development of this   framework.  + We implement and   update the action plan concerning  digital identity. Based on this, we   continue to develop the national digital  identity, its carriers, basic software and  applications in order to move towards   a convenient and secure manner of  identification without    using tools.  + We prepare, implement  and constantly update a   development plan for new  platform services. We improve  the quality of the management   of platform services.  + We develop a   state mailbox and legalise it as  the main channel for delivering   notices and documents from the  state instead of letters    on paper.  + We contribute to the legal  space of digital identity and  digital signatures in the EU,   and the further development of  interoperability and common   solutions to increase   cross-border usability.    26 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  4. Centrally provided basic IT services  Current situation:  + The provision of a number of standardised IT  services, such as computer workstations and server  hosting services, has been organised separately in  each area of government. The competences in the  provision of these services and their quality are uneven  and it is difficult to combine services, which hampers  cooperation between authorities and the reorganisation  of tasks in the course of state reform. The level, volume  and capacity of outsourcing services to the private  sector is uneven.  + Standard IT services are too costly for the state in  their current dispersed state. At the same time, the  technological and financial sustainability of digital  government is a more general point of concern,  encouraging us to look for opportunities to increase  efficiency. Servers, data centers, licenses and qualified  staff are required for every new digital government  service.  + A large part of the core infrastructure of digital  government is not state-of-the art; for example,  modern cloud solutions and opportunities to link to the  common infrastructure of the EU are underused. Cloud  competency is poor in the public sector. Furthermore,  the implementation of modern cloud services in  information systems or the readiness to do that is  lacking. The quality of public services is therefore also  reduced (e.g. availability and accessibility at peak times).  + A data embassy25 pilot project has been implemented  in digital government, ensuring the secure storage of  data which are vital for the functioning of the state  outside its territory. The functionality of the data  embassy has been minimal so far and it does not  function as an extension of quickly switchable public  server infrastructure yet.  + Access rights, roles and identity management are  unevenly dispersed across administrative fields in  digital government and are not compatible, hindering  the use of services beyond single administrative fields.  This also causes security risks because there is no  overview of who has access to various systems and  whether access rights change upon changes in the role  of a person.  + Although the provision of public communications  services has been consolidated, it has been  undermanaged and the quality of services has not met  the expectations of users. The future directions for the  development of public communications (the concept)  have been determined and await implementation.    27 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Activities:  Results:  + Standardised IT services are centrally provided. As  a result, the quality of services related to computer  workstations and server hosting, including the user  experience of public sector employees, has improved  (making joint work easier). In addition, the provision  of these services is more (cost-)efficient and the  introduction of modern technologies is quicker.  Standard services are outsourced to the private sector  to a greater extent.  + Digital government is in the cloud: every new  development is designed to be cloud-native and all  older digital services have been transferred to cloud  infrastructure, unless contradicting information security.   + The data embassy functions as a complete service  and can be used as a technical extension of critical  digital services in the case of major interruptions.  + Digital government infrastructure is compatible with  EU and other international cross-border initiatives, e.g.  the infrastructure for cloud and blockchain services.  + Rights and roles have been determined in a uniform  manner in digital government. Changes of user roles  in decentralised systems are made uniformly and  according to similar principles across the country.  + Public communications services are guaranteed to  users at a sufficient level (including availability, integrity,  confidentiality, coverage, data speed and volume).  + We consolidate the provision of  computer workstation and server   hosting services, so that it is organised  by a single competency centre across  the public sector in order to ensure the  best possible quality and cost-efficiency  of the base layer of digital government  services. In relation to that we introduce  integrated administration of central roles   and rights management.  + We launch a digital  government marketplace26   in order to outsource standard  services and software solutions  to the private sector uniformly,   more broadly and quickly.  + We adopt cloud solutions  in the public sector as a  whole, also combining   public and private solutions  according to needs and   opportunities.  + We cooperate at the  EU level and invest in the   interoperability of our digital  government infrastructure   with the common EU  infrastructure.  + We implement  and update the data   embassy action plan.  + We implement the concept  of developing public   communications: we build  capacity with regard to managing   public communications and  improve the quality of services.    28 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  5. Systematic experimentation with new ways  Activities:  Current situation:  + Even though Estonia is esteemed as a digital country  in the world, our attention and resources are largely  directed to the management and development of  existing digital services. As a result, the proportion  of new approaches, technologies and experiments,  i.e. disruptive innovation27 in digital government has  decreased.  + There is no systematic development of new skills or  mapping of technological development in the public  sector. At the same time, the private and academic  sectors offer knowledge and solutions which could be  more broadly deployed in the development of digital  government, including in the rapidly growing Estonian  start-up community.  Results:  + New technology and approaches are eagerly  adopted in the Estonian digital government: Estonia is  a pioneer in the world when it comes to implementing  new solutions. We address and resolve major social  and economic concerns in an entirely innovative way.  + Estonia is one of the first countries to test the  possible use and value of emerging technologies28  in the ecosystem of digital government and the  development of digital services.  + The public sector collaborates to a greater extent  and more systematically with the academic and private  sector to create new knowledge and competences.  The Estonian technology community is more  competent in developing digital government owing to  this.  + We initiate and fund pilot projects,  promote relevant innovation-related   cooperation with the private sector and  participate in international initiatives  where possible. Among others, we   launch mission-based29 initiatives for the  adoption of entirely innovative solutions.  + We increase and coordinate the  commissioning of digital government-  related research and development  activities across the country and   disseminate and put to use their results.  Among others, we carry out systematic   monitoring of the development and  adoption of technology.  + We initiate and implement  programmes for the adoption   of new technologies that  have a significant impact, and  participate in joint initiatives at   the EU level.    29 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  6. Open innovation30 and development of govtech community  development  of govtech  community  Current situation:  + The technical components and developments  of digital government are largely non-transparent  between administrative fields and for the private  sector. Too little is known of what already exists or is  being developed in the public or private sector, what is  duplicated or what lacks the necessary synergy.  + The current manner of developing digital government  and the organisation of service management in the  public sector restrict the private sector’s opportunities  of providing components and services which the state  could outsource instead of developing and managing  them. The private sector community using digital  government developments is small, which hampers  competition and the spread of competence.  + Separate working environments which are  incompatible or do not meet the state’s expectations  are used within the public sector and when partnering  with the private sector. Expectations and requirements  regarding developments are fragmented and  insufficiently communicated, rendering cooperation  and developments inefficient.  + The services and components developed for digital  government find little reuse. The solutions that have  been created for digital government so far, particularly  business services and related information systems, are  exportable to a very limited extent.  + The amount of open data has been rapidly increasing  in recent years, but making them available has not  become a widespread everyday practice, nor do they  find much reuse.  Results:  + The quality of Estonian digital services has been  taken to a new level in cooperation with the private  sector: the private sector makes a major contribution to  digital government innovation with joint developments,  sectoral links and complete solutions.  + The govtech community is active and growing.  Participants use tools that ensure the required  information security and allow for flexible cooperation  at the same time.  + There is a transparent, exhaustive and updated  overview of digital government services and technical  components, relevant requirements and frameworks.    30 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + We expand the govtech  community, in other words the  information field and the circle  of foreign experts involved in  development, relevant joint  activities and information   exchange.  + We introduce modern   architectural principles and patterns   which enhance reuse and support scaling   in the architecture of digital government. Among   others, we adopt the approach of event-driven   microservices and domain-driven design31 as well as   the API-first principle32.  + We promote cooperation   and forms of cooperation with the   private sector (including start-ups and   foreign companies), and outsource more   solutions as full services.  + We establish a single  information space for publishing  the principles of the development  of digital government services and   technology, including a development and  interoperability framework that provides   guidelines. We keep the information  space and frameworks updated.  + We adopt and continue  to develop tools and platforms   for reuse and cooperation, including  a technical services and database   management system (the current RIHA),  a code repository33 and artifactory34,   collaborative applications, etc.  + We implement and  constantly update the action plan   for the reuse of data with the aim of  supporting the improved accessibility and   reuse of data, including the use of confidential  data for scientific purposes, the availability   of open data and consent-based data  processing.  Activities:  + Separate software developed for digital government   which is funded using taxpayers’ money and includes   intellectual property of the public sector is published   with an open source license – as long as it is not   significant with regard to national security.  + The development of digital government relies on an   architectural principles that allow for reuse. Solutions   created for the Estonian state based on this can be   adapted more easily both with regard to business and   technology (including by means of cloud technology),   increasing the export of digital government solutions.  + All machine-readable open data are available and   reused as actively as possible.    31 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  7. Empowering digital change in public sector  The continued  development of   technology keeps  creating new  opportunities  Current situation:  + Paper-based service provision has been replaced  with digital services in Estonia but we can put digital  solutions to even better use to improve public services  and provide them more efficiently. Large-scale digital  changes still have to be made in a number of fields:  using digital possibilities, we can reform the logic  behind the functioning of public administration and  services.  + We lack the knowledge and skills required for the  initiation and successful completion of more substantial  digital changes. The competences of public sector  employees which are required for digital management  and development have not been systematically  increased or taken into account in recruitment  decisions.  + Another problematic issue is the uneven level of  the adoption of digital services and solutions among  local governments. There is a shortage of funds and  people, making it impossible to do it at an equally  good level separately in every city and municipality.  The establishment of a single centre of competence  on the basis of the Association of Estonian Cities  and Municipalities has been launched to create  and implement a common digital strategy of local  governments but the capacity and tasks of this entity  are still limited.  + The continued development of technology  keeps creating new opportunities of taking current  information systems and services to a new level.  In addition, new business needs keep emerging  due to policies and the evolution of the state, e.g. in  connection with overcoming cross-sectoral barriers  to development. Therefore, it pays off to continuously  develop and invest in digital government services and  solutions  + Keeping existing information systems and IT  infrastructure up to date presents another challenge,  and consistent attention and investments are required  to update and maintain them.  + In order to maintain the sustainability of the  established digital government and introduce new  solutions in the best way possible, it is practical to  join forces across the state and share experiences  and solutions with one another. Common guidelines  and requirements must also be in place to ensure  interoperability, avoid duplication and make sure that  the solutions being created have the best possible  technological basis. There have been renewed  attempts to strengthen the management of the state  information system and its architecture in recent years  but only the first steps have been taken.    32 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + We carry out  a reform for   the sustainable  funding of digital   government.  + We support the   development of a centre   of IT competence for local  governments and the   implementation of the IT strategy  at the level of local governments   through it.  + We support   the implementation   of digital changes in public   sector institutions with consultation   and funding. The focus is on programmes of   large-scale digital changes in various fields, state-  wide joint developments and the updating or   redevelopment of legacy systems that reduce   the quality of digital government.  + We promote the  knowledge and skills required  for the development of digital   government in the public sector at  the level of managers and specialists   as well as basic knowledge and  special skills.  + We manage  the development of   digital government architecture  and organise cooperation within the   community. + Among others, we establish  and continue to update a single information   space for the principles of the development of  digital government services and technology,   which includes a development and  interoperability frameworks that provide   guidelines.  Activities:  Results:  + Digital government is maintained sustainably:  important information systems are up to date and  continue to be developed; relevant consistent funding  is guaranteed. At the same time, a new wave of digital  transformation has taken place in various fields (new  large-scale changes have been launched and carried  out). Among other things, the quality and sustainability  of the digital services of local governments has  improved.  + We have the competences, support and funds  required for bold and needed digital changes and the  development and maintenance of services. The focus  has shifted to the creation of value and especially to  user-centricity and user experience, including cross- sectoral cooperation for this purpose. However, efforts  are also still made to increase efficiency.  + The directions of the development of digital  government are known throughout the public sector  and work is carried out to follow them in a uniform  manner across the country. The functioning of digital  government is based on common principles, and  interoperable and compatible solutions (technologies).    33 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  8. Targeted international cooperation  + Where necessary  and possible, we support the   Estonian IT sector with the export  of digital government solutions, and   state authorities in the field of business  diplomacy by sharing content   knowledge to other countries and  providing state experts.  + We participate in  the forms of cooperation of   OECD and Digital Nations for the  purpose of knowledge exchange   and launch joint initiatives with  the countries at the forefront of   the development of digital  government.  Activities:  + We participate in the forms  of cooperation, policy-making and   law-making of the EU and Nordic countries  according to the development needs of   digital government. The focus is on promoting  cross-border interoperability and ensuring the   compatibility of common solutions and the  architecture of digital government.  Current situation:  + Estonia is expected and wanted in all international  cooperation formats in the field of digital technology  and an esteemed contributor to international policy- making. Due to limited resources we have to choose  where, on which topic, to which extent and how  actively we participate, both in the European Union and  elsewhere in the world.  + People and companies operate internationally but  still have to endure paper-based procedures – in the  EU and among the Nordic countries as well as at a  bilateral level, cross-border exchange of data and  services have remained limited to pilot projects and  individual initiatives. First and foremost, cross-border  interoperability, including common approaches and  supporting platforms, should be developed for this  purpose.  + Estonia has learned from the successful and  unsuccessful digitalisation experiences of other  countries. It has allowed us to take over good ideas and  solutions and improve policy-making but it also needs  purposeful activities in conditions where resources are  limited.  + The entire world is highly interested in the  experiences and solutions of the Estonian digital   government, opening up opportunities of exporting  knowledge and solutions for Estonian experts and  entrepreneurs. It is often useful or necessary that  the state contributes in the early stages of the sales  process by introducing its achievements and the actors  in the sector.  Results:  + The trends and volumes of external cooperation are  in accordance with the objectives and needs of the  development of digital government.  + Estonian digital solutions are interoperable with  European trends. Estonian residents and entrepreneurs  can carry out the main procedures digitally and at once  when travelling or doing business in the European  Union, including the Nordic countries and the Baltic  region – there are more and more cross-border  services.  + Best global practices and new trends are always  taken into account in digital government-related policy- making.  + The export of Estonian digital government solutions  and consultation services grows with the help of  ‘opening doors’.    34 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Target based on the general objective:  By 2030, ultrafast, reliable and affordable  telecommunications connections are available in  Estonia irrespective of your location, making it  possible to create and use innovative services. This sub-objective is directly related to the implementation of one of the axes of the vision of digital society:   creating an impressive way of life. As has been stated above, the vision sets out that services should be convenient   and available all over Estonia, which is why relevant (telecommunications) connections are needed.  The digital power of the economy, in turn, depends on the development of connectivity. The better the   connections, the more digital solutions, products and services can serve as vehicles for development in various   sectors and across Estonia. The quality and availability of connections also determines whether conditions are   favourable for the creation of future solutions in Estonia and whether people from other countries come here with   the same aspirations.  II sub-objective.  Connectivity  metric: The proportion of Estonian households and companies who are able to access an Internet   connection of at least 100 Mbit/s which can be increased up to 1 Gbit/s.  58%  100%  Current situation   (2021)  Objective for   2030  The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority measures the results once a year.    35 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  1. Up-to-date and forward-looking legal space  Trends in connectivity  + We carry out  consistent and efficient   supervision of the  functioning of the market  + We make the  frequency resources,   which have been agreed on  internationally and are freed up   domestically, available to market  participants as quickly as  possible on the basis of   competitions  + We shape and  represent the positions   of Estonia in the discussions  held in the European Union   and the International  Telecommunications Union  + We promote  innovative investment   and cooperation models for  developing communication   infrastructure  Activities:  Current situation:  + The single market communication regulation at the  EU level sets a clear framework for the competition- based functioning of the Estonian communications  market. Regulation must be consistent and legally  certain: this turns Estonia into an attractive investment  environment which, in turn, promotes the more  rapid and efficient construction of communication  infrastructure with a very high capacity35. The prices  of mobile communications services are affordable.  There are three major cable network operators and  three mobile telephone operators and a number of  smaller regional telecommunications companies on the  Estonian communications market. A highly competitive  retail services market proves that newcomers can  easily enter the communication services market.  + On the European and global scale, the Estonian  communications market is small in terms of the  number of consumers, which may lead to unexpected  reorganisation or consolidation and in the end decrease  efficient competition if unfavourable economic and  regulatory circumstances coincide.  + The experience of collectively developing a  base network of high-speed Internet has provided  favourable presumptions for the use of similar models  in the future.  + As a limited natural resource, the 3400-3800 MHz,  694-790 MHz and 24.25-27.5 GHz frequency bands  (the so-called 5G frequencies) can be adopted in  mobile communications as a next step. The possible  use of the 40.5-43.5 GHz and 66-71 GHz frequency  bands can be specified.  Results:  + The interests of the state and market participants  have been taken into account when shaping the  legal space, so that the regulatory environment stays  as stable as possible and the market develops in a  balanced manner. Among others, cooperation in  building core infrastructure is promoted, also in market  failure areas.  + Frequency resources required for the rapid  development of the mobile network and the creation of  new services have been allocated to the market quickly  and efficiently.  + The decisions adopted by the European Union and  the International Telecommunications Union are in  accordance with Estonia’s interests.    36 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  2. Development of access networks  + We support the  development of very high   capacity access networks in rural  areas where telecommunications  companies do not invest under the   conditions of competition.  Activities:  Current situation:  + In addition to networks established by  telecommunications operators, a broadband backhaul  network of 7000 km has been created with state  support, evenly covering the entire country. It is  available to all telecommunications companies  and state authorities on an equal basis and at  affordable prices in order to improve the availability of  communication services and the affordability of joining  networks in rural areas.  + All three mobile networks offer adequate average  and maximum speeds across Estonia which are  sufficient for using modern services. The upload and  download speeds of mobile Internet have increased by  70% on average within the last two years in Estonia.  + Estonia is currently below the average of the EU  with regard to the availability of fixed broadband  subscriptions in rural areas and the adoption of  ultra-fast broadband. The importance of a modern  communications network has increased and will  continue to increase in connection with remote working  and learning due to the coronavirus pandemic.  + As of 2021, there are an estimated 120,000  households and companies without a fast fixed  connection in rural areas. More than 45,000 of them  will get a fibre-optic access network by the end of  2023 which is in line with the 2025 Gigabit Society  targets of the EU. Nevertheless, at least 75,000  addresses remain in market failure areas, i.e. the ‘white  area’, which require investments made by the state in  cooperation with telecommunications companies.  Results:  + Opportunities to join access networks have been  established for all companies and authorities as well as  households that are inhabited throughout the year in  rural areas.  + Households, companies and authorities that have  joined an access network can use and ultra-fast (at  least 100 Mbit/s) broadband connection which can be  increased up to 1 Gbit/s.    37 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  3. Development of 5G and 6G core infrastructure  + We support the  coverage of selected   residential and business  areas with 5G.  + We make the  necessary preparations for the   adoption of 6G when the relevant  technology arrives on the market. We  support reaching an agreement on the  legal framework and support measures  of the adoption of 6G at the EU level as   soon as possible.  + We support the  establishment of core   infrastructure in the main  transport corridors in Estonia,   allowing for uninterrupted 5G  coverage.  Activities of the  development plan:  Current situation:  + The existing core infrastructure including broadband  backhaul networks and the towers connected to them  provides a good basis for necessary investments  in additional infrastructure and services in order  to take a new leap in the development of mobile  communications.  + The widespread adoption of smart networks requires  considerable investments from telecommunications  companies, not only in connection with specific 5G/6G  infrastructure, but also additions to the backhaul  network and base stations. In order to make use of the  potential of technology, it is important that services are  not merely made available as pilot projects, but are also  widely accessible in areas where business investments  do not promise quick profits.  + Balanced regional development and the availability  of modern services may be hampered if there is no  very high capacity broadband infrastructure and  5G coverage outside larger cities. At the same time,   investing in new core infrastructure outside larger cities  is not financially beneficial for telecommunications  companies in the short term. ‘White areas’ can still  be found along the primary movement corridors of  people, i.e. the main and secondary roads.  + At the moment there is no specific timeframe  concerning the arrival of the next generation of mobile  communications, i.e. 6G, but it can be assumed that it  will begin at least before 2030.  Results:  + The entire Estonia is covered by 5G. 5G core  infrastructure has been built by the state in cooperation  with telecommunications companies in market failure  areas, allowing for the adoption of new technologies.  + When 6G arrives on the market, Estonia is ready to  adopt these networks.    38 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  4. Development of new content and business services  newest technologies  are meant for the   provision of services  at a new level  + We support the  planning, analysis and   development of services  that attract widespread   public interest.  + We participate in  the work of international  organisations with the  purpose of protecting   Internet freedom.  + We support  the activities of the   development networks  of innovative services.  Activities of the  development plan:  Current situation:  + While 4G and early 5G services focused on  consumer applications, newest technologies are meant  for the provision of services at a new level (including  communications and business services). The advances  in the adoption of 5G and 6G are no longer viewed in  terms of adding and counting connections. Instead, the  success of their adoption is determined by the number  and spread of content and business services (i.e. cases  of use).  + Solutions concerning the environment, energy,  the industry of smart regions, connected mobility,  communications security, social services and  healthcare as well as free broadcasting may be of  interest to Estonia. In other words, Estonia may gain  economic and social advantages by developing use  cases in these areas.  + Estonia has the opportunity to be a pioneer by  innovating content and business services based on new  broadband technologies. Estonia would be able to take  advantage of global 5G trends and support structural  changes primarily in the areas of use of 5G business  services.  + The protection and upholding of the principles of  Internet freedom continues to be important in Estonia  in order to ensure the availability of modern content  and business services.  Results:  + Content and business services with significant public  influence are in daily use, resolving important social and  economic problems.  + The level of Internet freedom remains high in Estonia.    39 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  The cyber security sub-objective makes a direct contribution to the implementation of the vision of digital society   2030, since the aim is to guarantee the protection of our digital government, economy and digital way of life   more broadly. In a safe environment, we can make bold advances in our digital development: the development   of services, the digital transformation in the economy and the creation of future solutions. The cyber security   sub-objective thus consistently supports the entire vision, also keeping in mind and promoting national security   interests.  III sub-objective.   Cyber security  Target based on the general objective:  The Estonian cyberspace is safe and reliable.  metric: Estonia’s cyberspace is resilient to cyberthreats and trusted. For this purpose, we assess the state of two aspects or metrics:  1. 2.  Service providers (within the meaning of the Estonian  Cybersecurity Act) have met the requirements of  cyber security at a level with no considerable potential  damage.  Current situation: starting level unknown. The metric  is being developed. The first result should be available  in 2022 (we will add the metric to the calculation of the  general objective once it has been developed and we  have the first result).  The use of digital services has not been avoided due to  the existence of security risks.  Current situation: starting level (2019): 96.2%  Objective for 2030: above or equal to 96%  Metric: Internet users in the age of 16-74 who have  refrained from communicating with public sector  institutions or service providers via the Internet due  to security risks in the last 12 months (Statistics  Estonia, IT 44). The inverse response is used as the  metric: the result is the number of people who have  not refrained from communication. The result is  measured by Statistics Estonia. Results have been  measured at an interval of a couple of years so far. The  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications will  commission a measurement once a year from now on.    40 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  1. Relevant national cyber security set-up  Trends in cyber security  Activities:                     + Where   necessary, we carry  out an organisational   restructuring based on the  updated national cyber security   administration model.                   + We amend and   specify legal acts, contracts,  crisis-response plans and other   regulatory documents, which set  out the roles, responsibility, tasks and   cooperative relations of authorities  and organisations.                    + We constantly  analyse changes   in digital trends and  cyberthreats and their impact  on cyber security in Estonia and   its organisation.                   + We prepare and   update a cyber security  administration model based   on risk analyses, determining the  roles, responsibilities and tasks of   authorities and organisations with a  national cyber security function.  Current situation:  + The responsibility for ensuring cyber security is  largely decentralised in Estonia. All information system  owners and electronic service providers must take  care of the security of their systems and incident  management on their own and have the abilities  required for that. At the same time, the cyber security  field is increasingly specialised and owners of systems  find it very difficult to obtain all the competences  required for the protection of their systems. It creates  an excessive burden for them and reduces the level of  cyber security.  + Some tasks related to guaranteeing cyber security  are centralised. For instance, these include cyberspace  monitoring and safety warnings, the development  of the standard of information security measures,  supervision and policy-making, etc. In addition, certain  state functions are centralised, such as the investigation  of cybercrime, crisis management and cyber  operations for the purposes of national defence.  + In order to ensure that the cyber security field is  coordinated, a system involving a leading ministry and  a cyber security authority is implemented. The leading  ministry in the field of national cyber security is the  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications  (MEAC) and the cyber security authority is the  Information System Authority (RIA). The Ministry of  the Interior and its subsidiary bodies are responsible  for investigating cybercrime and ensuring internal  security. The Ministry of Defence and the authorities  in its area of government are assigned cyber security   tasks related to national defence. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs deals with cyber diplomacy. This  general management system has evolved over the  years but the roles, responsibilities and allocation of  work are unclear in a number of cases and insufficiently  regulated by law.  + The roles, responsibilities and tasks related to  ensuring cyber security must be determined according  to current needs and they must be comprehensive.  Changes and growth in cyberthreats and additional  tasks (certification, technology assessment, operational  cooperation, etc.) have to be taken into consideration  when updating the organisation of cyber security.  + The current arrangements for resolving cyber  incidents and crises must be supplemented. Various  incidents and situations (including COVID-19) have  highlighted shortcomings in the national crisis  management system. For example, the tasks and  responsibilities of various levels are unclear, ranging  from the institutions and public authorities influenced  by the incident to the responsible ministry of the field  and the Government of the Republic.  Results:  + A clear, comprehensive national cyber security  administration model that meets the needs of Estonia  (including risks and trends) is in place.  + The responsibility and tasks of authorities and  organisations have been appropriately laid down in  existing legal acts.    41 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  2. Analysis capacity for trends, risks and impacts  cyber security must  support innovation   and innovation  must support cyber   security  Current situation:  + In order to ensure the sustainable development  of digital society and the safe implementation of  innovation, we have to improve our understanding  of global trends and the development of technology.  This means that we must be able to understand the  risks associated with technology and their impact,  and develop risk management measures. Cyber  security must support innovation and innovation must  support cyber security. More attention must be paid to  accomplishing it than has been done so far.  + Information system owners are responsible for  mitigating risks related to their information systems and  services. A number of authorities and organisations  support the compilation of risk assessments and the  development of security measures with analyses and  instructions: the Information System Authority, security  authorities, educational and research institutions and  national and international centres of competence. The  capacity to constantly analyse the situation needs  to be developed in order to update existing security  requirements and prepare practical recommendations  and instructions for information system owners. This  also requires the development of a relevant basic  competence, among others at academic institutions.  + The analysis of the trends, risks and impacts of  digital society is not carried out entirely proactively and  systematically yet. Developments in the field of artificial  intelligence, cloud technology, robotics, augmented  reality, communication technology, the Internet of  things and many other technological trends bring along  with them changes which we need to prepare for. Our  analysis capacity is still insufficient for an appropriate  interpretation of the impacts of global developments  in the Estonian context and the development of  necessary security measures.  Results:  + Decision-makers, policy-makers and the owners  of networks and information systems have a good  situational awareness of the trends and risks of global  digital development and cyber security and their  impact on Estonia.  + Risks have been thought through and mitigated  when planning and implementing digital innovation.  + We can develop and implement cyber security  measures that are suitable or the Estonian context  quickly enough, among others by engaging the  competences of various authorities, companies and  experts.    42 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + In order to support policy- making related to cyber security,  we establish a network-based   think tank which takes technological,  security policy, economic, foreign policy  and other relevant aspects into account   in its prospective assessments and  recommendations.   + We increase the  capacity of academic   institutions and development  centres in implementing cyber  security-related research and   development projects of  national importance.                      + We establish a   work process for security   considerations in planning   digital innovation.                  + strategic risks   related to the reliability  of technology which may   have an impact on society via  the use of and dependence on   technology.  + We establish sustainable   arrangements for defining and   funding the research and development   needs, programmes and projects of cyber   security. We develop and implement a   national plan concerning research and   development activities related to   cyber security.  + We increase the capacity   of the public sector in assessing   the cyber security situation and risks and   developing security measures across the   state and in various sectors. We also   increase the relevant awareness   and competence.                     + ensuring the   security of the basic  services and platforms of the  Estonian digital government,  and artificial intelligence and   cloud computing;  Activities:  In the aforementioned activities,   we pay more attention to and   focus on:  + We support  an increase in funding   for research and development  and joint actions related to   cyber security at the EU level and  actively participate in them in order  to collectively generate and share   knowledge in the EU.    43 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Current situation:  + The current cyber security capacity of the state is  insufficient for preventing and reducing the risks that  endanger networks and information systems. The  consistent growth and development of cyberthreats  creates the need of rapidly developing our preventative  capacity, and improving the monitoring and supervision  of its implementation.  + The implementation of cyber security measures is  costly in the case of a decentralised administration  model. Authorities and organisations need similar  resources (experts, tools) to exercise their cyber security  functions, which makes it more expensive to guarantee  cyber security. Not all authorities have sufficient  capacity for procuring specific competences and taking  measures at an adequate level due to limited resources.  + Cyber incidents occur and we have to be ready for  them. The Estonian digital ecosystem has an extremely  complex infrastructure, rendering it financially  impractical to implement all kinds of preventive  security measures. The use of security measures must  be optimised and residual risks must be taken into  account. This means that it is not possible to prevent  all incidents. Instead, if they occur, we have to quickly  identify them, respond and resolve them.  + The capacity for managing and resolving cyber  incidents and crises is insufficient, considering the  digital dependence of the Estonian state. The crisis  management system faces greater demands due  to the growth in the number of cyberthreats and  incidents. This concerns both organisational capacity  and the use of cyber security products and services.  Cyber security tools supporting the monitoring of  networks and information systems, the development of  a situational picture and the management of incidents  must be constantly updated and improved.  + There is a shortage of competent cyber security  experts. The field of digitalisation and cyber security  is more and more specialised. The increasingly rapid  development of various technologies, such as cloud  computing, artificial intelligence, cryptosystems, the  Internet of things, robotics, augmented reality, etc.  creates a need for specialised experts. It is required for  national policies, the development of security measures  and profitable international cooperation.  + It is challenging to be an internationally trailblazing  and leading country in the ever-changing and  specialising field of cyber security. Estonia’s good  reputation derives from the successful use of digital  possibilities, accompanied by the skilful provision of  cyber security. This reputation supports the export  opportunities of companies and contributes to national  security. A high degree of competence (i.e. experts  and practical experience) is required in many fields  in order to be able to direct international processes.  Due to increasing complexity, it is not possible to be  highly competent in all aspects; instead, clear areas of  specialisation must be selected.  Results:  + Measures guaranteeing cyber security have been  taken at the required level which has been determined  in updated legal acts, standards and instructions.  Guaranteeing the continuity, integrity and confidentiality  of important services is the priority.  + The state is capable of promptly resolving crises of  various dimensions and participating in international  crisis management.  + There are enough specialised experts and tools to  implement modern cyber security measures.  + Estonia is a trailblazing and leading country in specific  prioritised fields of cyber security in the EU and at a  broader international level.  3. Increased capacity for maintaining cyber security  The current cyber  security capacity   of the state is  insufficient for   preventing risks.     44 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030     + We increase the capacity  of authorities and organisations   performing public functions and providers  of vital services in taking preventive   measures: creating a safe architecture,  implementing information security standards,  certification, testing (including a considerable   increase in the number of various tests),   auditing, training, consultation    and notification.                     + We increase the   number of specialised  experts in the public sector with   regard to issues that are required for the  provision of a high level of cyber security,   the functioning of basic digital government  services, the implementation of artificial  intelligence and cloud computing and   digital innovation.                       + We determine   and develop as a priority  the fields of cyber security   where Estonia has the greatest  international potential. We take the   initiative at an international level in fields  that are based on national priorities and   substantive strengths.     + We increase the capacity  of government agencies that   participate in the provision of national  cyber security in monitoring and   supervising the cyber security situation.  We develop updated metrics and   mechanisms for assessing the situation  of national cyber security. + We advocate the   provision of cyber security  at a uniformly high level in the   EU and promote cyber security- related cooperation between Member  States in order to manage risks and   increase our joint capacity of responding  to incidents.  + We increase the  capacity of government   agencies that participate in  the provision of national cyber   security in resolving cyber  incidents.               + We organise  national and   international exercises  to practice resolving   incidents.  + We systematise  and consolidate to a   practical extent the functions  of cyber security.  Activities:    45 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  The following is required to achieve the targets of   digital society by 2030:  + The availability of  a sufficient number  of ICT specialists  with an adequate  level, including cyber  specialists, is of critical  importance. The number of ICT specialists must at least double   in the economy by 2030 and the proportion of cyber   specialists must increase among them to achieve   future targets to the extent necessary.  For this purpose, relevant learning opportunities must   constantly be expanded and the quality of learning   must be improved at all levels. Above all, this requires   decisive steps with regard to increasing the volume   and quality of teaching capacity, including ensuring a   sufficient number of teachers.  As the domestic education system does not suffice for   realising our potential, we must make it easy for talents   to come to Estonia – it must be a convenient and   attractive destination.  + In order to take the wider digital transformation in the   economy and public administration to the next level of   digital maturity,   it is important to launch  widespread reskilling  and upskilling initiatives  in connection with  digital skills. This enables specialists of various fields to acquire   required specialised digital knowledge in order to   launch and manage or support digital changes in   their organisations. Furthermore, the development   of (specialised) digital skills must be a natural part of   every level of education. These steps also facilitate the   adaptation of employees to changes in the economy.  In order to implement the vision of digital society 2030, this development plan needs to be supplemented   in other policy fields in a number of ways. According to the procedure for compiling development plans in   Estonia, it is not an obligation automatically conferred on other fields, but rather a request and expectation   in connection with the content and direction of other policy measures, based on the vision of digital society   established in the framework of this development plan. These create the basis for submitting opinions and   coordinating activities between authorities when implementing and updating development plans.  Expectations  concerning  other fields in  implementing  our vision    46 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + The need to address  the wider digital literacy  of the population  persists The need to ‘attract people to the Internet’ is ever   decreasing. Instead, it must be ensured that they have   up-to-date skills to deal with digital solutions in a useful   and safe manner. By 2030, all Estonian adults should   be regular Internet users. This gives us the opportunity   to guarantee their sufficient capabilities, including   a basic level of awareness, so that they can make   even better use of services following the leap in the   development of digital government.   +Within the field  of research and  development activities,  investments have to be  made in increasing the  capacity of research  and development  (R&D) related to the  development of digital  society.  This way, we can find people to create smart solutions   and detect knowledge and solutions that can be   promptly tested and implemented in the state and   economy. The key is to guarantee sufficient funding of   ICT-related R&D.  + The best possible  services need to be  based on good Estonian  language technology,   so that domestic and global service providers can   make their services as convenient as possible for the   members of the Estonian digital society. This requires   increasing investments in basic language technology   solutions.  + Enterprise policies must simultaneously focus on two   targets:   1) supporting digital  transformation in more  traditional sectors (e.g.  industry) by pulling the  necessary levers    - from improving knowledge and skills to supporting   investments (including ensuring a cyber-secure digital   transformation)   2) constantly developing  a technology-based  business environment.      We must establish and guarantee excellent conditions   in Estonia for developing smart products and services,   founding and growing new companies creating such   solutions and attracting relevant foreign talent.  Developing the business environment plays a   significant role in  making Estonia the  easiest place to   conduct business in   the entire world.    As the next leap in our development, it is important to   develop the organisation of real-time economy and   solutions.  + In order to guarantee the development of   the business environment and more broadly   the creation and adoption of new solutions,   law-making must be  flexible in the rapidly  changing world and  quickly respond to  opportunities.  At the same time, legislation must continue to protect   the fundamental rights of people and ensure    the ethical use of data.    47 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  + If public services become more and more invisible, i.e.  proactive and automatic in the state, communication  between people and the state and people’s  understanding of the functioning of the state may  decrease. To avoid this,  the quality of  information services  and the openness of  governance must be  improved. In other words, people must be more and more actively  involved in making public decisions and holding  discussions. Among others, digital solutions can be  smartly used for this purpose, ranging from supporting  the functioning of communities to increasing the  opportunities of participation at national level.  + Using the support activities of business diplomacy  and export, we must continue our efforts to   provide Estonia with  the reputation of an  ambitious and smart  digital society and state  in the world. This opens doors to companies, allowing them to take  their IT solutions to the world, and turns them into  stronger partners in the creation of future solutions for  Estonia. On the other hand, Estonia’s prominence also  determines whether talents and global players   consider Estonia as their next place of residence.  + Social engagement,  coherence and reduction  of division highlighted  in the vision   is only possible if health, welfare and other  development plans aimed at the development of  society focus on an extensive and substantial digital  transformation strategy, the development of content  areas is strongly integrated and implementation is  managed effectively.  + In addition, we    must continue the rapid  digitalisation of our  cultural legacy in the  field of culture,   improve the quality of the creation, preservation and  availability of digital culture and promote the reuse  and cross-usage of digital content. This way, we can  accomplish the vision of promoting Estonian culture in  the digital era.    48 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  Organisation of management  The Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Communications (led by the Minister of  Entrepreneurship and Information Technology as of  2021) as the main body leading the development of  digital society is responsible for implementing the  development plan.  The development plan is implemented by means of  a digital society programme (hereinafter referred to  asthe programme) which includes the development  of digital government, connectivity and cyber security.  The programme sets out the specific objectives  for certain years and the activities required for  accomplishing them together with the responsible  entities, funds and metrics. The programme is prepared  for four years according to the duration of the state  budget strategy and updated once a year.  There are plans to review the development plan  more thoroughly at least twice during this period   and update it in order to take into account the rapidly  changing environment (e.g. the development of  technology) and the success of the activities. The  implementation of the development plan is previously  assessed as one of the bases of the review. The  updates are to be made in the first half of 2024 and by  the end of 2027.  In terms of organising the management of the  development plan, the main task is to ensure synergy  between the objectives and activities of various  areas and authorities because the development of  digital society (above all the implementation of the  vision for 2030) depends on the common efforts of  many participants. In order to ensure the required  compatibility, the coordination of cooperation and  a single information field, the management of the  development plan and its various levels have been  planned as follows.

See the concept of Bürokratt at https://www.kratid.ee/burokratt  17 A human-centred digital government is one where the use of digital solutions is not an end in itself but rather a   tool for increasing the well-being of people. For people’s trust in digital government to become stable and grow,   digital solutions have to be reliable. Reliable digital solutions are dependable, ethical and lawful, guaranteeing the   fundamental rights and freedoms of all people.  18 The Personal Data Usage Monitor makes data processing transparent, improving people’s awareness and helping   institutions respond to personal data enquiries. The Personal Data Usage Monitor provides a person with an over-  view of what has been done with their data and what is displayed in the state portal eesti.ee. It is meant to be linked   with public sector information systems which store and process personal data in their databases.  19 A consent service is a digital service linked to the database of an authority, enabling people to give their consent,   and view and withdraw it. Data users can view the consents given to them for the issue of data; database adminis-  trators can check whether a consent has been given when issuing personal data to the data users.  20 The aim of the green IT initiative is to reduce the negative impact of technologies by designing, producing, using   and later processing technologies in an environmentally friendly manner.  21 Privacy technology is a technical measure for ensuring the privacy of a person in a proactive and preventive man-  ner.  22 The ‘once-only’ principle means that the same data are not repeatedly requested from users. The principle of   reuse refers to an agreement allowing the reuse of data collected by someone else or for another purpose in the   creation of new knowledge.  2 The X-Road is a technological and organisational environment enabling a secure Internet-based data exchange   between state authorities and the private sector, whereby evidential value is guaranteed. To exchange data, a   member of the X-Road describes the shared data and other members can use that data based on an agreement.   Thanks to the large number of systems that have joined the X-Road, all members can use the services and data of   others to improve their own business processes.  24 Nordic Institute of Interoperability Solutions: https://www.niis.org/  25 A data embassy is a private cloud solution of the state, allowing for the storage and, where necessary, exploita-  tion of data and services at a secure data centre outside the state’s territorial borders. It makes it possible for the Es-  tonian state to continue functioning if the operation of data centres within its territory is terminated or suspended.  26 The marketplace is a common platform for the procurement of standard IT services in the public sector.  27 English: disruptive innovation  28 English: emerging technologies  29 Mission-based initiatives are innovative (cooperation) initiatives directed at resolving a multi-faceted problem that   has a state-wide or broad social impact.  https://www.kratid.ee/burokratt https://www.niis.org/   53 Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030  30 Open innovation means that innovative solutions are created and built openly together with and by various par-  ties or even under their leadership, instead of the state or a single authority devising, commissioning and doing   everything on its own.  31 English: event-driven microservices and domain-driven design  32 The so-called API-first principle  33 English: code repository  34 English: artifactory  35 A very high capacity network either consists wholly of optical fibre elements at least up to the distribution point   at the serving location or which is capable of delivering under usual peak-time conditions similar network perfor-  mance in terms of available down- and uplink bandwidth, resilience, error-related parameters, latency and its varia-  tion.  36 Shaping Europe’s digital future: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digi-  tal-future-feb2020_en_3.pdf  37 A European strategy for data: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-   19feb2020_en.pdf  38 Connectivity for a Competitive Digital Single Market -

Singapore is no different, as we work towards our vision of a Smart Nation. The Smart Nation journey empowers the Singapore economy through technology and digital innovation, and aims to bring about a better quality of life for all. The Government, through policies and initiatives, also aims to better prepare and equip Singapore to embrace the ever-changing digital landscape. The Smart Nation initiative rests on bridging comm- unications and enabling digital services. This brings about the phenomenon of manufacturing every type of device to be “smart”. From traffic cameras to lampposts and even the most mundane of devices like rice cookers and baby- monitors are now part of the “Internet of Things” or IoT. The rapid proliferation of such independently designed devices creates an extremely complex IoT ecosystem. These complexities create vulnerabilities that can easily be exploited by individuals or groups with malicious intent. This is a challenge that the world is facing now, and we ought to study the gaps in the IoT ecosystem and to develop frameworks, policies and innovative solutions to enhance the security of such devices. With the exponential growth in the deployment of IoT devices, the security threat is multiplied many fold. Singapore may not be the first to solve this issue, but we are willing to respond quickly and boldly to create a safe and secure IoT cyberspace. I am pleased that Singapore has established strong cybersecurity ties with the Netherlands. We have embarked on a journey to study and identify the security challenges of the IoT landscape. The outcome of this report highlights the need for collective responsibility between industries and governments. It is important for the ecosystem to stay vibrant and develop new innovative solutions to better secure our IoT against malicious and evolving threats. As we face this uphill challenge in the IoT cyber domain, industries and governments need to pool together resources, strengthen defenses and remain aligned through international standards and governance. Cyber threats are often global, transboundary and increasingly sophisticated. The security challenges can only be addressed when all stakeholders, Governments, industry, academia and consumers, work together. This report is the first of many collaborations with the Netherlands and all other like-minded nations and partners, as we forge towards a more trusted and resilient digital society.

Gartner2 forecasts that the number of connected things in use globally will surge from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 20.4 billion by 2020, with total spending on endpoints and services exceeding $2 trillion3. IoT unlocks tremendous value for the individual, for organisations and for governments; however, it also presents enormous security challenges. The 2015 VTech data breach4, the Mirai botnet5 of 2016, and the recent Silex malware attack6 are some of the many incidents that have affected IoT in this early stage of its evolution. The potential of IoT will only be fully realised if cybersecurity and privacy are built in by design, and the following risks7 are addressed and mitigated: 1. Consumer privacy and safety are undermined by the vulnerability of individual devices, connectivity, and back-ends; and 2. The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an increasing threat of large-scale cyber-attacks launched from massive numbers of insecure IoT devices. The International IoT Security Roundtables held in 2016, 2017 and 20188 by the Cyber Security Agency9 (CSA) of Singapore and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (MEAC) of the Netherlands10, as well as this study of the IoT security landscape, provide input for global efforts towards creating a safe and secure cyberspace of things; a global approach is required since IoT security is not limited by national boundaries. These efforts shall lead to a global platform to share ideas and experiences, shape technologies and architectures, and drive standards and collaboration in creating a next- generation, inherently secure IoT ecosystem that upholds security and privacy expectations. We identify and formulate the below problem statement based on our observations and the inputs of experts from CSA and MEAC as well as the Netherlands National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)11. Vulnerable IoT devices are deployed fast, globally and with unknown lifespan, while a level playing field on common standards and technical solutions for cybersecurity in IoT is lacking for the industry. This creates safety, environmental and social hazards that are not well understood and likely to be unacceptable for society. Using the problem statement as a starting point, this study identifies and discusses 11 interdependent IoT security challenges and presents findings and recommendations. We believe that addressing these challenges will allow IoT security to mature to a point where the IoT ecosystem can develop and flourish in a manner that is acceptable for society. 2 3 4 faq-about-cyber-attack-on-vtech-learning-lodge/ 5 dyn-dns-ddos-attack-cause-outage-status-explained 6 cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-silex-malware-bricks-iot-devices-with-weak- passwords 7 Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things.

Consequently, there exist hundreds of documents12 with significant duplications and possible contradictions. IoT product developers, and vendors involved in the IoT supply chain and life cycle, may find themselves overwhelmed – or they may take advantage of the lack of clarity to do nothing at all. There is an immediate need for harmonisation on security recommendations and guidelines as well as coordination on security assurances in the form of regulation and certification. Given the continuing exponential growth in the number of IoT devices, there is no time to lose. 12 baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot 10 11 1 INTRODUCTION From homes to hospitals, the power grid, the highway, and the high seas, the Internet of Things (IoT) is destined to change the way people live, do business, and interact with their governments. The IoT's massive interconnections of devices, or \"things”, lead to new efficiencies and capabilities, and unlock tremendous value for consumers, organisations and governments. Imagine an intelligent hospital system that links patient monitoring devices with drug infusion pumps to prevent overdoses and reduce false alarms. Or a smart city that automatically schedules maintenance work to minimise street blockages and uses smart lighting to de-escalate conflict situations in real time13. Or connected farms that control their irrigation systems based on the moisture content of the soil and on the weather forecast, all the while deriving algorithmic insights into optimal ways to grow and water crops. IoT is one of the key enabling technologies to realise these visions. The number of IoT devices in operation continues to grow exponentially. Gartner forecasts that the number of connected things in use globally will surge from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 20.4 billion by 2020, with total spending on endpoints and services exceeding $2 trillion.14 Smart cities and smart nations15 are enabled by the adoption of IoT along with related technologies such as cloud computing and big data analytics. These technologies can improve government operations, support better living, create new business opportunities, and support stronger and safer communities. But the aforementioned opportunities come with enormous challenges. Beckstrom’s Law of Cybersecurity16 is a recent Internet aphorism that, slightly paraphrased, states the following: 1. Anything attached to a network can be hacked. 2. Everything is being attached to a network. 3. Therefore, everything can be hacked. This pronouncement has proven largely accurate. In December 2015, VTech, a manufacturer of educational toys such as electronic learning devices, announced a security breach exposing the personal data of over 6 million people.17 Reports suggested that the breach exploited a SQL injection vulnerability at the server and that the account registration services did not use encrypted communication.18 The devices themselves were not compromised; however, the online services that the devices connected to were not sufficiently secured. On October 21, 2016, multiple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeted Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn, causing major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to users in Europe and North America.19 The attack was accomplished by issuing a large number of DNS lookup requests from as many as 600,000 Internet-connected devices20 – such as printers, IP cameras, residential gateways and baby monitors – that were infected with the 13 14 15 – Singapore Smart Nation website. 16 17 18 19 20 Mirai malware to create a “botnet”; Mirai was also used for similar attacks on websites such as Krebs on Security.21 On June 25, 2019, a new IoT malware called Silex was found to be wiping device firmware after gaining access via default credentials – the standard user name and password that devices are shipped with. The malware, which only operated for one day, managed to brick thousands of IoT devices.22 These examples highlight two primary risks facing IoT23: 1. Consumer privacy and safety are being undermined by the vulnerability of individual devices, connectivity, and back-ends; and 2. The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an increasing threat of large-scale cyber-attacks launched from massive numbers of insecure IoT devices. 21 22 23 Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things. Policy report UK Government, March 2018. INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) THREAT LANDSCAPE HISTORY OF ACTUAL EVENTS Multi-kiloton pipeline explosion Critical infrastructure sites affected Cars: digitally stolen, remotely crashed Steel mill blast furnace damaged Larger scale power grid crashed Hospital breached via medical devices Figure 1: IoT Threat Landscape: Actual Events (Source: Symantec) 12 13 According to ABI Research, at this moment less than 4% of IoT devices are secure by design.24 The real-life incidents depicted in Figure 1 emphasise the urgency of improving IoT security. For IoT to be successful, useful and acceptable, the hazards that come with the widespread use of IoT must be managed to risk levels acceptable for society. 1.1 OBJECTIVES This study provides input to global efforts in creating a safe and secure cyberspace of things; a global approach is required, since IoT security is not limited by national boundaries. These efforts shall lead to a global platform to share ideas and experiences, shape technologies and architectures, and drive standards and collaboration in creating a next-generation, inherently secure IoT ecosystem that upholds security and privacy expectations. The objective of this study is to define the problem spaces, determine the security challenges and identify gaps based on the current technological and policy landscape for each challenge in order to present key findings and recomm- endations, thus formulating the foundations for global actions and dialogue. In some industries, such an approach has been followed for decades: for example, the automotive industry develops designs in competition, while safety is based on common global standards (car safety certifications) and responsibilities (the manufacturer bears the cost of recalls). 1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT The problem statement is formulated based on the following observations of the IoT ecosystem. 1. IoT is by definition vulnerable – IoT is a network of physical devices using open network standards and software. Recent history has shown that such a network is highly vulnerable, especially given the resource- constrained nature of the devices and their often- unsupervised operation. 2. IoT devices are deployed fast, on a global scale and with unknown lifespan – IoT is one of the main drivers of innovation in today’s world and, owing to the almost borderless digital economy, IoT solutions are developed for a global market. As a result, the pace of technology development is high and competition is fierce. At the same time, product lifecycles may be long, and devices can be used for a longer period than intended by the manufacturers. 3. No level playing field for IoT device manufacturers – Owing to the lack of legislations and the differences in legislative environments in different countries, there is no level playing field for vendors nor a common expectation of security functionality. 4. Lack of security in the IoT business equation – Time-to- market, usability and cost are key considerations for many solutions, and the razor-thin margins for these devices leave manufacturers with less to spend on security with virtually no incentive25: indeed, an attack on a device may affect neither the manufacturer nor the user but heavily impact a third party target in a botnet scenario. 5. Lack of IoT security awareness26 – The current landscape is too complex for most end-users to really understand the risks to themselves and to others – for instance, few consumers would appreciate the very real risk of their refrigerators or smart TVs being used as part of a botnet in a DDoS attack. Given these observations, we formulate the following problem statement: Vulnerable IoT devices are deployed fast, globally and with unknown lifespan, while a level playing field on common standards and technical solutions for cybersecurity in IoT is lacking for the industry. This creates safety, environmental and social hazards that are not well understood and likely to be unacceptable for society. 24 IoT Security from Design to Lifecycle Management, An Embedded Perspective; ABI Research, 2018. 25 The economics of the security of consumer-grade IoT products and services, Internet Society / Plum Consulting, April 2019. 26 ‘Towards a secure connected digital society’ – Advice regarding cybersecurity of IoT, by Dutch Cyber Security Council, 2018. In Dutch. 1.3 JUSTIFICATION AND METHODOLOGY Data for this study was collected as follows. 1. Desk research and analysis focusing on publications from governments, standards development organisations, and industry, as well as scientific publications. 2. Interactive sessions including workshops, panel discussions and International IoT Security Roundtables27 featuring participants from government, industry and academia. 3. Consultations with experts and policymakers from organisations including Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency28, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands29, the Netherlands National Cyber Security Centre30, Germany’s BSI31, and the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS)32. Based on the collected data, we identify fundamental IoT security challenges and map them to three problem spaces. We summarise recent developments related to each challenge and derive conclusions and actionable recommendations based on our findings. We also identify priority challenges based on input from experts in government, academia and industry. While every effort is made to ensure that information is up-to-date, the IoT space continues to grow exponentially and we cannot guarantee completeness of coverage, particularly regarding initiatives and technology developments. 1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE This report presents a wide-ranging discussion on the IoT security la ndscape and provides findings and recommen- dations towards securing IoT ecosystems to support policy initiatives and to inform the industry as well as interested stakeholders. Hence, the target audience includes government and industry bodies as well as vendors of IoT products and services, and organisations responsible for IoT security. This report is also useful for executives responsible for IT and/or innovation activities in their organisations, such as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). 1.5 LANDSCAPE STUDY STRUCTURE The chapters in this study are organised as follows. – Chapter 2: Definitions and concepts used in this study. – Chapter 3: Specific challenges in IoT security, and a survey of expert opinions on the importance of each challenge given the current state of the art. – Chapter 4: Overview of key initiatives that contribute to one or more of the identified challenges. – Chapter 5: Discussions on each challenge, including a description of the current landscape and recent developments. – Chapter 6: Conclusions and recommendations towards a more secure IoT ecosystem. 27 28 29 30 31 32 17 33 34 35 Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things, Department of Homeland Security, May 2016 36 ITU-T Y.2060, Overview of the Internet of Things 2 DEFINITIONS AND BACKGROUND 2.1 INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) The IEEE provides the following definition for IoT33: Internet of Things envisions a self-configuring, adaptive, complex network that interconnects ‘things’ to the Internet through the use of standard communication protocols. The interconnected things have physical or virtual representation in the digital world, sensing/actuation capability, a programmability feature and are uniquely identifiable. The representation contains information including the thing’s identity, status, location or any other business, social or privately relevant information. The things offer services, with or without human intervention, through the exploitation of unique identification, data capture and communication, and actuation capability. According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)34: The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to devices, that are often constrained in communication and computation capabilities, now becoming more commonly connected to the Internet, and to various services that are built on top of the capabilities these devices jointly provide. It is expected that this development will usher in more machine-to-machine communication using the Internet with no human user actively involved. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security states35 the following: IoT refers to the connection of systems and devices with primarily physical purposes (e.g. sensing, heating/cooling, lighting, motor actuation, transportation) to information networks (including the Internet) via interoperable protocols, often built into embedded systems. According to the ITU-T36, the IoT can be viewed as “a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting physical and virtual things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies”. ITU-T emphasises that the IoT is characterised by its large-scale (compared to the current Internet) interconnections of heterogeneous devices that closely couple the physical and virtual worlds without the need for human intermediation; further, these devices may sleep, wake up, and change location while possibly being in operation without supervision for extended durations. It is clear from the above definitions that IoT deals with uniquely-identifiable, resource-constrained devices that measure and possibly control their environments and communicate over networks. We therefore exclude devices that are primarily intended for human interaction, such as mobile phones and computers; having said that, the extensive work done on IT security (or computer security37) over the past few decades provides useful fundamentals for IoT security. 2.2 IOT DEVICE AS A RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED DEVICE A representation of a generic IoT device is shown in Figure 3. IoT devices are extremely varied in nature and may consist of some or all of the components depicted. All IoT devices include sensors to collect information from the environment: these might be temperature sensors, motion sensors, air quality sensors, or light sensors, to name a few. Some devices may contain actuators for moving or controlling a system or environment. Devices also contain power supplies, often batteries. There is necessarily a module that provides connectivity, although the nature of this connectivity varies widely. There is also a certain amount of processing power provided by a microcontroller unit (MCU), storage such as non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), and often a minimal operating system (OS) and a dedicated application. LARGE-SCALE HETEROGENEOUS AUTOMATED INTEGRATED WITH PHYSICAL WORLD The number of devices will be far larger than the current Internet. Devices are based on a variety of platforms and communicate using different networks. Devices may be unsupervised for extended periods. Many might have zero or limited user interfacing. IoT connects the virtual world directly to physical objects and environments. Figure 2: IoT Characteristics 37 Operating system Application Storage Sensors Power supply Actuators ConnectivityProcessing Figure 3: An IoT Device 18 1938 IETF RFC 7228, May 2014, Terminology for Constrained-Node Networks As discussed, IoT devices are often resource-constrained; we may not have the luxury of measuring their memory in gigabytes, nor of measuring their processing power by number of cores. Most IoT devices use a microcontroller rather than a full-fledged microprocessor, and run at a few MHz rather than GHz. Specific resource constraints for IoT devices are shown below. Additionally, IoT devices may have physical constraints and accessibility constraints imposed by the operational environment, e.g. pacemakers within the human body. And, finally, cost is a critical constraint for IoT devices. Of course, different devices can be constrained to different degrees – the varied nature of the devices needs to be accounted for in any discussion of IoT. The IETF classifies resource-constrained devices as depicted below.38 Processing BandwidthMemory Power Storage IoT Device Resource Constraints Figure 4: IoT Device Resource Constraints Classification of Resource-Constrained Devices Class 0 Pre-configured, sensor-like devices that communicate only with gateways and support bare- minimum management functionality such as a health indicator or heartbeat. Class 1 Devices that are quite constrained and cannot easily talk to other Internet nodes employing a full protocol stack such as HTTP/TLS but can use protocols designed for constrained nodes and can integrate into an IP network using limited memory, storage, and power. Class 2 Devices that are capable of supporting most of the protocol stacks used on computers. However, even these devices can benefit from lightweight and energy-efficient protocols and from consuming less bandwidth. 2.3 IOT SECURITY VS IT SECURITY In accordance with the above discussions, this study excludes IT devices that require significant human interaction such as mobile phones and computers. Extensive work has been done in the field of IT security39 over the past few decades. While IoT security and IT security share the same fundamental principles, it is often inadvisable to apply IT security classifications and mindsets directly to the IoT world40 given the unique nature of the IoT ecosystem41. The following considerations apply: 1) As discussed, IoT devices are often constrained in terms of resources and/or physical environments. This significantly alters the way security is designed; for instance, IoT connections cannot generally rely on TLS/ SSL for encrypted and authenticated communications because many IoT devices do not have the resources to handle session establishment, communication overheads, or encryption. 2) IoT devices may run without supervision and for extended periods of time, possibly in hostile environments – making them particularly susceptible to hacking. Many might have zero or limited user interfacing; thus, patching and updating may not be convenient and malfunctioning or rogue devices may not be immediately detectable. 3) The fact that IoT is closely integrated with the physical world can increase the impact of cyber-attacks. While IT cyber-attacks have resulted in data leakage and financial losses, IoT cyber-attacks have the potential to cause direct physical harm. Moreover, conventional IT security has historically relied on fortifying a “perimeter”. In previous decades, organisations could easily define and visualise this perimeter, and create a protection policy to enforce and guard its obvious boundary. Enterprises still commonly secure corporate networks using familiar baseline measures such as the firewall, the demilitarised zone (DMZ), and some variety of intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the traditional perimeter has been eroded by the widespread adoption of mobile devices, virtual private networks (VPNs), web-based applications and cloud computing42; IoT potentially takes both client device and server back-end out of the no-longer- defined perimeter43, making it necessary to re-think security practices. 2.4 IOT THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES The IETF defines44 a threat as “a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability.” Vulnerabilities can be exploited by a threat agent in an attack. The result can potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a resource. Attacks on critical IoT devices and systems, such as connected cars and medical equipment, can target the device itself and disrupt its integrity or availability, endangering the user of the device and potentially those in the vicinity. For less critical IoT devices, such as thermostats or cameras, a major threat is device compromise, where the devices can be harnessed as part of a botnet to support DDoS attacks, spam bots or ransomware campaigns. The aforementioned Mirai45 botnet and an evolved version of Mirai called Reaper46 showed how 39 40 ITU-T Y.4806, Security capabilities supporting safety of the Internet of things 41 42 IBM Red Paper, Understanding IT Perimeter Security 43 44 IETF Internet Security Glossary, 45 Mirai IoT Botnet Co-Authors Plead Guilty - 46 The Reaper IoT botnet has already infected a million networks - 21 47 State-of-the-Art and Challenges for the Internet of Things Security, IRTF T2T Research Group, draft-irtf-t2trg-iot-seccons/?include_text=1 48 OWASP IoT Project, 49 Practical Internet of Things Security, Brian Russell, from p257, 2016. 50 AN ATTACK: I.E., A THREAT ACTION COUNTER MEASURE A SYSTEM RESOURCE: TARGET OF THE ATTACK Attacker i.e., a threat agent Vulnerability Passive or active attack Threat consequences Figure 5: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks (Source: IETF) such large-scale cyber-attacks can cascade into national and international security threats. Finally, for all types of IoT devices, the potential loss of confidential information via the device, its communication infrastructure, or its back- end servers remains a significant threat. Table 1 briefly discusses some of the threats and vulnerabilities facing IoT that are most commonly cited by sources such as IRTF47, OWASP48 and others49,50, as a prerequisite to discussing IoT security challenges. Table 1: IoT Threats and Vulnerabilities IoT Threats and Vulnerabilities 1 Vulnerable device software IoT devices rely on software that might contain poor design choices and/or security bugs such as buffer overflows and improper exception handling. This makes them vulnerable to many different attacks that can compromise data confidentiality or integrity. 2 Privacy threat Device location tracking poses a privacy risk to users; an attacker can infer sensitive information from data gathered and communicated by devices. Such information may be sold to interested parties for marketing purposes or used for unauthorised surveillance. 3 Eavesdropping Communication over an IoT network can be intercepted and deciphered if the communication channel is not sufficiently protected, for instance if keying material, security parameters, or configuration settings are exchanged in the clear or if weak or unsuitable cryptographic algorithms are used. Related attacks include man-in-the-middle, session hijacking, or message replay. 4 Denial of Service (DoS) Devices, being resource-constrained, are susceptible to denial of service attacks launched by attackers sending continuous requests to deplete device resources. On the other hand, compromised devices can themselves be used to disrupt the operation of other networks or systems via a Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack. 5 Firmware-level attack An attacker may be able replace device firmware during device commissioning or under the guise of a routine upgrade. 6 Device cloning or substitution A non-trusted factory can clone the physical characteristics, firmware/ software and security configuration of the device. Deployed devices might also be compromised and their software reverse-engineered, allowing for cloning. Cloned devices may be sold cheaply in the market and can contain functional modifications including backdoors. Alternatively, a genuine device may be substituted with a variant or clone during transportation or commissioning. 7 Data leakage Disclosure of sensitive data, intentionally or unintentionally, to unauthorised parties. Confidential data may be captured by an attacker from individual devices, during transit, or from the back-end. 8 Malware Devices can be infected with programs designed to carry out unauthorised actions on a system, possibly using existing vulnerabilities in software or firmware. 9 Weak user/admin credentials and authentication Poor credential management such as weak password choices and lack of multi-factor authentication for the user and administrative interfaces of devices, gateways or back-ends is a common vulnerability in many information systems including IoT. 22 23 2.5 SECURITY VS SAFETY While the terms “safety” and “security” tend to be used interchangeably in informal situations, they have acquired specific meanings51,52 in the domain of Information Security. Safety is the condition of a system operating without unacceptable risk of physical injury or damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the environment. (IEC) Computer security, cybersecurity or IT security is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage as well as disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. (Wikipedia) Safety measures focus on preventing losses due to unintentional actions by benevolent actors, while security measures emphasise the prevention of losses due to intentional actions by malevolent actors53. Security threats, as described in the previous section, tend to be rooted in malicious intentions, typically deriving from crime, terrorism, geo-politics or hacktivism, and they evolve over time, meaning that there should be a continuing strategy to react, adapt and defend against these threats. Safety hazards, on the other hand, are typically accidental and stem from environmental situations or human error. Having said that, many security threats can lead to safety losses – indeed, the fact that IoT devices are closely integrated with the physical world54 increases the likelihood of a malicious attack cascading into a significant safety loss. 51 52 53 Inside Risks: An Integrated Approach to Safety and Security Based on Systems Theory, Young and Leveson, Communications of the ACM, Feb 2014 54 25 3 IOT SECURITY PROBLEM SPACES AND CHALLENGES This study identifies 11 cybersecurity challenges in the IoT landscape based on a review of existing literature as well as expert input from the International IoT Security Roundtables and conversations with practitioners and policymakers during and after the Roundtables.55 Figure 6 maps the identified challenges to three problem spaces: Principles, Governance and Legislation; Ecosystem Development; and Technical References and Standards. This study explores these IoT security challenges in a domain-agnostic manner, with IoT devices modelled as generic resource-constrained devices that require security controls. Orthogonal to the generic approach would be a domain-specific approach; a given domain can impose specific physical and technological constraints and have specific security requirements. We briefly address in Annex A the IoT security requirements in two rapidly-growing domains: smart mobility and smart health.

Delivered during SICW International IoT Security Roundtable 2017. 3.1 PRINCIPLES, GOVERNANCE AND LEGISLATION IoT security needs to be based upon fundamentally sound cybersecurity principles. To achieve security in practice, these principles should lead to concrete guidelines and standards. Standards are used as a basis for evaluation and certification. For certification schemes to be successful, there must either be demand for certification from customers/users or governmental legislation mandating a minimum assurance level. Finally, since IoT is a global phenomenon and is not limited by national boundaries, it is essential to align country-specific legislations and adopt a coherent global approach to IoT security to drive standards and collaboration in creating an IoT environment that upholds security and privacy expectations. We identified the following challenges in this problem space. 1. Cybersecurity and Privacy by Design – To identify and define foundational principles to build cybersecurity and privacy by design for IoT devices. 2. IoT Security Standards and Guidelines – To set and harmonise IoT security standards and recommen- dations over different application domains. 3. Evaluation and Certification – To develop globally recognised and adopted cybersecurity evaluation and certification regimes for IoT devices. 4. Future-Proof Legislation – To develop regulatory policies that are sufficiently flexible to deal with societal security needs and a constantly evolving industry. 3.2 ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT As mentioned in the introduction to this document, time- to-market, usability and cost are key considerations for IoT solutions, and the razor-thin margins for devices leave suppliers with less to spend on security. Besides incentivising manufacturers to implement security, it is important to cultivate an ecosystem that fosters security in IoT supply chains and throughout device lifecycles. This study identified the following challenges in this problem space56. 5. Responsible Industry Ecosystem – To transform to a responsible industry that proactively implements cybersecurity in IoT devices. 6. Supply Chain Security – To create a framework for all suppliers and service providers involved in the supply chain to adopt security principles and to deliver secure IoT components. 7. Product Lifecycle Support – To implement a framework for secure device lifecycle management and patching that is adopted by all parties involved. 3.3 TECHNICAL REFERENCES AND STANDARDS Finally, this study examines the security challenges in the IoT technologies themselves: the devices and firmware, the operating systems and applications on the devices and back-end servers, and the communication infrastructure connecting devices to gateways and back-ends. The identified technical challenges are aligned with “the four cornerstones of security” identified by Symantec57. 8. Device Identity and Root of Trust – To establish a chain of trust from a root of trust on resource-constrained IoT devices to develop foundationally secure devices. 9. Secure OS, Cloud and Applications – To provision security controls in device OSes as well as cloud and back-end applications to guarantee security within the IoT ecosystem. 10. Secure Communications and Infrastructure – To ensure data and source integrity in the communication networks of resource-constrained IoT devices. 11. Security Monitoring and Analytics – To detect vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in IoT deployments and to quickly respond, recover and remediate. 26 27 Challenges 8 to 10 should provide a technical security baseline. However, history shows that vulnerabilities are invariably found after a product is deployed; therefore, we need to continue to monitor and analyse IoT deployments for advanced attacks, exceptions and other deviant behaviour. This is addressed under challenge 11. Of course, newly-found attack vectors should lead to solutions deployed in the form of patches or updates – which ties this challenge back to the product lifecycle and ecosystem. 3.4 EXPERT OPINIONS ON PRIORITY CHALLENGES As described in Chapter 1, this study makes extensive use of material gathered during interactive sessions with cybersecurity and IoT practitioners and policymakers. The sessions included workshops, panel discussions and International IoT Security Roundtables58, and expert opinions were sought from a number of individuals and several organisations including Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency59, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherland60, the Netherlands National Cyber Security Centre61, the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport62, and Germany’s BSI63. To determine the relative importance of each challenge and thereby identify priority challenges for policymakers and industry, a number of experts were surveyed. They were asked which of the identified IoT security challenges are, in their opinion, the most relevant and urgent given the current state of IoT security; their responses are summarised in the chart below. Each respondent chose up to 3 priority challenges. As Figure 7 on the next page reveals, there is a wide range of opinions among the expert community on which challenges are most critical; indeed, this is reflective of the nebulous state of IoT security today. Having said that, it is clear that the community expects security to be built into IoT devices and ecosystems by design. The development of effective evaluation and certification schemes built upon widely-accepted security standards (themselves based on sound cybersecurity and privacy principles) is increasingly seen as a cornerstone of IoT security, as is the establishment of a secure supply chain and managed device lifecycle. The security of the hardware devices is also seen by the expert community as important; in particular, the hardware root of trust is emphasised by security practitioners in the field. The streamlining of monitoring efforts with the supply chain and lifecycle challenges represents a key opportunity. These inputs suggest that certain security challenges should be addressed on a priority basis; this is discussed in the conclusion of this study after an examination of the current landscape and recent developments related to each challenge. 58 59 60 61 62 63 29 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Security monitoring and analytics Secure communications and infrastructure Secure OS, cloud and applications Device identity and root of trust Product lifecycle support Supply chain security Responsible industry ecosystem Future proof legislation Evaluation and certication IoT security standards and guidelines Cybersecurity and privacy by design % of respondents Io T S ec ur it y C ha lle ng e Figure 7: What are the most important challenges in IoT security? 20 expert respondents, each of whom chose 3 priority challenges 31 4 KEY INITIATIVES 4.1 INVENTORY OF KEY INITIATIVES Numerous IoT security initiatives have emerged in recent years. We have identified 25 major initiatives for further examination; each initiative is described in more detail in Annex B. The initiatives have been chosen based on their focus on and contributions to IoT security rather than IoT in general. These initiatives contribute to and, to some extent, define the state of the art in IoT security. The initiatives broadly fall within the below categories. – IoT-focused groups formed by standards development organisations (SDOs) such as ETSI, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)64 and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)65. – Professional bodies such as the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)66, the IoT Security Foundation67, and the Cloud Security Alliance68. – Governmental initiatives such as the IoT security divisions of NIST69 and ENISA70, and the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI)71. – Alliances focused on networking standards, such as GSMA72, Zigbee73 and LoRa74. – Initiatives dedicated to hardware platforms, such as the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)75, UEFI76 and GlobalPlatform77. Table 2 indicates the IoT security challenge/s primarily addressed by each key initiative. The table reveals a strong emphasis on standards as well as connectivity, and comparatively less focus (in terms of number of initiatives) on supply chain and lifecycle. It is noted that several of the initiatives are dedicated chiefly to a single challenge: Wi-SUN78, Zigbee, LoRa and IETF are focused primarily on IoT networking and communications (and the accompanying standards), the Global Cyber Alliance79 deals with threat analytics and intelligence, and UEFI and GlobalPlatform largely address hardware security. Some bodies, such as the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), have a much wider focus. Table 3 describes the primary membership of each initiative in terms of professional domain (government, industry or academia) and geographical region. We observe that government involvement is limited, particularly for non- European initiatives. Also, there is a strong tendency towards continental initiatives, focusing on the Americas or Europe. Only the IoT Acceleration Consortium80 and Wi-SUN are oriented towards Asia, specifically Japan. Given that Asia is a manufacturing hub for computer hardware and microelectronics, we would expect to find more IoT security activity in this region – although it is possible that we have been unable to identify Asian initiatives owing to language barriers. We were also unable to find major initiatives operating in Africa, although we note that the IoT Forum Africa81 is held annually in Johannesburg. Table 4 reiterates that global governmental initiatives are lacking – the sole international government-driven initiative appears to be the ITU-T Study Group 2082. 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 C yb er se cu rit y a nd P riv ac y b y D es ig n Io T S ec ur ity S ta nd ar ds Ev al ua tio n an d C er tifi ca tio n Fu tu re -P ro of L eg is la tio n Re sp on si bl e In du st ry E co sy st em S up pl y C ha in S ec ur ity Pr od uc t L ife cy cl e S up po rt D ev ic e Id en tit y an d Ro ot o f T ru st S ec ur e O S, C lo ud a nd A pp lic at io ns S ec ur e C om m un ic at io ns a nd In fr a S ec ur ity M on ito rin g an d An al yt ic s 1 Alliance for IoT Innovation ● ● ● 2 Cloud Security Alliance ● ● 3 ENISA IoT ● ● ● 4 ETSI ● ● 5 GlobalPlatform ● ● 6 Global Cyber Alliance ● 7 GSMA ● ● 8 Internet Engineering Task Force ● ● 9 Industrial Internet Consortium ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 10 IoT Acceleration Consortium ● 11 IoT Consortium ● 12 IoT Cybersecurity Alliance ● ● ● ● 13 IoT European Platforms Initiative ● 14 IoT Security Foundation ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 15 ITU Study Group 20 ● ● 16 LoRa Alliance ● ● ● 17 NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program ● 18 Open Connectivity Foundation ● ● 19 OWASP IoT Project ● ● ● ● 20 Prpl Foundation ● ● 21 Thing-to-Thing Research Group ● ● ● 22 Trusted Computing Group ● ● 23 UEFI Forum ● ● 24 Wi-SUN Alliance ● ● ● 25 Zigbee Alliance ● ● ● Table 2: IoT Security Initiatives – Challenges Addressed IoT Security Initiative C ha lle ng es A dd re ss ed 32 33 G ov er nm en t In du st ry A ca de m ia A m er ic as Eu ro pe A si a G lo ba l 1 Alliance for IoT Innovation ● ● ● 2 Cloud Security Alliance ● ● ● 3 ENISA IoT ● ● 4 ETSI ● ● ● ● 5 GlobalPlatform ● ● 6 Global Cyber Alliance ● ● 7 GSMA ● ● 8 Internet Engineering Task Force ● ● ● 9 Industrial Internet Consortium ● ● 10 IoT Acceleration Consortium ● ● ● ● 11 IoT Consortium ● ● ● 12 IoT Cybersecurity Alliance ● ● ● 13 IoT European Platforms Initiative ● ● 14 IoT Security Foundation ● ● ● 15 ITU-T Study Group 20 ● ● ● ● 16 LoRa Alliance ● ● 17 NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program ● ● 18 Open Connectivity Foundation ● ● 19 OWASP IoT Project ● ● ● ● 20 Prpl Foundation ● ● 21 Thing-to-Thing Research Group ● ● ● ● 22 Trusted Computing Group ● ● 23 UEFI Forum ● ● 24 Wi-SUN Alliance ● ● 25 Zigbee Alliance ● ● ● ● Total numbers 6 22 8 8 10 2 12 Table 3: IoT Security Initiatives – Membership IoT Security Initiative M em be rs hi p (p rim ar y fo cu s) 34 Global Americas Europe Asia Government 1 1 2 1 Industry 11 7 7 2 Academia 3 3 3 1 Table 4: IoT Security Initiatives – Membership (Region vs Domain) At the same time there are numerous national research initiatives, typically at university level, focusing on IoT security. Notable examples include the PETRAS83 research hub formed by a group of U.K. universities led by University College London. 4.2 APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INITIATIVES Many pilots address IoT security in the narrower context of a specialised application domain such as automotive or healthcare84, often under domain-specific names such as \"intelligent transportation\", “smart mobility”, \"smart grid\", or \"e-health\". In the automotive domain, notable examples include the Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles (CETRAN)85 at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the Security Credential Management System (SCMS)86 of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Enterprise Singapore has published a set of provisional national standards, known as Technical Reference (TR) 68, to guide industry in the development and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles in Singapore. The TR includes cybersecurity principles and assessment methodology. A vehicular IoT technology that is already widely deployed is the EU-wide eCall initiative87, intended to bring rapid assistance to motorists in the event of a crash by communicating the vehicle’s location and direction to emergency services; eCall has been mandatory for all new cars sold within the EU since April 2018. The Smart Mobility Working Group of AIOTI88 has done substantial work detailing the application of IoT principles to connected vehicles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) groups worldwide, particularly ERTICO89 in Europe, are involved in a number of pilot projects in the area of smart mobility. ERTICO has also released recommendations90 on communication technologies for future Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) scenarios. At the same time, consumer privacy is a concern in automotive IoT applications; the American Future of Privacy Forum91 and National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) have published a consumer guide92 highlighting the types of data that connected cars collect and transmit. In healthcare, efforts include in-home monitoring services for the elderly93 from Fujitsu and Panasonic, the M.A.I.L. (Motion capture and Artificial Intelligence assisted Liposuction)94 system from Korean plastic surgery provider 365mc, and remote monitoring and management of in-vitro diagnosis (IVD) devices95 by Roche Diagnostics96 in China. Cybersecurity concerns have naturally begun to emerge: in 2015, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered hospitals to stop using the Hospira Symbiq infusion pump, which delivers medications directly into the bloodstream, 83 84 We discuss these domains in more detail in Annex A. 85 for-Testing-Research-of-AVs-NTU-CETRAN.aspx 86 87 ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018 88 89 90 ertico-releases-guide-about-technologies-for-future-c-its-service-scenarios/ 91 92 fpf-and-nada-launch-guide-to-consumer-privacy-in-the-connected-car/ 93 releases/2015/0625-01.html 94 story/365mc-azure-iot-suite-machine-learning-korea-en 95 96 35 after a security researcher showed that the pump could be accessed remotely over WiFi and allowed an attacker to change dosage settings or use it as a gateway to attack hospital networks97. While there are numerous pilots and also several American and European initiatives to address specific domains such as automotive and healthcare as discussed above, global IoT security initiatives and standards are lacking in these domains. 4.3 KEY FINDINGS – Most initiatives have a generic focus, and application- specific initiatives (e.g. for automotive or healthcare) are largely country- or region-specific. – Most Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) have initiated work on IoT Security standards. – Most initiatives are industry-driven, and we observe a lack of government involvement outside Europe. – National or continental initiatives are centred on the Americas or Europe; a global approach is lacking. – Substantial initiatives with a broad security focus include the Industrial IoT Consortium and the IoT Security Foundation. 97 us-hospira-fda-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0Q52GJ20150731 37 5 IOT SECURITY CHALLENGES This chapter articulates the 11 IoT security challenges in detail. For each challenge we describe the current landscape and recent developments to examine the gap between the challenge and the state of the art. The full set of findings for the 11 security challenges are input for the conclusions and recommendations to drive IoT cybersecurity forward. 5.1 CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY BY DESIGN To build cybersecurity and privacy by design into IoT, a set of security principles should be adopted and adhered to. These principles form the basis for standards, future-proof legislation, and operational security solutions. 5.1.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)98, OWASP99, the Korea Internet & Security Agency100, and the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI)101 have all defined sets of IoT security and privacy principles. Strategic Principles by DHS The U.S. DHS describes the risks associated with IoT and provides a set of principles and best practices to build security into IoT.102 US Department of Homeland Security – Strategic Principles for Securing the IoT 1 Incorporate Security at the Design Phase 2 Advance Security Updates and Vulnerability Management 3 Build on Proven Security Practices 4 Prioritise Security Measures According to Potential Impact 5 Promote Transparency across IoT 6 Connect Carefully and Deliberately IoT Security Principles from South Korea The seven principles of common security for IoT as proposed by Korea Internet & Security Agency103 should be considered by the providers (developers) of IoT devices and services, and by users as well. 98 99 100 101 102 Strategic_ Principles_for_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things-2016-1115-FINALpdf 103 IoT Common Security Principles v1.0, Korea Internet & Security Agency. Korea Internet and Security Agency – IoT Common Security Principles 1 Design IoT products and services in consideration of the need to protect information and strengthen privacy. 2 Apply and verify technologies for the development of safe software and hardware. 3 Provide a method of establishing safe initial security. 4 Comply with the security protocol and set safe parameters. 5 Update security patches against the weak points of IoT products and services continuously. 6 Provide a system for information protection and privacy to ensure safe operation and control. 7 Provide a system capable of coping with infringements of the IoT and a method of detecting the responsible entity. IoT Security Principles from DCMS UK The U.K. Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has published a report104 on IoT security in which five guiding principles are identified to inform future action. The report also describes the development of the U.K.’s Code of Practice105 on IoT Security. 104 Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things. Policy report UK Government, March 2018. 105 106 UK Government – Improving the Cyber Security of Consumer IoT 1 Reducing Burden – Many consumers struggle to understand what is required of them, or conducted on their behalf, to keep their products secure. Reducing the burden on consumers will likely require everyone in the supply chain to pay more attention to security. 2 Transparency – Greater transparency is an essential part of a secure by design approach. Being open and explicit about security mechanisms that have been put in place to secure a product or service, allows for accountability and scrutiny, thereby enabling others in the supply chain to make informed choices. 3 Measurability – A secure by design approach should not just be about putting in place good security mechanisms, but also being able to measure the effectiveness of those mechanisms. 4 Facilitating Dialogue – Facilitating dialogue means maintaining effective communication between all parties across the supply chain and with consumers. 5 Resilience – A secure by design approach should further have provisions to increase the resilience of critical functions and services. This includes conducting business continuity planning, establishing a “fallback framework” and undertaking regular risk assessments to anticipate and mitigate future problems. IoT Security Principles by OWASP 1 Assume a Hostile Edge – Edge components are likely to fall into adversarial hands. Assume attackers will have physical access to edge components and can manipulate them, move them to hostile networks, and control resources such as DNS, DHCP, and internet routing. 2 Test for Scale – The volume of IoT means that every design and security consideration must also consider scale. Simple bootstrapping into an ecosystem can create a self-denial of service condition at IoT scale. Security countermeasures must perform at volume. IoT Security Principles by OWASP OWASP states sixteen principles106 that cover the full spectrum of IoT from system hardening and lifecycle support to authentication and isolation. 38 39 3 Internet of Lies – Automated systems are extremely capable of presenting misinformation in convincing formats. IoT systems should always verify data from the edge to prevent autonomous misinformation from tainting a system. 4 Exploit Autonomy – Automated systems are capable of complex, monotonous, and tedious operations that human users would never tolerate. IoT systems should seek to exploit this advantage for security. 5 Expect Isolation – The advantage of autonomy should also extend to situations where a component is isolated. Security countermeasures must never degrade in the absence of connectivity. 6 Protect Uniformly – Data encryption only protects encrypted pathways. Data that is transmitted over an encrypted link is still exposed at any point it is unencrypted, such as prior to encryption, after decryption, and along any communications pathways that do not enforce encryption. Careful consideration must be given to full data life cycle to ensure that encryption is applied uniformly and appropriately to guarantee protections. Encryption is not total - be aware that metadata about encrypted data might also provide valuable information to attackers. 7 Encryption is Tricky – It is very easy for developers to make mistakes when applying encryption. Using encryption but failing to validate certificates, failing to validate intermediate certificates, failing to encrypt traffic with a strong key, using a uniform seed, or exposing private key material are all common pitfalls when deploying encryption. Ensure a thorough review of any encryption capability to avoid these mistakes. 8 System Hardening – Be sure that IoT components are stripped down to the minimum viable feature set to reduce attack surface. Unused ports and protocols should be disabled, and unnecessary supporting software should be uninstalled or turned off. Be sure to track third party components and update them where possible. 9 Limit what you can – To the extent possible limit access based on acceptable use criteria. There's no advantage in exposing a sensor interface to the entire internet if there's no good case for a remote user in a hostile country. Limit access to white lists of rules that make sense. 10 Life cycle Support – IoT systems should be able to quickly onboard new components, but should also be capable of re-credentialing existing components, and deprovisioning components for a full device life cycle. This capability should include all components in the ecosystem from devices to users. 11 Data in Aggregate is Unpredictable – IoT systems can collect vast quantities of data that may seem innocuous at first, but complex data analysis may reveal very sensitive patterns or information hidden in data. IoT systems must prepare for the data stewardship responsibilities of unexpected information sensitivity that may only be revealed after an ecosystem is deployed. 12 Plan for the Worst – IoT systems should have capabilities to respond to compromises, hostile participants, malware, or other adverse events. There should be features in place to re-issue credentials, exclude participants, distribute security patches and updates, and so on, before they are ever necessary. 13 The Long Haul – IoT system designers must recognise that the extended lifespan of devices will require forward compatible security features. IoT ecosystems must be capable of aging in place and still addressing evolving security concerns. New encryption, advances in protocols, new attack methods and techniques, and changing topology all necessitate that IoT systems be capable of addressing emerging security concerns for years after they are deployed. 14 Attackers Target Weakness – Ensure that security controls are equivalent across interfaces in an ecosystem. Attackers will identify the weakest component and attempt to exploit it. Mobile interfaces, hidden API's, or resource constrained environments must enforce security in the same way as more robust or feature rich interfaces. Using multi-factor authentication for a web interface is useless if a mobile application allows access to the same APIs with a four-digit PIN. 15 Transitive Ownership – IoT components are often sold or transferred during their lifespan. Plan for this eventuality and be sure IoT systems can protect and isolate data to enable safe transfer of ownership, even if a component is sold or transferred to a competitor or attacker. 16 N:N Authentication – Realise that IoT does not follow a traditional 1:1 model of users to applications. Each component may have more than one user and a user may interact with multiple components. Several users might access different data or capabilities on a single device, and one user might have varying rights to multiple devices. Multiple devices may need to broker permissions on behalf of a single user account, and so on. Be sure the IoT system can handle these complex trust and authentication schemes. AOITI Basic Privacy Principles The Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) organised a workshop in 2016 in Sophia Antipolis, France, to explore and identify design principles for IoT security.107 One of the workshops was dedicated to practical privacy in IoT, and participants identified the following principles. 107 AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World, Report, 2016 AIOTI Basic Requirements on Practical Privacy in IoT 1 Common Understanding – Design, manufacturer and assemble components of Things and IoT ecosystems with clear understanding of what means what, and to what extent there is consensus in the related complex value chain and ecosystems. Promoting the goals of data protection such as limiting the scope of data processing to the necessary level; data segmentation, mapping, categorisation, purpose limitation, data isolation, and data control and data access of personal data are seen as prerequisite elements. 2 No Personal Data by Default, ‘As-If’ by Design & De-Identification by Default – Data minimalisation starts with only requesting, collecting, obtaining, deriving and processing personal data to the extent necessary (need-to- know principle), and. The ‘As-If’ principle it to design and engineer ecosystems in IoT as if these will (now or in a later phase) process personal data. The As-If principle is closely related to the privacy by design and privacy by default principles. Design de-Identification capabilities so personal data is de-identified as soon as legally possible. 3 Manufacturer-Implemented Parametrisation – Rights management for accessing data controlled by the user based on the assessment where and when a Thing or IoT ecosystems in its life cycle comes into contact with personal data, creates/derives (new) personal data, or otherwise processes personal data, while keeping in my mind the contextuality of purposes and use, as well as multi-purpose Things and IoT ecosystems. 40 41 108 press-releases/1549-2019-02-etsi-releases-first-globally-applicable- standard-for-consumer-iot-security 109 110 111 112 113 114 4 Accountability & Risk Impact Assessment by Design – Any data controller and processor to be accountable for regulatory, contractual and ethical compliance. If data is compromised, disclosed, accessed or lost, clear statement by vendors, data controllers and data processors on impact is another prerequisite. 5 Awareness & Information Supplied with Indication of Purpose – Technically regulating access to data to define who can use it for what purpose, and how that can be made transparent, and subsequently measured and monitored. Design in a transparent way, so the data subject is and remains clear and aware of privacy issues, choices it makes and possible consequences thereof. 5.1.2 Key Findings – There is no single set of IoT security and privacy principles that is internationally recognised and adopted. – The diversity in proposed IoT security principles between different countries and initiatives illustrates a lack of collaboration, especially between governments. – Due to the lack of globally-adopted principles, a language towards common understanding of shared IoT challenges and issues is lacking. Such a language is required to define a global governance process. – Consumers and companies are not uniformly aware of the cybersecurity risks and may not be equipped to respond properly. 5.2 IOT SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES While numerous standards exist in the IoT space, IoT security has not been standardised significantly until now; a recent ETSI standard is one of the first efforts to standardise IoT security.108 While numerous sets of IoT security recommendations exist, it is important to harmonise and align these for global acceptance and adoption as a precursor to developing evaluation and certification schemes. 5.2.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Standards development organisations (SDOs) such as ITU109, NIST110, ETSI111, IETF112, and ISO113 have all undertaken IoT-specific efforts. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for IoT Standards and Protocols114 profiles as many as 30 IoT standards, 15 of which have been marked to deliver “high business benefit.” Six of those are expected to become mainstream in the next five years, including the below networking standards. – 6LoWPAN: IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks is an IETF standard to deliver IPv6 connectivity over non-IP networking technologies such as NFC and LoRa using extremely low power, such that compliant devices can potentially run for years on battery power. – OneM2M: a machine-to-machine service layer that can be embedded in hardware and software to connect devices. – Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA): a proprietary standard for connecting IoT objects. – Sigfox: a proprietary low-power, low-throughput technology for IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. While many of the above standards include a security component, this section focuses on recommendations that deal with IoT security in general. Technical networking standards (including security aspects) are discussed in the section on Secure Communications and Infrastructure. The UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS), the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI), and GSMA115 have released recommendations, guidelines or good practices specifically for IoT security. We briefly discuss these below. UK Code of Practice DCMS UK has proposed a Code of Practice116 for the security of consumer IoT products and associated services. The Code identifies that many severe security issues stem from poor security design and bad practice in products sold to consumers. The guidance is listed in order of importance and, according to DCMS, the top three should be addressed as a matter of priority. 1. No default passwords, 2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy, 3. Keep software updated, 4. Securely store credentials and security-sensitive data, 5. Communicate securely, 6. Minimise exposed attack surfaces, 7. Ensure software integrity, 8. Ensure that personal data is protected, 9. Make systems resilient to outages, 10. Monitor system telemetry data, 11. Make it easy for consumers to delete personal data, 12. Make installation and maintenance of devices easy, 13. Validate input data. The Code of Practice is based on IoT security recomm- endations from the PETRAS IoT Hub117. In February 2019, the European Standards Organisation ETSI launched a globally-applicable industry standard for IoT devices based on the Code of Practice.118 It is expected that CEN/ CENELEC will also be involved in the further development and dissemination of this standard (see cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectorsold/DefenceSecurity Privacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx). ENISA Security Recommendations The Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT from ENISA119 include a number of policy, organisational and technical measures. Technical measures include the use of a hardware-based immutable root of trust, and security features such as specialised security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at the transistor level providing trusted storage of device identity, protecting keys at rest and in use, and preventing unprivileged access to security sensitive code. The overwhelming breadth and depth of coverage make this inventory impressive, but at the same time possibly challenging to implement in practice. AIOTI Recommendations for Standards AIOTI has done considerable work in this area, as referenced by the activity underway within the AIOTI Standards Working Group120 (WG03). According to AIOTI, basic requirements for IoT devices include121: – Testing and Certifying Security – Using existing, proven certifications recognised as state-of-the-art based on assessed risk level; additional introduction of a classification system to certify devices for particular use-case scenarios depending on the level of risk. 115 116 code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security 117 118 press-releases/1549-2019-02-etsi-releases-first-globally-applicable- standard-for-consumer-iot-security 119 ENISA ‘Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT’, November 2017 120 internet-things-platforms-and-standardisation-workshop 121 AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper Connected World Report 2016061642 43 122 123 124 lets-talk-about-iot-device-security 125 core_iot_cybersecurity_capabilities_baseline_considerations.pdf 126 127 128 IoT Security Guidelines Overview Document, Version 2.0, 31 October 2017 129 – Security Labels – Proven labels such as an ‘Energy efficiency label’ of appliances in order to classify the IoT device. – Preset Certified Security Structures – Encryption requirement for identities, access, communication channels and secure storage of keys and to store data at rest – also for secure boot process. – Security Rationale – Explanation of implemented security measures related to well understood hazards in order to define acceptable level security risks from any designer of IoT device, auditable by independent third party. – Information exchange – Sharing information about incidents/potential vulnerabilities between manufacturers. – Defined functions – IoT devices should only be able to perform documented functions, making sense for device/service. – Standardisation – Interoperability of components and communication protocols. NIST IoT Cybersecurity Program NIST’s Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Program122 is undertaking efforts to identify a core set of cybersecurity capabilities to form a baseline for IoT devices. In September 2018, NIST released a publication entitled “Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks” in order to help federal agencies and other organisations better understand and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with their IoT devices throughout device lifecycles123. This publication is intended to be an introductory foundation for a planned series of publications on more specific aspects of this topic. As of mid-2019, NIST is focusing on engaging with stakeholders124 via workshops, seminars and a draft discussion paper125 in order to gather feedback for a Core IoT Cybersecurity Capabilities Baseline. Industrial Internet of Things Security Framework126 Early IoT applications included industrial control systems, or Operational Technology (OT), that converged with IT to create an Industrial IoT. Such an IoT system connects and integrates industrial control systems with enterprise software and business processes and analytics to improve decision-making, operations and collaboration among a large number of increasingly autonomous control systems. The Industrial Internet Consortium’s IIoT Security Framework approaches IoT in a generic and detailed manner, and provides concrete recommendations for endpoint security, communications security, and data protection, making this report highly relevant for IoT device manufacturers. GSMA IoT Security Guidelines127 The telecommunications industry, which the GSMA represents, has a history of providing secure products and services to their customers at a very large scale. According to the GSMA, the provision of secure products and services is as much a process as it is a goal. Vigilance, innovation, responsiveness and continuous improvement are required to ensure that the solutions address the threats. To help ensure that the new IoT services coming to market are secure, the GSMA has created a comprehensive set of security guidelines128 for the benefit of service providers who are looking to develop new IoT services. Taking this a step further is GSMA’s assessment checklist129, which enables the suppliers of IoT products, services and components to self-assess the conformance of their products, services and components to the GSMA IoT Security Guidelines. Completing a GSMA IoT Security Assessment Checklist allows an entity to demonstrate the security measures they have taken to protect their products, services and components from cybersecurity risks. Assessment declarations can be made by submitting a completed declaration to the GSMA. 5.2.2 Key Findings – Security standards and guidelines are required for development and operations to stimulate the adoption of secure IoT devices. – A number of IoT security good practices, guidelines and recommendations exist, but efforts from established standards development organisations such as ETSI and NIST are very recent. – Manufacturers may not have the expertise to make use of the available guidelines and recommendation. Usability of security guidelines is a challenge and requires more research. – Harmonisation of IoT security guidelines and recommendations is required to stimulate adoption. Harmonisation should be supported by global cybersecurity research initiatives. – It is important for standardisation processes to stay aligned with technological developments without stifling innovation. 5.3 EVALUATION AND CERTIFICATION A comprehensive global IoT certification framework or self-certification solution does not yet exist; it remains an open challenge to develop globally recognised and adopted cybersecurity evaluation and certification regimes for IoT devices. Given that a system of secure components is not by definition a secure ecosystem, evaluation and certification regimes should include individual components, the wider network of systems and components, and the global ecosystem. An evaluation and certification scheme should be based on a generic and common framework, possibly with business- or application-specific provisions. Such a framework may provide assurance similar to the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC 15408). An alternative approach to certification may be to strengthen and modernise liability laws to encompass IoT products and ecosystems; this is discussed in the section on Responsible Industry Ecosystem. 5.3.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Independent laboratories such as UL130, Brightsight131, and Riscure132, as well as government bodies such as US-CERT of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, provide cybersecurity assessment and certification services and typically focus on vulnerability scanning and architecture design reviews. While they have taken early steps in IoT, they may not be ready for more comprehensive functional testing of IoT devices or for domain-specific testing; for instance, the security of a software application can be tested but not the effects that cascade from cybersecurity to functional safety. This is also because of the lack of globally-accepted IoT security standards and certification schemes to test and certify against. Trusted IoT security labels An IoT security label should give a baseline security requirement of protection, and the level of assurance for 130 risk/ - - - New Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable Products UL 2900 / ANSI new-standard-for-software-cybersecurity-for-network-connectable-products 131 132 45 133 AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World Report 20160616 134 roadmap-digitaal-veilige-hard-en-software - Roadmap digitaal veilige hard en software, 2018. By Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Netherlands, in Dutch. 135 136 Security-Compliance-Framework.pdf 137 Security-Compliance-Framework.pdf this needs to be defined. The label should provide a clear indication of the security achieved. AIOTI’s workshop on Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World133 introduced a set of possible labels: 1) Security certified by third party 2) Managed security (maintained) 3) Secure update mechanism implemented (maintainable) 4) Access-controlled device, based on “trusted manufacturer” and self-assessment of security 5) No security. Separately, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate and the Ministry of Justice and Security in the Netherlands134 have requested the industry to design a security labelling system and guidelines specifying: – Level of security, – Whether the device is automatically updated, – Lifespan of support by the manufacturer, – Device performance and functions when it is disconnected from the internet. In parallel, during the 2018 edition of the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW)135, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore hosted a leadership dialogue with various National Certification Bodies to exchange perspectives on a practical and balanced approach to address the evaluation of IoT devices, in consideration of the fact that this space is characterised by fast-moving innovations. IoT Security Foundation The IoT Security Foundation’s (IoTSF) IoT Security Compliance Framework136 aims to consistently evaluate the security of a wide range of IoT devices. To make the framework more practical across a variety of applications, IoTSF adopts a risk-based approach derived from the commonly used CIA Triad. The framework defines five Compliance Classes that achieve progressively higher levels of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability as depicted in Figure 8. – Class 0: where compromise to the data generated or loss of control is likely to result in little discernible impact on an individual or organisation. – Class 1: where compromise to the data generated or loss of control is likely to result in limited impact on an individual or organisation. – Class 2: in addition to class 1, the device is designed to resist attacks on availability that would have significant impact on an individual or organisation, or impact many individuals. For example, by limiting operations of an infrastructure to which it is connected. Compliance class Security objectives Confidentiality Integrity Availability Class 0 Basic Basic Basic Class 1 Basic Medium Medium Class 2 Medium Medium High Class 3 High Medium High Class 4 High High High Figure 8: IoTSF Compliance Classes137 – Class 3: in addition to class 2, the device is designed to protect sensitive data including sensitive personal data. – Class 4: in addition to class 3, where compromise to the data generated or loss of control have the potential to affect critical infrastructure or cause personal injury. For instance, a thermostat is considered to fall under Class 1 since – it does not store sensitive or personally-identifiable information. – it needs to report accurate data and external tampering with data values could result in business impact. – individual device unavailability would have little impact, but a DoS of multiple devices could result in significant business impact. Based on the Compliance Class determined for a particular product, a checklist of requirements is provided. Such a checklist could be made mandatory by procuring parties, as could a third-party audit to verify compliance with the checklist. Common Criteria Traditional IT products, such as firewalls and switches, are routinely subjected to Common Criteria (CC) evaluations using independent laboratories. Certificates are issued by participating national governments and recognised by signatories worldwide. The CC allows product developers to document their product’s Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in a Security Target (ST). An independent laboratory can conduct a CC evaluation to assess the product against the SFRs. The robustness of the evaluation depends on the desired Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). In theory, this approach allows an IoT product developer to demonstrate that their product meets specific security functional requirements. The flexible nature of CC evaluations allows each developer to choose the SFRs against which their product is evaluated, but this flexibility can make it difficult to compare similar products. For example, two firewall vendors could choose different SFRs and yet market their products as having achieved Common Criteria certification. To address this, Protection Profiles (PPs) exist for some types of common IT products. Each PP includes a set of SFRs along with specific test and assurance requirements. Products submitted for PP-based CC evaluations must exhibit exact conformance with the PP. Signatories to the CC Recognition Agreement (CCRA) recognise CC certification138 and specifically the collaborative Protection Profiles (cPPs)139. The cPP for Network Devices v2.1140 seems to be the profile to build on for IoT Security; however, it is noted that this cPP lacks IoT- specific criteria pertaining to, for example, device resource constraints and the heterogeneity of devices and network environments. Separately, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)141 advocates for trustworthy products and systems in the energy network and has developed a protection profile for the gateway of a smart metering system142 that follows the rules of Common Criteria in describing the threats to a certain target that needs protection and defining the minimum requirements for appropriate safety precautions. While well established, CC certification is often said to be a slow and expensive process typically costing manufacturers six figures and taking many months143. While it appears well-suited for testing computer systems for sale to governments, it may not be as appropriate for the fast- moving and low-cost world of IoT. Non-CC alternatives can 138 139 140 141 142 143 Standardisation and Certification of Safety, Security and Privacy in the ‘Internet of Things’, JRC Technical Report, Leverett et al.46 47 144 145 eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework provide a light-touch approach to certification and may prove more suitable. EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework The European Union has identified that certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the EU Digital Single Market . At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. For example, smart meter producers currently need to undergo separate certification processes in France, the UK and Germany. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificate schemes, the EU identifies an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. In this context, the EU has proposed an EU Certification Framework for ICT security products. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. ENISA will work towards implementing this certification process. The resulting certificate will be recognised in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. While the use of certification will be voluntary for the time being, the framework does avoid multiple certification processes in different Member States and creates an incentive to certify the quality and verify the security of the products and services in question. 5.3.2 Key Findings – There is a distinct lack of labels to inform end users about IoT device security and risks. However, efforts to create a labelling scheme are under way in various parts of the world. It should be ensured that these schemes are aligned in order to create a level playing field for vendors. – There are as yet no CC cPPs specifically for IoT devices. It should be determined whether these can be generic or specific to application domains. – Non-CC alternatives can provide a light-touch approach to certification and should be explored. 5.4 FUTURE-PROOF LEGISLATION Legislative policy solutions should be sufficiently flexible to deal with societal needs as well as constantly evolving technologies. Regulatory measures for IoT security should make use of inputs from consumers as well as industry representatives on the rights and responsibilities of consumers and vendors. This would help to ensure that the approach taken is effective in the present and fit for the future, and promotes innovation in an efficient way. The introduction of highly stringent measures and legislation by regulators could, counterproductively, prove restrictive for security research; it may be more effective to instead create initiatives to stimulate the development of security by the industry. Besides cybersecurity regulations, liability laws can also effectively drive IoT security; the section on Responsible Industry discusses this point. 5.4.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments There are only a few legislative efforts aimed at IoT security; we describe these below. It is noted that IoT security is differently organised in different countries, so not every cybersecurity agency is tasked with the same roles and responsibilities. While many industry organisations globally collaborate on a voluntary basis, we found a dearth of initiatives where governments work together for secure IoT. U.S. IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017 For years, cybersecurity experts have asked the US government to improve cybersecurity hygiene and use its buying power to push through new security standards.146 The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act (see text?format=txt) is a bill mandating minimal cybersecurity operational standards for Internet-connected devices purchased by U.S. Federal agencies. This can be a way to raise the bar across the industry more easily than larger, more direct legal measures. Government-purchased IoT devices would need to: – Be free of known security vulnerabilities, as defined in the NIST National Vulnerability Database147. – Have software or firmware components that accept “properly authenticated and trusted” patches from the vendor. – Use non-deprecated, industry-standard protocols for communication, encryption, and interconnection with other devices or peripherals. – Not include any “fixed or hard-coded” credentials (that is, passwords) used for remote administration, delivery of updates, or communications. – Have notification and disclosure methods in place for discovered security vulnerabilities. – Be patched or replaced to fix any vulnerability in a timely and secure manner. The legislation would also require American agencies to establish and maintain inventories of IoT devices and update them every 30 days. U.S. SMART IoT Act The State of Modern Application, Research, and Trends of IoT Act or SMART IoT Act directs the U.S. Department of Commerce to conduct a study on the state of IoT in the United States. California Senate Bill 327 California's SB 327 law148, approved in September 2018 and due to take effect in January 2020, requires all \"connected devices\" to have a \"reasonable security feature.\" Security experts point out that the law is well- intentioned and while it may not actually solve the problems that plague IoT security, it is nevertheless widely considered a good start.149,150 Privacy regulations From 2018 onwards, IoT stakeholders, including those in the supply chain, must be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and with similar privacy laws such as PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) in Singapore. The complex mesh of stakeholders involved asks for/implies the necessity of a precise allocation of legal responsibilities among them regarding the processing of the individual’s personal data, based on the specificities of their respective interventions. EU Cybersecurity Act In December 2018, the European Union passed the Cybersecurity Act151 to reinforce the mandate of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) to better support Member States with tackling cybersecurity threats and attacks. As referenced in the previous section, the Act also establishes an EU framework for cybersecurity certification, boosting the cybersecurity of online services and consumer devices. Certification is voluntary unless future EU legislation prescribes an EU certificate as a mandatory requirement to satisfy a specific security need. 146 147 148 xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327 149 150 first-iot-security-bill-reaches-governors-desk-in-california/ 151 49 152 opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity 153 network-and-information-security-nis-directive Common Position on Cybersecurity in Connected Devices The Common Position paper152 by Infineon, NXP, STMicroelectronics and ENISA proposes some key priorities for the European Commission (EC), but these priorities are globally applicable: – Define baseline requirements for security and privacy that minimise risk, are neutral in technological terms, and remain open to innovation. – Introduce a Trust Label, based on various security levels and a related risk assessment. – Ensure that reliable security processes and services are developed and support industry in implementing security features in products (e.g. through providing information and training on state-of-the art security solutions). – Encourage the development of mandatory staged requirements for IoT security and privacy. – Create an equal level playing field for cybersecurity and look into incentives to reward the use of good security practices. NIS Directive The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) was adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016153 and entered into force in August 2016 . The NIS Directive provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU by ensuring – Member States' preparedness by requiring them to be appropriately equipped, e.g. via a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and a competent national NIS authority. – cooperation among all the Member States, by setting up a cooperation group, in order to support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the exchange of information among Member States. – a culture of security across sectors that are vital for the economy and society, such as energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure. Businesses in these sectors that are identified by Member States as operators of essential services are required to take appropriate security measures and notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority. 5.4.2 Key Findings – Although there are numerous industry initiatives and best practices in this area, their adoption is voluntary. IoT security legislation is in its infancy and virtually non- existent outside the US and EU. – Enforcing procurement by governments of secure IoT devices can contribute towards IoT security when large countries participate; smaller economies such as Singapore and the Netherlands can work together for greater impact. The EU’s single digital market approach can support IoT security as well. 5.5 RESPONSIBLE INDUSTRY ECOSYSTEM The market for IoT devices is global. Within this competitive industry, time-to-market, usability and cost are key considerations. The razor-thin margins for IoT devices leave suppliers with less to spend on security. From the perspectives of cybersecurity and national security, security must also become part of the business equation; the cost of implementing security functionality needs to be offset in some manner. Currently, owing to the lack of enforcement of security in IoT devices, there is no level playing field for IoT device vendors nor a common expectation of security functionality. 5.5.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments The competitive advantage in the IoT industry is currently focused on time-to-market rather than secure-to-market. This balance should be shifted so that a specific level of security and privacy is required before market release. Defining security frameworks supported by baseline security measures can be a way forward in this direction. The use of certification and labelling can encourage better understanding and transparency in terms of IoT security and can additionally benefit end users and consumers by educating them and making them more aware of IoT security. Alternatively and perhaps complementarily, liability laws can be strengthened and modernised to hold manufacturers accountable in the event of a breach. Regardless of the regulatory approach adopted, it is important for cybersecurity regulators as well as the industry to work together and act as a global community that learns from incidents and vulnerabilities proactively. This requires an open culture of sharing incidents and mutual learning. Liability Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held responsible for damage caused by those products. The Dutch roadmap for safe hardware and software154 has identified liability laws as a key driver for IoT security. Liability litigation historically focused on negligence on the part of the vendor, or a breach of warranty. Under the notion of strict liability, the manufacturer is liable if the product is defective even if the manufacturer was not negligent in making that product defective155. The manufacturer thus becomes a de facto insurer against its defective products, with premiums built into the product's price. Strict liability also seeks to diminish the impact of information asymmetry between manufacturers and consumers: manufacturers have better knowledge of their own products' dangers than do consumers; therefore, manufacturers should bear the burden of finding, correcting, and warning consumers of those dangers. The 1985 European Product Liability Directive156 created a regime of strict liability for defective products: according to this Directive, a product is “defective” when it does not provide the “safety which a person is entitled to expect” (Article 6). While one may assume that this provides a baseline of liability for IoT devices, the use of the term “safety” is telling – security issues that are not outright safety defects may not be addressed at all unless those security issues can be proven to cascade into safety losses or traditional damage such as harm to human health or property. Even more fundamentally, Article 2 of the Directive states that it applies to “movables” – while this may have seemed perfectly reasonable in the 80s for products such as toasters or lawn mowers, for modern connected devices this terminology may entirely exclude the connectivity and server-side components. A recent EU research report157 identifies that vendors may take advantage of this by simply placing critical functionality on the server in order to escape liability.

By Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Netherlands, in Dutch. 155 156 Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0374:en:HTML 157 Standardisation and Certification of Safety, Security and Privacy in the ‘Internet of Things’, JRC Technical Report, Leverett et al. 50 51 158 Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation - 159 160 161 162 163 Liability issues for IoT need to be addressed in the context of global and national legislation and case law; in most cases, liability legislation will need to be modernised to account for the unique nature of the IoT ecosystem. Industry collaborations The inventory of initiatives in Annex B shows a substantial number of industry collaborations. AIOTI158 is an example of industry collaboration that promotes good practices across the diverse IoT ecosystem. The IoT Consortium159 is an industry body that aims to stimulate the growth of the IoT market by leading the industry’s efforts through strategic partnerships. Specifically, it generates opportunities for companies to meet and collaborate, forms industry committees to identify and address areas of common concern, exercises thought leadership in driving forward the most important conversations on IoT at industry events and in the press, promotes business development opportunities, and leads efforts to raise IoT awareness among consumers, sales channels, and investors. IoT-EPI160 is a European initiative for industry collaborations in IoT platform development. At the core of IoT-EPI are seven research and innovation projects: Inter-IoT, BIG IoT, AGILE, symbIoTe, TagItSmart!, VICINITY and bIoTope. Each project is run by several industry partners in collaboration and aims to solve one of the issues currently faced by the IoT ecosystem. For instance, Big IoT161 addresses the interoperability gap by defining a generic, unified Web API for smart object platforms, with the intention of establishing a marketplace where platform, application, and service providers can easily monetise their assets. Big IoT is spearheaded by Siemens AG (Germany), Bosch Software Innovations (Germany), and Atos (Austria). Within these initiatives the role of governments is limited; indeed, close collaboration between governments appears uncommon. Within the European Union, ENISA162 is a key player in this domain to establish collaborations. 5.5.2 Key Findings – Owing to the lack of legislation and regulation to enforce security in IoT devices, there is no level playing field for IoT device vendors nor a common expectation of security functionality. – Liability is likely to be an effective mechanism to drive the industry towards IoT security, but legislation needs to be modernised to address IoT. – Encouragingly, numerous industry collaborations exist and provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and mutual learning; however, the role of governments in such initiatives appears limited especially outside the EU. 5.6 SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY Modern products are assemblies of parts and components supplied by multiple vendors. To accelerate time-to-market and to reduce costs, device manufacturers increasingly use as many as possible off-the-shelf components using complex, globally distributed, and interconnected supply chains composed of various entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing. However, vulnerabilities can be introduced and exploited at any point in the supply chain.163 Cyber supply chain risks include the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorised production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices upstream. 5.6.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Managing cyber supply chain risks requires ensuring the integrity, security, quality and resilience of the supply chain and its products and services. Supply chain security is an often-overlooked component in IoT security even though, by some estimates, up to 80% of breaches may originate in the supply chain164. In 2011, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimated165 the cost of electronics counterfeiting at US$7.5 billion per year in lost revenue. Device compromise in transit and component-level vulnerabilities are other supply chain risks that can lead to significant consequences. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)166 identifies Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) as the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the distributed and interconnected nature of IT/OT products and service supply chains.167 NIST’s workshop on Best Practices in C-SCRM168 discussed that the global complexity of supply chains, the increase in potential disruptions, and emerging cybersecurity risks to the supply chain have dramatically increased the risks that: – Suppliers could intentionally or unintentionally introduce software, firmware, or hardware in which confidentiality, integrity or availability has been compromised. – Supply chain disruptions could create a scramble for parts that enables poor quality or counterfeit products to enter the supply chain. – High-value intellectual property shared with suppliers could be misused. – Service suppliers – including contract manufacturers, outsourced legal and accounting, and repair and maintenance providers – could tamper with a company’s information based on their access to a company’s information system, if the data is not adequately protected. – Adversaries can use vulnerabilities of different components within the supply chain to attack a company’s information systems. IoT supply chain risks, and more generally IT supply chain risks, are associated with an organisation’s decreased visibility into, and understanding of, how the technology they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed.169 Maintaining sufficient controls to minimise risk and maximise transparency requires close relationships with vendors, clear understanding of the risks involved and strict adherence to procedure. According to NIST, a primary objective of C-SCRM is to identify, assess, and mitigate “products and services that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the cyber supply chain.” C-SCRM activities include: – Determining cybersecurity requirements for suppliers, – Enacting cybersecurity requirements through formal agreement (e.g., contracts), – Communicating to suppliers how those cybersecurity requirements will be verified and validated, – Verifying that cybersecurity requirements are met through a variety of assessment methodologies, – Governing and managing the above activities. 164 Combatting Cyber Risks in the Supply Chain - room/whitepapers/analyst/combatting-cyber-risks-supply-chain-36252 165 president_testifies_at_ senate_armed_services_committee_on_dangers_ of_counterfeit_chips/ 166 167 168 Management/documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-SCRM- Business-Case.pdf 169 NIST Special Publication 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organisations52 53 The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)170 provides 12 principles for supply chain security, including the establishment of minimum security needs for suppliers and building security considerations into contracting processes (and ensuring that the suppliers do the same). While the principles proposed by NCSC may appear intuitive, they are followed by a surprisingly low percentage of organisations. The U.K. Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2016171 survey showed that, while most businesses have rules or controls for their own operations (and most medium or large organisations have formally documented their approaches), they are much less likely to set minimum standards for their suppliers: only 13% were seen to do this. 170 171 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, Klahr et al, Ipsos MORI, DCMS UK Supplier Supplier Supplier Supplier External service provider Supplier Supplier External service provider Supplier Supplier Supplier External service provider External service provider System integrator External service provider Organisation Figure 10: Organisational Supply Chain (Source: NIST) Supply chain security is predicated on careful supplier management. Examples of best practices in supplier management from a security perspective include the following172. – Procurement and sourcing processes are developed jointly with input from IT, security, engineering, and operations personnel; sourcing decisions receive multi- stakeholder input. – Standard security terms and conditions are included in all requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts, tailored to the type of contract and business needs. – Since many risk assessments depend on supplier self- evaluation, a number of companies employ on-site verification and validation of these reviews. Some companies cross-train personnel to be stationed at supplier companies so that security criteria can be monitored year-round. – New suppliers enter a test and assessment period – to test the capabilities of the supplier and its compliance with various requirements – before they actively join the supply chain. In high risk areas, for example, a supplier might go through a series of pilots before they fully enter the supply chain. – Quarterly reviews of supplier performance are assessed among a stakeholder group. – Annual supplier meetings ensure that suppliers understand the customers’ business needs, concerns and security priorities. – Mentoring and training programs are offered to suppliers, especially in difficult or key areas of concern to the company, such as cybersecurity. It may be noted that organisations wield both contractual and economic power over suppliers: contracts can stipulate security requirements and penalties in detail, and economic clout can be multiplied via industry and inter-governmental alliances. According to NIST, organisations can pose the following specific questions173 to suppliers to determine the 1. UNDERSTAND THE RISKS – Understand what needs to be protected and why – Know who your suppliers are and build an understanding of what their security looks like – Understand the security risk posed by your supply chain 2. ESTABLISH CONTROL – Communicate your view of security needs to your suppliers – Set and communicate minimum security requirements for your suppliers – Build security considerations into your contracting process and require that your suppliers do the same – Meet your own security responibilities as a supplier and consumer – Raise awareness of security within your supply chain – Provide support for security incidents 3. CHECK YOUR ARRANGEMENTS – Build assurance activities into your approach to managing your supply chain 4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT – Encourage the continuous improvement of security within your supply chain – Build trust with suppliers Figure 11: Principles of Supply Chain Security (Source: NCSC/CPNI) 172 Best-Practices 173 documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-Supply-Chain-Best-Practices.pdf54 55 risk levels associated with their suppliers’ cybersecurity practices. – Is the supplier’s software/hardware design process documented? Repeatable? Measurable? – How is configuration management performed? Quality assurance? How is code tested for quality or vulnerabilities? – What steps are taken to “tamper proof” products? Are backdoors closed? – Is the mitigation of known vulnerabilities factored into product design (through product architecture, run-time protection techniques, code review)? – How does the supplier stay current on emerging vulnerabilities? What are the capabilities to address new “zero day” vulnerabilities? – What controls are in place to manage and monitor production processes? – What levels of malware protection and detection are performed? – What physical security measures are in place? Documented? Audited? – What access controls, both cyber and physical, are in place? How are they documented and audited? – How do they protect and store customer data? How is the data encrypted? – How long is the data retained? – How is the data destroyed when the partnership is dissolved? – What type of employee background checks are conducted and how frequently? – What security practice expectations are set for upstream suppliers? How is adherence to these standards assessed? – How secure is the distribution process? Have approved and authorised distribution channels been clearly documented? – What is the component disposal risk and mitigation strategy? – How does the supplier ensure security throughout the product life-cycle? NIST’s workshop on Best Practices in C-SCRM further identified174 that vetting supply chain partners beyond the first tier is a challenge for many companies: manual methods can be difficult and do not scale for companies with hundreds or thousands of tier-one suppliers and numerous sub-tier suppliers. Additionally, smaller companies lack the economic power and relationships to get the information they need. To fill these gaps, consultants such as BitSight175 offer to collect, manage and centralise supplier risk management data. This can result in increased efficiencies for organisations as well as reduce the burden on suppliers who may be asked to fill out similar informational forms for each customer. According to ENISA’s Baseline Recommendations176, “For IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it is necessary to adopt cyber supply chain risk management policies and to communicate cyber security requirements to suppliers and partners.” Standards such as ISO28000177 specify supply chain security requirements in sufficient detail to allow self-declaration of conformance by an organisation or, alternatively, third-party certification by an accredited body to demonstrate contribution to supply chain security. Emphasising the importance of supply chain risks, NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF)178, which is published as NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, integrates supply chain risk management concepts into the RMF to protect against untrustworthy suppliers, insertion of counterfeits, tampering, unauthorised production, theft, insertion of 174 Management/documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-SCRM-Vendor- Selection-and-Management.pdf 175 176 Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, ENISA, Nov 2017 177 178 Risk-Management-Framework-(RMF)-Overview malicious code, and poor manufacturing and development practices throughout the SDLC. 5.6.2 Key Findings – IoT hardware and software manufacturers and suppliers should adopt a cyber supply chain risk management framework (ISO28000, NIST). – Cybersecurity requirements, risk and liability should be cascaded into the supply chain via contractual agreements. Organisations wield both contractual and economic power over suppliers. – It is important to encourage the use of open frameworks and provide transparency for supply chain security information flows. 5.7 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE SUPPORT Building a device today that will stand up to the ever- evolving security requirements of the next several years without any updates or modifications may well be impossible; in the absence of patching and device management, devices quickly become outdated from a security perspective. However, updates typically require changes in device firmware – this makes it difficult for regular users to manage these devices. Remote update capability needs to be designed into the device to allow security updates, yet, the specialised operating systems used for embedded devices may not support this by default. Further, the life cycle for IoT devices varies widely in duration: industrial devices may be in the field for decades, consumer products such as smart home appliances or autonomous vehicles could run for about 10 years, and wearables may be in use for only a year or two. Clearly, managing IoT device lifecycles is a tremendous challenge. 5.7.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments As ABI Research identifies179, lifecycle device management offers manufacturers the ability to continue providing value long after a device has been sold and even re-sold; however, that management service only has value if it can be tied securely back to the device. Secure hardware (such as secure elements and secure MCUs) is at the forefront of providing this trust. Without this process, any future service provisioning for the device post-market is vulnerable. The increased recognition that this opportunity cannot be realised without trust is a potential driver for industry adoption of secure hardware. Soos et al180 present a model for IoT device lifecycle management that maps the phases of the IoT device lifecycle to three broad life stages: Beginning of Life (BoL), Middle of Life (MoL) and End of Life (EoL). Figure 12 depicts the security features and functions that should be in place during each step of a device’s lifecycle.181 During initialisation or boot-up, a firmware integrity check and secure boot process should be used to ensure that firmware and bootloader software have not been modified or tampered with. Once initialisation is complete, the communication between device and device, device and the Internet, or device and user interface (through mobile apps or web apps) should be encrypted. Authentication should use a second factor wherever possible, and default passwords must be changed. During normal operation, monitoring, analytics and audit procedures should be in place. The device should detect abnormal events and operations and provide a warning to the backend and/or end user. Secure firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates should themselves be integrity-checked and verified before installation. 179 IoT Security: From Design to Life Cycle Management, ABI Research 180 IoT Device Lifecycle – a Generic Model and a use case for Cellular Mobile Networks, Soos et al, Conference Paper Aug 2018 181 Device Life Cycle Overview, Steven Hsu, Trend Micro Whitepaper, Security%20Whitepaper.pdf56 57 According to AIOTI182, device management is defined as software or firmware updates as well as configuration or fault and performance management. Device management can be performed using existing protocols e.g. BBF TR-069183 or OMA LWM2M184. Vulnerability Disclosure History shows that vulnerabilities are invariably found after a product is deployed – and often exploited in “zero-day” attacks. It is vital to be able to detect unforeseen vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live IoT deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and remediate. A strategy to deal with discovered threats and vulnerabilities includes a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) program that balances security with the interests of manufacturers and stakeholders, as well as a clear understanding of liability. CVD is standardised by the ISO185 under ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111.

Platform-Based Device Lifecycle Management The growth of IoT has led to the emergence of cloud-based IoT platforms from many cloud service providers (CSPs) such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Most of these offer comprehensive device management functions across the device lifecycle, e.g. device registration/ enrolment, identity management, provisioning, permissions, monitoring and troubleshooting, status queries, and over- the-air (OTA) firmware updates. Platforms allow IoT users scale device fleets and may help to reduce the cost and effort of managing large and diverse IoT device deployments. Microsoft Azure, in particular, has comprehensive device management functionality built into its IoT Hub.186 This includes the use of a “device twin” for each connected physical device that stores device metadata and essentially acts a proxy for the actual device.

Updates should be delivered and deployed using a secure and verifiable methodology. – Device manufacturers should adopt a secure software development lifecycle, with a documented vulnerability management process in accordance with ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111. – The manufacturer should bear responsibility for an IoT device throughout its product lifecycle, including a responsibility to manage suppliers. – Existing device lifecycle management protocols include OMA LWM2M. Cloud-based IoT platforms offer comprehensive, albeit unstandardised, device management functionality. 5.8 DEVICE IDENTITY AND ROOT OF TRUST The raison d'être for the Internet of Things are the Things themselves, i.e. the devices that interact directly with the physical world, measuring and sometimes controlling their environments. Securing these devices presents a challenge that is somewhat distinct from securing a laptop or a mobile phone. In this section we specifically discuss the security of the device and its firmware; the supply chain for the device and the management of its lifecycle are equally important and discussed in dedicated sections above. The device may run a minimal operating system (OS) and application and is expected to provide them with the necessary computational and storage resources as well as a secure execution environment. It is also noted that device security is closely linked to the security of its communication, since the device includes a connectivity module and authenticates itself as an initial step during any communicative exchange. Therefore, there are close links between the material discussed in this section and that presented in the sections on OS, communication, lifecycle and supply chain. We refer to the depiction of a generic IoT device presented in Chapter 2. IoT devices are extremely varied in nature and may consist of some or all of the components depicted the figure. All IoT devices include sensors: these might be temperature sensors, motion sensors, air quality sensors, or light sensors, to name a few. These sensors automatically collect information from the environment. Some devices may contain actuators for moving or controlling a system or mechanism. Devices also contain power supplies, often batteries; managing and replacing these batteries is a major operational consideration for IoT. There is a module that provides connectivity, although the nature of this connectivity varies widely. There is also a certain amount of processing power provided by a microcontroller unit (MCU), storage such as NVRAM, and often a minimal operating system and an application running on it. It may be argued that the smaller the device, the harder it is to protect. With IoT devices we do not have the luxury of measuring memory in gigabytes, nor of measuring processing power by the number of cores. Most IoT devices have a microcontroller rather than a full-fledged microprocessor, and speeds in MHz rather than GHz. Additionally, the low cost of these devices means razor-thin margins for the supplier and less to spend on security. Nevertheless, security should be part of an IoT device from an early design stage and is something that should never be passed over in the interest of decreasing manufacturing costs or time to market. Once designed, IoT devices are mass-produced. There may be thousands to millions of similar IoT devices. With consideration for the requirements and capabilities of these devices, the design should be fundamentally secure. Cryptographic identifiers are a common approach, but these are vulnerable because many devices manage secret keys with software, which if breached can expose the key. This leads to the challenge (as identified by ENISA187 and MITRE188) of establishing a chain of trust based on a root of trust embedded in the device. 5.8.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Recent developments focus on the device elements that are important from a security viewpoint: root of trust (which can physically reside in the processor or storage, or on a separate chip), firmware, and storage. Root of Trust A root of trust (RoT) is a hardware or software component that is inherently trusted189 due to its immutability. A RoT must be secure by design, should be small and protected and ideally implemented in hardware or protected by hardware. RoTs are trusted to perform or support one or more security-critical functions, e.g. verify software, protect cryptographic keys, and perform device authentication190. In fact, a RoT anchors several of the security functionalities that we discuss below and in subsequent sections. The main uses of the RoT include the following. – Identity: The RoT can securely hold a device identifier that can be queried by communicating entities. – Authentication: Secure communication is available after successfully completing an authentication and key exchange protocol, typically using an ephemeral symmetric session key for encryption and an HMAC key for authentication. These keys can be generated and stored in the RoT, keeping them protected from on-chip attacks. – Data Encryption: Encryption can protect data stored locally on the device as well as data transmitted over networks. The RoT can store encryption keys. Only indirect access to these keys is allowed and managed by permissions and policies on the application layer. – Secure Boot: Validation of the code and/or data on the device following power-up, based on trusted material stored within the RoT. This prevents the execution of unauthorised code and the exposure of embedded boot code and software IP. 187 ENISA ‘Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT’, November 2017 188 189 190 understanding-hardware-roots-of-trust-2017q4.html Identity Secure Boot Authentication Data Encryption ROOT OF TRUST Figure 15: Root of Trust Functionalities 60 61 GlobalPlatform defines191 a Secure Element (SE) as a tamper-resistant platform (typically a one-chip secure microcontroller) capable of securely hosting applications and their confidential and cryptographic data (e.g. keys). On the other hand, GlobalPlatform defines a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)192 as a secure area within a main processor that runs in an isolated environment and guarantees that the code and data loaded within are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the full power of a device's main processor and memory, but hardware isolation protects these components from applications running in the main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolations inside the TEE protect trusted applications from each other. Two common hardware technologies that support TEE are ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX. Synopsys’ DesignWare tRoot Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) also provide a TEE (see hw-secure-module). In a similar vein, a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)193 is a cryptographic coprocessor that is present in many commercial PCs and servers. The TPM specification is a recommendation from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) to securely identify individual connected devices and to securely generate and store keys within these devices. However, the inclusion of a TPM in IoT devices does lead to increased costs and resource requirements. Cisco’s implementation of a hardware RoT is the Trust Anchor. Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI194) credentials including the a SUDI certificate, the associated key pair, and its entire certificate chain are stored in the tamper resistant Trust Anchor chip. The identity is implemented at manufacturing and chained to a publicly identifiable root Certificate Authority (CA). The hardware chip is used as an anchor for a secure boot process. The Trust Anchor is compliant with NIST specifications and provides a NIST SP 800-90A195 and B certifiable Random Number Generator (RNG) that extracts entropy from a true random source within the chip. Similar to the Trust Anchor, Google’s Titan security chip196 offers secure boot as well as an end-to-end cryptographic identity system for the servers in Google’s data centres as well as the Pixel mobile phone. The Titan chip's manufacturing process generates unique keying material for each chip, and securely stores this material into a registry database. The contents of this database are cryptographically protected using keys maintained in an offline quorum-based Titan Certification Authority (Titan CA). Individual Titan chips can generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) directed at the Titan CA, which – under the direction of a quorum of Titan identity administrators – can verify the authenticity of the CSRs using the information in the registry database before issuing identity certificates.197 While the chip may not yet offer a practical solution for Class 0-2 IoT devices owing to cost considerations, it does provide a good indicator of the direction of RoT security. Having said that, a general drawback of CA-based approaches is that the CA must be secure and trustworthy; the DigiNotar incident198 has illustrated that CAs may themselves be vulnerable. 191 Secure-Element-15May2018.pdf 192 Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf 193 194 docs/trust-anchor-technologies-ds-45-734230.pdf 195 196 titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext 197 titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext 198 SIM and eSIM A Subscriber Identity Module, widely known as a SIM card, securely stores a user’s mobile phone number and associated symmetric key. The traditional SIM card is a removable piece of plastic – a smart microprocessor chip built on universal integrated circuit card (UICC) technology, which is inserted into a mobile device for use on GSM and successor networks. The key is programmed during manufacture and used by mobile network operators to authenticate and identify devices accessing their networks and services. The SIM has played a pivotal role in the rise of mobile communications over the last few decades – today, 4.8 billion people use mobile services worldwide and there are 400 million cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) connections. SIM cards can also support additional security capabilities that can be harnessed for IoT199; indeed, a SIM card can act as a secure RoT to provision and store digital certificates and other kinds of security credentials, such as passwords. These credentials can be used to identify and authenticate an IoT device to interact with a server-side application or IoT platform.200 With the advent of IoT, remote provisioning has also become an important requirement for SIM cards.201 Remote provisioning is the ability to remotely change the SIM profile on a deployed SIM card without having to physically change the SIM card itself. As GSMA identifies202, replacing physical SIM cards is problematic for many IoT/M2M use cases, given that many IoT devices are remotely located, often hermetically sealed, and have lengthy lifespans. GSMA highlights that many of the interfaces and processes needed to make the remote provisioning of SIMs work are virtually identical to current SIM personalisation processes and interfaces used by mobile operators today. Remote provisioning capability can be deployed on both removable and non-removable UICCs: the term embedded UICC (eUICC) is used to refer to a SIM card that can be remotely provisioned. An embedded SIM (eSIM) is one that supports remote provisioning and is physically integrated into the device during manufacture. 199 Case Study: Leveraging the SIM to Secure IoT Services, GSMA 200 Solutions to Enhance IoT Authentication Using SIM Cards (UICC), GSMA IoT, 2016 201 The future of the SIM: potential market and technology implications for the mobile ecosystem, GSMA Intelligence, Feb 2017 202 Reprogrammable Embedded Removable Non-programmable Traditional SIM Future mainstream Figure 16: SIM card Form Factor and Programmability (Source: GSMA Intelligence) 62 Challenge C R1 ≠ R2 ≠ R3 ≠ R4 PUF1 PUF2 PUF3 PUF4 R1 R2 R3 R4 Figure 17: Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) 63 Remote provisioning technology has been deployed widely in the IoT/M2M market: IHS Markit reported 108.9m eSIM shipments in 2016.203 Also in 2016, the GSMA published the eSIM technical specification204 for connecting consumer companion devices (such as tablets, smart watches and fitness devices) as well as handsets; future growth is expected to be driven by consumer as well as IoT devices. Physical Unclonable Functions A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is an interesting approach to device identification that does not require key storage. A PUF provides a silicon biometric that is unique for every chip, reacting to an input in an unpredictable (but repeatable) way due to the complex interaction of the stimulus with the physical microstructure of the chip, and deriving its uniqueness from uncontrolled variations in the chip manufacturing process. PUFs are increasingly used as building blocks in many secure systems for applications such as device authentication and secret key generation, providing an attractive alternative to storing secret random bits in volatile or non-volatile memory by instead generating these bits every time the PUFs are evaluated. Several vendors offer commercial PUF implementations including Intrinsic ID205 and Verayo206, both of which deliver identification and authentication solutions based on their respective PUF technologies. Intrinsic ID’s Spartan authentication module207 is specifically intended for IoT devices, using PUFs to provision products with secure keys and platform-compliant certificates in a scalable and cost- efficient way while also offering integration with the AWS IoT cloud platform. 203 204 205 206 207 Attestation and Privacy Consider a device communicating with a server that wants assurance of the device’s identity, i.e. the server wants the device to authenticate itself. However, the device (more specifically, its user) may want privacy and therefore may require that the server only learns that the device is trusted. In principle, the problem could be solved by embedding a single secret key in every device and in the server, or using public-key cryptography with a single private key across all devices and a public key in the server. However, if any one device were compromised and the secret key extracted and published, the server would no longer be able to distinguish between real devices and fake ones. To address this, TCG initially proposed an intermediate certification authority called the Privacy CA, which has the obvious drawback that the Privacy CA208 needs to be involved in every transaction and thus must be highly available and yet as secure as an ordinary CA that normally operates online. The newer Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) scheme is a digital signature algorithm supporting anonymity, allowing devices to uniquely authenticate themselves without the need for a Privacy CA . Unlike traditional digital signing, in which an entity has a public verification key corresponding to a single private signing key, DAA provides a common group public verification key associated with many unique private signing keys. DAA was created so that a device could prove its membership of a trusted group to an external party without needing to provide device identity. The DAA scheme was adopted by TCG as part of TPM 1.2.209 Intel’s Enhanced Privacy ID210 (EPID) is an enhancement of DAA that allows revocation of a private key given a signature created by that key, even if the key itself is still unknown. Also, each private key is actually a large set of key values, and a device can use a different key value in every transaction. This prevents anyone – including the manufacturer, the verifier, and the certificate authority – from tracing the key back to the root key or from identifying multiple transactions as emanating from the same device. EPID is the basis of Secure Device Onboard211 (SDO), a service developed by Intel that securely brings IoT devices online in an automated manner. SDO attests the device and connects it to the owner's IoT platform, and is supported by several IoT platform providers including AWS and Google. Firmware and Secure Boot When power is first switched on, a device is relatively dumb and can read only part of its storage called read-only memory (ROM) or firmware. For complex devices, the firmware (called Basic Input-Output System, or BIOS) typically initiates a multi-step procedure, calling code at the Master Boot Record (MBR) which in turn calls a bootloader to run a larger program such as an operating system. An alternative to BIOS is offered by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI); modern versions of Linux and Windows support UEFI with BIOS backward compatibility.212 Simpler embedded devices often have (minimal) software systems entirely in ROM firmware or flash memory; little or no loading is necessary. Some designs may use an intermediate technique where minimal bootloader-like code is loaded into device RAM by the integrated boot ROM.213 208 209 210 papers/intel-epid-iot-security-white-paper.pdf 211 onboard.html 212 213 Fundamentals-of-Booting-for-Embedded-Processors64 65 Regardless of the exact design used, implementing a secure boot process is critical to device integrity214 since a compromised boot process allows hackers to inject malware or entirely replace firmware (“boot kit”), leaving the entirety of a connected system vulnerable. A secure boot process also makes other security features available to the operating system and applications by providing a necessary degree of trust. At its simplest, a secure boot process prevents the execution of unauthorised code at the time of device power-up and prevents the exposure of embedded boot code and software IP. A secure boot can be achieved in different ways, including using digitally signed binaries, secure and trusted boot loaders, boot file encryption, and security microprocessors. The UEFI Forum is an industry body that advocates a standardised interface for secure booting. UEFI’s Root of Trust white paper215 addresses the use of hardware roots of trust such as AMD’s Platform Security Processor and ARM’s TrustZone. UEFI216 Secure Boot, specified by the UEFI 2.3.1 Errata C specification217 (or higher), describes a boot process that prevents the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature. 214 iot-security-starts-with-secure-boot 215 paper_Final%208%208%2016%20%28003%29.pdf 216 217 BIOS/UEFI BOOTLOADER OS KERNEL – The device is turned on and the BIOS/UEFI firmware initialises the hardware. – The firmware calls the code at the MBR to run the bootloader. For UEFI, the bootloader is loaded from a disk partition. – The bootloader finds and loads an OS kernel into memory. Figure 18: Typical Boot-Up Process for Complex (Class 2) Devices UEFI SECURE BOOT BOOTLOADER OS KERNEL – The device is turned on and UEFI firmware initialises the hardware. – UEFI firmware verifies the bootloader using a signature database. – The bootloader loads OS kernel and drivers into memory. These may also be verified EFI binaries. Figure 19: Secure Boot Process When Secure Boot is active, the UEFI firmware is responsible for verifying components such as drivers and bootloader. At commissioning, the device is initially placed in Setup Mode, which allows a public part of a Platform Key (PK) to be written to the firmware. The private part of the PK is used to sign a Key Exchange Key (KEK) which protects a signature database. Following this, Secure Boot enters User Mode, where only drivers and loaders whose signatures match the database can be loaded by the firmware. If an invalid binary is loaded while Secure Boot is enabled, the user is alerted, and the system will refuse to boot with the tampered binary. Additional signatures can be added to the database, but they must be signed by the private part of the KEK. While Secure Boot mitigates the problem of untrusted firmware, care must be taken in system design to protect secure boot databases. In addition, vendors must develop security processes to protect various signing keys and to sign only approved payloads218. Seven Properties of Highly Secured Devices Microsoft Research has identified seven properties219 that highly secured devices need to have: hardware based root- of-trust, small trusted computing base, defence in depth, compartmentalisation, certificate-based authentication, security renewal, and failure reporting. Microsoft’s Azure Sphere platform is designed around these properties, offering a secured, connected, crossover microcontroller unit (MCU), a custom high-level Linux-based operating system (OS), and a cloud-based security service. The Azure Sphere MCU, along with its operating system and application platform, enables the creation of secured, internet-connected devices that can be updated, controlled, monitored, and maintained remotely.220 Specifically, the MCU’s Pluton Security Subsystem generates its own key pairs, implements a true random number generator (RNG), and accelerates cryptographic operations,221 enabling measured boot as well as remote attestation. Local Device Storage Stored data should always be protected with encryption222. Of course, a technique commonly used in IoT is to not store data locally but send it to a server where it can be easily encrypted. Having said that, some devices incorporate local self-encrypting drives (SEDs) that provide confidentiality while being easy to use and manage and having minimal impact on system performance. At the most basic level, SEDs provide hardware-based data security by continuously scrambling data using a key as it is written to the drive, and then descrambling the data as it is retrieved. The contents of an SED are always encrypted, and the encryption keys are themselves encrypted and protected in hardware that cannot be accessed by other parts of the system. The SED standards223 from TCG enable encryption to be built into drives, improving security while avoiding the overhead of software encryption and ensuring that equipment can be cleansed for reuse simply by telling the drive to change its key. As with TPM, the SED standard is available in a wide variety of interoperable products, including hard drives, solid state drives, hybrid drives and enterprise storage systems, from a variety of vendors. SEDs are already in use in a number of devices, including printers, copiers and multi-function devices as well as point of sale systems. 218 pdf 219 SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf 220 what-is-azure-sphere 221 222 223 storage-work-group-storage-security-subsystem-class-opal/66 67 Key Provisioning The provisioning of cryptographic keys into devices is a critical initial step in establishing a security baseline. This provisioning is done in one of three ways224: – Pre-provisioning: Secure Elements (SEs) destined for IoT devices are typically purchased from a silicon vendor with all required keys pre-provisioned on the chip by this vendor. This means that the IoT device maker does not need to deal with provisioning keys for his device, but the SE approach comes with downsides such as increased costs and complexity in purchasing, supply chain and inter-chip interfacing. – Key Injection: Cryptographic keys can be injected into a device at different points in the supply chain. After injection, the keys are stored on the device. Most widely used embedded key storage methods are based on Non- Volatile Memory (NVM) such as Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), Flash, or One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory such as fuses and anti-fuses. With these memory types, the provisioning of root keys comes with trade-offs among flexibility, key-exposure liability, cost, reliability and security. – On-board Key Generation: An internal Random Number Generator (RNG) on the chip can derive a random secret and use it to generate cryptographic keys. This method increases the flexibility within the supply chain compared to key injection (assuming the target chip contains a random number generator), but it does not make any difference regarding how the root key is stored. 5.8.2 Key Findings – A hardware RoT is the only immutable trust anchor; the chain of trust should build on a hardware RoT. Currently, only 4% of IoT devices use a hardware RoT.225 – RoT-based cybersecurity can be provided by several solutions including Secure Elements, TPMs, TEEs, Cisco Trust Anchor, Microsoft’s Pluton Security Subsystem, and SIM cards. – Solutions to secure firmware and booting are being proposed as a joint effort of the hardware and software industry, however, their adoption for IoT devices is still in the initial stage. 224 Protecting the IoT With Invisible Keys, Intrinsic ID Whitepaper, 2018 225 IoT Security from Design to Lifecycle Management, An Embedded Perspective; ABI Research, 2018. Pre-provisioning: The use of a secure element may increase cost and complexity Key injection: non-volatile memory can be provisioned with keys early in the supply chain On-board Key Generation: Using an RNG, keys can be generated internally on the chip Figure 20: Key Provisioning (Source: Intrinsic ID) 5.9 SECURE OS, CLOUD AND APPLICATIONS Large amounts of data are generated as a consequence of the interaction between IoT devices and the physical world. In general, software applications running on an operating system collect and process this data. Given the resource constraints of IoT devices, computationally-intensive data processing is usually performed in a back-end system, which is usually part of a cloud environment. The operating system and applications on the device as well as the back- end operating system and applications need to be provisioned with appropriate security controls. 5.9.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Russell226 provides a practical guide to support developers and architects in building secure IoT systems. Open source software – particularly copyleft licenses – may not always be the first choice of industry but offer higher code quality and more secure code due to the increased numbers of contributors and reviewers227. Operating Systems IoT device operating systems are typically referred to as \"embedded\" or \"real-time” operating systems, reflecting their minimal nature and time-critical response requirements. Traditional operating systems such as Windows and iOS were not designed for IoT applications: they consume too much power, need capable processors, and in some cases, lack features such as guaranteed real- time response. Consequently, a wide range of IoT-specific operating systems has been developed to suit many different hardware footprints and feature needs. IoT-focused operating systems include VxWorks, ARM Mbed OS, Zephyr, Nucleus RTOS, Contiki and TinyOS. Hahm et al228 present a well-founded analysis of different IoT operating systems. Although it touches upon security as an important feature, a benchmark of the cybersecurity mechanisms available in the different operating systems is lacking; typically, this is the case for most of the literature229 on IoT operating systems. This observation leads to the recommendation to deliver this benchmark with a cybersecurity focus as input for security standards for IoT operating systems. To secure the operating system, at least the below security controls should be in place230: – Malicious application protection – Applications can contain many hidden threats for IoT devices. Even some legitimate software can be exploited for fraudulent purposes. – Malware protection – Malware can be installed on an IoT device with malicious intentions. Malware can send unsolicited messages, or give an attacker control over the device, all without informing the owner. – Spyware protection – Spyware is installed to collect or use private data without informing or approval. Data commonly targeted by spyware includes location, history, contacts and private data. This stolen information could be used for identity theft or financial fraud. – Privacy protection – Privacy threats could be caused by applications that are not necessarily malicious, but gather or use sensitive information (e.g., location, contact lists, personally identifiable information). – By default, the OS should disable as many services and features as possible, allowing developers and deployment configurations to enable features as necessary in order to minimise the attack surface. The framework should allow for configuration reporting 226 Practical Internet of Things Security, Brian Russell, 2016. 227 J.-H. Hoepman and B.

Cloud and IoT IoT devices send captured data to a back-end for analysis and possible further action. Since the deployment of IoT devices is progressing at a rapid pace and at large scale, the amount of data being generated is unprecedented. Cloud computing offers computing capabilities, storage, applications and services, in a highly scalable manner, and is thus considered a natural fit for the IoT ecosystem. Consequently, recent years have seen the emergence of a number of cloud-based IoT platforms, which facilitate communication, data flow, device management and user interfacing, and the functionality of applications. All of the major cloud service providers (CSPs) including AWS, Google and Microsoft have offerings targeted at the IoT market; widely-used IoT platforms include Amazon’s AWS IoT, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure IoT, IBM Watson, and Cisco IoT Cloud Connect. Having said that, research has found significant gaps in domain support in existing cloud computing platforms, and a notable absence of standardisation.231 Cloud computing is a shared technology model where different organisations are responsible for implementing and managing different parts of the stack. As a result, security responsibilities are also distributed across the stack and thus across the organisations involved. This is commonly referred to as the shared responsibility model. As described by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)232, the exact distribution of security responsibilities depends on the service model. Software as a Service: The cloud provider is responsible for most of the security, since the cloud user can only access and manage their use of the application and cannot alter how the application works. For example, a SaaS provider is responsible for perimeter security, logging/ monitoring/ auditing, and application security, while the consumer may only be able to manage authorisation and entitlements. 231 A survey of IoT cloud platforms, Partha Pratim Ray, 2017. 232 Cloud Security Alliance’s Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing v4.0, 2017 INFRASTRUCTURE as a service PLATFORM as a service SOFTWARE as a service Figure 21: Security Responsibilities in the Cloud (Source: Cloud Security Alliance) Security responsibility Mostly consumer Mostly provider Platform as a Service: The cloud provider is responsible for the security of the platform, while the cloud consumer is responsible for everything they implement on the platform, including how they configure any offered security features. For example, when using a Database as a Service, the provider manages fundamental security, patching, and core configuration, while the cloud consumer is responsible for everything else, including which security features of the database to use, and managing accounts as well as authentication methods. Infrastructure as a Service: The provider is responsible for foundational security, while the cloud consumer is responsible for everything they build on the infrastructure. This places far more responsibility on the cloud consumer. For example, the IaaS provider will likely monitor their perimeter for attacks, but the consumer is fully responsible for how they define and implement their virtual network security based on the tools available on the service. CSA provides further guidance233 for various aspects of cloud security across the above service models, including good practices such as the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged access, “architecting for failure” to ensure business continuity, carefully understanding the responsibilities and contract of the cloud provider, and using appropriate encryption and key management to ensure the protection of sensitive data. CSA also suggests a simple high-level process for implementing cloud security, as shown below. As an example, Google Cloud Platform servers use a variety of technologies to ensure that they are booting the correct software stack, including cryptographic signatures over low-level components like the BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and base operating system image234. This security is based on the Titan security chip which was also discussed in the previous section. ENISA describes235 security challenges that arise from the convergence of cloud computing and IoT, including the fact that the security requirements depend on the industry vertical being served, the vulnerability of edge devices that can then be used to gain access to the cloud, and the difficulty of securing heterogeneous communication protocols between devices and cloud. 233 Cloud Security Alliance’s Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing v4.0, 2017 234 235 Towards secure convergence of cloud and IoT, ENISA, Sept 2018 Figure 22: Cloud Security Process Model (Source: Cloud Security Alliance) Identify requirements Select provider, service and deployment models Assess security controls Design and implement controls Define architecture Identify control gaps Manage changes 70 71 Applications As identified by Subramanian and Swaminathan236, applications in a typical IoT environment fall into the following categories: 1. Device applications that reside on the nodes and/or gateways. 2. Controlling applications that typically reside in the data centre or on a user or operator’s mobile device. 3. Consuming applications that typically reside in the data centre and receive data from the devices for further processing and analytics. 4. Relay services that format and transfer data between different components, e.g., APIs and web services. To realise safe and secure software, it is important to adopt a secure design and development methodology. Useful guidelines for secure software development are provided by OWASP237, which also offers a comprehensive developer checklist that covers input validation, access control, session management, error handling, logging, database security and memory management. OWASP’s Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)238 is a list of application security requirements or tests that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and even consumers to determine the security level of a given application in a consistent manner. ASVS defines 3 security verification levels of successively increasing depth, with a set of security requirements for each level. OWASP specifically discusses the use of ASVS as the basis of a secure SDLC: developers are encouraged to use the ASVS as a peer review checklist to ensures that unsafe code does not get checked in; further, developers can use the ASVS as part of their automated verification secure unit and integration test suites. The aim is to reduce the risk from waterfall-style “penetration testing at the end”, which can lead to expensive refactoring when delivering milestone builds into production. IoT devices (or, more specifically, the applications running on them) should “prove their health”, before accessing other IoT devices or services. Associated capabilities include a process for securely determining software and firmware versions and a secure software and firmware update mechanism. For example, the Trusted Computing Group’s Trusted Network Connect (TNC) standards, which specify a standard mechanism to check which software or firmware is running on a device, are among the protocols and mechanisms for safeguarding the patch and upgrade process. Malware can be detected at boot time using the device’s Trusted Boot and Remote Attestation capabilities, even to the point of finding changes in the device’s BIOS or other firmware. 236 assurance-in-the-sdlc-for-the-internet-of-things.aspx 237 OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide 238 OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_3.0.1.pdf 3 Advanced 2 Standard 1 Opportunistic 0 Cursory ASVS defines detailed verification requirements for levels 1 and above; whereas level 0 is meant to be flexible and is customised by each organisation Figure 23: OWASP Security Verification Levels (Source: OWASP) 5.9.2 Key Findings – The diversity of operating systems, cloud solutions and application development frameworks that populate the IoT market is large. An in-depth evaluation is required on the security claims made for each solution. – Standards are required for software development, deployment and operation processes to secure the OS, cloud back-ends, and applications. – IoT-specific secure software development life cycle (SDLC) guidelines need to be defined for developers of IoT applications. 5.10 SECURE COMMUNICATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IoT devices transmit information to a back-end for processing and analytics. Depending on the computational capabilities of the devices, it may be possible to filter some of the data before transmission or even to take immediate action locally without sending any data at all; however, all IoT systems do, at some point, send data over a network to a back-end. There are numerous ways to achieve this connectivity, ranging from direct cellular or satellite connections to low-power WANs with gateways to reach the back-end. Security is paramount since IoT devices based on different technologies and acquired from various suppliers on the global market communicate via heterogeneous network interfaces in an open network that is untrustworthy and potentially hostile. 5.10.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments When a device connects to the back-end, a gateway or other devices, it must authenticate and establish trust. Once trust is established, devices, users and services can securely communicate, interact and transact information. This challenge encompasses all elements that route and transport endpoint data traffic securely over the infra- structure, whether control, management or actual data traffic. Authentication and Authorisation Authentication in IoT networks should establish mutual trust between devices, users, gateways, back-ends, networks, and services. Classically, the authentication process relies on the authenticating entity demonstrating knowledge (\"something you know\"), possession (\"something you have\"), and/or inherent/behavioural (\"something you are\") factors, with multiple factors often recommended for stronger authentication. While these factors are applicable to users of IoT devices (e.g. to log in to a management console), the \"things\" themselves are essentially restricted to possession factors relying on a shared secret or asymmetric key. As discussed in previous chapters, the provisioning of a trusted identity is normally done at the time of manufacturing or via key injection. Public-key infrastructure (PKI) has been used to authenticate machines and servers for decades, and offers an established open standard for interoperability. However, PKI needs to evolve in order to support the scale and hetero- geneity inherent in IoT usecases.239 Specifically, lightweight certificate enrollment procedures should prove useful; the Swedish CEBOT (Certificate Enrollment in Billions of Things) project addresses how lightweight enrollment can be achieved.240 Additionally, certificate validity periods and future-proof algorithms need to be considered. If implemented carefully using the device's root of trust, PKI-based identities can provide a basis for strong authentication. The authorisation layer controls the extent of access provided to a device or, more generally, a process. This layer builds upon the core authentication layer by leveraging the identity information of an entity to determine what actions it is allowed to perform. The principle of least privilege dictates that we should only allow the bare minimum of access to an entity, such as a device or process, to allow it to perform the functionality needed of it. With authentication and authorisation in place, a trust relationship is established between IoT devices to exchange appropriate information. 239 240 73 Secure network communications Though some traditional network security solutions are applicable to IoT, the limited processing and communication capabilities of IoT devices preclude the use of full-fledged security suites. Bonetto et al241 studied this and suggested solutions to the challenge, proposing a lightweight procedure to set up secure end-to-end channels between unconstrained (and remote) peers and IoT devices. Sain et al242 provide a survey of different wireless technologies and their security strengths and weaknesses in a constrained IoT environment. We present below a visual representation of some state-of- the-art networking technologies for IoT and the relationships between them. This stack bears some resemblance to the commonly-encountered HTTP-TCP-IP- Ethernet Web networking stack, but features a larger number of protocols and greater complexity. IoT networking protocols typically feature lightweight, low-power operation at relatively lower data rates compared to computer networks, in order to meet the requirements of resource- constrained devices with small amounts of memory and processing power and networks with low bandwidth and high latency. IEEE standard 802.15.4244 offers the lower network layers of a low-power wireless personal area network (WPAN or LoWPAN) for inexpensive, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices, as opposed to other approaches such as Wi-Fi, which offer more bandwidth but require more power. Naturally, many of the devices that use IEEE 802.15.4 connectivity are limited in their computational power, memory, and/or energy availability. Zigbee245 is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh network standard for WPANs that builds on the physical layer and media access control defined in IEEE 802.15.4. As one of its defining features, Zigbee provides facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, cyphering frames, and controlling devices246. Zigbee uses 128-bit keys to implement its security mechanisms, and assumes 241 “Secure Communication for Smart IoT Objects: Protocol Stacks, Use Cases and Practical Examples”, Bonetto et al. jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263790. 242 Survey on Security in Internet of things: State of the Art and Challenges, by Mangal Sain, Young Jin Kang, Hoon Jae Lee, South Korea, 2017. 243 244 245 246 Zigbee Network Protocols and Applications, Wang et al, 2014 Application Transport Network Data Link Physical IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee BLE Wi-Fi RFID NFC LPWANs (SigFox, LoRa, NB-IoT) CoAP UDP IPv6 MQTT TCP DTLS RPL 6LoWPAN TLS Figure 24: IoT Network Protocol Stack* (*integration of LPWANs with IPv6 is under way at IETF243) adequate protection of all keying material. Trust must be assumed in the initial installation of the keys, as well as in the processing of security information. A key can be associated either to a network, being usable by both Zigbee layers and the MAC sublayer, or to a link, acquired through pre-installation, agreement or transport. Establishment of link keys is based on a master key which controls link key correspondence. The initial master key must be obtained through a secure medium (transport or pre-installation), as the security of the whole network depends on it. Link and master keys are only visible to the application layer. Different services use different variations of the link key to avoid leaks and security risks. IPv6 promises to be a key enabler for the future of IoT, providing end-to-end connectivity with a distributed routing mechanism as well as a highly scalable address scheme, providing more than 2 billion addresses per square millimetre of the Earth surface247. This seems sufficient to address the needs of any present and future communicating device. Moreover, IPv6 is supported by a large community of users and researchers supporting ongoing improvement of its security features. RFC 4919 describes the requirements for LoWPANs to work with IPv6, and RFC 4944248 defines the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Since IPv6 requires support of packet sizes much larger than the largest IEEE 802.15.4 frame size, an adaptation layer (“6LoWPAN”) is defined. This RFC also defines mechanisms for header compression required to make IPv6 practical on IEEE 802.15.4 networks, and the provisions required for packet delivery in IEEE 802.15.4 meshes. The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a routing protocol standardised for constrained IoT environments such as 6LoWPAN networks. Providing security in IPv6/RPL connected 6LoWPANs is challenging because the devices are connected to the untrusted Internet and are resource constrained while using novel IoT technologies and lossy communication links. If a node becomes an internal adversary, it can break network operation without being detected by cryptography mechanisms. Therefore, analysing RPL threats in addition to specifying its operation will help to monitor most of the internal malicious behaviours. RPL in authenticated security mode uses secure messages. Pre-installed keys are used to join a network as a leaf to provide message confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. To join the network as a router, a second key must be obtained from a key authority.249 As opposed to WPANs which are short-range personal-area networks, low-power wireless wide area networks (LPWANs) enable long-range, low-power communication at low cost using simplified, lightweight protocols and either license- free or licensed bands. LoRaWAN250 is an LPWAN protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated devices to the internet. The LoRaWAN network architecture is deployed in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network server. The gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections and act as a transparent bridge, simply converting RF packets to IP packets and vice versa. The wireless communication takes advantage of the long-range characteristics of the LoRa physical layer, allowing a single-hop link between the end-device and one or many gateways. The LoRaWAN specification defines two layers of cryptography: 247 248 249 Routing Attacks and Countermeasures in the RPL-Based Internet of Things, Wallgren et al, 2012 250 75 – A unique 128-bit Network Session Key shared between the end-device and network server – A unique 128-bit Application Session Key shared end-to- end at the application level AES encryption provides authentication and integrity of packets to the network server and end-to-end encryption to the application server. The keys can be Activated By Personalisation (ABP) on the production line or during commissioning or can be Over-The-Air Activated (OTAA) in the field. OTAA allows devices to be re-keyed if necessary. It is possible to use the LoRa physical layer and run a different protocol on top of it, such as Symphony Link251. Sigfox is a proprietary LPWAN technology that enables remote devices to connect to an access point over Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) frequencies. Sigfox highlights that devices never have the ability to send data to arbitrary entities via internet and can therefore be considered to be protected by a “firewall”. Furthermore, Sigfox devices have the following security features252: – Each Sigfox device is provisioned during manufacturing with a unique symmetrical authentication key. Each message to be sent or received by the device contains a cryptographic token that is computed based on this authentication key. Verification of the token ensures the authentication of the sender (the device for an uplink message, or the Sigfox network for a downlink message) and the integrity of the message. Since the key is unique per device, the compromising of one device has a very limited impact. Sigfox has been working with its ecosystem to increase the security level of devices through the adoption of security best practices. In addition, secure elements dedicated to Sigfox devices are now available to provide tamper resistance. – Each Sigfox message contains a sequence counter which is verified by the Sigfox Core Network to detect and discard replay attempts. The integrity of the counter is guaranteed by the message authentication token. – By default, data is conveyed over the air interface without any encryption. However, depending on the application, this data may be very sensitive, and its privacy must be guaranteed. Sigfox gives customers the option to either implement their own end-to-end encryption solutions or to rely on an encryption solution provided by the Sigfox protocol. The IETF Working Group “IPv6 over Low Power Wide-Area Networks” is currently focused on enabling IPv6 connectivity over several LPWAN technologies including Sigfox, LoRa, WI-SUN and NB-IOT253. The LPWAN Technology Security Comparison white paper254 from GSMA and Franklin Heath discusses the security implications and controls for the abovementioned LPWA technologies, identifying that IoT security needs are driven largely by privacy and safety concerns and suggesting that any deployment using LPWA technologies should be subject to a security risk assessment using tools such as the GSMA IoT Security Assessment255. HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the dominant application-layer protocol for the Web and has proven to be very suitable for the navigation of interactive, hyperlinked webpages. For IoT devices, most of which support no direct human interaction, consume very little power and frequently have poor network connectivity, HTTP is unsuitable256: a single HTTP request requires a minimum of nine TCP packets, even without taking packet loss into account. This overhead adds to IoT operating expenses. 251 252 253 254 new-report-outlines-security-considerations-lpwa-technology/ 255 256 Why-HTTP-Won-t-Work-for-IoT Two of the most successful application-layer protocols for small devices are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)257 and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)258. Both MQTT and CoAP: – are open standards – are better suited to constrained environments than HTTP – provide mechanisms for asynchronous communication – run on existing protocols such as TCP/UDP over IP. MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for lightweight device communication, originally developed by IBM and now an open standard. It features a client/ server model, where every device is a client and connects to a server, known as a broker, over TCP. Every message is a discrete chunk of data published to an address, known as a topic. Clients may subscribe to multiple topics. Every client subscribed to a topic receives every message published to the topic. Connections may be encrypted using TLS for security259. CoAP is defined by the IETF’s Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group260 for applications that deal with the manipulation of simple resources on constrained networks. This includes applications to monitor simple sensors (e.g. temperature sensors, light switches, and power meters), to control actuators (e.g. light switches, heating controllers, and door locks), and to manage devices. The general architecture consists of devices on the constrained network that are responsible for one or more resources that may represent sensors, actuators, combinations of values, and/or other information. Devices can – send messages to change and query resources on other devices. – send notifications about changed resource values to other devices that have expressed their interest to receive notification about changes. – publish or be queried about its resources. CoAP is designed for use between devices on the same constrained network, between devices and general nodes on the Internet, and between devices on different constrained (but connected) networks. Another RESTful approach to IoT is found in the so-called Web of Things (WoT), which is an application layer that enables access and control over IoT resources and applications using common web technologies (such as HTML 5.0, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby on Rails etc.). This approach can enable both developers and vendors to benefit from the popularity and maturity of web technologies. While the W3C has begun standardisation efforts for WoT261, we do not yet find mainstream adoption of web technologies in the IoT space. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)262 provides security for datagram-based application protocols such as CoAP by allowing them to communicate in a way that is designed (RFC 4347263, RFC 6347264) to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the stream-oriented Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and is intended to provide similar security guarantees. The DTLS protocol datagram preserves the semantics of the underlying transport 257 258 259 MQTT Client Authentication using TLS, IBM Knowledge Center com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/ q021330_.htm 260 262 263 264 77 — the application does not suffer from the delays associated with stream protocols, but has to deal with packet reordering, loss of datagrams and data larger than the size of a datagram network packet. Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a widely-used network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of data sent over a network. IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host). IPsec uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over IP networks. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection. While IPSec does add overheads to packet size and computation, it is considered a good alternative to SSL for capable IoT devices265. 5G Fifth-generation (5G) communications networks are widely expected to revolutionise machine-to-machine communications. The 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership266 (5G-PPP) identifies that 5G networks shall enable not only very high availability or up-time but also high speeds, minimal latency and comprehensive coverage. According to 5G-PPP this implies a security makeover in how confidentiality, integrity, and availability will be maintained and managed in 5G networks.267 Furthermore, the complexity of securing a network and its services has increased with the introduction of 5G network slicing and the increasing use of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). The 5G PPP identifies specific 5G security risks including unauthorised access or usage of assets, weak slice isolation and connectivity, and traffic embezzlement due to recursive/ additive virtualization. In addition, service-specific security requirements must also be considered as the 5G ecosystem is anticipated to be service-oriented. Secure Gateways Every IoT system needs some way to connect its sensors/ devices to the cloud so that data can be sent back and forth. Gateways act as bridges between devices and the cloud: devices communicate with a gateway, which in turn communicates with the back-end. The benefits of such two-step communication are multi-fold:268 – Using a gateway means that devices only need to send data a relatively short distance to the gateway, while the gateway handles the high-bandwidth link (“backhaul”) to the cloud. This allows for longer battery life. – Latency can be minimised by processing some data on the gateway or even on the device itself. However, most IoT devices are too small and underpowered to do such processing themselves. Gateways can reduce latency in time-critical applications by pre-processing the data and issuing suitable actions. This is important for life-or- death situations in the medical realm or for fast-moving objects such as cars. – A complete IoT application might involve many kinds of sensors and devices that use varying transmission protocols as discussed above. Gateways can communicate with sensors/devices using the right protocols and then translate that data into a standard protocol such as MQTT to be sent to the cloud. – Devices can generate large amounts of data, only a small fraction of which may actually be valuable. Gateways can pre-process and filter the data to decrease transmission, processing, and storage requirements. 265 ipsec-whats-the-right-approach-for-iot-network-security.html 266 267 5G PPP Phase1 Security Landscape – White Paper by 5G PPP Security Working Group 268 IoT 101: An Introduction to the Internet of Things, Leverege LLC – Gateways reduce the number of sensors/devices connected to the internet by “multiplexing” the devices together. This makes gateways the first line of defence against hackers, but also prime targets. Therefore, security needs to be a priority for any gateway. Highly secured gateways can provide trust anchors within the network. For example, Germany’s BSI269 has standardised the Smart Meter Gateway as an interoperable and secure communication platform270 with a dedicated Common Criteria profile271. Gateways are also considered as solutions to secure legacy hardware such as industrial control systems. For older or proprietary hardware that doesn’t support modern networks or security standards, the Trusted Network Connect architecture272 includes a specification (IF-MAP Metadata for ICS Security) that organises legacy or constraint devices into local enclaves that connect to a trusted network using security gateways. The gateways that link these networks provide encrypted communications and security to the interconnected enclaves, and automatically apply access control policies from a centralised provisioning system. 5.10.2 Key Findings – The networking and interoperability challenge has seen extensive work as well as significant standardisation; however, an in-depth review is required of the security of these communication solutions and the security and privacy requirements on each level of the communication stack in the IoT ecosystem. – Good practices are lacking regarding the technical feasibility of security controls running on resource- constrained devices. Security reference architectures are required. – Secure gateways can provide high-security deployments even with low-cost IoT devices. 5.11 SECURITY MONITORING AND ANALYTICS History shows that vulnerabilities are invariably found after a product is deployed – and often exploited in “zero-day” attacks. It is vital to be able to detect unforeseen vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live IoT deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and remediate. In performing these tasks intelligently and automatically, it is important to devise new paradigms of IoT security monitoring, incident management and recovery. Since IoT is by definition vulnerable, we need to monitor and analyse dataflows for advanced attacks, exceptions and other deviant behaviour. Furthermore, we should learn from discovered incidents, preferably in real-time, in order to define relevant anomalies and improve protection and detection. No matter how well defence measures are implemented, some threats will still get past even the best defences. Detecting such threats requires strong understanding of what the systems “should” be doing. Machine learning may help to find threats hiding in the noise of trillions of events generated every month. 5.11.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments State-of-the-art security analytics are developed by the Industrial Internet Consortium under the Industrial Internet of Things Analytics Framework273, which is intended for system architects, technology leaders and business leaders looking to successfully deploy industrial analytics systems. Although this framework has a business focus and not a security focus, it addresses the required building blocks for security monitoring and analytics. 269 270 BSI Presentation by Joachim Weber, during SICW IoT Security roundtable, 2017. 271 Smart Meter Gateway PP, pp0073b_pdf.pdf 272 communications/tnc-resources/ 273 Oct_2017.pdf78 79 Schonwalder274 proposed and investigated a distributed passive monitoring architecture for IoT. The architecture relies on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which was discussed in the previous section, to monitor the network in a lightweight manner. Higher-order monitoring nodes can passively listen to the network while participating in its operation. Monitored nodes do not require to be instrumented, nor do they need to dedicate resources to the monitoring tasks which are operated by the cloud. Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure As ISO identifies275, inappropriate disclosure of a vulnerability could not only delay the deployment of the vulnerability resolution but also give attackers hints to exploit it. Vulnerability disclosure is a process through which vendors and vulnerability finders may work cooperatively in finding solutions that reduce the risks associated with a vulnerability. It encompasses actions such as reporting, coordinating, and publishing information about a vulnerability and its resolution. The goals of vulnerability disclosure include the following: a) ensuring that identified vulnerabilities are addressed; b) minimising the risk from vulnerabilities; c) providing users with sufficient information to evaluate risks from vulnerabilities to their systems; d) setting expectations to promote positive communication and coordination among involved parties. A strategy to deal with discovered threats and vulnerabilities includes a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) program that balances security with the interests of manufacturers and stakeholders, as well as a clear understanding of liability. As discussed276 by US-CERT, CVD practices commonly lead to a strategy for Vulnerability Management (VM), which is the common term for tasks such as vulnerability scanning, patch testing, and deployment. VM practices focus on the positive action of identifying specific systems affected by known (post- disclosure) vulnerabilities and reducing the risks they pose through the application of mitigations or remediation such as patches or configuration changes. This is also discussed in the previous section on product lifecycles. Data Classification Combining the computing power available within the cloud with the vast volumes of data that can be generated by IoT, it should be possible to segregate bad actors, limit access to malicious parties, and integrate easily with third party logging and intrusion detection and prevention systems. Data will be collected within the cloud from a variety of data components in the IoT ecosystem. Some data might be highly sensitive, while other data might be relatively benign; a security monitoring framework should provide capabilities to classify data and to protect data based on its classification. Interface controls should limit access and exposure of sensitive data on the basis of classification. Honeypots A honeypot is a computer security mechanism that appears to be a legitimate device containing information of value but is actually isolated and monitored. A honeypot resource is never meant for legitimate use; therefore, any access to the honeypot resource is suspicious, and either accidental or hostile in nature. The attack strategies are recorded by the honeypot, and may include network traffic, payload, malware samples, and the toolkit used by the attacker. Some honeypots that are specifically geared towards IoT include IoTPOT278, Dionaea279, and ZigBee Honeypot. DutchSec's HoneyTrap offers an advanced system for running and managing honeypots.280 274 Schonwalder, 2015. 275 Information technology — Security techniques — Vulnerability disclosure, ISO/ IEC 29147 276 The CERT® Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, August 2017 277 building-security-into-cars-iot_en-us.pdf 278 279 280 Security Event Reporting and Information Sharing Detailed descriptions of IoT incidents, such as those provided by ENISA281, can be used as input for evaluations and validations of certain security measures. The analytics framework should operate in the cloud, given that most IoT devices are resource-constrained. This approach creates an opportunity to compare large volumes of dataflows and detect and react to malicious activities over millions of devices. For example, the Malware Information Sharing Platform282 (MISP) is an open source threat intelligence platform that provides open standards for Threat Information Sharing. This platform is built to collect and share large amounts of data including reporting and alerting solutions. Gateway-Based Monitoring The gateway is uniquely suited to monitor traffic to and from the cloud, and should support anomaly detection and integrate easily with existing anomaly and intrusion detection systems. A secure gateway might even support intrusion prevention capabilities to exclude suspicious actors from the ecosystem. A logging and reporting framework should allow the gateway to observe, baseline, and monitor communications traffic and component behaviour. 5.11.2 Key Findings – Data collection and analytics for massive numbers of IoT devices is a major challenge. – New metrics and methodologies are required to support IoT infrastructure analytics given the data characteristics of resource-constrained IoT devices. – Monitoring and analytics capabilities should provide input for vulnerability management programs. – In case vulnerabilities are not solved by the supplier, monitoring tools should be able to detect and disconnect vulnerable devices from the internet. – The industry should act as a global community when learning from incidents. This requires an open culture of sharing incidents and mutual learning where security is a joint responsibility. 5.12 INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG CHALLENGES The IoT security challenges discussed throughout this study do not exist in isolation; rather, they are closely dependent on each other. These interdependencies are illustrated in Figure 25. IoT security needs to be based upon fundamentally sound cybersecurity principles, and all IoT products and services must be designed with security and privacy in mind. Manufacturers need to employ secure supply chains and carefully-considered lifecycle management strategies for device deployments. Devices themselves need a root of trust to allow for secure identification, booting and updates. Communications between devices and back-end need to be secured using authentication and encryption. Monitoring and analytics can detect vulnerabilities after deployment, and the information thus gathered can used to patch devices using lifecycle and supply chain management practices. At the same time, vulnerability information should be fed back into the supply chain to narrow down root causes and identify other devices that may be affected. 281 Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, ENISA, Nov 2017 282 81 At the governance level, cybersecurity principles must lead to concrete guidelines and standards that can be used as a basis for evaluation and certification, and in turn these certifications should be mandated and backed by governmental legislation. Finally, since IoT is a global phenomenon and is not limited by national boundaries, it is essential to align country-specific legislations and adopt a global approach to IoT security. Principles Standards Certication Legislation Global Alignment ConnectivityDevices Supply Chain Lifecycle Analytics/ Monitoring Security by design Platforms Privacy by design Applications Figure 25: IoT Security Interdependencies 83 6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The number of connected things in use globally will surge from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 20.4 billion by 2020, with total spending on endpoints and services exceeding $2 trillion283. It is seen that IoT devices are often constrained in terms of resources (energy, computing power, memory), physical environment, and cost, such that traditional IT security mindsets cannot be applied directly. Further, IoT devices may run without supervision and for extended periods of time, possibly in hostile environments – making them particularly susceptible to hacking. Many might have zero or limited user interfacing; thus, patching and updating may not be convenient and malfunctioning or rogue devices may not be immediately detectable. This leads to the below risks: – Consumer security, privacy and safety are undermined by the vulnerability of individual devices. – The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an increasing threat of large scale cyber-attacks launched from large volumes of insecure IoT devices. The fact that IoT is closely integrated with the physical world can increase the impact of cyber-attacks: while traditional IT cyber-attacks could result in data leakage and financial losses, IoT cyber-attacks have the potential to cause direct physical harm. An analysis of key initiatives shows that there are numerous industry collaborations focusing on these IoT security challenges and on IoT in general, but progress in achieving a secure IoT has been limited. At the same time, we have seen few government-led global initiatives. There is no single set of IoT security and privacy principles nor a certification regime that is internationally recognised and adopted. The diversity in proposed IoT security principles illustrates a lack of collaboration, especially between governments. Due to the lack of globally-adopted principles, a common understanding of shared IoT challenges and issues is lacking; this is required to define a global governance process. Separately, consumers and companies are not sufficiently aware of IoT security risks and not equipped to respond to threats. We have identified 11 foundational IoT security challenges; for most challenges, we face a fragmented space of solutions and gaps that need to be closed. Security standards are required to stimulate the adoption of secure IoT devices. There is an overwhelming number of good practices, guidelines and standards, but manufacturers may not have the expertise to use them: usability of security standards is a challenge and requires more research. Harmonisation of IoT security standards, guidelines and recommendations is required to stimulate adoption; such harmonisation should be supported by global cybersecurity research initiatives. It is important for standardisation processes to stay aligned with technical developments without stifling innovation. Having said that, cost and time-to-market pressures in the IoT world can make it difficult manufacturers to implement security and comply with standards in the absence of suitable incentives. There is a distinct lack of labels and certifications to inform IoT end users about device security and risks. Also, a minimum set of security requirements is lacking – such a baseline is vital for supervision and enforcement to prevent the deployment of vulnerable devices. There are as yet no evaluation profiles, e.g. Common Criteria cPPs, tailored to 283 IoT devices; it should be determined whether these can be generic or domain-specific to application domains. In fact, since CC certification is known for being a relatively slow and costly process, a non-CC certification approach may prove more suitable for IoT devices. Owing to a lack of legislation, the adoption of security guidelines and best practices remains voluntary. An initial step taken by the United States is to mandate that the government shall only procure IoT devices that conform to some measure of security. This approach can contribute significantly towards a secure IoT when large countries participate, but smaller economies such as Singapore and the Netherlands should work together for greater impact. Liability can prove to be an effective mechanism to drive the industry towards security, although in most cases liability legislation needs to be modernised to account for the nature of IoT. The process of identifying the responsible manufacturer or supplier and holding them liable for a vulnerability is a supply chain management challenge. IoT hardware and software manufacturers and suppliers should adopt a supply chain risk management framework (e.g. ISO28000, TL9000) to cascade cybersecurity requirements, risk and liability up the supply chain. At the device level, a root of trust (RoT) is an immutable trust anchor; the chain of trust should preferably build on a hardware RoT. RoT-based cybersecurity is provided by several solutions including TPMs and PUFs. IoT security guidelines emphasise hardware roots of trust; yet, established practices are lacking regarding their use in resource-constrained devices. Security reference architectures are required across a range of constraint classes. There is a diversity of operating systems, cloud solutions and application development frameworks in the IoT market. An in-depth evaluation is required on the security claims made for each solution. Cloud-based IoT platforms offer comprehensive device management functionality including onboarding and patching, but are largely unstandardised. IoT-specific secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) guidelines are necessary for IoT developers, platform operators, industry and manufacturers. A number of standards have emerged for IoT networking; however, an in-depth review is required of the security of these protocols and the security and privacy requirements on each level of the communication stack in the IoT ecosystem. Regardless of communication protocol, secure gateways are recommended and can provide a level of security even in deployments that use low-cost IoT devices. History shows that device-level vulnerabilities are invariably found after a product is deployed – and are often exploited in “zero-day” attacks. It is important to be able to detect unforeseen vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and remediate. Monitoring is especially vital for IoT, but data collection and analytics for massive numbers of IoT devices remains a challenge. A strategy to deal with discovered threats and vulnerabilities should include a CVD program that balances security with the interests of manufacturers and stakeholders, and includes the propagation of vulnerability information up and across supply chains. Keeping software and firmware up-to-date via patches and updates is critical for a secure IoT ecosystem. Updates should be delivered and deployed using a secure and verifiable methodology. If a vendor identifies or is informed about vulnerabilities, it must patch them in a timely manner and publish patch information as part of an auditable Vulnerability Management Program. Most importantly, the industry should act as a global community when learning from incidents. This requires an open culture of sharing and mutual learning, and the understanding that security is a joint responsibility. It is recommended to set up a global initiative on secure IoT in order to address the below gaps.84 85 – Limited adoption of IoT security practices and lack of harmonised operational expertise – A number of standards, guidelines and good practices are proposed and available; however, harmonisation towards a practical set of security standards is lacking, and clear- cut information on implementing conformant security functionality is scarce. Given that manufacturers are currently not mandated or incentivised to implement cybersecurity measures, and that a widely-accepted IoT security certification framework does not exist, there is no compelling reason for manufacturers to invest in delivering secure products. – Lack of alignment and information sharing across supply chains and geographies – IoT security is fundamentally a global problem that demands a global solution. Since IoT devices can reach and be reached from distant parts of the world, and modern products use components that may originate in several different countries, it is important to coordinate policies, share knowhow and intelligence, and propagate vulnerability information up and across supply chains. – Lack of foundational IoT device security – By some measures, only 4% of IoT devices build their cybersecurity on top of a hardware root of trust. The initiative should focus on the following challenges on a priority basis in order to address the gaps identified above. These are also highlighted by the experts consulted for the study; section 3.4 described their inputs on the priority challenges. 1. Evaluation and certification of IoT devices in order to provide assured security baselines for a wide variety of devices. A globally aligned approach with government involvement is necessary. 2. Monitoring and supply chain security along with global intelligence sharing for cybersecurity and trust at component level. It is important to close the gap between device supply chains and the threat and vulnerability intelligence gathered from a monitoring effort. 3. Hardware security and trusted device identities, focusing on the security of different root-of-trust implementations and their suitability for different device types. More research is needed on the use of alternatives such as PUFs for low-cost IoT devices. In particular, the use of these alternatives in various practical scenarios such as authentication, encryption and secure booting needs to be investigated. This IoT security initiative should be a partnership with strong involvement of government agencies, industry and academia. Government agencies should set the direction and steer nations towards a secure and safe IoT environment, working closely with thought leaders, cybersecurity and IoT experts from industry, academia and research organisations. The overarching objective is to share ideas and experiences, shape technologies and architectures, and drive standards and collaboration in order to ensure a safe and secure Internet of Things. 87 ANNEX A – IOT SECURITY IN SMART MOBILITY AND SMART HEALTH SMART MOBILITY The societal challenge of smart mobility284 is to achieve a transport system that is resource-efficient, climate and environmentally-friendly, and functions safely and seamlessly for the benefit of all citizens, the economy and society. IoT is a key enabling technology to solve this challenge. A modern vehicle can have between 8 and 30 on-board computers that manage various aspects of car functionality, from the speed of the car to the temperature of its interior. These numbers illustrate the observation that a car is not a single IoT device, but more appropriately thought of as a mega-IoT device or, more formally, a system-of-systems of IoT devices. Within this system-of-systems, the constraints are cost, computing power, and bandwidth limitations; physical constraints are usually less critical in a car environment. A connected car is invariably equipped with Internet access, and usually also with a wireless local area network. This allows the car to share Internet access with other devices inside as well as outside the vehicle. The successful and safe deployment of connected vehicles in different use case scenarios, using local and distributed information and intelligence, is a challenging task285 that needs to use reliable, real-time IoT platforms managing safety-critical vehicle services, advanced sensors and actuators, navigation and cognitive decision-making technology, interconnectivity between vehicles (V2V), and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. Connected vehicles will enable the development of service ecosystems based on collected information (e.g. maintenance, personalised insurance, and even customised in-car entertainment). As with all IoT devices, the additional functionality offered by a connected car comes with risks and potentially fatal consequences. Researchers have already proven that modern, computerised vehicles can be hijacked with just a laptop computer and easily obtained software. Hackers have demonstrated that they can display false readings on the dashboard, remotely control steering and disable brakes, and switch off the engine remotely when the vehicle is in motion286. ENISA identifies287 good practices to ensure the security of smart cars against cyber threats, categorising these practices into policy, organisational and technical measures. Policy measures include adherence to regulation and establishment of liability; organisational measures include the designation of a dedicated security team within organisational players in the connected car industry, the development of a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS) tailored to industry needs, and the introduction of security and privacy controls in the design phase; and technical measures include end-to-end encrypted communications, state-of-the-art standards for cryptography and random-number generation, dedicated and independently-audited hardware security modules (HSMs), and secure key management practices. ENISA also 284 smart-green-and-integrated-transport 285 Report: AIOTI WG 9 – Smart Mobility, 2015 286 287 Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars, ENISA, Dec 2016 recommends improved information sharing between industry stakeholders as well as clarification of liability amongst industry actors. In addition to safety and security dangers, drivers and passengers face privacy threats. Private data on smart phones, such as e-mail, text messages, contacts and other personal data, could be stolen by hackers. Vehicle location information can be used to determine when the occupants of a home are away, giving burglars a window of opportunity. Several initiatives have been launched to address the security issues inherent to connected cars. The European Commission’s Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) has a workgroup dedicated to Smart Mobility, which includes IoT use cases pertaining to the car industry. The eCall initiative288, described in Chapter 4, is intended to bring rapid assistance to motorists in the event of a crash by communicating the vehicle’s location and direction to emergency services; eCall has been mandatory for all new cars sold within the EU since April 2018. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) groups worldwide, particularly ERTICO289 in Europe, are involved in a number of pilot projects in the area of smart mobility. ERTICO has also released recommendations290 on communication technologies for future Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) scenarios. The American Future of Privacy Forum291 and National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) have published a DATA AND THE CONNECTED CAR CAN-BUS: internal communication bridge between electronic control units AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE IMAGING AND SCANNING: LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic sensors or exterior cameras DSRC RADIO: vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication THIRD PARTY MONITORING DEVICE: OBD II or external device communicates with fleet operator Telematics control unit (TCU): interconnects CAN-BUS and external sustems TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS: short range radio, goes to radio receiver EVENT DATA RECORDER: black box with accident data CRASH DATA RETRIEVAL: extract EDR data Figure 26: Connected car with different functions (Source: Future of Privacy Forum) 288 ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018 289 290 ertico-releases-guide-about-technologies-for-future-c-its-service-scenarios/ 291 89 consumer guide292 highlighting the types of data that connected cars collect and transmit. The Security Credential Management System (SCMS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation is a proof-of-concept (POC) message security solution293 for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. It uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based approach that employs encryption and certificate management to facilitate trusted communication. Authorised system participants use digital certificates issued by SCMS to authenticate and validate the safety and mobility messages that form the foundation for connected vehicles. To protect the privacy of vehicle owners, these certificates contain no personal or equipment-identifying information but serve as system credentials so that other users in the system can trust the source of each message. SCMS also protects the contents of each message by identifying and removing misbehaving devices, while maintaining privacy. Amongst industry initiatives, IBM advocates its Design, Build, Drive philosophy that aims to secure each phase of the lifecycle of the connected car. In particular, IBM recognises the need for designing a secure infrastructure in addition to a secure vehicle, given that infrastructure-based attacks such as falsified traffic conditions could wreak havoc by causing unexpected rerouting and braking. The approach also emphasises the need for a trusted supply chain and a trusted maintenance ecosystem.294 SMART HEALTH The societal challenge of health, demographic change and well-being295 aims to improve the lifelong health and well- being of all citizens; this means high-quality, economically sustainable and innovative health and care systems, as part of welfare systems, and opportunities for new jobs and growth. Smart health includes health services, electronic record management, smart home services and intelligent and connected medical devices.296 ENISA has proposed key recommendations for hospital information security executives and industry to enhance the level of information security in Smart Hospitals.297 Through the identification of assets and the related threats when IoT components are supporting a healthcare organisation, the report describes the Smart Hospital ecosystem and its specific objectives. The solutions to realise a smart hospital (or even more ambitiously, true \"Smart Health\" – where the boundaries between hospitals and home care start to blur) are broad and diverse. A related technology for home care is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which aims at helping older people live as independently as possible by embedding intelligent objects in the environment.298 292 fpf-and-nada-launch-guide-to-consumer-privacy-in-the-connected-car/ 293 294 IBM Executive Report, Driving security: Cyber assurance for next-generation vehicles, Christopher Poulin 295 health-demographic-change-and-wellbeing 296 what-is-smart-health-and-how-do-people-benefit/ 297 Smart Hospitals - Security and Resilience for Smart Health Service and Infrastructures, ENISA, November 2016. 298 Design security in – Design a secure vehicle – Design a secure infrastructure – Control the production environment – Create a trusted supply chain – Harden the vehicle – Create a trusted mainenance ecosystem – Enable new and trusted models Build a secure vehicle Drive with confidence Figure 27: IBM's Design, Build, Drive Approach (Source: IBM) AAL technologies range from automatically switching off kitchen appliances or lights to monitoring vital functions and the automatic notification of medical assistance in case of an emergency. One such effort is the in-home monitoring services for the elderly299 from Fujitsu and Panasonic. Personal wellness applications based on IoT devices for both generic and health-specific purposes constitute important developments towards Smart Health. These can be accompanied by remote health monitoring and staff identification. Smart Health IoT devices contain and retain highly sensitive personal data of the patients to whom the device is attached, be it temporary (e.g. electrocardiogram) or more permanent (e.g. pacemaker). As can be imagined, vast amounts of Protected Health Information (PHI) are collected by the devices and either retained or shared in real-time for querying and analysis. As might be expected, there have already been cases of security compromise in the domain of Smart Health. According to Cylance300, in 2017 Abbott’s (formerly St. Jude Medical) found itself the centre of attention for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration301 (FDA) and unhappy patients over their pacemakers, defibrillators, and other medical devices being vulnerable to third-party man-in-the- middle access via cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities could affect how the device operates, Deep brain neurostimulators Gastric stimulators Foot drop implants Insulin pumps Cochlear implants Cardiac defibrillator pacemakers Figure 28: Wireless Implantable Medical Devices, source: pinstake.com. 299 releases/2015/0625-01.html 300 301 91 including “rapid depletion of battery and/or inappropriate pacing or shocks.” In August 2017, the FDA approved a firmware update which addressed these vulnerabilities. Separately, German electronics company Siemens issued a customer alert302 in July 2017 warning of the highly critical vulnerabilities in many of their medical scanners. Pending a solution, Siemens has directed the devices to be taken offline. As with smart mobility IoT applications, smart health IoT is vulnerable by definition as well. As a result, cybersecurity flaws can lead to grievous safety losses. This emphasises the need for cybersecurity in smart health devices. Are these devices safe, secure, reliable, and resilient, and do they uphold privacy expectations? Given the critical nature of these devices, the sensitivity of the information they capture, and the complexity of smart health ecosystems and supply chains, it is imperative to work towards an assured security framework for connected medical devices. 302 822184.pdf 93 ANNEX B – CATALOGUE OF KEY INITIATIVES AIOTI Title AIOTI Description The Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) is an inclusive body with members including key IoT industrial players – large companies, successful SMEs and dynamic startups – as well as well-known European research centres, universities, associations and public bodies.

Singapore is no different, as we work  towards our vision of a Smart Nation. The Smart Nation  journey empowers the Singapore economy through  technology and digital innovation, and aims to bring about   a better quality of life for all.  The Government, through  policies and initiatives, also aims to better prepare and  equip Singapore to embrace the ever-changing digital  landscape.  The Smart Nation initiative rests on bridging comm- unications and enabling digital services. This brings about  the phenomenon of manufacturing every type of device to  be “smart”. From traffic cameras to lampposts and even  the most mundane of devices like rice cookers and baby- monitors are now part of the “Internet of Things” or IoT. The rapid proliferation of such independently designed  devices creates an extremely complex IoT ecosystem.  These complexities create vulnerabilities that can easily   be exploited by individuals or groups with malicious intent.  This is a challenge that the world is facing now, and we  ought to study the gaps in the IoT ecosystem and to develop  frameworks, policies and innovative solutions to enhance  the security of such devices.   With the exponential growth in the deployment of IoT  devices, the security threat is multiplied many fold.  Singapore may not be the first to solve this issue, but we  are willing to respond quickly and boldly to create a safe  and secure IoT cyberspace.   I am pleased that Singapore has established strong  cybersecurity ties with the Netherlands. We have embarked  on a journey to study and identify the security challenges of  the IoT landscape. The outcome of this report highlights the  need for collective responsibility between industries and  governments. It is important for the ecosystem to stay  vibrant and develop new innovative solutions to better  secure our IoT against malicious and evolving threats.    As we face this uphill challenge in the IoT cyber domain,  industries and governments need to pool together  resources, strengthen defenses and remain aligned  through international standards and governance.  Cyber threats are often global, transboundary and  increasingly sophisticated. The security challenges can   only be addressed when all stakeholders, Governments,  industry, academia and consumers, work together.   This report is the first of many collaborations with the  Netherlands and all other like-minded nations and partners,  as we forge towards a more trusted and resilient digital  society.

Gartner2 forecasts that the number of connected things in  use globally will surge from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 20.4  billion by 2020, with total spending on endpoints and  services exceeding $2 trillion3. IoT unlocks tremendous  value for the individual, for organisations and for governments;  however, it also presents enormous security challenges.  The 2015 VTech data breach4, the Mirai botnet5 of 2016,  and the recent Silex malware attack6 are some of the many  incidents that have affected IoT in this early stage of its  evolution. The potential of IoT will only be fully realised if  cybersecurity and privacy are built in by design, and the  following risks7 are addressed and mitigated: 1. Consumer privacy and safety are undermined by the   vulnerability of individual devices, connectivity, and  back-ends; and  2. The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an  increasing threat of large-scale cyber-attacks launched  from massive numbers of insecure IoT devices.  The International IoT Security Roundtables held in 2016,  2017 and 20188 by the Cyber Security Agency9 (CSA) of  Singapore and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate  Policy (MEAC) of the Netherlands10, as well as this study of  the IoT security landscape, provide input for global efforts  towards creating a safe and secure cyberspace of things; a  global approach is required since IoT security is not limited  by national boundaries.  These efforts shall lead to a global platform to share ideas  and experiences, shape technologies and architectures,  and drive standards and collaboration in creating a next- generation, inherently secure IoT ecosystem that upholds  security and privacy expectations.   We identify and formulate the below problem statement  based on our observations and the inputs of experts from  CSA and MEAC as well as the Netherlands National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC)11.  Vulnerable IoT devices are deployed fast, globally and with   unknown lifespan, while a level playing field on common   standards and technical solutions for cybersecurity in IoT is   lacking for the industry. This creates safety, environmental   and social hazards that are not well understood and likely to   be unacceptable for society.  Using the problem statement as a starting point, this study  identifies and discusses 11 interdependent IoT security  challenges and presents findings and recommendations.  We believe that addressing these challenges will allow IoT  security to mature to a point where the IoT ecosystem can  develop and flourish in a manner that is acceptable for  society.  2 https://www.gartner.com/en  3 https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917  4 https://www.vtech.com/en/press_release/2018/  faq-about-cyber-attack-on-vtech-learning-lodge/  5 https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/21/13362354/  dyn-dns-ddos-attack-cause-outage-status-explained  6 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/  cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-silex-malware-bricks-iot-devices-with-weak-  passwords  7 Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of   Things.

Consequently,  there exist hundreds of documents12 with significant  duplications and possible contradictions. IoT product  developers, and vendors involved in the IoT supply chain  and life cycle, may find themselves overwhelmed – or they  may take advantage of the lack of clarity to do nothing at all.  There is an immediate need for harmonisation on security  recommendations and guidelines as well as coordination   on security assurances in the form of regulation and  certification. Given the continuing exponential growth in the  number of IoT devices, there is no time to lose.  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/  baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot    10    11  1 INTRODUCTION  From homes to hospitals, the power grid, the highway, and  the high seas, the Internet of Things (IoT) is destined to  change the way people live, do business, and interact with  their governments. The IoT's massive interconnections   of devices, or \"things”, lead to new efficiencies and  capabilities, and unlock tremendous value for consumers,  organisations and governments. Imagine an intelligent  hospital system that links patient monitoring devices with  drug infusion pumps to prevent overdoses and reduce  false alarms. Or a smart city that automatically schedules  maintenance work to minimise street blockages and uses  smart lighting to de-escalate conflict situations in real  time13. Or connected farms that control their irrigation  systems based on the moisture content of the soil and on  the weather forecast, all the while deriving algorithmic  insights into optimal ways to grow and water crops. IoT   is one of the key enabling technologies to realise these  visions.   The number of IoT devices in operation continues to grow  exponentially. Gartner forecasts that the number of  connected things in use globally will surge from 8.4 billion  in 2017 to 20.4 billion by 2020, with total spending on  endpoints and services exceeding $2 trillion.14  Smart cities and smart nations15 are enabled by the  adoption of IoT along with related technologies such as  cloud computing and big data analytics. These technologies  can improve government operations, support better living,   create new business opportunities, and support stronger  and safer communities.   But the aforementioned opportunities come with enormous  challenges. Beckstrom’s Law of Cybersecurity16 is a recent  Internet aphorism that, slightly paraphrased, states the  following: 1. Anything attached to a network can be hacked. 2. Everything is being attached to a network. 3. Therefore, everything can be hacked.  This pronouncement has proven largely accurate. In  December 2015, VTech, a manufacturer of educational toys  such as electronic learning devices, announced a security  breach exposing the personal data of over 6 million  people.17 Reports suggested that the breach exploited a  SQL injection vulnerability at the server and that the  account registration services did not use encrypted  communication.18 The devices themselves were not  compromised; however, the online services that the devices  connected to were not sufficiently secured. On October 21,  2016, multiple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks  targeted Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn, causing  major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to  users in Europe and North America.19 The attack was  accomplished by issuing a large number of DNS lookup  requests from as many as 600,000 Internet-connected  devices20 – such as printers, IP cameras, residential  gateways and baby monitors – that were infected with the   13 https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/built-environment/research/smart-cities-program/collaboration/living-labs/stratumseind/  14 https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917  15 https://www.smartnation.sg – Singapore Smart Nation website.  16 https://dld-conference.com/articles/its-a-mad-mad-mad-cyber-world  17 https://www.vtech.com/en/press_release/2018/faq-about-cyber-attack-on-vtech-learning-lodge/  18 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34963686  19 https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/21/13362354/dyn-dns-ddos-attack-cause-outage-status-explained  20 https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-mirai-the-infamous-iot-botnet-a-retrospective-analysis/    Mirai malware to create a “botnet”; Mirai was also used for  similar attacks on websites such as Krebs on Security.21  On June 25, 2019, a new IoT malware called Silex was  found to be wiping device firmware after gaining access via  default credentials – the standard user name and password  that devices are shipped with. The malware, which only  operated for one day, managed to brick thousands of IoT  devices.22   These examples highlight two primary risks facing IoT23: 1. Consumer privacy and safety are being undermined by   the vulnerability of individual devices, connectivity, and  back-ends; and  2. The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an  increasing threat of large-scale cyber-attacks launched  from massive numbers of insecure IoT devices.      21 https://krebsonsecurity.com/  22 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-silex-malware-bricks-iot-devices-with-weak-passwords  23 Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things.

INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)   THREAT LANDSCAPE  HISTORY OF   ACTUAL EVENTS  Multi-kiloton pipeline explosion  Critical infrastructure sites affected  Cars: digitally stolen, remotely crashed  Steel mill blast furnace damaged  Larger scale power grid crashed  Hospital breached via medical devices  Figure 1: IoT Threat Landscape: Actual Events (Source: Symantec)  12    13  According to ABI Research, at this moment less than 4% of  IoT devices are secure by design.24 The real-life incidents  depicted in Figure 1 emphasise the urgency of improving IoT  security. For IoT to be successful, useful and acceptable,  the hazards that come with the widespread use of IoT must  be managed to risk levels acceptable for society.   1.1 OBJECTIVES This study provides input to global efforts in creating a   safe and secure cyberspace of things; a global approach   is required, since IoT security is not limited by national  boundaries. These efforts shall lead to a global platform   to share ideas and experiences, shape technologies and  architectures, and drive standards and collaboration in  creating a next-generation, inherently secure IoT ecosystem  that upholds security and privacy expectations.  The objective of this study is to define the problem spaces,  determine the security challenges and identify gaps based  on the current technological and policy landscape for each  challenge in order to present key findings and recomm- endations, thus formulating the foundations for global  actions and dialogue. In some industries, such an approach  has been followed for decades: for example, the automotive  industry develops designs in competition, while safety is  based on common global standards (car safety certifications)  and responsibilities (the manufacturer bears the cost of  recalls).   1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT The problem statement is formulated based on the  following observations of the IoT ecosystem. 1. IoT is by definition vulnerable – IoT is a network of   physical devices using open network standards and  software. Recent history has shown that such a network  is highly vulnerable, especially given the resource- constrained nature of the devices and their often- unsupervised operation.   2. IoT devices are deployed fast, on a global scale and with  unknown lifespan – IoT is one of the main drivers of  innovation in today’s world and, owing to the almost  borderless digital economy, IoT solutions are developed  for a global market. As a result, the pace of technology  development is high and competition is fierce. At the  same time, product lifecycles may be long, and devices  can be used for a longer period than intended by the  manufacturers.   3. No level playing field for IoT device manufacturers –  Owing to the lack of legislations and the differences in  legislative environments in different countries, there is  no level playing field for vendors nor a common  expectation of security functionality.   4. Lack of security in the IoT business equation – Time-to- market, usability and cost are key considerations for  many solutions, and the razor-thin margins for these  devices leave manufacturers with less to spend on  security with virtually no incentive25: indeed, an attack  on a device may affect neither the manufacturer nor the  user but heavily impact a third party target in a botnet  scenario.  5. Lack of IoT security awareness26 – The current  landscape is too complex for most end-users to really  understand the risks to themselves and to others – for  instance, few consumers would appreciate the very real  risk of their refrigerators or smart TVs being used as  part of a botnet in a DDoS attack.   Given these observations, we formulate the following  problem statement:  Vulnerable IoT devices are deployed fast, globally and with  unknown lifespan, while a level playing field on common  standards and technical solutions for cybersecurity in IoT is  lacking for the industry. This creates safety, environmental  and social hazards that are not well understood and likely to  be unacceptable for society.  24 IoT Security from Design to Lifecycle Management, An Embedded Perspective; ABI Research, 2018.  25 The economics of the security of consumer-grade IoT products and services, Internet Society / Plum Consulting, April 2019.   26 ‘Towards a secure connected digital society’ – Advice regarding cybersecurity of IoT, by Dutch Cyber Security Council, 2018.

Desk research and analysis focusing on publications   from governments, standards development  organisations, and industry, as well as scientific  publications.  2. Interactive sessions including workshops, panel  discussions and International IoT Security  Roundtables27 featuring participants from government,  industry and academia.  3. Consultations with experts and policymakers from  organisations including Singapore’s Cyber Security  Agency28, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the  Netherlands29, the Netherlands National Cyber Security  Centre30, Germany’s BSI31, and the UK Department for  Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS)32.   Based on the collected data, we identify fundamental IoT  security challenges and map them to three problem spaces.  We summarise recent developments related to each  challenge and derive conclusions and actionable  recommendations based on our findings. We also identify  priority challenges based on input from experts in  government, academia and industry.  While every effort is made to ensure that information is  up-to-date, the IoT space continues to grow exponentially  and we cannot guarantee completeness of coverage,  particularly regarding initiatives and technology  developments.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE This report presents a wide-ranging discussion on the IoT  security la ndscape and provides findings and recommen- dations towards securing IoT ecosystems to support policy  initiatives and to inform the industry as well as interested  stakeholders. Hence, the target audience includes  government and industry bodies as well as vendors of IoT  products and services, and organisations responsible for  IoT security. This report is also useful for executives  responsible for IT and/or innovation activities in their  organisations, such as Chief Information Security Officers  (CISOs).   1.5 LANDSCAPE STUDY STRUCTURE The chapters in this study are organised as follows.  – Chapter 2: Definitions and concepts used in this study.  – Chapter 3: Specific challenges in IoT security, and a   survey of expert opinions on the importance of each  challenge given the current state of the art.  – Chapter 4: Overview of key initiatives that contribute to  one or more of the identified challenges.  – Chapter 5: Discussions on each challenge, including a  description of the current landscape and recent  developments.   – Chapter 6: Conclusions and recommendations towards a  more secure IoT ecosystem.   27 https://www.sicw.sg/iot  28 https://www.csa.gov.sg/  29 https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy  30 https://english.ncsc.nl/  31 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/TheBSI/thebsi_node.html  32 https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport14        17  33 https://iot.ieee.org/definition.html  34 https://www.ietf.org/topics/iot/  35 Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things, Department of Homeland Security, May 2016  36 ITU-T Y.2060, Overview of the Internet of Things  2 DEFINITIONS AND BACKGROUND   2.1 INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) The IEEE provides the following definition for IoT33: Internet of Things envisions a self-configuring, adaptive,  complex network that interconnects ‘things’ to the Internet  through the use of standard communication protocols. The  interconnected things have physical or virtual representation  in the digital world, sensing/actuation capability, a  programmability feature and are uniquely identifiable. The  representation contains information including the thing’s  identity, status, location or any other business, social or  privately relevant information. The things offer services, with  or without human intervention, through the exploitation of  unique identification, data capture and communication, and  actuation capability.  According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)34: The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to devices, that are often  constrained in communication and computation capabilities,  now becoming more commonly connected to the Internet,  and to various services that are built on top of the capabilities  these devices jointly provide. It is expected that this  development will usher in more machine-to-machine  communication using the Internet with no human user  actively involved.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security states35 the  following: IoT refers to the connection of systems and devices with  primarily physical purposes (e.g. sensing, heating/cooling,  lighting, motor actuation, transportation) to information  networks (including the Internet) via interoperable protocols,  often built into embedded systems.  According to the ITU-T36, the IoT can be viewed as “a global  infrastructure for the information society, enabling  advanced services by interconnecting physical and virtual  things based on existing and evolving interoperable  information and communication technologies”. ITU-T  emphasises that the IoT is characterised by its large-scale  (compared to the current Internet) interconnections of  heterogeneous devices that closely couple the physical and  virtual worlds without the need for human intermediation;  further, these devices may sleep, wake up, and change  location while possibly being in operation without  supervision for extended durations.        It is clear from the above definitions that IoT deals with  uniquely-identifiable, resource-constrained devices that  measure and possibly control their environments and  communicate over networks. We therefore exclude devices  that are primarily intended for human interaction, such as  mobile phones and computers; having said that, the  extensive work done on IT security (or computer security37)  over the past few decades provides useful fundamentals   for IoT security.   2.2 IOT DEVICE AS A RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED  DEVICE  A representation of a generic IoT device is shown in Figure  3. IoT devices are extremely varied in nature and may  consist of some or all of the components depicted. All IoT  devices include sensors to collect information from the  environment: these might be temperature sensors, motion  sensors, air quality sensors, or light sensors, to name a  few. Some devices may contain actuators for moving or  controlling a system or environment. Devices also contain  power supplies, often batteries. There is necessarily a  module that provides connectivity, although the nature of  this connectivity varies widely. There is also a certain  amount of processing power provided by a microcontroller   unit (MCU), storage such as non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), and  often a minimal operating system (OS) and a dedicated  application.   LARGE-SCALE HETEROGENEOUS AUTOMATED INTEGRATED WITH  PHYSICAL WORLD  The number of  devices will be  far larger than  the current  Internet.  Devices are based  on a variety of  platforms and  communicate  using different  networks.  Devices may be  unsupervised for  extended periods.  Many might have  zero or limited  user interfacing.  IoT connects the  virtual world  directly to physical  objects and  environments.  Figure 2: IoT Characteristics  37 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security  Operating  system  Application  Storage  Sensors Power supply Actuators  ConnectivityProcessing  Figure 3: An IoT Device  18    1938 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7228, IETF RFC 7228, May 2014, Terminology for Constrained-Node Networks  As discussed, IoT devices are often resource-constrained;  we may not have the luxury of measuring their memory in  gigabytes, nor of measuring their processing power by  number of cores. Most IoT devices use a microcontroller  rather than a full-fledged microprocessor, and run at a few  MHz rather than GHz. Specific resource constraints for IoT  devices are shown below.  Additionally, IoT devices may have physical constraints and  accessibility constraints imposed by the operational  environment, e.g. pacemakers within the human body. And,  finally, cost is a critical constraint for IoT devices.   Of course, different devices can be constrained to different  degrees – the varied nature of the devices needs to be  accounted for in any discussion of IoT. The IETF classifies  resource-constrained devices as depicted below.38  Processing  BandwidthMemory  Power Storage  IoT Device  Resource   Constraints  Figure 4: IoT Device Resource Constraints  Classification of Resource-Constrained Devices  Class 0 Pre-configured, sensor-like devices that communicate only with gateways and support bare- minimum management functionality such as a health indicator or heartbeat.  Class 1 Devices that are quite constrained and cannot easily talk to other Internet nodes employing a full  protocol stack such as HTTP/TLS but can use protocols designed for constrained nodes and can  integrate into an IP network using limited memory, storage, and power.  Class 2 Devices that are capable of supporting most of the protocol stacks used on computers. However,  even these devices can benefit from lightweight and energy-efficient protocols and from  consuming less bandwidth.    2.3 IOT SECURITY VS IT SECURITY In accordance with the above discussions, this study  excludes IT devices that require significant human  interaction such as mobile phones and computers.  Extensive work has been done in the field of IT security39  over the past few decades. While IoT security and IT  security share the same fundamental principles, it is often  inadvisable to apply IT security classifications and  mindsets directly to the IoT world40 given the unique nature  of the IoT ecosystem41. The following considerations apply: 1) As discussed, IoT devices are often constrained in terms   of resources and/or physical environments. This  significantly alters the way security is designed; for  instance, IoT connections cannot generally rely on TLS/ SSL for encrypted and authenticated communications  because many IoT devices do not have the resources to  handle session establishment, communication  overheads, or encryption.  2) IoT devices may run without supervision and for  extended periods of time, possibly in hostile  environments – making them particularly susceptible to  hacking. Many might have zero or limited user  interfacing; thus, patching and updating may not be  convenient and malfunctioning or rogue devices may not  be immediately detectable.  3) The fact that IoT is closely integrated with the physical  world can increase the impact of cyber-attacks. While IT  cyber-attacks have resulted in data leakage and  financial losses, IoT cyber-attacks have the potential to  cause direct physical harm.  Moreover, conventional IT security has historically relied on  fortifying a “perimeter”. In previous decades, organisations   could easily define and visualise this perimeter, and create  a protection policy to enforce and guard its obvious  boundary. Enterprises still commonly secure corporate  networks using familiar baseline measures such as the  firewall, the demilitarised zone (DMZ), and some variety of  intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the traditional  perimeter has been eroded by the widespread adoption of  mobile devices, virtual private networks (VPNs), web-based  applications and cloud computing42; IoT potentially takes  both client device and server back-end out of the no-longer- defined perimeter43, making it necessary to re-think  security practices.  2.4 IOT THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES The IETF defines44 a threat as “a potential for violation of  security, which exists when there is a circumstance,  capability, action, or event that could breach security and  cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that  might exploit a vulnerability.” Vulnerabilities can be  exploited by a threat agent in an attack. The result can  potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity or  availability of a resource.  Attacks on critical IoT devices and systems, such as  connected cars and medical equipment, can target the  device itself and disrupt its integrity or availability,  endangering the user of the device and potentially those in  the vicinity. For less critical IoT devices, such as  thermostats or cameras, a major threat is device  compromise, where the devices can be harnessed as part  of a botnet to support DDoS attacks, spam bots or  ransomware campaigns. The aforementioned Mirai45 botnet  and an evolved version of Mirai called Reaper46 showed how   39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security  40 ITU-T Y.4806, Security capabilities supporting safety of the Internet of things  41 https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/security-iot/  42 IBM Red Paper, Understanding IT Perimeter Security https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4397.pdf  43 https://www.networkworld.com/article/3223952/internet-of-things/5-reasons-why-device-makers-cannot-secure-the-iot-platform.html  44 IETF Internet Security Glossary, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949  45 Mirai IoT Botnet Co-Authors Plead Guilty - https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/  46 The Reaper IoT botnet has already infected a million networks - https://www.wired.com/story/reaper-iot-botnet-infected-million-networks/20    21  47 State-of-the-Art and Challenges for the Internet of Things Security, IRTF T2T Research Group, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/  draft-irtf-t2trg-iot-seccons/?include_text=1  48 OWASP IoT Project, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project  49 Practical Internet of Things Security, Brian Russell, from p257, 2016.  50 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot  AN ATTACK: I.E., A THREAT ACTION  COUNTER  MEASURE  A SYSTEM RESOURCE:   TARGET OF THE ATTACK  Attacker i.e., a threat  agent  Vulnerability Passive  or active attack  Threat consequences  Figure 5: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks (Source: IETF)  such large-scale cyber-attacks can cascade into national  and international security threats. Finally, for all types of IoT  devices, the potential loss of confidential information via  the device, its communication infrastructure, or its back- end servers remains a significant threat. Table 1 briefly   discusses some of the threats and vulnerabilities facing IoT  that are most commonly cited by sources such as IRTF47,  OWASP48 and others49,50, as a prerequisite to discussing  IoT security challenges.     Table 1: IoT Threats and Vulnerabilities  IoT Threats and Vulnerabilities  1 Vulnerable device software IoT devices rely on software that might contain poor design choices and/or  security bugs such as buffer overflows and improper exception handling.  This makes them vulnerable to many different attacks that can  compromise data confidentiality or integrity.  2 Privacy threat Device location tracking poses a privacy risk to users; an attacker can  infer sensitive information from data gathered and communicated by  devices. Such information may be sold to interested parties for marketing  purposes or used for unauthorised surveillance.  3 Eavesdropping Communication over an IoT network can be intercepted and deciphered if  the communication channel is not sufficiently protected, for instance if  keying material, security parameters, or configuration settings are exchanged  in the clear or if weak or unsuitable cryptographic algorithms are used. Related  attacks include man-in-the-middle, session hijacking, or message replay.    4 Denial of Service (DoS) Devices, being resource-constrained, are susceptible to denial of service  attacks launched by attackers sending continuous requests to deplete  device resources. On the other hand, compromised devices can  themselves be used to disrupt the operation of other networks or systems  via a Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack.  5 Firmware-level attack An attacker may be able replace device firmware during device  commissioning or under the guise of a routine upgrade.   6 Device cloning or substitution A non-trusted factory can clone the physical characteristics, firmware/ software and security configuration of the device. Deployed devices might  also be compromised and their software reverse-engineered, allowing for  cloning. Cloned devices may be sold cheaply in the market and can contain  functional modifications including backdoors. Alternatively, a genuine  device may be substituted with a variant or clone during transportation or  commissioning.  7 Data leakage Disclosure of sensitive data, intentionally or unintentionally, to  unauthorised parties. Confidential data may be captured by an attacker  from individual devices, during transit, or from the back-end.  8 Malware Devices can be infected with programs designed to carry out unauthorised  actions on a system, possibly using existing vulnerabilities in software or  firmware.  9 Weak user/admin credentials and  authentication  Poor credential management such as weak password choices and lack of  multi-factor authentication for the user and administrative interfaces of  devices, gateways or back-ends is a common vulnerability in many  information systems including IoT.   22    23  2.5 SECURITY VS SAFETY While the terms “safety” and “security” tend to be used  interchangeably in informal situations, they have acquired  specific meanings51,52 in the domain of Information  Security.   Safety is the condition of a system operating without  unacceptable risk of physical injury or damage to the health  of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage  to property or to the environment. (IEC)  Computer security, cybersecurity or IT security is the  protection of computer systems from theft or damage as well  as disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.  (Wikipedia)  Safety measures focus on preventing losses due to  unintentional actions by benevolent actors, while security  measures emphasise the prevention of losses due to  intentional actions by malevolent actors53. Security threats,  as described in the previous section, tend to be rooted in  malicious intentions, typically deriving from crime,  terrorism, geo-politics or hacktivism, and they evolve over  time, meaning that there should be a continuing strategy to  react, adapt and defend against these threats. Safety  hazards, on the other hand, are typically accidental and  stem from environmental situations or human error.   Having said that, many security threats can lead to safety  losses – indeed, the fact that IoT devices are closely  integrated with the physical world54 increases the likelihood  of a malicious attack cascading into a significant safety  loss.   51 https://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/explained/  52 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security  53 Inside Risks: An Integrated Approach to Safety and Security Based on Systems Theory, Young and Leveson, Communications of the ACM, Feb 2014  54 https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/safety-security/      25  3 IOT SECURITY PROBLEM SPACES    AND CHALLENGES   This study identifies 11 cybersecurity challenges in the IoT  landscape based on a review of existing literature as well   as expert input from the International IoT Security  Roundtables and conversations with practitioners and  policymakers during and after the Roundtables.55 Figure 6  maps the identified challenges to three problem spaces:  Principles, Governance and Legislation; Ecosystem  Development; and Technical References and Standards.     This study explores these IoT security challenges in a  domain-agnostic manner, with IoT devices modelled as  generic resource-constrained devices that require security  controls. Orthogonal to the generic approach would be a  domain-specific approach; a given domain can impose  specific physical and technological constraints and have  specific security requirements. We briefly address in Annex  A the IoT security requirements in two rapidly-growing  domains: smart mobility and smart health.

Delivered during SICW International IoT Security Roundtable 2017.   3.1 PRINCIPLES, GOVERNANCE AND LEGISLATION IoT security needs to be based upon fundamentally sound  cybersecurity principles. To achieve security in practice,  these principles should lead to concrete guidelines and  standards. Standards are used as a basis for evaluation  and certification. For certification schemes to be  successful, there must either be demand for certification  from customers/users or governmental legislation  mandating a minimum assurance level. Finally, since IoT   is a global phenomenon and is not limited by national  boundaries, it is essential to align country-specific  legislations and adopt a coherent global approach to IoT  security to drive standards and collaboration in creating an  IoT environment that upholds security and privacy  expectations. We identified the following challenges in this  problem space. 1.  Cybersecurity and Privacy by Design – To identify and   define foundational principles to build cybersecurity and  privacy by design for IoT devices.   2.  IoT Security Standards and Guidelines – To set and  harmonise IoT security standards and recommen- dations over different application domains.  3.  Evaluation and Certification – To develop globally  recognised and adopted cybersecurity evaluation and  certification regimes for IoT devices.   4.  Future-Proof Legislation – To develop regulatory  policies that are sufficiently flexible to deal with societal  security needs and a constantly evolving industry.  3.2 ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT As mentioned in the introduction to this document, time-  to-market, usability and cost are key considerations for   IoT solutions, and the razor-thin margins for devices   leave suppliers with less to spend on security. Besides  incentivising manufacturers to implement security, it is  important to cultivate an ecosystem that fosters security in  IoT supply chains and throughout device lifecycles. This   study identified the following challenges in this problem  space56.  5.  Responsible Industry Ecosystem – To transform to a   responsible industry that proactively implements  cybersecurity in IoT devices.  6. Supply Chain Security – To create a framework for all  suppliers and service providers involved in the supply  chain to adopt security principles and to deliver secure  IoT components.  7. Product Lifecycle Support – To implement a framework  for secure device lifecycle management and patching  that is adopted by all parties involved.  3.3 TECHNICAL REFERENCES AND STANDARDS Finally, this study examines the security challenges in the  IoT technologies themselves: the devices and firmware, the  operating systems and applications on the devices and  back-end servers, and the communication infrastructure  connecting devices to gateways and back-ends. The  identified technical challenges are aligned with “the four  cornerstones of security” identified by Symantec57.  8. Device Identity and Root of Trust – To establish a chain   of trust from a root of trust on resource-constrained IoT  devices to develop foundationally secure devices.  9. Secure OS, Cloud and Applications – To provision  security controls in device OSes as well as cloud and  back-end applications to guarantee security within the  IoT ecosystem.  10. Secure Communications and Infrastructure – To ensure  data and source integrity in the communication  networks of resource-constrained IoT devices.  11. Security Monitoring and Analytics – To detect  vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in IoT  deployments and to quickly respond, recover and  remediate.  26    27  Challenges 8 to 10 should provide a technical security  baseline. However, history shows that vulnerabilities are  invariably found after a product is deployed; therefore, we  need to continue to monitor and analyse IoT deployments  for advanced attacks, exceptions and other deviant  behaviour. This is addressed under challenge 11. Of  course, newly-found attack vectors should lead to solutions  deployed in the form of patches or updates – which ties this  challenge back to the product lifecycle and ecosystem.    3.4 EXPERT OPINIONS ON PRIORITY CHALLENGES As described in Chapter 1, this study makes extensive   use of material gathered during interactive sessions with  cybersecurity and IoT practitioners and policymakers.   The sessions included workshops, panel discussions   and International IoT Security Roundtables58, and expert  opinions were sought from a number of individuals and  several organisations including Singapore’s Cyber Security  Agency59, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the  Netherland60, the Netherlands National Cyber Security  Centre61, the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media   and Sport62, and Germany’s BSI63.  To determine the relative importance of each challenge and  thereby identify priority challenges for policymakers and  industry, a number of experts were surveyed. They were  asked which of the identified IoT security challenges are, in  their opinion, the most relevant and urgent given the current  state of IoT security; their responses are summarised in the  chart below. Each respondent chose up to 3 priority  challenges.    As Figure 7 on the next page reveals, there is a wide   range of opinions among the expert community on which  challenges are most critical; indeed, this is reflective of the  nebulous state of IoT security today. Having said that, it is  clear that the community expects security to be built into  IoT devices and ecosystems by design. The development of  effective evaluation and certification schemes built upon  widely-accepted security standards (themselves based on  sound cybersecurity and privacy principles) is increasingly  seen as a cornerstone of IoT security, as is the  establishment of a secure supply chain and managed  device lifecycle. The security of the hardware devices is  also seen by the expert community as important; in  particular, the hardware root of trust is emphasised by  security practitioners in the field. The streamlining of  monitoring efforts with the supply chain and lifecycle  challenges represents a key opportunity.   These inputs suggest that certain security challenges  should be addressed on a priority basis; this is discussed  in the conclusion of this study after an examination of the  current landscape and recent developments related to each  challenge.  58 https://www.sicw.sg/iot  59 https://www.csa.gov.sg/  60 https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy  61 https://english.ncsc.nl/  62 https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport  63 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/TheBSI/thebsi_node.html28    29  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50  Security monitoring and analytics  Secure communications and infrastructure  Secure OS, cloud and applications  Device identity and root of trust  Product lifecycle support  Supply chain security  Responsible industry ecosystem  Future proof legislation  Evaluation and certi�cation  IoT security standards and guidelines  Cybersecurity and privacy by design  % of respondents  Io T   S ec  ur it  y  C  ha lle  ng e  Figure 7: What are the most important challenges in IoT security? 20 expert respondents, each of whom chose 3 priority challenges      31  4 KEY INITIATIVES 4.1  INVENTORY OF KEY INITIATIVES  Numerous IoT security initiatives have emerged in recent  years. We have identified 25 major initiatives for further  examination; each initiative is described in more detail in  Annex B. The initiatives have been chosen based on their  focus on and contributions to IoT security rather than IoT in  general. These initiatives contribute to and, to some extent,  define the state of the art in IoT security.  The initiatives broadly fall within the below categories. – IoT-focused groups formed by standards development   organisations (SDOs) such as ETSI, the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU)64 and the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF)65.  – Professional bodies such as the Industrial Internet  Consortium (IIC)66, the IoT Security Foundation67,   and the Cloud Security Alliance68.  – Governmental initiatives such as the IoT security  divisions of NIST69 and ENISA70, and the Alliance for   IoT Innovation (AIOTI)71.  – Alliances focused on networking standards, such as  GSMA72, Zigbee73 and LoRa74.  – Initiatives dedicated to hardware platforms, such as the  Trusted Computing Group (TCG)75, UEFI76 and  GlobalPlatform77.  Table 2 indicates the IoT security challenge/s primarily  addressed by each key initiative. The table reveals a strong  emphasis on standards as well as connectivity, and   comparatively less focus (in terms of number of initiatives)  on supply chain and lifecycle. It is noted that several of  the initiatives are dedicated chiefly to a single challenge:  Wi-SUN78, Zigbee, LoRa and IETF are focused primarily on  IoT networking and communications (and the accompanying  standards), the Global Cyber Alliance79 deals with threat  analytics and intelligence, and UEFI and GlobalPlatform  largely address hardware security. Some bodies, such as  the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and the Industrial  Internet Consortium (IIC), have a much wider focus.  Table 3 describes the primary membership of each initiative  in terms of professional domain (government, industry or  academia) and geographical region. We observe that  government involvement is limited, particularly for non- European initiatives. Also, there is a strong tendency  towards continental initiatives, focusing on the Americas or  Europe. Only the IoT Acceleration Consortium80 and Wi-SUN  are oriented towards Asia, specifically Japan. Given that  Asia is a manufacturing hub for computer hardware and  microelectronics, we would expect to find more IoT security  activity in this region – although it is possible that we have  been unable to identify Asian initiatives owing to language  barriers. We were also unable to find major initiatives  operating in Africa, although we note that the IoT Forum  Africa81 is held annually in Johannesburg. Table 4 reiterates  that global governmental initiatives are lacking – the sole  international government-driven initiative appears to be the  ITU-T Study Group 2082.  64 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2017-2020/20/Pages/default.aspx  65 https://www.ietf.org/topics/iot/  66 https://www.iiconsortium.org/  67 https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/  68 https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/  69 https://www.nist.gov/topics/internet-things-iot  70 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/iot  71 https://aioti.eu/  72 https://www.gsma.com/iot/  73 https://www.zigbee.org/  74 https://lora-alliance.org/  75 https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/  76 https://uefi.org/  77 https://globalplatform.org/  78 https://www.wi-sun.org/  79 https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/smart-cities-and-iot/  80 http://www.iotac.jp/en/  81 http://iotforumafrica.com/  82 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/groups/Pages/sg20.aspx    C yb  er se  cu rit  y a nd   P riv  ac y b  y D es  ig n  Io T   S ec  ur ity   S ta  nd ar  ds  Ev al  ua tio  n  an  d  C  er tifi  ca tio  n  Fu tu  re -P  ro of   L eg  is la  tio n  Re sp  on si  bl e   In du  st ry   E co  sy st  em  S up  pl y   C ha  in  S  ec ur  ity  Pr od  uc t L  ife cy  cl e   S up  po rt  D ev  ic e   Id en  tit y   an d   Ro ot   o f T  ru st  S ec  ur e   O S,   C lo  ud  a  nd  A  pp lic  at io  ns  S ec  ur e   C om  m un  ic at  io ns   a nd   In fr  a  S ec  ur ity   M on  ito rin  g  an  d  An  al yt  ic s  1 Alliance for IoT Innovation ● ● ●  2 Cloud Security Alliance ● ●  3 ENISA IoT ● ● ●  4 ETSI ● ●  5 GlobalPlatform ● ●  6 Global Cyber Alliance ●  7 GSMA ● ●  8 Internet Engineering Task Force ● ●  9 Industrial Internet Consortium ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●  10 IoT Acceleration Consortium ●  11 IoT Consortium ●  12 IoT Cybersecurity Alliance ● ● ● ●  13 IoT European Platforms Initiative ●  14 IoT Security Foundation ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●  15 ITU Study Group 20 ● ●  16 LoRa Alliance ● ● ●  17 NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program ●  18 Open Connectivity Foundation ● ●  19 OWASP IoT Project ● ● ● ●  20 Prpl Foundation ● ●  21 Thing-to-Thing Research Group ● ● ●  22 Trusted Computing Group ● ●  23 UEFI Forum ● ●  24 Wi-SUN Alliance ● ● ●  25 Zigbee Alliance ● ● ●  Table 2: IoT Security Initiatives – Challenges Addressed  IoT Security Initiative C ha  lle ng  es  A  dd re  ss ed  32    33  G ov  er nm  en t  In du  st ry  A ca  de m  ia  A m  er ic  as  Eu ro  pe  A si  a  G lo  ba l  1 Alliance for IoT Innovation ● ● ●  2 Cloud Security Alliance ● ● ●  3 ENISA IoT ● ●  4 ETSI ● ● ● ●  5 GlobalPlatform ● ●  6 Global Cyber Alliance ● ●  7 GSMA ● ●  8 Internet Engineering Task Force ● ● ●  9 Industrial Internet Consortium ● ●  10 IoT Acceleration Consortium ● ● ● ●  11 IoT Consortium ● ● ●  12 IoT Cybersecurity Alliance ● ● ●  13 IoT European Platforms Initiative ● ●  14 IoT Security Foundation ● ● ●  15 ITU-T Study Group 20 ● ● ● ●  16 LoRa Alliance ● ●  17 NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program ● ●  18 Open Connectivity Foundation ● ●  19 OWASP IoT Project ● ● ● ●  20 Prpl Foundation ● ●  21 Thing-to-Thing Research Group ● ● ● ●  22 Trusted Computing Group ● ●  23 UEFI Forum ● ●  24 Wi-SUN Alliance ● ●  25 Zigbee Alliance ● ● ● ●  Total numbers 6 22 8 8 10 2 12  Table 3: IoT Security Initiatives – Membership  IoT Security Initiative M em  be rs  hi p   (p rim  ar y   fo cu  s)    34  Global Americas Europe Asia  Government 1 1 2 1  Industry 11 7 7 2  Academia 3 3 3 1  Table 4: IoT Security Initiatives – Membership (Region vs Domain)  At the same time there are numerous national research  initiatives, typically at university level, focusing on IoT  security. Notable examples include the PETRAS83 research  hub formed by a group of U.K. universities led by University  College London.   4.2 APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INITIATIVES Many pilots address IoT security in the narrower context of  a specialised application domain such as automotive or  healthcare84, often under domain-specific names such as  \"intelligent transportation\", “smart mobility”, \"smart grid\",  or \"e-health\". In the automotive domain, notable examples  include the Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research  of Autonomous Vehicles (CETRAN)85 at the Nanyang  Technological University in Singapore and the Security  Credential Management System (SCMS)86 of the U.S.  Department of Transportation. Enterprise Singapore has  published a set of provisional national standards, known as  Technical Reference (TR) 68, to guide industry in the  development and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles  in Singapore. The TR includes cybersecurity principles and  assessment methodology.  A vehicular IoT technology that is already widely deployed is  the EU-wide eCall initiative87, intended to bring rapid  assistance to motorists in the event of a crash by  communicating the vehicle’s location and direction to  emergency services; eCall has been mandatory for all new  cars sold within the EU since April 2018.   The Smart Mobility Working Group of AIOTI88 has done  substantial work detailing the application of IoT principles  to connected vehicles. Intelligent Transportation Systems  (ITS) groups worldwide, particularly ERTICO89 in Europe, are  involved in a number of pilot projects in the area of smart  mobility. ERTICO has also released recommendations90 on  communication technologies for future Cooperative ITS  (C-ITS) scenarios. At the same time, consumer privacy is   a concern in automotive IoT applications; the American  Future of Privacy Forum91 and National Automobile Dealers’  Association (NADA) have published a consumer guide92  highlighting the types of data that connected cars collect  and transmit.  In healthcare, efforts include in-home monitoring services  for the elderly93 from Fujitsu and Panasonic, the M.A.I.L.  (Motion capture and Artificial Intelligence assisted  Liposuction)94 system from Korean plastic surgery provider  365mc, and remote monitoring and management of in-vitro  diagnosis (IVD) devices95 by Roche Diagnostics96 in China.  Cybersecurity concerns have naturally begun to emerge: in  2015, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered  hospitals to stop using the Hospira Symbiq infusion pump,  which delivers medications directly into the bloodstream,   83 https://www.petrashub.org/  84 We discuss these domains in more detail in Annex A.  85 http://erian.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/IRP/FMSs/Pages/Centre-of-Excellence-  for-Testing-Research-of-AVs-NTU-CETRAN.aspx  86 https://www.its.dot.gov/factsheets/pdf/CV_SCMS.pdf  87 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/  ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018  88 https://aioti.eu/aioti-wg09-report-on-smart-mobility/  89 http://ertico.com/  90 http://erticonetwork.com/  ertico-releases-guide-about-technologies-for-future-c-its-service-scenarios/  91 https://fpf.org/  92 https://fpf.org/2017/01/25/  fpf-and-nada-launch-guide-to-consumer-privacy-in-the-connected-car/  93 http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-  releases/2015/0625-01.html  94 https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/  story/365mc-azure-iot-suite-machine-learning-korea-en  95 https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/roche-diagnostics  96 https://www.roche.com/about/business/diagnostics.htm    35  after a security researcher showed that the pump could be  accessed remotely over WiFi and allowed an attacker to  change dosage settings or use it as a gateway to attack  hospital networks97.   While there are numerous pilots and also several American  and European initiatives to address specific domains such  as automotive and healthcare as discussed above, global  IoT security initiatives and standards are lacking in these  domains.   4.3 KEY FINDINGS – Most initiatives have a generic focus, and application-  specific initiatives (e.g. for automotive or healthcare) are  largely country- or region-specific.  – Most Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) have  initiated work on IoT Security standards.  – Most initiatives are industry-driven, and we observe a  lack of government involvement outside Europe.  – National or continental initiatives are centred on the  Americas or Europe; a global approach is lacking.  – Substantial initiatives with a broad security focus include  the Industrial IoT Consortium and the IoT Security  Foundation.  97 https://www.reuters.com/article/  us-hospira-fda-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0Q52GJ20150731      37  5 IOT SECURITY CHALLENGES This chapter articulates the 11 IoT security challenges in  detail. For each challenge we describe the current  landscape and recent developments to examine the gap  between the challenge and the state of the art. The full set  of findings for the 11 security challenges are input for the  conclusions and recommendations to drive IoT  cybersecurity forward.   5.1 CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY BY DESIGN  To build cybersecurity and privacy by design into IoT, a set of  security principles should be adopted and adhered to.  These principles form the basis for standards, future-proof  legislation, and operational security solutions.   5.1.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments The United States Department of Homeland Security  (DHS)98, OWASP99, the Korea Internet & Security Agency100,  and the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI)101 have all defined  sets of IoT security and privacy principles.  Strategic Principles by DHS The U.S. DHS describes the risks associated with IoT and  provides a set of principles and best practices to build  security into IoT.102   US Department of Homeland Security –   Strategic Principles for Securing the IoT  1 Incorporate Security at the Design Phase  2 Advance Security Updates and Vulnerability Management  3 Build on Proven Security Practices  4 Prioritise Security Measures According to Potential  Impact  5 Promote Transparency across IoT  6 Connect Carefully and Deliberately  IoT Security Principles from South Korea The seven principles of common security for IoT as  proposed by Korea Internet & Security Agency103 should be  considered by the providers (developers) of IoT devices and  services, and by users as well.  98  https://www.dhs.gov/  99  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page  100  https://www.kisa.or.kr/eng/main.jsp  101  https://aioti.eu/  102  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ Strategic_  Principles_for_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things-2016-1115-FINAL....pdf  103  IoT Common Security Principles v1.0, Korea Internet & Security Agency.  Korea Internet and Security Agency – IoT Common Security Principles  1 Design IoT products and services in consideration of the need to protect information and strengthen privacy.  2 Apply and verify technologies for the development of safe software and hardware.  3 Provide a method of establishing safe initial security.  4 Comply with the security protocol and set safe parameters.  5 Update security patches against the weak points of IoT products and services continuously.  6 Provide a system for information protection and privacy to ensure safe operation and control.  7 Provide a system capable of coping with infringements of the IoT and a method of detecting the responsible  entity.    IoT Security Principles from DCMS UK The U.K. Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has published a report104 on IoT security  in which five guiding principles are identified to inform future action. The report also describes the development of the  U.K.’s Code of Practice105 on IoT Security.   104  Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things. Policy report UK Government, March 2018.  105  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/secure-by-design/code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security  106  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Principles_of_IoT_Security  UK Government – Improving the Cyber Security of Consumer IoT  1 Reducing Burden – Many consumers struggle to understand what is required of them, or conducted on their  behalf, to keep their products secure. Reducing the burden on consumers will likely require everyone in the  supply chain to pay more attention to security.  2 Transparency – Greater transparency is an essential part of a secure by design approach. Being open and explicit  about security mechanisms that have been put in place to secure a product or service, allows for accountability  and scrutiny, thereby enabling others in the supply chain to make informed choices.  3 Measurability – A secure by design approach should not just be about putting in place good security mechanisms,  but also being able to measure the effectiveness of those mechanisms.  4 Facilitating Dialogue – Facilitating dialogue means maintaining effective communication between all parties  across the supply chain and with consumers.  5 Resilience – A secure by design approach should further have provisions to increase the resilience of critical  functions and services. This includes conducting business continuity planning, establishing a “fallback  framework” and undertaking regular risk assessments to anticipate and mitigate future problems.  IoT Security Principles by OWASP  1 Assume a Hostile Edge – Edge components are likely to fall into adversarial hands. Assume attackers will have  physical access to edge components and can manipulate them, move them to hostile networks, and control  resources such as DNS, DHCP, and internet routing.  2 Test for Scale – The volume of IoT means that every design and security consideration must also consider scale.  Simple bootstrapping into an ecosystem can create a self-denial of service condition at IoT scale. Security  countermeasures must perform at volume.  IoT Security Principles by OWASP OWASP states sixteen principles106 that cover the full spectrum of IoT from system hardening and lifecycle support to  authentication and isolation.    38    39  3 Internet of Lies – Automated systems are extremely capable of presenting misinformation in convincing formats.  IoT systems should always verify data from the edge to prevent autonomous misinformation from tainting a  system.  4 Exploit Autonomy – Automated systems are capable of complex, monotonous, and tedious operations that  human users would never tolerate. IoT systems should seek to exploit this advantage for security.  5 Expect Isolation – The advantage of autonomy should also extend to situations where a component is isolated.  Security countermeasures must never degrade in the absence of connectivity.  6 Protect Uniformly – Data encryption only protects encrypted pathways. Data that is transmitted over an encrypted  link is still exposed at any point it is unencrypted, such as prior to encryption, after decryption, and along any  communications pathways that do not enforce encryption. Careful consideration must be given to full data life  cycle to ensure that encryption is applied uniformly and appropriately to guarantee protections. Encryption is not  total - be aware that metadata about encrypted data might also provide valuable information to attackers.  7 Encryption is Tricky – It is very easy for developers to make mistakes when applying encryption. Using encryption  but failing to validate certificates, failing to validate intermediate certificates, failing to encrypt traffic with a  strong key, using a uniform seed, or exposing private key material are all common pitfalls when deploying  encryption. Ensure a thorough review of any encryption capability to avoid these mistakes.  8 System Hardening – Be sure that IoT components are stripped down to the minimum viable feature set to reduce  attack surface. Unused ports and protocols should be disabled, and unnecessary supporting software should be  uninstalled or turned off. Be sure to track third party components and update them where possible.  9 Limit what you can – To the extent possible limit access based on acceptable use criteria. There's no advantage  in exposing a sensor interface to the entire internet if there's no good case for a remote user in a hostile country.  Limit access to white lists of rules that make sense.  10 Life cycle Support – IoT systems should be able to quickly onboard new components, but should also be capable  of re-credentialing existing components, and deprovisioning components for a full device life cycle. This capability  should include all components in the ecosystem from devices to users.  11 Data in Aggregate is Unpredictable – IoT systems can collect vast quantities of data that may seem innocuous at  first, but complex data analysis may reveal very sensitive patterns or information hidden in data. IoT systems  must prepare for the data stewardship responsibilities of unexpected information sensitivity that may only be  revealed after an ecosystem is deployed.  12 Plan for the Worst – IoT systems should have capabilities to respond to compromises, hostile participants,  malware, or other adverse events. There should be features in place to re-issue credentials, exclude participants,  distribute security patches and updates, and so on, before they are ever necessary.  13 The Long Haul – IoT system designers must recognise that the extended lifespan of devices will require forward  compatible security features. IoT ecosystems must be capable of aging in place and still addressing evolving  security concerns. New encryption, advances in protocols, new attack methods and techniques, and changing  topology all necessitate that IoT systems be capable of addressing emerging security concerns for years after  they are deployed.    14 Attackers Target Weakness – Ensure that security controls are equivalent across interfaces in an ecosystem.  Attackers will identify the weakest component and attempt to exploit it. Mobile interfaces, hidden API's, or  resource constrained environments must enforce security in the same way as more robust or feature rich  interfaces. Using multi-factor authentication for a web interface is useless if a mobile application allows access  to the same APIs with a four-digit PIN.  15 Transitive Ownership – IoT components are often sold or transferred during their lifespan. Plan for this eventuality  and be sure IoT systems can protect and isolate data to enable safe transfer of ownership, even if a component is  sold or transferred to a competitor or attacker.  16 N:N Authentication – Realise that IoT does not follow a traditional 1:1 model of users to applications. Each  component may have more than one user and a user may interact with multiple components. Several users might  access different data or capabilities on a single device, and one user might have varying rights to multiple  devices. Multiple devices may need to broker permissions on behalf of a single user account, and so on. Be sure  the IoT system can handle these complex trust and authentication schemes.  AOITI Basic Privacy Principles The Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) organised a workshop in 2016 in Sophia Antipolis, France, to explore and identify  design principles for IoT security.107 One of the workshops was dedicated to practical privacy in IoT, and participants  identified the following principles.   107  AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World, Report, 2016  AIOTI Basic Requirements on Practical Privacy in IoT  1 Common Understanding – Design, manufacturer and assemble components of Things and IoT ecosystems with  clear understanding of what means what, and to what extent there is consensus in the related complex value  chain and ecosystems. Promoting the goals of data protection such as limiting the scope of data processing to  the necessary level; data segmentation, mapping, categorisation, purpose limitation, data isolation, and data  control and data access of personal data are seen as prerequisite elements.  2 No Personal Data by Default, ‘As-If’ by Design & De-Identification by Default – Data minimalisation starts with  only requesting, collecting, obtaining, deriving and processing personal data to the extent necessary (need-to- know principle), and. The ‘As-If’ principle it to design and engineer ecosystems in IoT as if these will (now or in a  later phase) process personal data. The As-If principle is closely related to the privacy by design and privacy by  default principles. Design de-Identification capabilities so personal data is de-identified as soon as legally  possible.  3 Manufacturer-Implemented Parametrisation – Rights management for accessing data controlled by the user  based on the assessment where and when a Thing or IoT ecosystems in its life cycle comes into contact with  personal data, creates/derives (new) personal data, or otherwise processes personal data, while keeping in my  mind the contextuality of purposes and use, as well as multi-purpose Things and IoT ecosystems.  40    41  108  https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/  press-releases/1549-2019-02-etsi-releases-first-globally-applicable-  standard-for-consumer-iot-security  109  https://www.itu.int  110  https://www.nist.gov/  111  http://www.etsi.org/  112  https://www.ietf.org/  113  https://www.iso.org  114  https://www.gartner.com/doc/3762285/hype-cycle-iot-standards-protocols  4 Accountability & Risk Impact Assessment by Design – Any data controller and processor to be accountable for  regulatory, contractual and ethical compliance. If data is compromised, disclosed, accessed or lost, clear  statement by vendors, data controllers and data processors on impact is another prerequisite.  5 Awareness & Information Supplied with Indication of Purpose – Technically regulating access to data to define  who can use it for what purpose, and how that can be made transparent, and subsequently measured and  monitored. Design in a transparent way, so the data subject is and remains clear and aware of privacy issues,  choices it makes and possible consequences thereof.  5.1.2 Key Findings – There is no single set of IoT security and privacy   principles that is internationally recognised and adopted. – The diversity in proposed IoT security principles between   different countries and initiatives illustrates a lack of  collaboration, especially between governments.  – Due to the lack of globally-adopted principles, a language  towards common understanding of shared IoT challenges  and issues is lacking. Such a language is required to  define a global governance process.  – Consumers and companies are not uniformly aware of the  cybersecurity risks and may not be equipped to respond  properly.  5.2 IOT SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES While numerous standards exist in the IoT space, IoT  security has not been standardised significantly until now; a  recent ETSI standard is one of the first efforts to  standardise IoT security.108 While numerous sets of IoT  security recommendations exist, it is important to  harmonise and align these for global acceptance and  adoption as a precursor to developing evaluation and  certification schemes.  5.2.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Standards development organisations (SDOs) such as ITU109,  NIST110, ETSI111, IETF112, and ISO113 have all undertaken  IoT-specific efforts. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for IoT Standards  and Protocols114 profiles as many as 30 IoT standards,   15 of which have been marked to deliver “high business  benefit.” Six of those are expected to become mainstream  in the next five years, including the below networking  standards. – 6LoWPAN: IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area   Networks is an IETF standard to deliver IPv6 connectivity  over non-IP networking technologies such as NFC and  LoRa using extremely low power, such that compliant  devices can potentially run for years on battery power.  – OneM2M: a machine-to-machine service layer that can be  embedded in hardware and software to connect devices.  – Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA): a proprietary  standard for connecting IoT objects.  – Sigfox: a proprietary low-power, low-throughput  technology for IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M)  communications.    While many of the above standards include a security  component, this section focuses on recommendations   that deal with IoT security in general. Technical networking  standards (including security aspects) are discussed in the  section on Secure Communications and Infrastructure.   The UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport  (DCMS), the EU Agency for Network and Information  Security (ENISA), the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI),   and GSMA115 have released recommendations, guidelines  or good practices specifically for IoT security. We briefly  discuss these below.  UK Code of Practice DCMS UK has proposed a Code of Practice116 for the  security of consumer IoT products and associated services.  The Code identifies that many severe security issues stem  from poor security design and bad practice in products sold  to consumers. The guidance is listed in order of importance  and, according to DCMS, the top three should be addressed  as a matter of priority. 1. No default passwords, 2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy, 3. Keep software updated, 4. Securely store credentials and security-sensitive data, 5. Communicate securely, 6. Minimise exposed attack surfaces, 7. Ensure software integrity, 8. Ensure that personal data is protected, 9. Make systems resilient to outages, 10. Monitor system telemetry data, 11. Make it easy for consumers to delete personal data, 12. Make installation and maintenance of devices easy, 13. Validate input data.  The Code of Practice is based on IoT security recomm- endations from the PETRAS IoT Hub117. In February 2019,  the European Standards Organisation ETSI launched a  globally-applicable industry standard for IoT devices based  on the Code of Practice.118 It is expected that CEN/ CENELEC will also be involved in the further development  and dissemination of this standard (see https://www. cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectorsold/DefenceSecurity  Privacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx).  ENISA Security Recommendations The Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT from  ENISA119 include a number of policy, organisational and  technical measures. Technical measures include the use   of a hardware-based immutable root of trust, and security  features such as specialised security chips / coprocessors  that integrate security at the transistor level providing  trusted storage of device identity, protecting keys at rest  and in use, and preventing unprivileged access to security  sensitive code. The overwhelming breadth and depth of  coverage make this inventory impressive, but at the same  time possibly challenging to implement in practice.  AIOTI Recommendations for Standards AIOTI has done considerable work in this area, as  referenced by the activity underway within the AIOTI  Standards Working Group120 (WG03). According to AIOTI,  basic requirements for IoT devices include121: – Testing and Certifying Security – Using existing, proven   certifications recognised as state-of-the-art based on  assessed risk level; additional introduction of a  classification system to certify devices for particular   use-case scenarios depending on the level of risk.   115  https://www.gsma.com/  116  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/  code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security  117  https://www.petrashub.org/  118  https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/  press-releases/1549-2019-02-etsi-releases-first-globally-applicable-  standard-for-consumer-iot-security  119  ENISA ‘Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT’, November 2017  120  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/  internet-things-platforms-and-standardisation-workshop  121  AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper Connected World   Report 2016061642    43  122  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program  123  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8228/final  124  https://www.nist.gov/blogs/i-think-therefore-iam/  lets-talk-about-iot-device-security  125  https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019/02/01/final_  core_iot_cybersecurity_capabilities_baseline_considerations.pdf  126  http://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/IIC_PUB_G4_V1.00_PB-3.pdf  127  https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security/iot-security-guidelines/  128  IoT Security Guidelines Overview Document, Version 2.0, 31 October 2017  129  https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-assessment/  – Security Labels – Proven labels such as an ‘Energy  efficiency label’ of appliances in order to classify the IoT  device.  – Preset Certified Security Structures – Encryption  requirement for identities, access, communication  channels and secure storage of keys and to store data  at rest – also for secure boot process.  – Security Rationale – Explanation of implemented  security measures related to well understood hazards  in order to define acceptable level security risks from  any designer of IoT device, auditable by independent  third party.  – Information exchange – Sharing information about  incidents/potential vulnerabilities between  manufacturers.  – Defined functions – IoT devices should only be able  to perform documented functions, making sense for  device/service.  – Standardisation – Interoperability of components and  communication protocols.  NIST IoT Cybersecurity Program NIST’s Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT)  Program122 is undertaking efforts to identify a core set of  cybersecurity capabilities to form a baseline for IoT devices.  In September 2018, NIST released a publication entitled  “Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT)  Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks” in order to help federal  agencies and other organisations better understand and  manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with  their IoT devices throughout device lifecycles123. This  publication is intended to be an introductory foundation for  a planned series of publications on more specific aspects  of this topic. As of mid-2019, NIST is focusing on engaging   with stakeholders124 via workshops, seminars and a draft  discussion paper125 in order to gather feedback for a Core  IoT Cybersecurity Capabilities Baseline.  Industrial Internet of Things Security Framework126  Early IoT applications included industrial control systems,  or Operational Technology (OT), that converged with IT to  create an Industrial IoT. Such an IoT system connects and  integrates industrial control systems with enterprise  software and business processes and analytics to improve  decision-making, operations and collaboration among a  large number of increasingly autonomous control systems.  The Industrial Internet Consortium’s IIoT Security  Framework approaches IoT in a generic and detailed  manner, and provides concrete recommendations for  endpoint security, communications security, and data  protection, making this report highly relevant for IoT device  manufacturers.   GSMA IoT Security Guidelines127  The telecommunications industry, which the GSMA  represents, has a history of providing secure products and  services to their customers at a very large scale. According  to the GSMA, the provision of secure products and services  is as much a process as it is a goal. Vigilance, innovation,  responsiveness and continuous improvement are required  to ensure that the solutions address the threats. To help  ensure that the new IoT services coming to market are  secure, the GSMA has created a comprehensive set of  security guidelines128 for the benefit of service providers  who are looking to develop new IoT services.  Taking this a step further is GSMA’s assessment  checklist129, which enables the suppliers of IoT products,     services and components to self-assess the conformance  of their products, services and components to the GSMA  IoT Security Guidelines. Completing a GSMA IoT Security  Assessment Checklist allows an entity to demonstrate the  security measures they have taken to protect their  products, services and components from cybersecurity  risks. Assessment declarations can be made by submitting  a completed declaration to the GSMA.  5.2.2 Key Findings – Security standards and guidelines are required for   development and operations to stimulate the adoption of  secure IoT devices.  – A number of IoT security good practices, guidelines and  recommendations exist, but efforts from established  standards development organisations such as ETSI and  NIST are very recent.  – Manufacturers may not have the expertise to make use of  the available guidelines and recommendation. Usability  of security guidelines is a challenge and requires more  research.  – Harmonisation of IoT security guidelines and  recommendations is required to stimulate adoption.  Harmonisation should be supported by global  cybersecurity research initiatives.  – It is important for standardisation processes to stay  aligned with technological developments without stifling  innovation.  5.3 EVALUATION AND CERTIFICATION A comprehensive global IoT certification framework or   self-certification solution does not yet exist; it remains an  open challenge to develop globally recognised and adopted  cybersecurity evaluation and certification regimes for IoT   devices. Given that a system of secure components is not  by definition a secure ecosystem, evaluation and  certification regimes should include individual components,  the wider network of systems and components, and the  global ecosystem.   An evaluation and certification scheme should be based on  a generic and common framework, possibly with business-  or application-specific provisions. Such a framework may  provide assurance similar to the Common Criteria for  Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC  15408). An alternative approach to certification may be to  strengthen and modernise liability laws to encompass IoT  products and ecosystems; this is discussed in the section  on Responsible Industry Ecosystem.  5.3.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Independent laboratories such as UL130, Brightsight131,  and Riscure132, as well as government bodies such as  US-CERT of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,  provide cybersecurity assessment and certification  services and typically focus on vulnerability scanning and  architecture design reviews. While they have taken early  steps in IoT, they may not be ready for more comprehensive  functional testing of IoT devices or for domain-specific  testing; for instance, the security of a software application  can be tested but not the effects that cascade from  cybersecurity to functional safety. This is also because of  the lack of globally-accepted IoT security standards and  certification schemes to test and certify against.   Trusted IoT security labels An IoT security label should give a baseline security  requirement of protection, and the level of assurance for   130  https://www.ul.com/inside-ul/ul-2900-2-3-helps-mitigate-iot-cybersecurity-  risk/ - - - New Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable   Products UL 2900 / ANSI     https://industries.ul.com/blog/  new-standard-for-software-cybersecurity-for-network-connectable-products  131  https://www.brightsight.com/en/archieven/1111  132  https://www.riscure.com/market/iot-healthcare/44    45  133  AIOTI Workshop On Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World   Report 20160616  134  https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2018/04/02/  roadmap-digitaal-veilige-hard-en-software - Roadmap digitaal veilige hard en   software, 2018. By Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Netherlands, in Dutch.  135  https://www.sicw.sg/  136  https://iotsecurityfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IoT-  Security-Compliance-Framework.pdf  137  https://iotsecurityfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IoT-  Security-Compliance-Framework.pdf  this needs to be defined. The label should provide a clear  indication of the security achieved. AIOTI’s workshop on  Security and Privacy in the Hyper-Connected World133   introduced a set of possible labels: 1)  Security certified by third party 2)  Managed security (maintained) 3)  Secure update mechanism implemented (maintainable) 4)  Access-controlled device, based on “trusted   manufacturer” and self-assessment of security 5)  No security.  Separately, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate  and the Ministry of Justice and Security in the  Netherlands134 have requested the industry to design a  security labelling system and guidelines specifying: – Level of security, – Whether the device is automatically updated, – Lifespan of support by the manufacturer, – Device performance and functions when it is   disconnected from the internet.   In parallel, during the 2018 edition of the Singapore  International Cyber Week (SICW)135, the Cyber Security  Agency of Singapore hosted a leadership dialogue with  various National Certification Bodies to exchange   perspectives on a practical and balanced approach to address  the evaluation of IoT devices, in consideration of the fact  that this space is characterised by fast-moving innovations.   IoT Security Foundation The IoT Security Foundation’s (IoTSF) IoT Security  Compliance Framework136 aims to consistently evaluate the  security of a wide range of IoT devices. To make the  framework more practical across a variety of applications,  IoTSF adopts a risk-based approach derived from the  commonly used CIA Triad. The framework defines five  Compliance Classes that achieve progressively higher  levels of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability as  depicted in Figure 8.  – Class 0: where compromise to the data generated or loss   of control is likely to result in little discernible impact on  an individual or organisation.   – Class 1: where compromise to the data generated or loss  of control is likely to result in limited impact on an  individual or organisation.  – Class 2: in addition to class 1, the device is designed to  resist attacks on availability that would have significant  impact on an individual or organisation, or impact many  individuals. For example, by limiting operations of an  infrastructure to which it is connected.   Compliance class Security objectives Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Class 0 Basic Basic Basic Class 1 Basic Medium Medium Class 2 Medium Medium High Class 3 High Medium High Class 4 High High High  Figure 8: IoTSF Compliance Classes137    – Class 3: in addition to class 2, the device is designed to  protect sensitive data including sensitive personal data.   – Class 4: in addition to class 3, where compromise to the  data generated or loss of control have the potential to  affect critical infrastructure or cause personal injury.   For instance, a thermostat is considered to fall under Class  1 since  – it does not store sensitive or personally-identifiable   information. – it needs to report accurate data and external tampering   with data values could result in business impact. – individual device unavailability would have little impact,   but a DoS of multiple devices could result in significant  business impact.  Based on the Compliance Class determined for a particular  product, a checklist of requirements is provided. Such a checklist  could be made mandatory by procuring parties, as could a  third-party audit to verify compliance with the checklist.   Common Criteria Traditional IT products, such as firewalls and switches, are  routinely subjected to Common Criteria (CC) evaluations  using independent laboratories. Certificates are issued by  participating national governments and recognised by  signatories worldwide.  The CC allows product developers to document their  product’s Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in a  Security Target (ST). An independent laboratory can conduct  a CC evaluation to assess the product against the SFRs.  The robustness of the evaluation depends on the desired  Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). In theory, this approach  allows an IoT product developer to demonstrate that their  product meets specific security functional requirements.   The flexible nature of CC evaluations allows each developer  to choose the SFRs against which their product is  evaluated, but this flexibility can make it difficult to compare  similar products. For example, two firewall vendors could  choose different SFRs and yet market their products as  having achieved Common Criteria certification. To address  this, Protection Profiles (PPs) exist for some types of  common IT products. Each PP includes a set of SFRs along  with specific test and assurance requirements. Products  submitted for PP-based CC evaluations must exhibit exact  conformance with the PP.  Signatories to the CC Recognition Agreement (CCRA)  recognise CC certification138 and specifically the  collaborative Protection Profiles (cPPs)139. The cPP for  Network Devices v2.1140 seems to be the profile to build on  for IoT Security; however, it is noted that this cPP lacks IoT- specific criteria pertaining to, for example, device resource  constraints and the heterogeneity of devices and network  environments.  Separately, the German Federal Office for Information  Security (BSI)141 advocates for trustworthy products and  systems in the energy network and has developed a  protection profile for the gateway of a smart metering  system142 that follows the rules of Common Criteria in  describing the threats to a certain target that needs  protection and defining the minimum requirements for  appropriate safety precautions.  While well established, CC certification is often said to be a  slow and expensive process typically costing manufacturers  six figures and taking many months143. While it appears  well-suited for testing computer systems for sale to  governments, it may not be as appropriate for the fast- moving and low-cost world of IoT. Non-CC alternatives can   138  https://www.csa.gov.sg/programmes/csa-common-criteria  139  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/pps/?cpp=1  140  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/CPP_ND_V2.1.pdf  141  https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html  142  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0073b_pdf.pdf  143  Standardisation and Certification of Safety, Security and Privacy in the   ‘Internet of Things’, JRC Technical Report, Leverett et al.46    47  144  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-3194_en.htm  145  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/  eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework  provide a light-touch approach to certification and may  prove more suitable.  EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework The European Union has identified that certification plays a  critical role in increasing trust and security in products and  services that are crucial for the EU Digital Single Market .   At the moment, a number of different security certification  schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. For example,  smart meter producers currently need to undergo separate  certification processes in France, the UK and Germany.  Without a common framework for EU-wide valid  cybersecurity certificate schemes, the EU identifies an  increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single  market.   In this context, the EU has proposed an EU Certification  Framework for ICT security products. The proposed  certification framework will provide EU-wide certification  schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical  requirements, standards and procedures. This will be  based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the  security properties of a specific ICT-based product or  service e.g. smart cards. ENISA will work towards  implementing this certification process. The resulting  certificate will be recognised in all Member States, making  it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for  purchasers to understand the security features of the  product or service.  While the use of certification will be voluntary for the time  being, the framework does avoid multiple certification  processes in different Member States and creates an  incentive to certify the quality and verify the security of   the products and services in question.  5.3.2 Key Findings – There is a distinct lack of labels to inform end users   about IoT device security and risks. However, efforts to  create a labelling scheme are under way in various parts  of the world. It should be ensured that these schemes  are aligned in order to create a level playing field for  vendors.  – There are as yet no CC cPPs specifically for IoT devices.   It should be determined whether these can be generic or  specific to application domains.   – Non-CC alternatives can provide a light-touch approach to  certification and should be explored.  5.4 FUTURE-PROOF LEGISLATION Legislative policy solutions should be sufficiently flexible to  deal with societal needs as well as constantly evolving  technologies. Regulatory measures for IoT security should  make use of inputs from consumers as well as industry  representatives on the rights and responsibilities of  consumers and vendors. This would help to ensure that the  approach taken is effective in the present and fit for the  future, and promotes innovation in an efficient way. The  introduction of highly stringent measures and legislation by  regulators could, counterproductively, prove restrictive for  security research; it may be more effective to instead  create initiatives to stimulate the development of security  by the industry.  Besides cybersecurity regulations, liability laws can also  effectively drive IoT security; the section on Responsible  Industry discusses this point.  5.4.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments There are only a few legislative efforts aimed at IoT security;  we describe these below. It is noted that IoT security is  differently organised in different countries, so not every  cybersecurity agency is tasked with the same roles and  responsibilities. While many industry organisations globally  collaborate on a voluntary basis, we found a dearth of  initiatives where governments work together for secure IoT.     U.S. IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017 For years, cybersecurity experts have asked the US  government to improve cybersecurity hygiene and use its  buying power to push through new security standards.146  The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act (see https://  www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1691/ text?format=txt) is a bill mandating minimal cybersecurity  operational standards for Internet-connected devices  purchased by U.S. Federal agencies. This can be a way to  raise the bar across the industry more easily than larger,  more direct legal measures. Government-purchased IoT  devices would need to: – Be free of known security vulnerabilities, as defined in   the NIST National Vulnerability Database147. – Have software or firmware components that accept “properly   authenticated and trusted” patches from the vendor. – Use non-deprecated, industry-standard protocols for   communication, encryption, and interconnection with  other devices or peripherals.  – Not include any “fixed or hard-coded” credentials (that is,  passwords) used for remote administration, delivery of  updates, or communications.  – Have notification and disclosure methods in place for  discovered security vulnerabilities.  – Be patched or replaced to fix any vulnerability in a timely  and secure manner.  The legislation would also require American agencies to  establish and maintain inventories of IoT devices and  update them every 30 days.  U.S. SMART IoT Act The State of Modern Application, Research, and Trends of  IoT Act or SMART IoT Act directs the U.S. Department of  Commerce to conduct a study on the state of IoT in the  United States.  California Senate Bill 327 California's SB 327 law148, approved in September 2018  and due to take effect in January 2020, requires all  \"connected devices\" to have a \"reasonable security  feature.\" Security experts point out that the law is well- intentioned and while it may not actually solve the problems  that plague IoT security, it is nevertheless widely  considered a good start.149,150  Privacy regulations From 2018 onwards, IoT stakeholders, including those in  the supply chain, must be compliant with the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and with similar  privacy laws such as PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act)   in Singapore. The complex mesh of stakeholders involved  asks for/implies the necessity of a precise allocation of  legal responsibilities among them regarding the processing  of the individual’s personal data, based on the specificities  of their respective interventions.  EU Cybersecurity Act  In December 2018, the European Union passed the  Cybersecurity Act151 to reinforce the mandate of the EU  Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) to better support Member  States with tackling cybersecurity threats and attacks. As  referenced in the previous section, the Act also establishes  an EU framework for cybersecurity certification, boosting  the cybersecurity of online services and consumer devices.  Certification is voluntary unless future EU legislation  prescribes an EU certificate as a mandatory requirement to  satisfy a specific security need.  146  https://www.wired.com/2008/08/securitymatters-0807/  147  https://nvd.nist.gov/  148  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.  xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327  149  https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/new_iot_securit.html  150  https://www.zdnet.com/article/  first-iot-security-bill-reaches-governors-desk-in-california/  151  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/cybersecurity-act-2018-dec-11_en48    49  152  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-  opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity  153  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/  network-and-information-security-nis-directive  Common Position on Cybersecurity in Connected Devices The Common Position paper152 by Infineon, NXP,  STMicroelectronics and ENISA proposes some key priorities  for the European Commission (EC), but these priorities are  globally applicable: – Define baseline requirements for security and privacy   that minimise risk, are neutral in technological terms,  and remain open to innovation.   – Introduce a Trust Label, based on various security levels  and a related risk assessment.  – Ensure that reliable security processes and services are  developed and support industry in implementing security  features in products (e.g. through providing information  and training on state-of-the art security solutions).  – Encourage the development of mandatory staged  requirements for IoT security and privacy.   – Create an equal level playing field for cybersecurity and  look into incentives to reward the use of good security  practices.  NIS Directive The Directive on security of network and information  systems (NIS Directive) was adopted by the European  Parliament on 6 July 2016153 and entered into force in  August 2016 . The NIS Directive provides legal measures to  boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU by ensuring  – Member States' preparedness by requiring them to be   appropriately equipped, e.g. via a Computer Security  Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and a competent  national NIS authority.  – cooperation among all the Member States, by setting up  a cooperation group, in order to support and facilitate  strategic cooperation and the exchange of information  among Member States.  – a culture of security across sectors that are vital for the  economy and society, such as energy, transport, water,  banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and  digital infrastructure. Businesses in these sectors that  are identified by Member States as operators of essential  services are required to take appropriate security  measures and notify serious incidents to the relevant  national authority.   5.4.2 Key Findings – Although there are numerous industry initiatives and best   practices in this area, their adoption is voluntary. IoT  security legislation is in its infancy and virtually non- existent outside the US and EU.  – Enforcing procurement by governments of secure IoT  devices can contribute towards IoT security when large  countries participate; smaller economies such as  Singapore and the Netherlands can work together for  greater impact. The EU’s single digital market approach  can support IoT security as well.   5.5 RESPONSIBLE INDUSTRY ECOSYSTEM The market for IoT devices is global. Within this competitive  industry, time-to-market, usability and cost are key  considerations. The razor-thin margins for IoT devices leave  suppliers with less to spend on security. From the  perspectives of cybersecurity and national security,  security must also become part of the business equation;  the cost of implementing security functionality needs to be  offset in some manner. Currently, owing to the lack of  enforcement of security in IoT devices, there is no level  playing field for IoT device vendors nor a common  expectation of security functionality.  5.5.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments The competitive advantage in the IoT industry is currently  focused on time-to-market rather than secure-to-market.  This balance should be shifted so that a specific level of  security and privacy is required before market release.  Defining security frameworks supported by baseline  security measures can be a way forward in this direction.     The use of certification and labelling can encourage better  understanding and transparency in terms of IoT security  and can additionally benefit end users and consumers by  educating them and making them more aware of IoT  security. Alternatively and perhaps complementarily,  liability laws can be strengthened and modernised to hold  manufacturers accountable in the event of a breach.  Regardless of the regulatory approach adopted, it is  important for cybersecurity regulators as well as the  industry to work together and act as a global community  that learns from incidents and vulnerabilities proactively.  This requires an open culture of sharing incidents and  mutual learning.   Liability Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers,  distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make  products available to the public are held responsible for  damage caused by those products. The Dutch roadmap for  safe hardware and software154 has identified liability laws  as a key driver for IoT security.  Liability litigation historically focused on negligence on the  part of the vendor, or a breach of warranty. Under the notion  of strict liability, the manufacturer is liable if the product is  defective even if the manufacturer was not negligent in  making that product defective155. The manufacturer thus  becomes a de facto insurer against its defective products,  with premiums built into the product's price. Strict liability  also seeks to diminish the impact of information asymmetry  between manufacturers and consumers: manufacturers  have better knowledge of their own products' dangers than  do consumers; therefore, manufacturers should bear the  burden of finding, correcting, and warning consumers of  those dangers.   The 1985 European Product Liability Directive156 created a  regime of strict liability for defective products: according   to this Directive, a product is “defective” when it does not  provide the “safety which a person is entitled to expect”  (Article 6). While one may assume that this provides a  baseline of liability for IoT devices, the use of the term  “safety” is telling – security issues that are not outright  safety defects may not be addressed at all unless those  security issues can be proven to cascade into safety losses  or traditional damage such as harm to human health or  property. Even more fundamentally, Article 2 of the  Directive states that it applies to “movables” – while this  may have seemed perfectly reasonable in the 80s for  products such as toasters or lawn mowers, for modern  connected devices this terminology may entirely exclude  the connectivity and server-side components. A recent EU  research report157 identifies that vendors may take  advantage of this by simply placing critical functionality on  the server in order to escape liability.

Industry collaborations The inventory of initiatives in Annex B shows a substantial  number of industry collaborations. AIOTI158 is an example of  industry collaboration that promotes good practices across  the diverse IoT ecosystem. The IoT Consortium159 is an  industry body that aims to stimulate the growth of the IoT  market by leading the industry’s efforts through strategic  partnerships. Specifically, it generates opportunities for  companies to meet and collaborate, forms industry  committees to identify and address areas of common  concern, exercises thought leadership in driving forward the  most important conversations on IoT at industry events and  in the press, promotes business development  opportunities, and leads efforts to raise IoT awareness  among consumers, sales channels, and investors.  IoT-EPI160 is a European initiative for industry collaborations  in IoT platform development. At the core of IoT-EPI are seven  research and innovation projects: Inter-IoT, BIG IoT, AGILE,  symbIoTe, TagItSmart!, VICINITY and bIoTope. Each project  is run by several industry partners in collaboration and   aims to solve one of the issues currently faced by the IoT  ecosystem. For instance, Big IoT161 addresses the  interoperability gap by defining a generic, unified Web   API for smart object platforms, with the intention of  establishing a marketplace where platform, application,  and service providers can easily monetise their assets.   Big IoT is spearheaded by Siemens AG (Germany), Bosch  Software Innovations (Germany), and Atos (Austria).  Within these initiatives the role of governments is limited;  indeed, close collaboration between governments appears  uncommon. Within the European Union, ENISA162 is a key  player in this domain to establish collaborations.  5.5.2 Key Findings – Owing to the lack of legislation and regulation to enforce   security in IoT devices, there is no level playing field for  IoT device vendors nor a common expectation of security  functionality.   – Liability is likely to be an effective mechanism to drive the  industry towards IoT security, but legislation needs to be  modernised to address IoT.  – Encouragingly, numerous industry collaborations exist  and provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and  mutual learning; however, the role of governments in such  initiatives appears limited especially outside the EU.   5.6 SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY Modern products are assemblies of parts and components  supplied by multiple vendors. To accelerate time-to-market  and to reduce costs, device manufacturers increasingly use  as many as possible off-the-shelf components using  complex, globally distributed, and interconnected supply  chains composed of various entities with multiple tiers of  outsourcing.   However, vulnerabilities can be introduced and exploited   at any point in the supply chain.163 Cyber supply chain risks  include the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorised  production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious  software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and  development practices upstream.    5.6.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Managing cyber supply chain risks requires ensuring the  integrity, security, quality and resilience of the supply chain  and its products and services. Supply chain security is an  often-overlooked component in IoT security even though, by  some estimates, up to 80% of breaches may originate in  the supply chain164. In 2011, the Semiconductor Industry  Association estimated165 the cost of electronics  counterfeiting at US$7.5 billion per year in lost revenue.  Device compromise in transit and component-level  vulnerabilities are other supply chain risks that can lead to  significant consequences.   The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST)166 identifies Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management  (C-SCRM) as the process of identifying, assessing, and  mitigating the risks associated with the distributed and  interconnected nature of IT/OT products and service supply  chains.167 NIST’s workshop on Best Practices in C-SCRM168  discussed that the global complexity of supply chains, the  increase in potential disruptions, and emerging  cybersecurity risks to the supply chain have dramatically  increased the risks that: – Suppliers could intentionally or unintentionally introduce   software, firmware, or hardware in which confidentiality,  integrity or availability has been compromised.  – Supply chain disruptions could create a scramble for  parts that enables poor quality or counterfeit products to  enter the supply chain.  – High-value intellectual property shared with suppliers  could be misused.  – Service suppliers – including contract manufacturers,   outsourced legal and accounting, and repair and  maintenance providers – could tamper with a company’s  information based on their access to a company’s  information system, if the data is not adequately  protected.  – Adversaries can use vulnerabilities of different  components within the supply chain to attack a  company’s information systems.  IoT supply chain risks, and more generally IT supply chain  risks, are associated with an organisation’s decreased  visibility into, and understanding of, how the technology  they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed.169   Maintaining sufficient controls to minimise risk and  maximise transparency requires close relationships with  vendors, clear understanding of the risks involved and strict  adherence to procedure.   According to NIST, a primary objective of C-SCRM is to  identify, assess, and mitigate “products and services that  may contain potentially malicious functionality, are  counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing  and development practices within the cyber supply chain.”  C-SCRM activities include:  – Determining cybersecurity requirements for suppliers, – Enacting cybersecurity requirements through formal   agreement (e.g., contracts), – Communicating to suppliers how those cybersecurity   requirements will be verified and validated, – Verifying that cybersecurity requirements are met through   a variety of assessment methodologies, – Governing and managing the above activities.  164  Combatting Cyber Risks in the Supply Chain - https://www.sans.org/reading-  room/whitepapers/analyst/combatting-cyber-risks-supply-chain-36252  165  https://www.semiconductors.org/news/2011/11/08/news_2011/sia_  president_testifies_at_ senate_armed_services_committee_on_dangers_  of_counterfeit_chips/  166  https://www.nist.gov/  167  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management  168  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-  Management/documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-SCRM-  Business-Case.pdf  169  NIST Special Publication 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management   Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organisations52    53  The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)170  provides 12 principles for supply chain security, including  the establishment of minimum security needs for suppliers  and building security considerations into contracting  processes (and ensuring that the suppliers do the same).  While the principles proposed by NCSC may appear  intuitive, they are followed by a surprisingly low percentage  of organisations. The U.K. Cyber Security Breaches Survey   2016171 survey showed that, while most businesses have  rules or controls for their own operations (and most medium  or large organisations have formally documented their  approaches), they are much less likely to set minimum  standards for their suppliers: only 13% were seen to do  this.  170  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security    171  Cyber Security Breaches Survey, Klahr et al, Ipsos MORI, DCMS UK  Supplier  Supplier  Supplier  Supplier  External service provider  Supplier  Supplier  External service provider  Supplier  Supplier  Supplier  External service provider  External service provider  System integrator  External service provider  Organisation  Figure 10: Organisational Supply Chain (Source: NIST)    Supply chain security is predicated on careful supplier  management. Examples of best practices in supplier  management from a security perspective include the  following172. – Procurement and sourcing processes are developed   jointly with input from IT, security, engineering, and  operations personnel; sourcing decisions receive multi- stakeholder input.  – Standard security terms and conditions are included in all  requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts, tailored to  the type of contract and business needs.   – Since many risk assessments depend on supplier self- evaluation, a number of companies employ on-site  verification and validation of these reviews. Some  companies cross-train personnel to be stationed at  supplier companies so that security criteria can be  monitored year-round.   – New suppliers enter a test and assessment period – to  test the capabilities of the supplier and its compliance   with various requirements – before they actively join the  supply chain. In high risk areas, for example, a supplier  might go through a series of pilots before they fully enter  the supply chain.  – Quarterly reviews of supplier performance are assessed  among a stakeholder group.  – Annual supplier meetings ensure that suppliers  understand the customers’ business needs, concerns  and security priorities.  – Mentoring and training programs are offered to suppliers,  especially in difficult or key areas of concern to the  company, such as cybersecurity.  It may be noted that organisations wield both contractual  and economic power over suppliers: contracts can stipulate  security requirements and penalties in detail, and economic  clout can be multiplied via industry and inter-governmental  alliances. According to NIST, organisations can pose the  following specific questions173 to suppliers to determine the   1. UNDERSTAND THE RISKS – Understand what needs to be protected and why – Know who your suppliers are and build an   understanding of what their security looks like – Understand the security risk posed by your supply   chain  2. ESTABLISH CONTROL – Communicate your view of security needs to your   suppliers – Set and communicate minimum security requirements   for your suppliers – Build security considerations into your contracting   process and require that your suppliers do the same  – Meet your own security responibilities as a supplier  and consumer  – Raise awareness of security within your supply chain – Provide support for security incidents  3. CHECK YOUR ARRANGEMENTS – Build assurance activities into your approach to   managing your supply chain  4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT – Encourage the continuous improvement of security   within your supply chain – Build trust with suppliers  Figure 11: Principles of Supply Chain Security (Source: NCSC/CPNI)  172  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cyber-supply-chain-risk-management/  Best-Practices  173  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management/  documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-Supply-Chain-Best-Practices.pdf54    55  risk levels associated with their suppliers’ cybersecurity  practices. – Is the supplier’s software/hardware design process   documented? Repeatable? Measurable? – How is configuration management performed? Quality   assurance? How is code tested for quality or  vulnerabilities?  – What steps are taken to “tamper proof” products? Are  backdoors closed?   – Is the mitigation of known vulnerabilities factored into  product design (through product architecture, run-time  protection techniques, code review)?  – How does the supplier stay current on emerging  vulnerabilities? What are the capabilities to address new  “zero day” vulnerabilities?  – What controls are in place to manage and monitor  production processes?   – What levels of malware protection and detection are  performed?  – What physical security measures are in place?  Documented? Audited?  – What access controls, both cyber and physical, are in  place? How are they documented and audited? – How do they protect and store customer data? How is   the data encrypted? – How long is the data retained? – How is the data destroyed when the partnership is   dissolved? – What type of employee background checks are conducted   and how frequently? – What security practice expectations are set for upstream   suppliers? How is adherence to these standards  assessed?  – How secure is the distribution process? Have approved  and authorised distribution channels been clearly  documented?  – What is the component disposal risk and mitigation  strategy?  – How does the supplier ensure security throughout the  product life-cycle?  NIST’s workshop on Best Practices in C-SCRM further  identified174 that vetting supply chain partners beyond the  first tier is a challenge for many companies: manual  methods can be difficult and do not scale for companies  with hundreds or thousands of tier-one suppliers and  numerous sub-tier suppliers. Additionally, smaller  companies lack the economic power and relationships to  get the information they need. To fill these gaps,  consultants such as BitSight175 offer to collect, manage  and centralise supplier risk management data. This can  result in increased efficiencies for organisations as well as  reduce the burden on suppliers who may be asked to fill out  similar informational forms for each customer.  According to ENISA’s Baseline Recommendations176, “For  IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it  is necessary to adopt cyber supply chain risk management  policies and to communicate cyber security requirements to  suppliers and partners.” Standards such as ISO28000177  specify supply chain security requirements in sufficient  detail to allow self-declaration of conformance by an  organisation or, alternatively, third-party certification by an  accredited body to demonstrate contribution to supply  chain security.   Emphasising the importance of supply chain risks, NIST’s  Risk Management Framework (RMF)178, which is published  as NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, integrates supply chain risk  management concepts into the RMF to protect against  untrustworthy suppliers, insertion of counterfeits,  tampering, unauthorised production, theft, insertion of   174  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-  Management/documents/briefings/Workshop-Brief-on-Cyber-SCRM-Vendor-  Selection-and-Management.pdf  175  https://www.bitsight.com/  176  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, ENISA, Nov 2017  177  https://www.iso.org/standard/44641.html  178  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Risk-Management/  Risk-Management-Framework-(RMF)-Overview    malicious code, and poor manufacturing and development  practices throughout the SDLC.  5.6.2 Key Findings – IoT hardware and software manufacturers and suppliers   should adopt a cyber supply chain risk management  framework (ISO28000, NIST).  – Cybersecurity requirements, risk and liability should be  cascaded into the supply chain via contractual  agreements. Organisations wield both contractual and  economic power over suppliers.  – It is important to encourage the use of open frameworks  and provide transparency for supply chain security  information flows.  5.7 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE SUPPORT Building a device today that will stand up to the ever- evolving security requirements of the next several years  without any updates or modifications may well be  impossible; in the absence of patching and device  management, devices quickly become outdated from a  security perspective. However, updates typically require  changes in device firmware – this makes it difficult for  regular users to manage these devices. Remote update  capability needs to be designed into the device to allow  security updates, yet, the specialised operating systems  used for embedded devices may not support this by default.  Further, the life cycle for IoT devices varies widely in  duration: industrial devices may be in the field for decades,  consumer products such as smart home appliances or  autonomous vehicles could run for about 10 years, and  wearables may be in use for only a year or two. Clearly,  managing IoT device lifecycles is a tremendous challenge.  5.7.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments As ABI Research identifies179, lifecycle device management  offers manufacturers the ability to continue providing value  long after a device has been sold and even re-sold;  however, that management service only has value if it can  be tied securely back to the device. Secure hardware (such  as secure elements and secure MCUs) is at the forefront of  providing this trust. Without this process, any future service  provisioning for the device post-market is vulnerable. The  increased recognition that this opportunity cannot be  realised without trust is a potential driver for industry  adoption of secure hardware.  Soos et al180 present a model for IoT device lifecycle  management that maps the phases of the IoT device  lifecycle to three broad life stages: Beginning of Life (BoL),  Middle of Life (MoL) and End of Life (EoL). Figure 12   depicts the security features and functions that should be  in place during each step of a device’s lifecycle.181 During  initialisation or boot-up, a firmware integrity check and  secure boot process should be used to ensure that  firmware and bootloader software have not been modified  or tampered with. Once initialisation is complete, the  communication between device and device, device and the  Internet, or device and user interface (through mobile apps  or web apps) should be encrypted. Authentication should  use a second factor wherever possible, and default  passwords must be changed. During normal operation,  monitoring, analytics and audit procedures should be in  place. The device should detect abnormal events and  operations and provide a warning to the backend and/or  end user. Secure firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates  should themselves be integrity-checked and verified before  installation.  179  IoT Security: From Design to Life Cycle Management, ABI Research  180  IoT Device Lifecycle – a Generic Model and a use case for Cellular Mobile   Networks, Soos et al, Conference Paper Aug 2018  181  Device Life Cycle Overview, Steven Hsu, Trend Micro Whitepaper, https://  www.trendmicro.com/us/iot-security/content/main/document/IoT%20  Security%20Whitepaper.pdf56    57  According to AIOTI182, device management is defined as  software or firmware updates as well as configuration or  fault and performance management. Device management  can be performed using existing protocols e.g. BBF  TR-069183 or OMA LWM2M184.  Vulnerability Disclosure History shows that vulnerabilities are invariably found after  a product is deployed – and often exploited in “zero-day”  attacks. It is vital to be able to detect unforeseen  vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live IoT  deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and  remediate. A strategy to deal with discovered threats and  vulnerabilities includes a Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure (CVD) program that balances security with the  interests of manufacturers and stakeholders, as well as a  clear understanding of liability. CVD is standardised by the  ISO185 under ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111.

Platform-Based Device Lifecycle Management The growth of IoT has led to the emergence of cloud-based  IoT platforms from many cloud service providers (CSPs)  such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.  Most of these offer comprehensive device management  functions across the device lifecycle, e.g. device registration/  enrolment, identity management, provisioning, permissions,  monitoring and troubleshooting, status queries, and over- the-air (OTA) firmware updates. Platforms allow IoT users  scale device fleets and may help to reduce the cost and  effort of managing large and diverse IoT device deployments.  Microsoft Azure, in particular, has comprehensive device  management functionality built into its IoT Hub.186 This  includes the use of a “device twin” for each connected  physical device that stores device metadata and essentially  acts a proxy for the actual device.

Updates  should be delivered and deployed using a secure and  verifiable methodology.   – Device manufacturers should adopt a secure software  development lifecycle, with a documented vulnerability  management process in accordance with ISO/IEC 29147  and ISO/IEC 30111.  – The manufacturer should bear responsibility for an IoT  device throughout its product lifecycle, including a  responsibility to manage suppliers.  – Existing device lifecycle management protocols include  OMA LWM2M. Cloud-based IoT platforms offer  comprehensive, albeit unstandardised, device  management functionality.   5.8 DEVICE IDENTITY AND ROOT OF TRUST The raison d'être for the Internet of Things are the Things  themselves, i.e. the devices that interact directly with the  physical world, measuring and sometimes controlling their  environments. Securing these devices presents a challenge  that is somewhat distinct from securing a laptop or a mobile  phone. In this section we specifically discuss the security of  the device and its firmware; the supply chain for the device  and the management of its lifecycle are equally important  and discussed in dedicated sections above. The device may  run a minimal operating system (OS) and application and is  expected to provide them with the necessary computational  and storage resources as well as a secure execution  environment. It is also noted that device security is closely  linked to the security of its communication, since the device  includes a connectivity module and authenticates itself as  an initial step during any communicative exchange.  Therefore, there are close links between the material  discussed in this section and that presented in the sections  on OS, communication, lifecycle and supply chain.  We refer to the depiction of a generic IoT device presented  in Chapter 2. IoT devices are extremely varied in nature   and may consist of some or all of the components depicted  the figure. All IoT devices include sensors: these might be  temperature sensors, motion sensors, air quality sensors,  or light sensors, to name a few. These sensors  automatically collect information from the environment.  Some devices may contain actuators for moving or  controlling a system or mechanism. Devices also contain  power supplies, often batteries; managing and replacing  these batteries is a major operational consideration for   IoT. There is a module that provides connectivity, although  the nature of this connectivity varies widely. There is also   a certain amount of processing power provided by a  microcontroller unit (MCU), storage such as NVRAM, and  often a minimal operating system and an application  running on it.   It may be argued that the smaller the device, the harder it is  to protect. With IoT devices we do not have the luxury of  measuring memory in gigabytes, nor of measuring  processing power by the number of cores. Most IoT devices     have a microcontroller rather than a full-fledged  microprocessor, and speeds in MHz rather than GHz.  Additionally, the low cost of these devices means razor-thin  margins for the supplier and less to spend on security.  Nevertheless, security should be part of an IoT device from  an early design stage and is something that should never  be passed over in the interest of decreasing manufacturing  costs or time to market.   Once designed, IoT devices are mass-produced. There   may be thousands to millions of similar IoT devices. With  consideration for the requirements and capabilities of  these devices, the design should be fundamentally secure.  Cryptographic identifiers are a common approach, but  these are vulnerable because many devices manage secret  keys with software, which if breached can expose the key.  This leads to the challenge (as identified by ENISA187 and  MITRE188) of establishing a chain of trust based on a root of  trust embedded in the device.   5.8.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Recent developments focus on the device elements that  are important from a security viewpoint: root of trust (which  can physically reside in the processor or storage, or on a  separate chip), firmware, and storage.   Root of Trust A root of trust (RoT) is a hardware or software component  that is inherently trusted189 due to its immutability. A RoT  must be secure by design, should be small and protected  and ideally implemented in hardware or protected by  hardware. RoTs are trusted to perform or support one or  more security-critical functions, e.g. verify software, protect  cryptographic keys, and perform device authentication190.   In fact, a RoT anchors several of the security functionalities  that we discuss below and in subsequent sections. The  main uses of the RoT include the following.  – Identity: The RoT can securely hold a device identifier that  can be queried by communicating entities.  – Authentication: Secure communication is available after  successfully completing an authentication and key  exchange protocol, typically using an ephemeral  symmetric session key for encryption and an HMAC key  for authentication. These keys can be generated and  stored in the RoT, keeping them protected from on-chip  attacks.  – Data Encryption: Encryption can protect data stored  locally on the device as well as data transmitted over  networks. The RoT can store encryption keys. Only  indirect access to these keys is allowed and managed by  permissions and policies on the application layer.   – Secure Boot: Validation of the code and/or data on the  device following power-up, based on trusted material  stored within the RoT. This prevents the execution of  unauthorised code and the exposure of embedded boot  code and software IP.   187  ENISA ‘Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT’, November 2017  188  https://www.mitre.org/research/mitre-challenge/mitre-challenge-iot  189  https://blog.nxp.com/security/getting-to-the-root-of-trust  190  https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/technical-bulletin/  understanding-hardware-roots-of-trust-2017q4.html  Identity  Secure Boot  Authentication  Data Encryption  ROOT OF TRUST  Figure 15: Root of Trust Functionalities  60    61  GlobalPlatform defines191 a Secure Element (SE) as a  tamper-resistant platform (typically a one-chip secure  microcontroller) capable of securely hosting applications  and their confidential and cryptographic data (e.g. keys). On  the other hand, GlobalPlatform defines a Trusted Execution  Environment (TEE)192 as a secure area within a main  processor that runs in an isolated environment and  guarantees that the code and data loaded within are  protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.  Trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the   full power of a device's main processor and memory, but  hardware isolation protects these components from  applications running in the main operating system.  Software and cryptographic isolations inside the TEE  protect trusted applications from each other. Two common  hardware technologies that support TEE are ARM TrustZone  and Intel SGX. Synopsys’ DesignWare tRoot Hardware  Security Modules (HSMs) also provide a TEE (see   www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=security-troot-  hw-secure-module).  In a similar vein, a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)193   is a cryptographic coprocessor that is present in many  commercial PCs and servers. The TPM specification is a  recommendation from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)  to securely identify individual connected devices and to  securely generate and store keys within these devices.  However, the inclusion of a TPM in IoT devices does lead   to increased costs and resource requirements.  Cisco’s implementation of a hardware RoT is the Trust  Anchor. Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI194)  credentials including the a SUDI certificate, the associated   key pair, and its entire certificate chain are stored in the  tamper resistant Trust Anchor chip. The identity is  implemented at manufacturing and chained to a publicly  identifiable root Certificate Authority (CA). The hardware  chip is used as an anchor for a secure boot process.   The Trust Anchor is compliant with NIST specifications and  provides a NIST SP 800-90A195 and B certifiable Random  Number Generator (RNG) that extracts entropy from a true  random source within the chip.   Similar to the Trust Anchor, Google’s Titan security chip196  offers secure boot as well as an end-to-end cryptographic  identity system for the servers in Google’s data centres as  well as the Pixel mobile phone. The Titan chip's  manufacturing process generates unique keying material  for each chip, and securely stores this material into a  registry database. The contents of this database are  cryptographically protected using keys maintained in an  offline quorum-based Titan Certification Authority (Titan  CA). Individual Titan chips can generate Certificate Signing  Requests (CSRs) directed at the Titan CA, which – under the  direction of a quorum of Titan identity administrators – can  verify the authenticity of the CSRs using the information in  the registry database before issuing identity certificates.197  While the chip may not yet offer a practical solution for  Class 0-2 IoT devices owing to cost considerations, it does  provide a good indicator of the direction of RoT security.   Having said that, a general drawback of CA-based  approaches is that the CA must be secure and trustworthy;  the DigiNotar incident198 has illustrated that CAs may  themselves be vulnerable.  191  https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-  Secure-Element-15May2018.pdf  192  https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-  Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf  193  https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/trusted-platform-module/  194  https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/  docs/trust-anchor-technologies-ds-45-734230.pdf  195  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A  196  https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/  titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext  197  https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/  titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext  198  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar    SIM and eSIM A Subscriber Identity Module, widely known as a SIM card,  securely stores a user’s mobile phone number and  associated symmetric key. The traditional SIM card is a  removable piece of plastic – a smart microprocessor chip  built on universal integrated circuit card (UICC) technology,  which is inserted into a mobile device for use on GSM and  successor networks. The key is programmed during  manufacture and used by mobile network operators to  authenticate and identify devices accessing their networks  and services. The SIM has played a pivotal role in the rise of  mobile communications over the last few decades – today,  4.8 billion people use mobile services worldwide and there are  400 million cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) connections.   SIM cards can also support additional security capabilities  that can be harnessed for IoT199; indeed, a SIM card can act  as a secure RoT to provision and store digital certificates  and other kinds of security credentials, such as passwords.  These credentials can be used to identify and authenticate  an IoT device to interact with a server-side application or IoT  platform.200   With the advent of IoT, remote provisioning has also  become an important requirement for SIM cards.201 Remote  provisioning is the ability to remotely change the SIM profile  on a deployed SIM card without having to physically change  the SIM card itself. As GSMA identifies202, replacing  physical SIM cards is problematic for many IoT/M2M use  cases, given that many IoT devices are remotely located,  often hermetically sealed, and have lengthy lifespans.  GSMA highlights that many of the interfaces and processes  needed to make the remote provisioning of SIMs work are  virtually identical to current SIM personalisation processes  and interfaces used by mobile operators today.  Remote provisioning capability can be deployed on both  removable and non-removable UICCs: the term embedded  UICC (eUICC) is used to refer to a SIM card that can be  remotely provisioned. An embedded SIM (eSIM) is one that  supports remote provisioning and is physically integrated  into the device during manufacture.  199  Case Study: Leveraging the SIM to Secure IoT Services, GSMA   200  Solutions to Enhance IoT Authentication Using SIM Cards (UICC),    GSMA IoT, 2016  201  The future of the SIM: potential market and technology implications for   the mobile ecosystem, GSMA Intelligence, Feb 2017  202  https://www.gsma.com/iot/embedded-sim/  Reprogrammable  Embedded  Removable  Non-programmable  Traditional SIM  Future  mainstream  Figure 16: SIM card Form Factor and Programmability (Source: GSMA Intelligence)  62    Challenge C  R1 ≠ R2 ≠ R3 ≠ R4  PUF1 PUF2 PUF3 PUF4  R1 R2 R3 R4  Figure 17: Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)  63  Remote provisioning technology has been deployed widely  in the IoT/M2M market: IHS Markit reported 108.9m eSIM  shipments in 2016.203 Also in 2016, the GSMA published  the eSIM technical specification204 for connecting  consumer companion devices (such as tablets, smart  watches and fitness devices) as well as handsets; future  growth is expected to be driven by consumer as well as IoT  devices.  Physical Unclonable Functions A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is an interesting  approach to device identification that does not require key  storage. A PUF provides a silicon biometric that is unique  for every chip, reacting to an input in an unpredictable (but  repeatable) way due to the complex interaction of the  stimulus with the physical microstructure of the chip, and  deriving its uniqueness from uncontrolled variations in the   chip manufacturing process. PUFs are increasingly used as  building blocks in many secure systems for applications  such as device authentication and secret key generation,  providing an attractive alternative to storing secret random  bits in volatile or non-volatile memory by instead generating  these bits every time the PUFs are evaluated. Several  vendors offer commercial PUF implementations including  Intrinsic ID205 and Verayo206, both of which deliver  identification and authentication solutions based on their  respective PUF technologies. Intrinsic ID’s Spartan  authentication module207 is specifically intended for IoT  devices, using PUFs to provision products with secure keys  and platform-compliant certificates in a scalable and cost- efficient way while also offering integration with the AWS IoT  cloud platform.  203  https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/1118/abstract-digital-security.pdf  204  https://www.gsma.com/esim/esim-specification/  205  https://www.intrinsic-id.com/sram-puf-technology-solutions/  206  http://verayo.com/tech.php  207  https://www.intrinsic-id.com/products/spartan/    Attestation and Privacy Consider a device communicating with a server that wants  assurance of the device’s identity, i.e. the server wants the  device to authenticate itself. However, the device (more  specifically, its user) may want privacy and therefore may  require that the server only learns that the device is  trusted. In principle, the problem could be solved by  embedding a single secret key in every device and in the  server, or using public-key cryptography with a single private  key across all devices and a public key in the server.  However, if any one device were compromised and the  secret key extracted and published, the server would no  longer be able to distinguish between real devices and  fake ones.   To address this, TCG initially proposed an intermediate  certification authority called the Privacy CA, which has the  obvious drawback that the Privacy CA208 needs to be  involved in every transaction and thus must be highly  available and yet as secure as an ordinary CA that normally  operates online. The newer Direct Anonymous Attestation  (DAA) scheme is a digital signature algorithm supporting  anonymity, allowing devices to uniquely authenticate  themselves without the need for a Privacy CA . Unlike  traditional digital signing, in which an entity has a public  verification key corresponding to a single private signing  key, DAA provides a common group public verification key  associated with many unique private signing keys. DAA  was created so that a device could prove its membership  of a trusted group to an external party without needing to  provide device identity. The DAA scheme was adopted by  TCG as part of TPM 1.2.209   Intel’s Enhanced Privacy ID210 (EPID) is an enhancement of  DAA that allows revocation of a private key given a signature  created by that key, even if the key itself is still unknown.  Also, each private key is actually a large set of key values,  and a device can use a different key value in every  transaction. This prevents anyone – including the  manufacturer, the verifier, and the certificate authority –  from tracing the key back to the root key or from identifying  multiple transactions as emanating from the same device.  EPID is the basis of Secure Device Onboard211 (SDO), a  service developed by Intel that securely brings IoT devices  online in an automated manner. SDO attests the device and  connects it to the owner's IoT platform, and is supported by  several IoT platform providers including AWS and Google.  Firmware and Secure Boot  When power is first switched on, a device is relatively  dumb and can read only part of its storage called read-only  memory (ROM) or firmware. For complex devices, the  firmware (called Basic Input-Output System, or BIOS)  typically initiates a multi-step procedure, calling code at the  Master Boot Record (MBR) which in turn calls a bootloader  to run a larger program such as an operating system. An  alternative to BIOS is offered by the Unified Extensible  Firmware Interface (UEFI); modern versions of Linux and  Windows support UEFI with BIOS backward compatibility.212   Simpler embedded devices often have (minimal) software  systems entirely in ROM firmware or flash memory; little or  no loading is necessary. Some designs may use an  intermediate technique where minimal bootloader-like code  is loaded into device RAM by the integrated boot ROM.213   208  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Anonymous_Attestation  209  https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-main-specification/  210  https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-  papers/intel-epid-iot-security-white-paper.pdf  211  https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/internet-of-things/secure-device-  onboard.html  212  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface    213  https://www.embedded.com/design/mcus-processors-and-socs/4008796/2/  Fundamentals-of-Booting-for-Embedded-Processors64    65  Regardless of the exact design used, implementing a  secure boot process is critical to device integrity214 since  a compromised boot process allows hackers to inject  malware or entirely replace firmware (“boot kit”), leaving the  entirety of a connected system vulnerable. A secure boot  process also makes other security features available to the  operating system and applications by providing a necessary  degree of trust. At its simplest, a secure boot process  prevents the execution of unauthorised code at the time of  device power-up and prevents the exposure of embedded  boot code and software IP. A secure boot can be achieved  in different ways, including using digitally signed binaries,   secure and trusted boot loaders, boot file encryption,  and security microprocessors.  The UEFI Forum is an industry body that advocates a  standardised interface for secure booting. UEFI’s Root of  Trust white paper215 addresses the use of hardware roots  of trust such as AMD’s Platform Security Processor and  ARM’s TrustZone. UEFI216 Secure Boot, specified by the  UEFI 2.3.1 Errata C specification217 (or higher), describes  a boot process that prevents the loading of drivers or OS  loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital  signature.  214  http://www.embedded-computing.com/embedded-computing-design/  iot-security-starts-with-secure-boot  215  http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20RoT%20white%20  paper_Final%208%208%2016%20%28003%29.pdf  216  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface  217  http://www.uefi.org/specifications  BIOS/UEFI BOOTLOADER OS KERNEL  – The device is turned on and  the BIOS/UEFI firmware  initialises the hardware.   – The firmware calls the code  at the MBR to run the  bootloader. For UEFI, the  bootloader is loaded from a  disk partition.  – The bootloader finds and  loads an OS kernel into  memory.  Figure 18: Typical Boot-Up Process for Complex (Class 2) Devices  UEFI SECURE BOOT BOOTLOADER OS KERNEL  – The device is turned on and  UEFI firmware initialises  the hardware.   – UEFI firmware verifies the  bootloader using a  signature database.  – The bootloader loads OS  kernel and drivers into  memory. These may also  be verified EFI binaries.  Figure 19: Secure Boot Process    When Secure Boot is active, the UEFI firmware is  responsible for verifying components such as drivers and  bootloader. At commissioning, the device is initially placed  in Setup Mode, which allows a public part of a Platform Key  (PK) to be written to the firmware. The private part of the PK  is used to sign a Key Exchange Key (KEK) which protects a  signature database. Following this, Secure Boot enters  User Mode, where only drivers and loaders whose  signatures match the database can be loaded by the  firmware. If an invalid binary is loaded while Secure Boot is  enabled, the user is alerted, and the system will refuse to  boot with the tampered binary. Additional signatures can be  added to the database, but they must be signed by the  private part of the KEK.  While Secure Boot mitigates the problem of untrusted  firmware, care must be taken in system design to protect  secure boot databases. In addition, vendors must develop  security processes to protect various signing keys and to  sign only approved payloads218.  Seven Properties of Highly Secured Devices Microsoft Research has identified seven properties219 that  highly secured devices need to have: hardware based root- of-trust, small trusted computing base, defence in depth,  compartmentalisation, certificate-based authentication,  security renewal, and failure reporting. Microsoft’s Azure  Sphere platform is designed around these properties,  offering a secured, connected, crossover microcontroller  unit (MCU), a custom high-level Linux-based operating  system (OS), and a cloud-based security service.   The Azure Sphere MCU, along with its operating system and  application platform, enables the creation of secured,   internet-connected devices that can be updated, controlled,  monitored, and maintained remotely.220 Specifically, the  MCU’s Pluton Security Subsystem generates its own key  pairs, implements a true random number generator (RNG),  and accelerates cryptographic operations,221 enabling  measured boot as well as remote attestation.  Local Device Storage Stored data should always be protected with encryption222.  Of course, a technique commonly used in IoT is to not store  data locally but send it to a server where it can be easily  encrypted. Having said that, some devices incorporate local  self-encrypting drives (SEDs) that provide confidentiality  while being easy to use and manage and having minimal  impact on system performance. At the most basic level,  SEDs provide hardware-based data security by continuously  scrambling data using a key as it is written to the drive, and  then descrambling the data as it is retrieved. The contents  of an SED are always encrypted, and the encryption keys  are themselves encrypted and protected in hardware that  cannot be accessed by other parts of the system.   The SED standards223 from TCG enable encryption to be  built into drives, improving security while avoiding the  overhead of software encryption and ensuring that  equipment can be cleansed for reuse simply by telling the  drive to change its key. As with TPM, the SED standard is  available in a wide variety of interoperable products,  including hard drives, solid state drives, hybrid drives and  enterprise storage systems, from a variety of vendors.  SEDs are already in use in a number of devices, including  printers, copiers and multi-function devices as well as point  of sale systems.  218  http://www.rtcgroup.com/whitepapers/files/Insyde_Embedded_Secure_Boot.  pdf  219  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/  SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf  220  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/product-overview/  what-is-azure-sphere  221  https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/anatomy-of-a-secured-mcu/  222  https://www.gemalto.com/enterprise-security/enterprise-data-encryption  223  https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/  storage-work-group-storage-security-subsystem-class-opal/66    67  Key Provisioning The provisioning of cryptographic keys into devices is a  critical initial step in establishing a security baseline. This  provisioning is done in one of three ways224: – Pre-provisioning: Secure Elements (SEs) destined for IoT   devices are typically purchased from a silicon vendor with  all required keys pre-provisioned on the chip by this  vendor. This means that the IoT device maker does not  need to deal with provisioning keys for his device, but the  SE approach comes with downsides such as increased  costs and complexity in purchasing, supply chain and  inter-chip interfacing.  – Key Injection: Cryptographic keys can be injected into a  device at different points in the supply chain. After  injection, the keys are stored on the device. Most widely  used embedded key storage methods are based on Non- Volatile Memory (NVM) such as Electrically Erasable  Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), Flash, or  One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory such as fuses  and anti-fuses. With these memory types, the  provisioning of root keys comes with trade-offs among  flexibility, key-exposure liability, cost, reliability and  security.  – On-board Key Generation: An internal Random Number  Generator (RNG) on the chip can derive a random secret  and use it to generate cryptographic keys. This method  increases the flexibility within the supply chain compared  to key injection (assuming the target chip contains a  random number generator), but it does not make any  difference regarding how the root key is stored.  5.8.2 Key Findings – A hardware RoT is the only immutable trust anchor; the   chain of trust should build on a hardware RoT. Currently,  only 4% of IoT devices use a hardware RoT.225   – RoT-based cybersecurity can be provided by several  solutions including Secure Elements, TPMs, TEEs, Cisco  Trust Anchor, Microsoft’s Pluton Security Subsystem, and  SIM cards.   – Solutions to secure firmware and booting are being  proposed as a joint effort of the hardware and software  industry, however, their adoption for IoT devices is still in  the initial stage.  224  Protecting the IoT With Invisible Keys, Intrinsic ID Whitepaper, 2018  225  IoT Security from Design to Lifecycle Management, An Embedded Perspective; ABI Research, 2018.

In general, software applications running on an operating  system collect and process this data. Given the resource  constraints of IoT devices, computationally-intensive data  processing is usually performed in a back-end system,  which is usually part of a cloud environment. The operating  system and applications on the device as well as the back- end operating system and applications need to be  provisioned with appropriate security controls.  5.9.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments Russell226 provides a practical guide to support developers  and architects in building secure IoT systems. Open source  software – particularly copyleft licenses – may not always  be the first choice of industry but offer higher code quality  and more secure code due to the increased numbers of  contributors and reviewers227.  Operating Systems IoT device operating systems are typically referred to as  \"embedded\" or \"real-time” operating systems, reflecting  their minimal nature and time-critical response  requirements. Traditional operating systems such as  Windows and iOS were not designed for IoT applications:  they consume too much power, need capable processors,  and in some cases, lack features such as guaranteed real- time response. Consequently, a wide range of IoT-specific  operating systems has been developed to suit many  different hardware footprints and feature needs.   IoT-focused operating systems include VxWorks, ARM   Mbed OS, Zephyr, Nucleus RTOS, Contiki and TinyOS.  Hahm et al228 present a well-founded analysis of different  IoT operating systems. Although it touches upon security as  an important feature, a benchmark of the cybersecurity  mechanisms available in the different operating systems is  lacking; typically, this is the case for most of the  literature229 on IoT operating systems. This observation  leads to the recommendation to deliver this benchmark with  a cybersecurity focus as input for security standards for IoT  operating systems.   To secure the operating system, at least the below security  controls should be in place230:  – Malicious application protection – Applications can   contain many hidden threats for IoT devices. Even some  legitimate software can be exploited for fraudulent  purposes.  – Malware protection – Malware can be installed on an IoT  device with malicious intentions. Malware can send  unsolicited messages, or give an attacker control over  the device, all without informing the owner.  – Spyware protection – Spyware is installed to collect or  use private data without informing or approval. Data  commonly targeted by spyware includes location, history,  contacts and private data. This stolen information could  be used for identity theft or financial fraud.  – Privacy protection – Privacy threats could be caused by  applications that are not necessarily malicious, but  gather or use sensitive information (e.g., location,  contact lists, personally identifiable information).  – By default, the OS should disable as many services   and features as possible, allowing developers and  deployment configurations to enable features as  necessary in order to minimise the attack surface.   The framework should allow for configuration reporting   226  Practical Internet of Things Security, Brian Russell, 2016.  227  J.-H. Hoepman and B.

Cloud and IoT IoT devices send captured data to a back-end for analysis  and possible further action. Since the deployment of IoT  devices is progressing at a rapid pace and at large scale,  the amount of data being generated is unprecedented.  Cloud computing offers computing capabilities, storage,  applications and services, in a highly scalable manner, and  is thus considered a natural fit for the IoT ecosystem.  Consequently, recent years have seen the emergence of a  number of cloud-based IoT platforms, which facilitate  communication, data flow, device management and user  interfacing, and the functionality of applications. All of the  major cloud service providers (CSPs) including AWS, Google  and Microsoft have offerings targeted at the IoT market;  widely-used IoT platforms include Amazon’s AWS IoT,  Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure IoT, IBM Watson, and Cisco  IoT Cloud Connect. Having said that, research has found   significant gaps in domain support in existing cloud computing  platforms, and a notable absence of standardisation.231  Cloud computing is a shared technology model where  different organisations are responsible for implementing  and managing different parts of the stack. As a result,  security responsibilities are also distributed across the  stack and thus across the organisations involved. This is  commonly referred to as the shared responsibility model.  As described by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)232, the  exact distribution of security responsibilities depends on  the service model.   Software as a Service: The cloud provider is responsible for  most of the security, since the cloud user can only access  and manage their use of the application and cannot alter  how the application works. For example, a SaaS provider is  responsible for perimeter security, logging/ monitoring/ auditing, and application security, while the consumer may  only be able to manage authorisation and entitlements.  231  A survey of IoT cloud platforms, Partha Pratim Ray, 2017.  232  Cloud Security Alliance’s Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud   Computing v4.0, 2017  INFRASTRUCTURE  as a service  PLATFORM  as a service  SOFTWARE  as a service  Figure 21: Security Responsibilities in the Cloud (Source: Cloud Security Alliance)  Security responsibility  Mostly consumer Mostly provider    Platform as a Service: The cloud provider is responsible for  the security of the platform, while the cloud consumer is  responsible for everything they implement on the platform,  including how they configure any offered security features.  For example, when using a Database as a Service, the  provider manages fundamental security, patching, and core  configuration, while the cloud consumer is responsible for  everything else, including which security features of the  database to use, and managing accounts as well as  authentication methods.  Infrastructure as a Service: The provider is responsible for  foundational security, while the cloud consumer is  responsible for everything they build on the infrastructure.  This places far more responsibility on the cloud consumer.  For example, the IaaS provider will likely monitor their  perimeter for attacks, but the consumer is fully responsible  for how they define and implement their virtual network  security based on the tools available on the service. CSA provides further guidance233 for various aspects of  cloud security across the above service models, including  good practices such as the use of multi-factor authentication  (MFA) for privileged access, “architecting for failure” to   ensure business continuity, carefully understanding the  responsibilities and contract of the cloud provider, and  using appropriate encryption and key management to  ensure the protection of sensitive data. CSA also suggests  a simple high-level process for implementing cloud security,  as shown below.  As an example, Google Cloud Platform servers use a variety  of technologies to ensure that they are booting the correct  software stack, including cryptographic signatures over  low-level components like the BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and  base operating system image234. This security is based on  the Titan security chip which was also discussed in the  previous section.  ENISA describes235 security challenges that arise from the  convergence of cloud computing and IoT, including the fact  that the security requirements depend on the industry  vertical being served, the vulnerability of edge devices that  can then be used to gain access to the cloud, and the  difficulty of securing heterogeneous communication  protocols between devices and cloud.  233  Cloud Security Alliance’s Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud   Computing v4.0, 2017  234  https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext  235  Towards secure convergence of cloud and IoT, ENISA, Sept 2018  Figure 22: Cloud Security Process Model (Source: Cloud Security Alliance)  Identify requirements  Select provider,  service and  deployment   models  Assess security  controls  Design and  implement  controls  Define  architecture  Identify control  gaps  Manage changes  70    71  Applications As identified by Subramanian and Swaminathan236,  applications in a typical IoT environment fall into the  following categories: 1. Device applications that reside on the nodes and/or   gateways. 2. Controlling applications that typically reside in the data   centre or on a user or operator’s mobile device. 3. Consuming applications that typically reside in the data   centre and receive data from the devices for further  processing and analytics.  4. Relay services that format and transfer data between  different components, e.g., APIs and web services.  To realise safe and secure software, it is important to adopt  a secure design and development methodology. Useful  guidelines for secure software development are provided by  OWASP237, which also offers a comprehensive developer  checklist that covers input validation, access control,  session management, error handling, logging, database  security and memory management.  OWASP’s Application Security Verification Standard  (ASVS)238 is a list of application security requirements or  tests that can be used by architects, developers, testers,  security professionals, and even consumers to determine  the security level of a given application in a consistent  manner. ASVS defines 3 security verification levels of  successively increasing depth, with a set of security  requirements for each level. OWASP specifically discusses  the use of ASVS as the basis of a secure SDLC: developers  are encouraged to use the ASVS as a peer review checklist  to ensures that unsafe code does not get checked in;  further, developers can use the ASVS as part of their  automated verification secure unit and integration test   suites. The aim is to reduce the risk from waterfall-style  “penetration testing at the end”, which can lead to  expensive refactoring when delivering milestone builds into  production.  IoT devices (or, more specifically, the applications running  on them) should “prove their health”, before accessing  other IoT devices or services. Associated capabilities  include a process for securely determining software and  firmware versions and a secure software and firmware  update mechanism. For example, the Trusted Computing  Group’s Trusted Network Connect (TNC) standards, which  specify a standard mechanism to check which software or  firmware is running on a device, are among the protocols  and mechanisms for safeguarding the patch and upgrade  process. Malware can be detected at boot time using the  device’s Trusted Boot and Remote Attestation capabilities,  even to the point of finding changes in the device’s BIOS or  other firmware.  236  https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2017/Volume-3/Pages/security-  assurance-in-the-sdlc-for-the-internet-of-things.aspx  237  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/  OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide    238 https:// www.owasp.org/images/3/33/  OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_3.0.1.pdf  3 Advanced  2 Standard  1 Opportunistic  0 Cursory  ASVS defines detailed  verification requirements   for levels 1 and above;  whereas level 0 is meant    to be flexible and is  customised by each   organisation  Figure 23: OWASP Security Verification Levels (Source: OWASP)    5.9.2 Key Findings – The diversity of operating systems, cloud solutions and   application development frameworks that populate the  IoT market is large. An in-depth evaluation is required on  the security claims made for each solution.  – Standards are required for software development,  deployment and operation processes to secure the OS,  cloud back-ends, and applications.  – IoT-specific secure software development life cycle  (SDLC) guidelines need to be defined for developers of   IoT applications.  5.10 SECURE COMMUNICATIONS AND  INFRASTRUCTURE  IoT devices transmit information to a back-end for  processing and analytics. Depending on the computational  capabilities of the devices, it may be possible to filter some  of the data before transmission or even to take immediate  action locally without sending any data at all; however, all  IoT systems do, at some point, send data over a network to  a back-end. There are numerous ways to achieve this  connectivity, ranging from direct cellular or satellite  connections to low-power WANs with gateways to reach the  back-end. Security is paramount since IoT devices based on  different technologies and acquired from various suppliers  on the global market communicate via heterogeneous  network interfaces in an open network that is untrustworthy  and potentially hostile.  5.10.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments When a device connects to the back-end, a gateway or other  devices, it must authenticate and establish trust. Once  trust is established, devices, users and services can  securely communicate, interact and transact information.  This challenge encompasses all elements that route and  transport endpoint data traffic securely over the infra- structure, whether control, management or actual data  traffic.  Authentication and Authorisation Authentication in IoT networks should establish mutual  trust between devices, users, gateways, back-ends,  networks, and services. Classically, the authentication  process relies on the authenticating entity demonstrating  knowledge (\"something you know\"), possession  (\"something you have\"), and/or inherent/behavioural  (\"something you are\") factors, with multiple factors often  recommended for stronger authentication. While these  factors are applicable to users of IoT devices (e.g. to log in  to a management console), the \"things\" themselves are  essentially restricted to possession factors relying on a  shared secret or asymmetric key. As discussed in previous  chapters, the provisioning of a trusted identity is normally  done at the time of manufacturing or via key injection.  Public-key infrastructure (PKI) has been used to  authenticate machines and servers for decades, and offers  an established open standard for interoperability. However,  PKI needs to evolve in order to support the scale and hetero- geneity inherent in IoT usecases.239 Specifically, lightweight  certificate enrollment procedures should prove useful; the  Swedish CEBOT (Certificate Enrollment in Billions of Things)  project addresses how lightweight enrollment can be  achieved.240 Additionally, certificate validity periods and  future-proof algorithms need to be considered. If implemented  carefully using the device's root of trust, PKI-based  identities can provide a basis for strong authentication.    The authorisation layer controls the extent of access  provided to a device or, more generally, a process. This  layer builds upon the core authentication layer by leveraging  the identity information of an entity to determine what  actions it is allowed to perform. The principle of least  privilege dictates that we should only allow the bare  minimum of access to an entity, such as a device or  process, to allow it to perform the functionality needed of   it. With authentication and authorisation in place, a trust  relationship is established between IoT devices to exchange  appropriate information. 239  https://www.globalsign.com/en-sg/blog/iot-vs-traditional-pki-deployments/  240  https://www.sics.se/projects/certificate-enrollment-in-billions-of-things72    73  Secure network communications  Though some traditional network security solutions are  applicable to IoT, the limited processing and communication  capabilities of IoT devices preclude the use of full-fledged  security suites. Bonetto et al241 studied this and suggested  solutions to the challenge, proposing a lightweight  procedure to set up secure end-to-end channels between  unconstrained (and remote) peers and IoT devices. Sain et  al242 provide a survey of different wireless technologies and  their security strengths and weaknesses in a constrained  IoT environment.  We present below a visual representation of some state-of- the-art networking technologies for IoT and the  relationships between them. This stack bears some  resemblance to the commonly-encountered HTTP-TCP-IP- Ethernet Web networking stack, but features a larger  number of protocols and greater complexity. IoT networking  protocols typically feature lightweight, low-power operation  at relatively lower data rates compared to computer  networks, in order to meet the requirements of resource-  constrained devices with small amounts of memory and  processing power and networks with low bandwidth and  high latency.  IEEE standard 802.15.4244 offers the lower network  layers of a low-power wireless personal area network  (WPAN or LoWPAN) for inexpensive, low-speed ubiquitous  communication between devices, as opposed to other  approaches such as Wi-Fi, which offer more bandwidth  but require more power. Naturally, many of the devices  that use IEEE 802.15.4 connectivity are limited in their  computational power, memory, and/or energy availability.   Zigbee245 is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh network  standard for WPANs that builds on the physical layer and  media access control defined in IEEE 802.15.4. As one of  its defining features, Zigbee provides facilities for carrying  out secure communications, protecting establishment and  transport of cryptographic keys, cyphering frames, and  controlling devices246. Zigbee uses 128-bit keys to  implement its security mechanisms, and assumes   241  “Secure Communication for Smart IoT Objects: Protocol Stacks, Use Cases and   Practical Examples”, Bonetto et al. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.  jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263790.  242  Survey on Security in Internet of things: State of the Art and Challenges, by   Mangal Sain, Young Jin Kang, Hoon Jae Lee, South Korea, 2017.  243  https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/about/  244  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4  245  https://www.zigbee.org/  246  Zigbee Network Protocols and Applications, Wang et al, 2014  Application  Transport  Network  Data Link  Physical IEEE 802.15.4  Zigbee  BLE Wi-Fi RFID NFC  LPWANs (SigFox, LoRa,   NB-IoT)  CoAP  UDP  IPv6  MQTT  TCP DTLS  RPL  6LoWPAN  TLS  Figure 24: IoT Network Protocol Stack* (*integration of LPWANs with IPv6 is under way at IETF243)    adequate protection of all keying material. Trust must be  assumed in the initial installation of the keys, as well as in  the processing of security information. A key can be  associated either to a network, being usable by both Zigbee  layers and the MAC sublayer, or to a link, acquired through  pre-installation, agreement or transport. Establishment of  link keys is based on a master key which controls link key  correspondence. The initial master key must be obtained  through a secure medium (transport or pre-installation), as  the security of the whole network depends on it. Link and  master keys are only visible to the application layer.  Different services use different variations of the link key to  avoid leaks and security risks.  IPv6 promises to be a key enabler for the future of IoT,  providing end-to-end connectivity with a distributed routing  mechanism as well as a highly scalable address scheme,  providing more than 2 billion addresses per square  millimetre of the Earth surface247. This seems sufficient to  address the needs of any present and future communicating  device. Moreover, IPv6 is supported by a large community  of users and researchers supporting ongoing improvement  of its security features.   RFC 4919 describes the requirements for LoWPANs to work  with IPv6, and RFC 4944248 defines the frame format for  transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Since IPv6 requires support of packet sizes much larger  than the largest IEEE 802.15.4 frame size, an adaptation  layer (“6LoWPAN”) is defined. This RFC also defines  mechanisms for header compression required to make IPv6  practical on IEEE 802.15.4 networks, and the provisions  required for packet delivery in IEEE 802.15.4 meshes.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks  (RPL) is a routing protocol standardised for constrained IoT  environments such as 6LoWPAN networks. Providing  security in IPv6/RPL connected 6LoWPANs is challenging  because the devices are connected to the untrusted  Internet and are resource constrained while using novel IoT  technologies and lossy communication links. If a node  becomes an internal adversary, it can break network  operation without being detected by cryptography  mechanisms. Therefore, analysing RPL threats in addition  to specifying its operation will help to monitor most of the  internal malicious behaviours. RPL in authenticated  security mode uses secure messages. Pre-installed keys  are used to join a network as a leaf to provide message  confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. To join the  network as a router, a second key must be obtained from a  key authority.249   As opposed to WPANs which are short-range personal-area  networks, low-power wireless wide area networks (LPWANs)  enable long-range, low-power communication at low cost  using simplified, lightweight protocols and either license- free or licensed bands. LoRaWAN250 is an LPWAN protocol  designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated devices to  the internet. The LoRaWAN network architecture is  deployed in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay  messages between end-devices and a central network  server. The gateways are connected to the network server  via standard IP connections and act as a transparent  bridge, simply converting RF packets to IP packets and vice  versa. The wireless communication takes advantage of the  long-range characteristics of the LoRa physical layer,  allowing a single-hop link between the end-device and one  or many gateways. The LoRaWAN specification defines two  layers of cryptography:  247  https://iot6.eu/ipv6_for_iot  248  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4944  249  Routing Attacks and Countermeasures in the RPL-Based Internet of Things,   Wallgren et al, 2012  250  https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan74    75  – A unique 128-bit Network Session Key shared between  the end-device and network server  – A unique 128-bit Application Session Key shared end-to- end at the application level  AES encryption provides authentication and integrity of  packets to the network server and end-to-end encryption   to the application server. The keys can be Activated By  Personalisation (ABP) on the production line or during  commissioning or can be Over-The-Air Activated (OTAA) in  the field. OTAA allows devices to be re-keyed if necessary.   It is possible to use the LoRa physical layer and run a  different protocol on top of it, such as Symphony Link251.  Sigfox is a proprietary LPWAN technology that enables  remote devices to connect to an access point over Ultra  Narrow Band (UNB) frequencies. Sigfox highlights that  devices never have the ability to send data to arbitrary  entities via internet and can therefore be considered to be  protected by a “firewall”. Furthermore, Sigfox devices have  the following security features252: – Each Sigfox device is provisioned during manufacturing   with a unique symmetrical authentication key. Each  message to be sent or received by the device contains a  cryptographic token that is computed based on this  authentication key. Verification of the token ensures the  authentication of the sender (the device for an uplink  message, or the Sigfox network for a downlink message)  and the integrity of the message. Since the key is unique  per device, the compromising of one device has a very  limited impact. Sigfox has been working with its  ecosystem to increase the security level of devices  through the adoption of security best practices. In  addition, secure elements dedicated to Sigfox devices  are now available to provide tamper resistance.  – Each Sigfox message contains a sequence counter which  is verified by the Sigfox Core Network to detect and  discard replay attempts. The integrity of the counter is  guaranteed by the message authentication token.   – By default, data is conveyed over the air interface without  any encryption. However, depending on the application,  this data may be very sensitive, and its privacy must be  guaranteed. Sigfox gives customers the option to either  implement their own end-to-end encryption solutions or  to rely on an encryption solution provided by the Sigfox  protocol.   The IETF Working Group “IPv6 over Low Power Wide-Area  Networks” is currently focused on enabling IPv6  connectivity over several LPWAN technologies including  Sigfox, LoRa, WI-SUN and NB-IOT253.  The LPWAN Technology Security Comparison white paper254  from GSMA and Franklin Heath discusses the security  implications and controls for the abovementioned LPWA  technologies, identifying that IoT security needs are driven  largely by privacy and safety concerns and suggesting that  any deployment using LPWA technologies should be subject  to a security risk assessment using tools such as the GSMA  IoT Security Assessment255.  HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the dominant  application-layer protocol for the Web and has proven to be  very suitable for the navigation of interactive, hyperlinked  webpages. For IoT devices, most of which support no direct  human interaction, consume very little power and frequently  have poor network connectivity, HTTP is unsuitable256: a  single HTTP request requires a minimum of nine TCP  packets, even without taking packet loss into account.   This overhead adds to IoT operating expenses.   251  https://www.link-labs.com/symphony  252  https://www.sigfox.com/en/technology/security  253  https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/about/  254  https://www.gsma.com/iot/news/  new-report-outlines-security-considerations-lpwa-technology/  255  https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-assessment/  256  https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/eye-on-iot-/4437056/  Why-HTTP-Won-t-Work-for-IoT    Two of the most successful application-layer protocols for  small devices are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport  (MQTT)257 and the Constrained Application Protocol  (CoAP)258. Both MQTT and CoAP: – are open standards – are better suited to constrained environments than HTTP – provide mechanisms for asynchronous communication – run on existing protocols such as TCP/UDP over IP.  MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed  for lightweight device communication, originally developed  by IBM and now an open standard. It features a client/ server model, where every device is a client and connects  to a server, known as a broker, over TCP. Every message is a  discrete chunk of data published to an address, known as a  topic. Clients may subscribe to multiple topics. Every client  subscribed to a topic receives every message published to  the topic. Connections may be encrypted using TLS for  security259.  CoAP is defined by the IETF’s Constrained RESTful  Environments (CoRE) working group260 for applications that  deal with the manipulation of simple resources on  constrained networks. This includes applications to monitor  simple sensors (e.g. temperature sensors, light switches,  and power meters), to control actuators (e.g. light switches,  heating controllers, and door locks), and to manage  devices. The general architecture consists of devices on  the constrained network that are responsible for one or  more resources that may represent sensors, actuators,  combinations of values, and/or other information.   Devices can – send messages to change and query resources on other   devices.  – send notifications about changed resource values to   other devices that have expressed their interest to  receive notification about changes.   – publish or be queried about its resources.   CoAP is designed for use between devices on the same  constrained network, between devices and general nodes  on the Internet, and between devices on different  constrained (but connected) networks.  Another RESTful approach to IoT is found in the so-called  Web of Things (WoT), which is an application layer that  enables access and control over IoT resources and  applications using common web technologies (such as  HTML 5.0, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby on Rails etc.). This  approach can enable both developers and vendors to  benefit from the popularity and maturity of web  technologies. While the W3C has begun standardisation  efforts for WoT261, we do not yet find mainstream adoption  of web technologies in the IoT space.  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)262 provides  security for datagram-based application protocols such as  CoAP by allowing them to communicate in a way that is  designed (RFC 4347263, RFC 6347264) to prevent  eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS  protocol is based on the stream-oriented Transport Layer  Security (TLS) protocol and is intended to provide similar  security guarantees. The DTLS protocol datagram  preserves the semantics of the underlying transport    257  http://mqtt.org/  258  http://coap.technology/  259  MQTT Client Authentication using TLS, IBM Knowledge Center https://www.ibm.  com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/  q021330_.htm   260  https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/documents/261    https://www.w3.org/WoT/,  262  https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tls-dtls13-01.html  263  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4347  264  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc634776    77  — the application does not suffer from the delays  associated with stream protocols, but has to deal with  packet reordering, loss of datagrams and data larger than  the size of a datagram network packet.  Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a widely-used network  protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of  data sent over a network. IPsec includes protocols for  establishing mutual authentication between agents at the  beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic  keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows  between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of  security gateways (network-to-network), or between a  security gateway and a host (network-to-host). IPsec uses  cryptographic security services to protect communications  over IP networks. IPsec supports network-level peer  authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity,  data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.  While IPSec does add overheads to packet size and  computation, it is considered a good alternative to SSL for  capable IoT devices265.  5G Fifth-generation (5G) communications networks are   widely expected to revolutionise machine-to-machine  communications. The 5G Infrastructure Public Private  Partnership266 (5G-PPP) identifies that 5G networks shall  enable not only very high availability or up-time but also   high speeds, minimal latency and comprehensive coverage.  According to 5G-PPP this implies a security makeover in  how confidentiality, integrity, and availability will be  maintained and managed in 5G networks.267 Furthermore,   the complexity of securing a network and its services has  increased with the introduction of 5G network slicing and  the increasing use of software-defined networking (SDN)  and network function virtualization (NFV). The 5G PPP   identifies specific 5G security risks including unauthorised  access or usage of assets, weak slice isolation and  connectivity, and traffic embezzlement due to recursive/ additive virtualization. In addition, service-specific security  requirements must also be considered as the 5G  ecosystem is anticipated to be service-oriented.   Secure Gateways Every IoT system needs some way to connect its sensors/ devices to the cloud so that data can be sent back and  forth. Gateways act as bridges between devices and the  cloud: devices communicate with a gateway, which in turn  communicates with the back-end. The benefits of such   two-step communication are multi-fold:268   – Using a gateway means that devices only need to send  data a relatively short distance to the gateway, while the  gateway handles the high-bandwidth link (“backhaul”) to  the cloud. This allows for longer battery life.  – Latency can be minimised by processing some data on  the gateway or even on the device itself. However, most  IoT devices are too small and underpowered to do such  processing themselves. Gateways can reduce latency in  time-critical applications by pre-processing the data and  issuing suitable actions. This is important for life-or- death situations in the medical realm or for fast-moving  objects such as cars.  – A complete IoT application might involve many kinds of  sensors and devices that use varying transmission  protocols as discussed above. Gateways can  communicate with sensors/devices using the right  protocols and then translate that data into a standard  protocol such as MQTT to be sent to the cloud.  – Devices can generate large amounts of data, only a small  fraction of which may actually be valuable. Gateways can  pre-process and filter the data to decrease transmission,  processing, and storage requirements.  265  https://www.networkworld.com/article/3164531/internet-of-things/ssl-or-  ipsec-whats-the-right-approach-for-iot-network-security.html  266  https://5g-ppp.eu/  267  5G PPP Phase1 Security Landscape – White Paper by 5G PPP Security Working   Group  268  IoT 101: An Introduction to the Internet of Things, Leverege LLC    – Gateways reduce the number of sensors/devices  connected to the internet by “multiplexing” the devices  together. This makes gateways the first line of defence  against hackers, but also prime targets. Therefore,  security needs to be a priority for any gateway.  Highly secured gateways can provide trust anchors within  the network. For example, Germany’s BSI269 has  standardised the Smart Meter Gateway as an interoperable  and secure communication platform270 with a dedicated  Common Criteria profile271.  Gateways are also considered as solutions to secure legacy  hardware such as industrial control systems. For older or  proprietary hardware that doesn’t support modern networks  or security standards, the Trusted Network Connect  architecture272 includes a specification (IF-MAP Metadata  for ICS Security) that organises legacy or constraint devices  into local enclaves that connect to a trusted network using  security gateways. The gateways that link these networks  provide encrypted communications and security to the  interconnected enclaves, and automatically apply access  control policies from a centralised provisioning system.   5.10.2 Key Findings – The networking and interoperability challenge has seen   extensive work as well as significant standardisation;  however, an in-depth review is required of the security of  these communication solutions and the security and  privacy requirements on each level of the communication  stack in the IoT ecosystem.   – Good practices are lacking regarding the technical  feasibility of security controls running on resource- constrained devices. Security reference architectures are  required.   – Secure gateways can provide high-security deployments  even with low-cost IoT devices.  5.11 SECURITY MONITORING AND ANALYTICS History shows that vulnerabilities are invariably found after  a product is deployed – and often exploited in “zero-day”  attacks. It is vital to be able to detect unforeseen  vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live IoT  deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and  remediate. In performing these tasks intelligently and  automatically, it is important to devise new paradigms of  IoT security monitoring, incident management and recovery.   Since IoT is by definition vulnerable, we need to monitor and  analyse dataflows for advanced attacks, exceptions and  other deviant behaviour. Furthermore, we should learn from  discovered incidents, preferably in real-time, in order to  define relevant anomalies and improve protection and  detection. No matter how well defence measures are  implemented, some threats will still get past even the best  defences. Detecting such threats requires strong  understanding of what the systems “should” be doing.  Machine learning may help to find threats hiding in the  noise of trillions of events generated every month.  5.11.1 Current Landscape and Recent Developments State-of-the-art security analytics are developed by the  Industrial Internet Consortium under the Industrial Internet  of Things Analytics Framework273, which is intended for  system architects, technology leaders and business  leaders looking to successfully deploy industrial analytics  systems. Although this framework has a business focus  and not a security focus, it addresses the required building  blocks for security monitoring and analytics.  269  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0073b_pdf.pdf  270  BSI Presentation by Joachim Weber, during SICW IoT Security roundtable, 2017.  271  Smart Meter Gateway PP, https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/  pp0073b_pdf.pdf  272  https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/trusted-network-  communications/tnc-resources/  273  http://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/IIC_Industrial_Analytics_Framework_  Oct_2017.pdf78    79  Schonwalder274 proposed and investigated a distributed  passive monitoring architecture for IoT. The architecture  relies on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy  Networks (RPL), which was discussed in the previous  section, to monitor the network in a lightweight manner.  Higher-order monitoring nodes can passively listen to the  network while participating in its operation. Monitored  nodes do not require to be instrumented, nor do they need  to dedicate resources to the monitoring tasks which are  operated by the cloud.  Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure As ISO identifies275, inappropriate disclosure of a  vulnerability could not only delay the deployment of the  vulnerability resolution but also give attackers hints to  exploit it. Vulnerability disclosure is a process through  which vendors and vulnerability finders may work  cooperatively in finding solutions that reduce the risks  associated with a vulnerability. It encompasses actions  such as reporting, coordinating, and publishing information  about a vulnerability and its resolution. The goals of  vulnerability disclosure include the following: a) ensuring that identified vulnerabilities are addressed; b) minimising the risk from vulnerabilities; c) providing users with sufficient information to evaluate   risks from vulnerabilities to their systems; d) setting expectations to promote positive communication   and coordination among involved parties.  A strategy to deal with discovered threats and  vulnerabilities includes a Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure (CVD) program that balances security with the  interests of manufacturers and stakeholders, as well as a  clear understanding of liability. As discussed276 by  US-CERT, CVD practices commonly lead to a strategy for  Vulnerability Management (VM), which is the common term   for tasks such as vulnerability scanning, patch testing, and  deployment. VM practices focus on the positive action of  identifying specific systems affected by known (post- disclosure) vulnerabilities and reducing the risks they pose  through the application of mitigations or remediation such  as patches or configuration changes. This is also discussed  in the previous section on product lifecycles.  Data Classification Combining the computing power available within the cloud  with the vast volumes of data that can be generated by IoT,  it should be possible to segregate bad actors, limit access  to malicious parties, and integrate easily with third party  logging and intrusion detection and prevention systems.  Data will be collected within the cloud from a variety of data  components in the IoT ecosystem. Some data might be  highly sensitive, while other data might be relatively benign;  a security monitoring framework should provide capabilities  to classify data and to protect data based on its  classification. Interface controls should limit access and  exposure of sensitive data on the basis of classification.  Honeypots A honeypot is a computer security mechanism that appears  to be a legitimate device containing information of value but  is actually isolated and monitored. A honeypot resource is  never meant for legitimate use; therefore, any access to the  honeypot resource is suspicious, and either accidental or  hostile in nature. The attack strategies are recorded by the  honeypot, and may include network traffic, payload,  malware samples, and the toolkit used by the attacker.  Some honeypots that are specifically geared towards IoT  include IoTPOT278, Dionaea279, and ZigBee Honeypot.  DutchSec's HoneyTrap offers an advanced system for  running and managing honeypots.280  274  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7502833/, Schonwalder, 2015.  275  Information technology — Security techniques — Vulnerability disclosure, ISO/  IEC 29147  276  The CERT® Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, August 2017  277  http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/  building-security-into-cars-iot_en-us.pdf  278  https://github.com/IoTPOT/IoTPOT  279  https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea  280  https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap    Security Event Reporting and Information Sharing Detailed descriptions of IoT incidents, such as those  provided by ENISA281, can be used as input for evaluations  and validations of certain security measures. The analytics  framework should operate in the cloud, given that most IoT  devices are resource-constrained. This approach creates  an opportunity to compare large volumes of dataflows and  detect and react to malicious activities over millions of  devices. For example, the Malware Information Sharing  Platform282 (MISP) is an open source threat intelligence  platform that provides open standards for Threat  Information Sharing. This platform is built to collect and  share large amounts of data including reporting and alerting  solutions.   Gateway-Based Monitoring The gateway is uniquely suited to monitor traffic to and from  the cloud, and should support anomaly detection and  integrate easily with existing anomaly and intrusion  detection systems. A secure gateway might even support  intrusion prevention capabilities to exclude suspicious  actors from the ecosystem. A logging and reporting  framework should allow the gateway to observe, baseline,  and monitor communications traffic and component  behaviour.   5.11.2 Key Findings – Data collection and analytics for massive numbers of IoT   devices is a major challenge. – New metrics and methodologies are required to support   IoT infrastructure analytics given the data characteristics  of resource-constrained IoT devices.  – Monitoring and analytics capabilities should provide input  for vulnerability management programs.  – In case vulnerabilities are not solved by the supplier,  monitoring tools should be able to detect and disconnect  vulnerable devices from the internet.   – The industry should act as a global community when  learning from incidents. This requires an open culture of  sharing incidents and mutual learning where security is a  joint responsibility.  5.12 INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG CHALLENGES The IoT security challenges discussed throughout this study  do not exist in isolation; rather, they are closely dependent  on each other. These interdependencies are illustrated in  Figure 25.   IoT security needs to be based upon fundamentally sound  cybersecurity principles, and all IoT products and services  must be designed with security and privacy in mind.  Manufacturers need to employ secure supply chains and  carefully-considered lifecycle management strategies for  device deployments. Devices themselves need a root of  trust to allow for secure identification, booting and updates.  Communications between devices and back-end need to be  secured using authentication and encryption. Monitoring  and analytics can detect vulnerabilities after deployment,  and the information thus gathered can used to patch  devices using lifecycle and supply chain management  practices. At the same time, vulnerability information  should be fed back into the supply chain to narrow down  root causes and identify other devices that may be  affected.   281  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, ENISA, Nov 2017  282  http://www.misp-project.org/80    81  At the governance level, cybersecurity principles must   lead to concrete guidelines and standards that can be   used as a basis for evaluation and certification, and in turn  these certifications should be mandated and backed by  governmental legislation. Finally, since IoT is a global  phenomenon and is not limited by national boundaries, it is  essential to align country-specific legislations and adopt a  global approach to IoT security.  Principles  Standards  Certi�cation  Legislation  Global  Alignment ConnectivityDevices  Supply Chain  Lifecycle  Analytics/ Monitoring  Security by  design  Platforms  Privacy by  design  Applications  Figure 25: IoT Security Interdependencies      83  6 CONCLUSIONS AND   RECOMMENDATIONS  The number of connected things in use globally will surge  from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 20.4 billion by 2020, with total  spending on endpoints and services exceeding $2  trillion283. It is seen that IoT devices are often constrained  in terms of resources (energy, computing power, memory),  physical environment, and cost, such that traditional IT  security mindsets cannot be applied directly. Further, IoT  devices may run without supervision and for extended  periods of time, possibly in hostile environments – making  them particularly susceptible to hacking. Many might have  zero or limited user interfacing; thus, patching and updating  may not be convenient and malfunctioning or rogue devices  may not be immediately detectable. This leads to the below  risks: – Consumer security, privacy and safety are undermined by   the vulnerability of individual devices. – The wider economy and critical infrastructures face an   increasing threat of large scale cyber-attacks launched  from large volumes of insecure IoT devices.   The fact that IoT is closely integrated with the physical world  can increase the impact of cyber-attacks: while traditional   IT cyber-attacks could result in data leakage and financial  losses, IoT cyber-attacks have the potential to cause direct  physical harm.  An analysis of key initiatives shows that there are numerous  industry collaborations focusing on these IoT security  challenges and on IoT in general, but progress in achieving  a secure IoT has been limited. At the same time, we have  seen few government-led global initiatives. There is no  single set of IoT security and privacy principles nor a  certification regime that is internationally recognised and  adopted. The diversity in proposed IoT security principles   illustrates a lack of collaboration, especially between  governments. Due to the lack of globally-adopted principles,  a common understanding of shared IoT challenges and  issues is lacking; this is required to define a global  governance process. Separately, consumers and  companies are not sufficiently aware of IoT security risks  and not equipped to respond to threats.  We have identified 11 foundational IoT security challenges;  for most challenges, we face a fragmented space of  solutions and gaps that need to be closed.   Security standards are required to stimulate the adoption  of secure IoT devices. There is an overwhelming number of  good practices, guidelines and standards, but  manufacturers may not have the expertise to use them:  usability of security standards is a challenge and requires  more research. Harmonisation of IoT security standards,  guidelines and recommendations is required to stimulate  adoption; such harmonisation should be supported by  global cybersecurity research initiatives. It is important for  standardisation processes to stay aligned with technical  developments without stifling innovation. Having said that,  cost and time-to-market pressures in the IoT world can  make it difficult manufacturers to implement security and  comply with standards in the absence of suitable  incentives.   There is a distinct lack of labels and certifications to inform  IoT end users about device security and risks. Also, a  minimum set of security requirements is lacking – such a  baseline is vital for supervision and enforcement to prevent  the deployment of vulnerable devices. There are as yet no  evaluation profiles, e.g. Common Criteria cPPs, tailored to   283  https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917    IoT devices; it should be determined whether these can be  generic or domain-specific to application domains. In fact,  since CC certification is known for being a relatively slow  and costly process, a non-CC certification approach may  prove more suitable for IoT devices.   Owing to a lack of legislation, the adoption of security  guidelines and best practices remains voluntary. An initial  step taken by the United States is to mandate that the  government shall only procure IoT devices that conform to  some measure of security. This approach can contribute  significantly towards a secure IoT when large countries  participate, but smaller economies such as Singapore and  the Netherlands should work together for greater impact.   Liability can prove to be an effective mechanism to drive the  industry towards security, although in most cases liability  legislation needs to be modernised to account for the  nature of IoT. The process of identifying the responsible  manufacturer or supplier and holding them liable for a  vulnerability is a supply chain management challenge.   IoT hardware and software manufacturers and suppliers  should adopt a supply chain risk management framework  (e.g. ISO28000, TL9000) to cascade cybersecurity  requirements, risk and liability up the supply chain.  At the device level, a root of trust (RoT) is an immutable  trust anchor; the chain of trust should preferably build on   a hardware RoT. RoT-based cybersecurity is provided by  several solutions including TPMs and PUFs. IoT security  guidelines emphasise hardware roots of trust; yet,  established practices are lacking regarding their use in  resource-constrained devices. Security reference  architectures are required across a range of constraint  classes.  There is a diversity of operating systems, cloud solutions  and application development frameworks in the IoT market.  An in-depth evaluation is required on the security claims  made for each solution. Cloud-based IoT platforms offer  comprehensive device management functionality including   onboarding and patching, but are largely unstandardised.  IoT-specific secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)  guidelines are necessary for IoT developers, platform  operators, industry and manufacturers.   A number of standards have emerged for IoT networking;  however, an in-depth review is required of the security of  these protocols and the security and privacy requirements  on each level of the communication stack in the IoT  ecosystem. Regardless of communication protocol, secure  gateways are recommended and can provide a level of  security even in deployments that use low-cost IoT devices.  History shows that device-level vulnerabilities are invariably  found after a product is deployed – and are often exploited  in “zero-day” attacks. It is important to be able to detect  unforeseen vulnerabilities, anomalies and threats in live  deployments, and to respond quickly, recover and  remediate. Monitoring is especially vital for IoT, but data  collection and analytics for massive numbers of IoT devices  remains a challenge. A strategy to deal with discovered  threats and vulnerabilities should include a CVD program  that balances security with the interests of manufacturers  and stakeholders, and includes the propagation of  vulnerability information up and across supply chains.   Keeping software and firmware up-to-date via patches and  updates is critical for a secure IoT ecosystem. Updates  should be delivered and deployed using a secure and  verifiable methodology. If a vendor identifies or is informed  about vulnerabilities, it must patch them in a timely manner  and publish patch information as part of an auditable  Vulnerability Management Program.  Most importantly, the industry should act as a global  community when learning from incidents. This requires an  open culture of sharing and mutual learning, and the  understanding that security is a joint responsibility.  It is recommended to set up a global initiative on secure IoT  in order to address the below gaps.84    85  – Limited adoption of IoT security practices and lack of  harmonised operational expertise – A number of  standards, guidelines and good practices are proposed  and available; however, harmonisation towards a  practical set of security standards is lacking, and clear- cut information on implementing conformant security  functionality is scarce. Given that manufacturers are  currently not mandated or incentivised to implement  cybersecurity measures, and that a widely-accepted IoT  security certification framework does not exist, there is  no compelling reason for manufacturers to invest in  delivering secure products.  – Lack of alignment and information sharing across supply  chains and geographies – IoT security is fundamentally a  global problem that demands a global solution. Since IoT  devices can reach and be reached from distant parts of  the world, and modern products use components that  may originate in several different countries, it is  important to coordinate policies, share knowhow and  intelligence, and propagate vulnerability information up  and across supply chains.  – Lack of foundational IoT device security – By some  measures, only 4% of IoT devices build their cybersecurity  on top of a hardware root of trust.   The initiative should focus on the following challenges on a  priority basis in order to address the gaps identified above.  These are also highlighted by the experts consulted for the  study; section 3.4 described their inputs on the priority  challenges. 1. Evaluation and certification of IoT devices in order to   provide assured security baselines for a wide variety of  devices. A globally aligned approach with government  involvement is necessary.  2. Monitoring and supply chain security along with global  intelligence sharing for cybersecurity and trust at  component level. It is important to close the gap  between device supply chains and the threat and  vulnerability intelligence gathered from a monitoring  effort.   3. Hardware security and trusted device identities,  focusing on the security of different root-of-trust  implementations and their suitability for different device  types. More research is needed on the use of  alternatives such as PUFs for low-cost IoT devices.   In particular, the use of these alternatives in various  practical scenarios such as authentication, encryption  and secure booting needs to be investigated.   This IoT security initiative should be a partnership with  strong involvement of government agencies, industry and  academia. Government agencies should set the direction  and steer nations towards a secure and safe IoT  environment, working closely with thought leaders,  cybersecurity and IoT experts from industry, academia and  research organisations. The overarching objective is to  share ideas and experiences, shape technologies and  architectures, and drive standards and collaboration in  order to ensure a safe and secure Internet of Things.      87  ANNEX A – IOT SECURITY IN SMART  MOBILITY AND SMART HEALTH  SMART MOBILITY The societal challenge of smart mobility284 is to achieve a  transport system that is resource-efficient, climate and  environmentally-friendly, and functions safely and  seamlessly for the benefit of all citizens, the economy and  society. IoT is a key enabling technology to solve this  challenge.   A modern vehicle can have between 8 and 30 on-board  computers that manage various aspects of car functionality,  from the speed of the car to the temperature of its interior.  These numbers illustrate the observation that a car is not a  single IoT device, but more appropriately thought of as a  mega-IoT device or, more formally, a system-of-systems of  IoT devices. Within this system-of-systems, the constraints  are cost, computing power, and bandwidth limitations;  physical constraints are usually less critical in a car  environment.  A connected car is invariably equipped with Internet access,  and usually also with a wireless local area network. This  allows the car to share Internet access with other devices  inside as well as outside the vehicle.  The successful and safe deployment of connected vehicles  in different use case scenarios, using local and distributed  information and intelligence, is a challenging task285 that  needs to use reliable, real-time IoT platforms managing  safety-critical vehicle services, advanced sensors and  actuators, navigation and cognitive decision-making  technology, interconnectivity between vehicles (V2V), and   vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. Connected  vehicles will enable the development of service ecosystems  based on collected information (e.g. maintenance,  personalised insurance, and even customised in-car  entertainment).  As with all IoT devices, the additional functionality offered  by a connected car comes with risks and potentially fatal  consequences. Researchers have already proven that  modern, computerised vehicles can be hijacked with just a  laptop computer and easily obtained software. Hackers  have demonstrated that they can display false readings   on the dashboard, remotely control steering and disable  brakes, and switch off the engine remotely when the vehicle  is in motion286.  ENISA identifies287 good practices to ensure the security   of smart cars against cyber threats, categorising these  practices into policy, organisational and technical  measures. Policy measures include adherence to regulation  and establishment of liability; organisational measures  include the designation of a dedicated security team within  organisational players in the connected car industry, the  development of a dedicated Information Security  Management System (ISMS) tailored to industry needs,   and the introduction of security and privacy controls in the  design phase; and technical measures include end-to-end  encrypted communications, state-of-the-art standards for  cryptography and random-number generation, dedicated  and independently-audited hardware security modules  (HSMs), and secure key management practices. ENISA also   284  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/  smart-green-and-integrated-transport  285  Report: AIOTI WG 9 – Smart Mobility, 2015  286  https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  287  Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars, ENISA, Dec 2016    recommends improved information sharing between  industry stakeholders as well as clarification of liability  amongst industry actors.   In addition to safety and security dangers, drivers and  passengers face privacy threats. Private data on smart  phones, such as e-mail, text messages, contacts and other  personal data, could be stolen by hackers. Vehicle location  information can be used to determine when the occupants  of a home are away, giving burglars a window of opportunity.  Several initiatives have been launched to address the  security issues inherent to connected cars. The European  Commission’s Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) has a   workgroup dedicated to Smart Mobility, which includes IoT  use cases pertaining to the car industry. The eCall  initiative288, described in Chapter 4, is intended to bring  rapid assistance to motorists in the event of a crash by  communicating the vehicle’s location and direction to  emergency services; eCall has been mandatory for all new  cars sold within the EU since April 2018. Intelligent  Transportation Systems (ITS) groups worldwide, particularly  ERTICO289 in Europe, are involved in a number of pilot  projects in the area of smart mobility. ERTICO has also  released recommendations290 on communication  technologies for future Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) scenarios.  The American Future of Privacy Forum291 and National  Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) have published a   DATA AND THE CONNECTED CAR  CAN-BUS: internal communication bridge between   electronic control units  AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE IMAGING AND   SCANNING: LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic   sensors or exterior cameras  DSRC RADIO: vehicle to vehicle   and vehicle to infrastructure   communication  THIRD PARTY MONITORING   DEVICE: OBD II or external   device communicates with   fleet operator  Telematics control unit (TCU): interconnects   CAN-BUS and external sustems  TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS: short range radio,   goes to radio receiver  EVENT DATA RECORDER:   black box with accident data  CRASH DATA RETRIEVAL:   extract EDR data  Figure 26: Connected car with different functions (Source: Future of Privacy Forum)  288  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/  ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018  289  http://ertico.com/  290  http://erticonetwork.com/  ertico-releases-guide-about-technologies-for-future-c-its-service-scenarios/  291  https://fpf.org/88    89  consumer guide292 highlighting the types of data that  connected cars collect and transmit.  The Security Credential Management System (SCMS) of the  U.S. Department of Transportation is a proof-of-concept  (POC) message security solution293 for vehicle-to-vehicle  (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.   It uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based approach  that employs encryption and certificate management to  facilitate trusted communication. Authorised system  participants use digital certificates issued by SCMS to  authenticate and validate the safety and mobility messages  that form the foundation for connected vehicles. To protect  the privacy of vehicle owners, these certificates contain no  personal or equipment-identifying information but serve as  system credentials so that other users in the system can  trust the source of each message. SCMS also protects the  contents of each message by identifying and removing  misbehaving devices, while maintaining privacy.  Amongst industry initiatives, IBM advocates its Design,  Build, Drive philosophy that aims to secure each phase of  the lifecycle of the connected car. In particular, IBM  recognises the need for designing a secure infrastructure in  addition to a secure vehicle, given that infrastructure-based  attacks such as falsified traffic conditions could wreak  havoc by causing unexpected rerouting and braking. The  approach also emphasises the need for a trusted supply  chain and a trusted maintenance ecosystem.294    SMART HEALTH The societal challenge of health, demographic change and  well-being295 aims to improve the lifelong health and well- being of all citizens; this means high-quality, economically  sustainable and innovative health and care systems, as   part of welfare systems, and opportunities for new jobs and  growth. Smart health includes health services, electronic  record management, smart home services and intelligent  and connected medical devices.296   ENISA has proposed key recommendations for hospital  information security executives and industry to enhance the  level of information security in Smart Hospitals.297 Through  the identification of assets and the related threats when   IoT components are supporting a healthcare organisation,  the report describes the Smart Hospital ecosystem and its  specific objectives. The solutions to realise a smart  hospital (or even more ambitiously, true \"Smart Health\" –  where the boundaries between hospitals and home care  start to blur) are broad and diverse. A related technology for  home care is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which aims at  helping older people live as independently as possible by  embedding intelligent objects in the environment.298    292  https://fpf.org/2017/01/25/  fpf-and-nada-launch-guide-to-consumer-privacy-in-the-connected-car/  293  https://www.its.dot.gov/resources/scms.htm  294  IBM Executive Report, Driving security: Cyber assurance for next-generation   vehicles, Christopher Poulin  295  http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/  health-demographic-change-and-wellbeing  296  https://www.activeadvice.eu/news/concept-projects/  what-is-smart-health-and-how-do-people-benefit/  297  Smart Hospitals - Security and Resilience for Smart Health Service and   Infrastructures, ENISA, November 2016.  298  http://www.aal-europe.eu/  Design  security in  – Design a secure vehicle  – Design a secure infrastructure  – Control the production    environment  – Create a trusted supply chain  – Harden the vehicle  – Create a trusted mainenance   ecosystem  – Enable new and trusted models  Build a secure  vehicle  Drive with  confidence  Figure 27: IBM's Design, Build, Drive Approach (Source: IBM)    AAL technologies range from automatically switching off  kitchen appliances or lights to monitoring vital functions  and the automatic notification of medical assistance in  case of an emergency. One such effort is the in-home  monitoring services for the elderly299 from Fujitsu and  Panasonic.  Personal wellness applications based on IoT devices for  both generic and health-specific purposes constitute  important developments towards Smart Health. These can  be accompanied by remote health monitoring and staff  identification. Smart Health IoT devices contain and retain  highly sensitive personal data of the patients to whom the  device is attached, be it temporary (e.g. electrocardiogram)   or more permanent (e.g. pacemaker). As can be imagined,  vast amounts of Protected Health Information (PHI) are  collected by the devices and either retained or shared in  real-time for querying and analysis.  As might be expected, there have already been cases of  security compromise in the domain of Smart Health.  According to Cylance300, in 2017 Abbott’s (formerly St. Jude  Medical) found itself the centre of attention for the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration301 (FDA) and unhappy  patients over their pacemakers, defibrillators, and other  medical devices being vulnerable to third-party man-in-the- middle access via cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Such  vulnerabilities could affect how the device operates,   Deep brain neurostimulators  Gastric stimulators  Foot drop implants  Insulin pumps  Cochlear implants  Cardiac defibrillator  pacemakers  Figure 28: Wireless Implantable Medical Devices, source: pinstake.com.  299  http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-  releases/2015/0625-01.html  300  https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/medical-device-security-the-state-of-play.html  301  https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm535843.htm90    91  including “rapid depletion of battery and/or inappropriate  pacing or shocks.” In August 2017, the FDA approved a  firmware update which addressed these vulnerabilities.  Separately, German electronics company Siemens issued a  customer alert302 in July 2017 warning of the highly critical  vulnerabilities in many of their medical scanners. Pending a  solution, Siemens has directed the devices to be taken  offline.  As with smart mobility IoT applications, smart health IoT is  vulnerable by definition as well. As a result, cybersecurity  flaws can lead to grievous safety losses. This emphasises  the need for cybersecurity in smart health devices. Are  these devices safe, secure, reliable, and resilient, and do  they uphold privacy expectations? Given the critical nature  of these devices, the sensitivity of the information they  capture, and the complexity of smart health ecosystems  and supply chains, it is imperative to work towards an  assured security framework for connected medical devices.  302  https://www.siemens.com/cert/pool/cert/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-  822184.pdf      93  ANNEX B – CATALOGUE OF KEY  INITIATIVES  AIOTI   Title AIOTI  Description The Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) is an inclusive body with members including key IoT  industrial players – large companies, successful SMEs and dynamic startups – as well as  well-known European research centres, universities, associations and public bodies.

Particularly, the appearance of cyberspace as one domain has transformed our world into a small village heralding globalization. Cyber, which is primarily based on the Internet, enabled the world to be interconnected so that any information from anywhere in the world can be accessed in seconds, enabled the connection between people not to be limited in space and time, availed a fast data exchange, fundamentally altered the lifestyle of a human being by changing the social, economic and political realities, and created a new chapter in the life of human being. Hence, it is now becoming a reality that it is not possible to remain out of cyberspace; without cyber, it is now almost impossible to survive as a sovereign country let alone become competent. A country and people that cannot be competent enough in cyberspace cannot maintain its sovereignty in its totality. Cyberspace is an arena of high-security threats and risks. Especially, as cyberspace is an arena engulfed with responsibilities of protecting the cyber sovereignty, ensuring the privacy of individuals, and of facing the paradox attached to the advancement in ICT, ensuring the security of this space is becoming the challenge of all nations. Thus, the countries of the world are giving attention to running the cyber security issues in parallel with the rapid development in ICT to exploit the economic, social, and political benefits and opportunities that the new space availed. Cyber security has become high on the agenda from technologically advanced to developing nations. Consequently, it is a challenging assignment for countries to ensure cyber security. As ensuring cyber security became the question of survival not that of a choice, international institutions and countries of the world are striving 24/7. As a result, many countries formulate policies to make sure that cyber security is ensured. Ethiopia, like any other country, is exploiting the opportunities and facing security challenges that are parallel to the fast-growing ICT infrastructure. In line with this, the country's limited resources, technology dependence and high vulnerability, low cyber security awareness, lack of expertise, and underdeveloped research work pose a security risk. 2 Therefore, to take full advantage of the opportunities the sector presents and to ensure its security, it is necessary to develop an up-to-date policy and strategy. As a result, this National Cyber Security Policy and Strategy (CSPS) is formulated by amending the previous National Information Security Policy that has been effective since 2011. 3 Part One Policy and Strategy Need, Vision, Mission, and Objectives 1.1. The Need for the NCSPS The NCSPS has been developed as it is deemed important because of the following reasons: 1. As the overall situation and behavior of cyber security has changed with the development of ICT, we have reached the point where it is progressively challenging to properly protect the sovereignty and security of a country. Consequently, Ethiopia is cognizant that it needs an up to date cyber security policy and strategy to protect the security of the complex, dynamic, unpredictable, and high-tech prone cyber, to be able to take advantage of the enormous opportunities that cyber brings with it, and to mitigate the risks therein; 2. As cyberspace is gaining a big share in Ethiopia's socio-cultural, political, economic, and security arena, and creating a tangible influence than ever before, it is important to set cyber security policy directions and strategies that consider the existing situation; 3. Due to the increased risks, vulnerabilities, and attacks to cyber security as the result of the expansion and digitalization of key infrastructures and systems by which the country's information is stored, analyzed, and disseminated; 4. For cyber security by its very nature is not the role and responsibility exclusive to government, there is a need to increase coordination and partnership between public and private institutions and other stakeholders; 5. Given the multifaceted potential of the private sector in cyber security as seen in the realities of the rest of the world and its growing involvement in key infrastructures in our country, it is necessary to administer the role of the private sector with that of the government institutions in a reasonable and complementary fashion; 6. Considering the apparent global cyber security threats and vulnerabilities, it is deemed necessary to know and use the up to date technologies, to establish legal and regulatory frameworks, to build research and development capacity, to raise awareness; and to state policy directions and strategies that take into account the existing and imminent cyber security threats, and to establish a monitoring and evaluation system; 4 1.2 Fundamental Assumptions 1. Government Leadership Commitment The government gives strategic directions for the coordinated distribution of resources and capacities needed for the proper implementation of the NCSPS. 2. Shared Responsibility As cyber security is the concern of multiple stakeholders, citizens, the government, the private sector, and other concerned bodies need to implement the NCSPS with shared responsibility and a strong sense of ownership, integration and collaboration. 3. The Rule of Law To ensure the constitutional rights, freedom, and equitable benefits of citizens; to create reliable cyberspace, and to guarantee that the task of ensuring cyber security and the rule of law among the highly interconnected cyber society is to be taken as a key role as it is a reality in the physical world. 4. International Cooperation and Partnership As cyber security threats, vulnerability and attacks have a cross-border nature, it requires building strong international cooperation and partnership. 5. Ethiopian Values This National Cyber Security Policy and Strategy will be implemented in a manner that respects the values of Ethiopians. 1.3 Vision To see a globally competent and resilient national cyber security capability; 1.4 Mission To protect national interests by building a self-reliant cyber security capability that enables to safeguard the country's information and key information infrastructure from cyber-attacks; 1.5 Objectives 1. To build resilient cyber security capability that monitor, detect and warn threats and vulnerability; and that prevent and give quick response to cyber attacks; 5 2. To enable cyber security to play a role in the protection of citizen's privacy, human rights, democratic rights, and in the assurance of sustainable peace and development in its process and end; 3. To establish strong national, regional, continental, and international partnership and collaboration on cyber security; 4. To build indigenous technological capabilities and deploy systems that sustain key infrastructure and information resources through the R&D which is up to the international standard; 5. To create an aware society that uses cyber with knowledge and reason through building a local cyber security culture; 1.6 Principles 1. Accountability All public and private institutions have the accountability to protect their information and information infrastructure and systems; to ensure the security of their cyber products and services. 2. Resilience It is incumbent to affirm cyber security by withstanding the challenges in cyberspace, by being resilient, and by remaining strong and more agile. 3. Sovereignty-Centric The country should make sure that its cyber sovereignty and national interests are intact in all its international cooperation, negotiations, and agreements in the field of cyber security. 4. Coordination and partnership As the task of ensuring cyber security requires the participation of all concerned bodies, the public and private institutions, and other stakeholders need to work in coordination and partnership. 5. Global Compliance Since the task of securing the cyber is practiced in a global space, it should be done by international laws, principles, and agreements. 6 6. Balancing privacy and security The NCSPS will be implemented by maintaining the balance between the protection of cyber security and the rights and privacy of individuals. 1.7 Scope of the NCSPS The NCSPS applies to all public, private and other institutions in the country and focuses on ensuring the security of the information, key information infrastructures and systems of these institutions, and safeguarding the security of any personal data of individuals. 7 Part Two Focus Areas and Strategies 2.1. Policy Issues It is becoming a challenging issue to maintain the sovereignty of states in the cyber world. Especially, in cyberspace that has a global nature, the cyber sovereignty of a state which has not built a competent capability will be under question in one way or another. This happens because of the reason that the leading states in cyber technology do not easily transfer the technology to other states and for the reason that the technology creates a convenient environment to put other states under their influence. As a result of this, those states which are lagging in technology will highly be vulnerable. On the other hand, as avoiding the cyber world is not an option, countries have become part of this globalization. Thus, in addition to building the technological capability in the area, countries strive to ensure cyber security through establishing a regulatory mechanism. The fact that Ethiopia is a developing country cannot immune it from the vulnerability that comes with cyber and cyber technology. Hence, it needs to set in place a regulatory mechanism in addition to advancing its cyber defense capability by arming itself with cyber security technology internally through research and development schemes or procurement. In this process, it needs to build a knowledge-based system by understanding the paradoxes in the cyber world. Therefore, considering the global and national cyber security reality on the ground, major policy issues have been identified. Accordingly, the NCSPS comprises seven major policy focus areas. These are Legal and Regulatory Framework, Awareness, Capacity Building, Research and Development, Digital Identity and Personal Data Protection, Key Information Infrastructure Protection, and International and National Cooperation. 2.2. Legal and Regulatory Framework 2.1.1.

National and International Cooperation 2.8.1. National Coordination and Partnership 2.8.1.1. Policy Statement Cyber security attacks are so complex, unpredictable, dynamic, and borderless that cannot be dealt with government or a limited number of institutions alone. Hence, establishing national coordination and partnership to ensure cyber security, and also tackling cyber security threats should be a shared responsibility of all stakeholders. In particular, the development of cyber security products and services requires the active participation of the private sector. The 19 private sector has been making progress in the country's information technology industry development. On the other hand, though the private sector can play a key role in accelerating the cyber security efforts of the country, as of now, the participation of the sector in the area is limited. To change this, the government encourages the involvement of the private sector in the development of the cyber security industry. Therefore, to ensure cyber security at the national level, the government mobilizes and makes use of national capacity and enhances the role of the private sector. To this end, it sets the following objectives and strategies and implements them. 2.8.1.2. Goals The goal of national coordination and partnership shall be: 1.

General Overview It is important to identify the role and responsibility of the concerned institutions, establish the necessary new structures, establish the monitoring and evaluation systems, and point out directions to implement this NCSPS. As cyber security is inherently complex and highly dynamic, it is difficult for any country to overcome the challenges alone. It is, therefore, important to work in collaboration and partnership with a variety of stakeholders. Hence, for the NCSPS to be effective, it requires the engagement of the government, the private sector, the educational and research institutions, the civil society organizations, and other national and international stakeholders. To this end, the government provides strategic leadership to implement the policy. 3.2. Institutional Structure To ensure cyber security in our country, it is necessary to create strong institutions and to strengthen the existing ones. Cognizant of this fact, the government has established INSA and Ethio-CER2T to protect and respond to cyber attacks targeting the country and its key infrastructures. To ensure cyber security, it is important to cooperate and work in partnership with various national institutions. To make this collaboration and partnership effective, National Cyber Security Council, which comprises the concerned government, private, and other stakeholders, will be established. The government may establish new institutions and task forces at the national and sectoral levels to facilitate the implementation of the policy and strategy, or assign additional responsibilities for existing institutions. To make the institutional structure helpful to the implementation of this NCSPS, it will be developed in a manner that takes into account the private sector. 3.3. Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders It is incumbent on all government institutions, on private sectors with key information infrastructures, and on other concerned stakeholders to implement this NCSPS. They also 24 have the responsibility for designing and implementing cyber security programs in consistence with this NCSPS and international standards. 3.4. Monitoring and Evaluation To measure the effectiveness of the NCSPS at all levels and to realize the execution process, a monitoring and evaluation system which includes the following key issues will be in place: 1. An action plan for the implementation of the policy and strategy will be prepared by INSA; the Cyber Security Council will play its role in the implementation. 2. A monitoring and evaluation system shall be established to ensure that public and private institutions and other stakeholders carry out the relevant activities specified in the NCSPS, perform activities listed in NCSP implementation frameworks, establish the necessary institutional structure, and allocate the required budget and resources; 3. For the implementation of NCSPS, data collection, organization, and analysis activities will be carried out and a reporting system will be established with coordination of INSA; 4. An annual stakeholders meeting will be organized by INSA to evaluate the implementation of the NCSPS; 5. Based on the results of NCSPS monitoring and evaluation, directions to develop other necessary frameworks and, if need be, to revise the NCSPS will be given. 3.5. Legal Issues 1. This NCSPS shall be implemented upon approval by the House of Representatives; 2. The NCSPS shall legally be binding on all parties directly or indirectly referred to in this document; 3. Legislation may be enacted to hold those who fail to implement this NCSPS accountable; 3.6. Financial Issues 1. The budget required to implement the NCSPS and to carry out other related activities shall mainly be allocated by the government; 2. The budget allocated for the implementation of the NCSPS shall be run following the monitoring and evaluation system set in the policy and strategy and by the decision of the body endowed with a legal responsibility to oversee the NCSPS. 25 3. Projects and programs designed to implement the policy goals, strategies, and tactics will be carried out in collaboration with the relevant bodies as needed; 3.7. Success Indicators 1. Stable socio-cultural, economic, and political conditions as a result of reduced cyber security risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks; 2. Developed Cyber security capacities and systems at the national, sectoral, and institutional levels; 3. The delivery of cyber security products and services through national capacity; 4. An aware society that uses the cyber safely; and a built national cyber security culture; 5. A built cyber security industry with the participation of the private sector; 6. The strengthened and tangible cyber security partnerships and collaborations at the international, regional, and national levels resulted in a contribution to the national interest. 3.8. Revision The NCSPS may be revised as the result of the impact that the political, economic, social, and technological changes in the country bring on the process of ensuring cyber security; when new needs arise with the development of the role and responsibilities of public and private institutions in the sector; as well as when the direction is given based on the findings of the NCSPS monitoring and evaluation. Based on the above-mentioned perspectives, the NCSPS will be revised in five years beginning from the date of ratification. By the direction set forward by the Cyber Security Council considering the findings of the monitoring and evaluation result, INSA takes the responsibility of revising the NCSPS.",

Particularly, the appearance of cyberspace as   one domain has transformed our world into a small village heralding globalization. Cyber,   which is primarily based on the Internet, enabled the world to be interconnected so that any   information from anywhere in the world can be accessed in seconds, enabled the connection   between people not to be limited in space and time, availed a fast data exchange,   fundamentally altered the lifestyle of a human being by changing the social, economic and   political realities, and created a new chapter in the life of human being.   Hence, it is now becoming a reality that it is not possible to remain out of cyberspace;   without cyber, it is now almost impossible to survive as a sovereign country let alone become   competent. A country and people that cannot be competent enough in cyberspace cannot   maintain its sovereignty in its totality.   Cyberspace is an arena of high-security threats and risks. Especially, as cyberspace is an   arena engulfed with responsibilities of protecting the cyber sovereignty, ensuring the privacy   of individuals, and of facing the paradox attached to the advancement in ICT, ensuring the   security of this space is becoming the challenge of all nations. Thus, the countries of the   world are giving attention to running the cyber security issues in parallel with the rapid   development in ICT to exploit the economic, social, and political benefits and opportunities   that the new space availed. Cyber security has become high on the agenda from   technologically advanced to developing nations.   Consequently, it is a challenging assignment for countries to ensure cyber security. As   ensuring cyber security became the question of survival not that of a choice, international   institutions and countries of the world are striving 24/7. As a result, many countries formulate   policies to make sure that cyber security is ensured.    Ethiopia, like any other country, is exploiting the opportunities and facing security challenges   that are parallel to the fast-growing ICT infrastructure. In line with this, the country's limited   resources, technology dependence and high vulnerability, low cyber security awareness, lack   of expertise, and underdeveloped research work pose a security risk.           2     Therefore, to take full advantage of the opportunities the sector presents and to ensure its   security, it is necessary to develop an up-to-date policy and strategy. As a result, this National   Cyber Security Policy and Strategy (CSPS) is formulated by amending the previous National   Information Security Policy that has been effective since 2011.                3     Part One   Policy and Strategy Need, Vision, Mission, and Objectives  1.1. The Need for the NCSPS    The NCSPS has been developed as it is deemed important because of the following reasons:    1. As the overall situation and behavior of cyber security has changed with the development   of ICT, we have reached the point where it is progressively challenging to properly   protect the sovereignty and security of a country. Consequently, Ethiopia is cognizant that   it needs an up to date cyber security policy and strategy to protect the security of the   complex, dynamic, unpredictable, and high-tech prone cyber,  to be able to  take   advantage of the enormous opportunities that cyber brings with it, and to mitigate the   risks therein;   2. As cyberspace is gaining a big share in Ethiopia's socio-cultural, political, economic, and   security arena, and creating a tangible influence than ever before, it is important to set   cyber security policy directions and strategies that consider the existing situation;   3. Due to the increased risks, vulnerabilities, and attacks to cyber security as the result of the   expansion and digitalization of key infrastructures and systems by which the country's   information is stored, analyzed, and disseminated;   4. For cyber security by its very nature is not the role and responsibility exclusive to   government, there is a need to increase coordination and partnership between public and   private institutions and other stakeholders;   5. Given the multifaceted potential of the private sector in cyber security as seen in the   realities of the rest of the world and its growing involvement in key infrastructures in our   country, it is necessary to administer the role of the private sector with that of the   government institutions in a reasonable and complementary fashion;   6. Considering the apparent global cyber security threats and vulnerabilities, it is deemed   necessary to know and use the up to date technologies, to establish legal and regulatory   frameworks, to build research and development capacity, to raise awareness; and to  state   policy directions and strategies that take into account the existing and imminent cyber   security threats, and  to establish a monitoring and evaluation system;           4     1.2   Fundamental Assumptions    1. Government Leadership Commitment    The government gives strategic directions for the coordinated distribution of resources and   capacities needed for the proper implementation of the NCSPS.   2. Shared Responsibility   As cyber security is the concern of multiple stakeholders, citizens, the government, the   private sector, and other concerned bodies need to implement the NCSPS with shared   responsibility and a strong sense of ownership, integration and collaboration.    3. The Rule of Law   To ensure the constitutional rights, freedom, and equitable benefits of citizens; to create   reliable cyberspace, and to guarantee that the task of ensuring cyber security and the rule of   law among the highly interconnected cyber society is to be taken as a key role as it is a reality   in the physical world.   4. International Cooperation and Partnership   As cyber security threats, vulnerability and attacks have a cross-border nature, it requires   building strong international cooperation and partnership.   5. Ethiopian Values   This National Cyber Security Policy and Strategy will be implemented in a manner that   respects the values of  Ethiopians.     1.3    Vision   To see a globally competent and resilient national cyber security capability;   1.4    Mission   To protect national interests by building a self-reliant cyber security capability that enables to   safeguard the country's information and key information infrastructure from cyber-attacks;   1.5    Objectives  1. To build resilient cyber security capability that monitor, detect and warn threats and   vulnerability;  and that prevent and give quick response to cyber attacks;        5     2. To enable cyber security to play a role in the protection of citizen's privacy, human   rights, democratic rights, and in the  assurance of sustainable peace and development   in its process and end;   3. To establish  strong national, regional, continental, and international partnership and   collaboration on cyber security;   4. To build indigenous technological capabilities and deploy systems that sustain key   infrastructure and information resources through the  R&D which is up to the   international standard;   5. To create an aware society that uses cyber with knowledge and reason through   building a local cyber security culture;   1.6   Principles   1. Accountability   All public and private institutions have the accountability to protect their information and   information infrastructure and systems; to ensure the security of their cyber products and   services.    2. Resilience    It is incumbent to affirm cyber security by withstanding the challenges in cyberspace, by   being resilient, and by remaining strong and more agile.   3. Sovereignty-Centric   The country should make sure that its cyber sovereignty and national interests are intact in all   its international cooperation, negotiations, and agreements in the field of cyber security.   4. Coordination and partnership   As the task of ensuring cyber security requires the participation of all concerned bodies, the   public and private institutions, and other stakeholders need to work in coordination and   partnership.    5. Global Compliance    Since the task of securing the cyber is practiced in a global space, it should be done by   international laws, principles, and agreements.           6        6. Balancing privacy and security   The NCSPS will be implemented by maintaining the balance between the protection of   cyber security and the rights and privacy of individuals.    1.7  Scope of the NCSPS   The NCSPS applies to all public,  private and other institutions in the country and focuses on   ensuring the security of the information,  key information infrastructures and systems of these   institutions, and safeguarding the security of any personal data of individuals.                                                           7     Part Two   Focus Areas and Strategies   2.1. Policy Issues   It is becoming a challenging issue to maintain the sovereignty of states in the cyber world.   Especially, in cyberspace that has a global nature, the cyber sovereignty of a state which has   not built a competent capability will be under question in one way or another. This happens   because of the reason that the leading states in cyber technology do not easily transfer the   technology to other states and for the reason that the technology creates a convenient   environment to put other states under their influence. As a result of this, those states which   are lagging in technology will highly be vulnerable. On the other hand, as avoiding the cyber   world is not an option, countries have become part of this globalization. Thus, in addition to   building the technological capability in the area, countries strive to ensure cyber security   through establishing a regulatory mechanism.   The fact that Ethiopia is a  developing country cannot immune it from the vulnerability that   comes with cyber and cyber technology. Hence, it needs to set in place a regulatory   mechanism in addition to advancing its cyber defense capability by arming itself with cyber   security technology internally through research and development schemes or procurement. In   this process, it needs to build a knowledge-based system by understanding the paradoxes in   the cyber world. Therefore, considering the global and national cyber security reality on the   ground, major policy issues have been identified.   Accordingly, the NCSPS comprises seven major policy focus areas. These are Legal and   Regulatory Framework, Awareness, Capacity Building, Research and Development, Digital   Identity and Personal Data Protection, Key Information Infrastructure Protection, and   International and National Cooperation.   2.2. Legal and Regulatory Framework   2.1.1. Policy Statement   It is important to develop and implement up-to-date legal and regulatory frameworks that are   consistent with the reality on the ground to reduce the progressively increasing cyber security   vulnerability and threat, defend against attacks, and hold perpetrators accountable.        8     Therefore, it is important to develop and implement cyber security laws, policies, strategies,   standards, and other frameworks to prevent cybercrime, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage,   and other illegal activities in the country. Thus, the following legal and regulatory objectives,   strategies, and tactics are designed and to be implemented.   2.1.2. Goals    The goal of the legal and regulatory framework shall be:    1. Developing and continuously revising cyber security legal and regulatory frameworks   that are consistent with international laws and standards adopted by the country and   making continuous improvements to them;   2. Building the capacity of law enforcement entities to prevent cybercrime, cyber terrorism,   cyber espionage, and other illegal activities;   3.

Capacity Building on Cyber Security    2.4.1. Policy Statement   The lack of trained human resources and lack of strong cyber security systems and   institutional structures in our country has contributed to the cyber security capacity being at a   low level. As a result, citizens, government, and private institutions became vulnerable to        11     various forms of attacks and deprived of reaping the benefits cyberspace provides   sufficiently.    Therefore, as the ability of the government to be able to build a strong cyber security   capability has a significant contribution to the economical,  political, and social development,   and transformation of the country, the government has set out the following objectives,   strategies, and tactics to build a strong cyber security culture among the community, to   expand education and training programs, to build institutional capacity and establish working   systems, and to build resilient and flexible cyber security capabilities at the national level.   2.4.2.

General Overview   It is important to identify the role and responsibility of the concerned institutions, establish   the necessary new structures, establish the monitoring and evaluation systems, and point out   directions to implement this NCSPS. As cyber security is inherently complex and highly   dynamic, it is difficult for any country to overcome the challenges alone. It is, therefore,    important to work in collaboration and partnership with a variety of stakeholders. Hence, for   the NCSPS to be effective, it requires the engagement of the government, the private sector,   the educational and research institutions, the civil society organizations, and other national   and international stakeholders. To this end, the government provides strategic leadership to   implement the policy.   3.2.  Institutional Structure   To ensure cyber security in our country, it is necessary to create strong institutions and to   strengthen the existing ones. Cognizant of this fact, the government has established INSA and    Ethio-CER2T to protect and respond to cyber attacks targeting the country and its key   infrastructures.    To ensure cyber security, it is important to cooperate and work in partnership with various   national institutions.  To make this collaboration and partnership effective, National Cyber   Security Council, which comprises the concerned government, private, and other   stakeholders, will be established. The government may establish new institutions and task   forces at the national and sectoral levels to facilitate the implementation of the policy and   strategy, or assign additional responsibilities for existing institutions. To make the   institutional structure helpful to the implementation of this NCSPS, it will be developed in a   manner that takes into account the private sector.    3.3.  Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders   It is incumbent on all government institutions, on private sectors with key information   infrastructures,  and on other concerned stakeholders to implement this NCSPS.  They also        24     have the responsibility for designing and implementing cyber security programs in   consistence with this NCSPS and international standards.    3.4.  Monitoring and Evaluation    To measure the effectiveness of the NCSPS at all levels and to realize the execution process,   a monitoring and evaluation system which includes the following key issues will be in place:    1. An action plan for the implementation of the policy and strategy will be prepared by   INSA; the  Cyber Security Council will play its role in the implementation.   2. A monitoring and evaluation system shall be established to ensure that public and   private institutions and other stakeholders carry out the relevant activities specified in   the NCSPS, perform activities listed in NCSP implementation frameworks, establish   the necessary institutional structure, and allocate the required budget and resources;   3. For the implementation of NCSPS, data collection, organization, and analysis   activities will be carried out and a reporting system will be established with   coordination of INSA;   4. An annual stakeholders meeting will be organized by INSA to evaluate the   implementation of the NCSPS;   5. Based on the results of NCSPS monitoring and evaluation, directions to develop other   necessary frameworks and,  if need be,  to revise the NCSPS will be given.    3.5.  Legal Issues    1. This NCSPS shall be implemented upon approval by the House of Representatives;   2. The NCSPS shall legally be binding on all parties directly or indirectly referred to in   this document;   3. Legislation may be enacted to hold those who fail to implement this NCSPS   accountable;    3.6.  Financial Issues    1. The budget required to implement the NCSPS and to carry out other related activities   shall mainly be allocated by the government;   2. The budget allocated for the implementation of the NCSPS shall be run following the   monitoring and evaluation system set in the policy and strategy and by the decision of   the body endowed with a legal responsibility to oversee the NCSPS.        25     3. Projects and programs designed to implement the policy goals, strategies, and tactics   will be carried out in collaboration with the relevant bodies as needed;   3.7. Success Indicators    1. Stable socio-cultural, economic, and political conditions as a result of reduced   cyber security risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks;   2. Developed Cyber security capacities and systems at the national, sectoral, and   institutional levels;   3. The delivery of cyber security products and services through national capacity;   4. An aware society that uses the cyber safely; and a built national cyber security    culture;   5. A built cyber security industry with the participation of the private sector;    6. The strengthened and tangible cyber security partnerships and collaborations at   the international, regional, and national levels resulted in a contribution to the   national interest.    3.8. Revision    The NCSPS may be revised as the result of the impact that the political, economic, social,   and technological changes in the country bring on the process of ensuring cyber security;   when new needs arise with the development of the role and responsibilities of public and   private institutions in the sector; as well as when the direction is given based on the findings   of the NCSPS monitoring and evaluation. Based on the above-mentioned perspectives, the   NCSPS will be revised in five years beginning from the date of ratification. By the direction   set forward by the Cyber Security Council considering the findings of the monitoring and   evaluation result, INSA takes the responsibility of revising the NCSPS.",

We live and work online. In many respects this makes our lives easier, and the economic advantages are obvi- ous. It’s important that companies and the public can enjoy the full benefit of our digital society and eco- nomy, and for that, security is vital. Security in the digital world, however, still lags far behind that in the physical world. Anyone buying a car knows that it meets all kinds of safety and quality requirements. And the buyer knows exactly what they are expected to do in order to drive the vehicle: hold a valid driving licence, refrain from drinking alcohol and undergo an annual vehicle test. Things are very different in the digital world. In the design of many digital systems, security is still not the main priority. For decades, responsibility for that security has rested with end users, such as individual consumers and small businesses and organisations. But many of those end users are in practice comple- tely unable to meet that responsibility. They do not know, for example, how to update a Wi-Fi router, and they struggle with system security, privacy require- ments, and so on. Meanwhile, the risks keep growing. As a highly deve- loped society, the Netherlands is rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digital systems. But even in more mature organisations, tech companies and government organisations, system security depends on the actions of individuals. Whole systems may go down if one employee opens a phishing email or fails to install the right security. The government believes that the one-sided focus on individual responsibility is a dead-end street, and has chosen to take a different route to a digitally secure ecosystem. On behalf of the government I am there- fore presenting a new cybersecurity strategy which contains the following priorities: 1. Understanding the threat. The government will invest in people and systems that provide a clearer picture of the origin of threats and whom they are directed at. 2. More cybersecurity specialists. We will take vari- ous measures to bring more ICT specialists to the labour market. 3. Government and sectors taking responsibility. Responsibility for security will be transferred in part from end users to the government and speci- fic sectors. The most mature and most key organisations will bear the greatest responsibili- ties. Robust government-wide statutory security requirements will be arranged, together with com- pliance monitoring. 4. Better supervision and the necessary legislation. Reorganising responsibilities requires an expan- sion of statutory rules and supervision. Security must become the basis on which new systems are founded. New rules will be introduced for central and subnational government authorities, critical providers and suppliers of digital products and ser- vices. Cover photo: Nowadays we are online more than ever. In 2021 there were no fewer than 17 million mobile connections in the Netherlands. Almost 96% of these connections was for a smartphone, 90% of which were also used to access the internet. Over 15 million people have one or more social media accounts. The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS) is the result of a broad partnership between public, private and civil society organisations, coordinated by the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Secu- rity (NCTV). The pillars and aims set out in the Strategy are based on the Cybersecurity Threat Assessment for the Netherlands (CSBN) Table of contents | 54 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Table of contents Introduction and context 7 Cooperation in the cybersecurity domain 9 1.

Clear information via a national cyber authority. A new central cyber authority will be established in the Netherlands: the national Cybersecurity Inci- dent Response Team. This new organisation will collaborate with public and private partners to provide critical and non-critical organisations, government authorities and the public with infor- mation relating to cyber incidents (or potential incidents) to enable them to protect themselves. This strategy sets out the government’s ambitions for the next six years. In the first phase, we will be inves- ting heavily in the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) and the Defence Intelligence and Secu- rity Service (MIVD), in the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and in reinforcing the Netherlands’ nationwide network of cybersecurity partnerships (LDS) that provide organisations with security advice, and in strengthening the cyber resilience of specific sectors. This is a shared responsibility of all parties in the cyber domain, and one that requires targeted public- private cooperation. I am therefore most grateful to all the public bodies, private parties and academic institutions – especially the members of the Cyber Security Council – that contributed to the development of this strategy. Keep up the good work as we move forward with implementation! Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, Minister of Justice and Security Introduction and context In producing the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS), the government’s aim is to achieve a digitally secure Netherlands. That will enable us as a country to capitalise safely on the economic and social opportunities presented by digitalisation and, at the same time, to safeguard our security and public values. The Netherlands is one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. Increasingly, we are working, shopping and meeting each other online. Digital systems now form the ‘central nervous system’ of our society. That presents society with countless opportunities, but it also poses risks. butes to the digital resilience of the system as a whole. This is the great challenge for the coming years. The digital ecosystem is now so interconnected and com- plex that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for individual organisations and people to fathom it completely, while it is precisely this ecosystem that powers our modern way of life, our economy and society as a whole. Criminals and malicious states take advantage of this complexity by lurking in the shadows and exploiting digital vulnerabilities to attack our public values. Against this backdrop, the government observes that the increased importance and complexity of the digi- tal ecosystem are no longer commensurate with the autonomous way in which the cyber landscape has evolved in recent years. The ecosystem therefore needs to be adapted to the new reality. In the current system, a single phishing email or lost password can have a huge impact. This is because part of the res- ponsibility for risk management for an entire ecosystem, including critical sectors and processes, lies with the least digitally mature participants: indi- viduals, small businesses and local authorities. Many of the more mature organisations, tech companies Introduction and context | 76 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Recent history has shown that cyber incidents, such as ransomware attacks, are now commonplace occurrences. As a result, cybersecurity is now largely perceived from the point of view of the threat, and thus in terms of risks. Which hackers need to be stop- ped? What vulnerabilities need to be patched? How can information about cyber threats be shared more quickly and more efficiently? How can organised cybercrime, such as ransomware attacks, be tackled effectively? How can potential victims be notified in time (provided the necessary information is availa- ble)? These are just some of the many relevant challenges which need to be overcome and which form part of this strategy. We must not forget, however, that the ultimate objective is to safeguard our public values. We want to create an open, free, stable and secure digital world in which companies and individuals can partici- pate as securely as in the physical world. Cybersecurity is an investment in our future and must not simply be regarded as an expense. To achieve this, we must realise that each element of the digital ecosystem, be it specific technology, an organisation, an information system, a digital product or a person, forms part of a globally interconnected network. The cybersecurity of all those individual elements contri- Increasing digitalisation provides the world of education with many opportunities, such as offering online lectures and unlocking vast reserves of knowledge. At the same time, this increased dependence on technology entails risks. In recent years, various universities have been the targets of ransomware attacks. Introduction and context | 9 and government organisations are working towards a more secure and stable internet, but at the same time implicitly assume that individuals are capable of deci- ding what security they should install and know how to use a password manager. It goes without saying that cyber hygiene is and will remain an essential issue for everyone, but from a systemic perspective this will not be enough to guarantee the continued resilience of our digital interests. The government has a duty to ensure that the ecosystem contributes to and serves our public values, and meets the cyberse- curity requirements within it. Many digital systems, services and processes were not designed on the basis of cybersecurity and risk management (i.e. on the basis of security by design and security by default). This means that end users are responsible for keeping our systems digitally secure. In other sectors, ecosystems have evolved over the years into a balanced composition of instru- ments, such as statutory security requirements, certifications, warranties and mandatory training. Similar structures will eventually be created for the cybersecurity of digital products and services too. The government is therefore committed to streng- thening and transforming the digital ecosystem so that no single organisation or individual can be the weakest link any more. This requires a reorganisation of the responsibilities of all players in the ecosystem, so that the relevant rights and obligations are alloca- ted to the right parties. To achieve this, we need to deploy a well-balanced combination of instruments, from more intensive public-private partnerships to new legislation, designed to create an ecosystem in which businesses and the public can in principle pur- chase secure products and services. In the context of the European digital single market and the pursuit of a level playing field and secure internet-of-things products and services, the govern- ment is concentrating its efforts on the development of European legislation. Various legal measures have now been taken and initiatives launched to make this happen. We will eventually need to arrive at a situation in which every party involved in the digital ecosystem has a clear understanding of their contribution to the security and stability of the whole. This requires a system transformation. No single party can do this alone, not even the government. It will be a joint effort in which all parties contribute to the transfor- mation. And that will require obligations and commitments. Cybersecurity will always be a respon- sibility shared among those who build our digital infrastructure, those who manage it and those who use it. This requires collaboration as well as robust coordination to achieve cohesion of effort and ensure that those efforts ultimately amount to more than the sum of their parts. In this strategy, the government sets out its vision of a digitally secure Netherlands, where companies and the public can benefit fully from participation in the digital society, without having to worry about cyber risks. That is the ultimate goal. For some themes, achieving this vision will span multiple government terms or even remain an ongoing pursuit. The government will use the strategic aims and the action plan to set out how it will advance the achievement of this vision over the coming years. Phasing, prioriti- sation and decision-making will be necessary, as achieving a digitally secure Netherlands will take years. Not all ambitions will be realised in the short or medium term. In cases where additional resources are required, the government will opt at this stage for structural investment in the AIVD and the MIVD with a view to getting a better handle on the threat. Resources will also be made available to boost the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships, partly through the further development of the NCSC into a national CSIRT, and partly through the centra- lisation of government organisations in the chain wherever possible and in the public interest. Lastly, resources will be provided for ministries with major sectoral challenges to enable them to boost cyber resilience in the sectors concerned. Generally spea- king, there is sufficient funding for the implementation of the actions set out in the action plan. If, however, there is a need for follow-up steps 8 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 or supplementary processes, legislative or otherwise, as a result of the actions, additional resources will need to be found. The appendices contain a more detailed explanation of the financial basis for this strategy. This strategy will also show what can be expected from the government in concrete terms, as well as what it is accountable for. Cooperation in the cybersecurity domain The strategy has been produced with the extensive involvement of many public, private and civil society organisations, and builds on previous government- wide cybersecurity strategies published in 2011, 2013 and 2018. All ministries are working together and with public and private partners to set out and imple- ment the strategy. The Minister of Justice and Security is the coordinating minister for cybersecurity, is responsible for tackling cybercrime, and is in charge of implementing this strategy and monitoring the process. However, each party retains its own tasks and responsibilities for achieving the cybersecurity goals. Lastly, the strategy is closely aligned with the government’s efforts in the area of digitalisation, which are led by the State Secretary for Kingdom Relations and Digitalisation, as set out in the framework letter of 8 March 2022 on this subject.1 Cybersecurity: the full spectrum of measures designed to reduce relevant cyber risks to an acceptable level. This also includes dealing with risks of damage to or failure of digital systems and the availability, integrity and confidentiality of data. Measures may focus on the prevention of cyber incidents and – if a cyber incident does occur – on detection, damage limitation and recovery. What constitutes an acceptable level of risk will be determined in a risk assessment.2 Cyber resilience: the ability to reduce relevant risks to an acceptable level by means of a set of measures to prevent cyber incidents and, if they do occur, to detect them, limit the damage and facilitate recovery. What constitutes an accepta- ble level of resilience is determined by a risk assessment. This can help with the selection of the right technical, procedural or organisational measures.3 Cybercrime prevention: efforts to prevent crime in which a computer system is attacked or mis- used for the purpose of criminal activity. Cybercrime prevention is an integral part of the cybersecurity approach. 10 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Cyber risks have not diminished Within the broad domain of digitalisation, the central goal is to achieve a secure, inclusive digital society with a wealth of opportunities for all Dutch people. The importance of digital processes is growing because of technological developments and far-rea- ching digitalisation. For that digital transformation to succeed, cybersecurity is an essential requirement.4 Digital processes are the central nervous system of society and the economy: they cannot function pro- perly without them. Digital security is thus inextricably linked to six national security interests: territorial security, physical security, economic secu- rity, ecological security, social and political stability and the international legal order.5 An attack on critical processes, such as electricity or drinking water sup- plies, shipping or financial transactions, could bring society to a temporary or even enduring standstill. Figure 1: Cyber risks are determined by the relationship between interests, threats to those interests and resilience in the face of such threats The digital threat is here to stay and is more likely to increase than to diminish, with all the repercussions that entails. The threat could be posed either by a cyberattack or a digital system failure. Such a failure could be the result of natural or technical causes, or the result of human error. State actors and cybercri- minals constitute the main threat in terms of malicious actions, and are not always distinguishable from each other because of their interwoven relati- ons. State actors may hire, allow or pressurise cybercriminals to perpetrate cyberattacks on desig- nated targets.6 Cyberattacks by state actors are no longer unusual. National cybersecurity task | 11 1. National cybersecurity task This chapter gives an overview of current and future challenges in relation to cybersecurity, which form the basis for the pillars and aims of the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy. In order to produce a widely supported strategy, parties with a major cybersecurity role, both within and outside government, were involved at various stages. Interests Threats Resilience Risks The Port of Rotterdam has one of the Netherlands’ most advanced ICT systems, comprising a dedicated infrastructure designed to connect terminals, depots and distribution centres. This makes it possible to see exactly where a container is located at any given time. But it also creates a great deal of interdependence. This became all too clear in 2019, when a hacker attack on shipping giant Maersk’s systems completely paralysed all container transport. Market dynamics complicate cyber risk management. Supply and demand for digital services, hardware (and components), software and networks converge on digital markets. These markets have a number of unique characteristics, such as the semi-monopolistic status of certain suppliers, the high level of interdependence and the focus on gathering as much data as possible. Moreover, incentives for digital security are not always the overriding concern in these markets. These factors complicate risk management for individuals, organisations, sectors and countries alike. Coordinated and integrated risk management is still in its infancy. Coordinated and integrated risk management within and between the organisational, sectoral and national levels is still in its infancy. Cyber risks have not yet been given a definitive place in broader risk management within and between these levels. Risk management is not yet a given, even though a risk- based approach plays a big role in determining and achieving the desired level of resilience. Of course, many organisations do have the appropriate risk management in place, but in many cases it is not embedded in organisations’ primary process.9 There is also an overarching theme that affects all the others: restrictions in digital autonomy also limit cyber resilience.10 European countries, including the Nether- lands, are subject to restrictions in digital autonomy. That autonomy includes the Netherlands’ ability and means to make independent choices about ongoing digitalisation, as well as the desired level of cyber resilience. This autonomy is restricted by various fac- tors, which relate to the strategic themes referred to above; they limit the options for influencing and making decisions about the country’s cyber resilience, and they reduce the country’s control over that resilience. Despite their diverse nature, each of these themes, both separately and in association, illustrates the complications for strategic risk management. Need for an integrated approach to cyber resilience Over the past few years, various authoritative organi- sations have issued recommendations to the government on the subject of cybersecurity and on how to boost cyber resilience. These recommendati- ons, in addition to the strategic themes listed above, were taken into account in the creation of this stra- tegy. A wide-ranging group of stakeholders was also asked – by means of a questionnaire and in work ses- sions11– to identify further challenges.12 This resulted in the following key additional insights which have been incorporated in this strategy. • There is a growing ‘cyber resilience gap’ between organisations. Some organisations have their cybersecurity in order, but others do not. • Demand for cybersecurity expertise is expected to continue rising, leading to a shortfall of qualified personnel. • It has been observed that responsibilities in the Dutch cybersecurity system are not currently clearly allocated or clearly defined, which obstructs effective cooperation. • In recent years, information-sharing has been found to be fragmented, and as a result threat information has not always reached all organisati- ons in time to enable them to take the necessary measures. • Organisations have limited oversight of the risks of and damage resulting from failure of digital sys- tems and there is a lack of data on the scale of damage caused by technical faults or human error. • The practice of learning from incidents in cyberspace is still in development. • There is still too little scientific cybersecurity know- ledge and innovation reaching the market. • The development of international norms surroun- ding cybersecurity is challenging, and the formulation, adoption and implementation of international norms for state responsibility are proceeding slowly. National cybersecurity task | 13 State actors can use a broad range of digital resour- ces for this purpose: influencing and interference (including the dissemination of disinformation); espionage, including economic and political espio- nage; preparatory action for attacks and actual disruption and sabotage. According to the AIVD, the threat of offensive cyber programmes against the Netherlands and against Dutch interests remains high and will only increase in the future.7 Cybercriminals are also still capable of inflicting serious damage on digital processes. They are motivated by money and are not intent on disrupting society, but their attacks can nonetheless have such an impact that they adver- sely affect national interests. The threat posed by hacktivists is relatively low, but could affect Dutch interests indirectly. In recent years it has become clear that the level of cyber resilience in the Netherlands is insufficient.8 Despite efforts to boost resilience, there is a disparity between the growing threat and the development of resilience. Complete imperviousness to cyber threats is impossible, but boosting resilience to system failu- res and misuse is the most important tool for managing cyber risks. Cyber resilience is not yet at the desired level across the board because basic mea- sures have not been sufficiently implemented. There are major differences in resilience levels within and between sectors and supply chains. Complications of risk management pose a threat to society The 2022 Cybersecurity Assessment for the Netherlands (CSBN2022) includes strategic themes which have been identified in collaboration with part- ners and which are relevant for the Netherlands’ digital security, now and in the future: Risks are the downside of a digital society. Dutch society is highly digitised. That has a downside: reliance on digi- tal processes has made us vulnerable to system failures and to the activities of those with malicious intent. Chain reactions can affect entire sectors or even society as a whole. The disruption of digital processes can also have physical consequences. Cyberspace is an arena for regional and global dominance. Digital security is closely linked to geopolitics. States are using cyberspace constantly and intensively to pro- mote their own geopolitical interests. Cyberattacks, such as those used to gather political and economic intelligence, are an important instrument in that res- pect; they are relatively inexpensive and scalable, and they have a significant, often long-term impact. Even the ultimate form of geopolitical conflict – war – invol- ves cyberattacks. Attribution is also a difficult issue. Individuals, organisations, sectors and countries can do little to influence these geopolitical rivalries, even though they serve to heighten the risks. Cybercrime is industrially scalable, while resilience – for now – is not. Serious, organised cybercrime has become highly scalable and has thus taken on industrial pro- portions in recent years in terms of victims, damage and criminal proceeds. Ransomware has proved to be a gamechanger in this regard. Serious cybercriminals and their service providers are primarily motivated by money and aim for maximum profit, happily exploi- ting the opportunities offered by cyberspace. Given the nature and growing scale of the cybercrime threat, the task of making and keeping the chain of resilience scalable will be a fundamental challenge in the years ahead. 12 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 National cybersecurity task | 15 • Awareness among small organisations and the public of the need to protect themselves against cyber threats is still too limited. An integrated approach to cybersecurity is required to overcome these challenges. will allow information to be shared ever more widely, efficiently and effectively between organisations resulting in better provision of information to their target groups. • In 2020 the Cyber Intel/Info Cell (CIIC) was established. This is a body in which the AIVD, the MIVD, the NCSC, the Public Prosecution Service and the National Police assemble threat information, and staff from these orga- nisations evaluate the information jointly. This makes it possible to both form a picture of new threats and offer organisations poten- tial courses of action more rapidly. • The National Detection Network has been expanded in recent years, enabling steps to be taken in the detection and monitoring of threats within central government and critical infrastructure. • The new dcypher platform was officially laun- ched in 2021. Dcypher is the place where public, private and knowledge-based stake- holders, resources and expertise converge to ensure effective engagement in cybersecurity education, research, innovation and concrete applications. 14 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Looking back on enhancing cyber resilience under the National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA) • The Network and Information Systems (Secu- rity) Act (WBNI) came into force in 2018. Among other things, it provides that operators of essential services and digital ser- vice providers are obliged to take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisatio- nal measures in relation to cybersecurity. • The Digital Trust Centre (DTC) was also set up in 2018 so that non-critical companies too had a point of contact for cybersecurity issues. The DTC provides information and advice and encourages the establishment of cybersecurity partnerships. • With the bill on promoting cybersecurity in the business sector and the establishment of an information service, the DTC made a start on receiving and sharing information about digital threats and risks with companies. • The Civil Service Strategic Information Agenda 2019-2021 focused on strengthening the government-wide information-security pillar. • Setting up and strengthening a nationwide system of cybersecurity partnerships (LDS) The end of the Dutch public transport smart card is in sight. Soon it will be possible to check in with your debit or credit card or smartphone when boarding a train, bus or tram, which should make both travel and payments more convenient. An innovation of this scale is quite an undertaking: more than 60,000 entry gates and card readers need to be modified. Vision In the future, society will be fully digitised: our way of life is already closely interwoven with cyberspace. The risk of abuses, such as those perpetrated by state or criminal actors, or of process failures, form the downside of this digital society. Cyber resilience, including combating cybercrime, is essential for society and the economy to function. It is not simply a cost; it is a profitable investment. Cyber resilience offers competitive advantages and boosts the invest- ment climate, innovation and employment. By producing this strategy, the government is working towards a future in which the imbalance between the cyber threat and cyber resilience is kept to a minimum. In this vision of the future, cybersecu- rity is at a level commensurate with the threat and with the importance of ensuring the continuity, inte- grity and reliability of digital systems and processes. Cyber threats will also be identified and dealt with. Lastly, society will be resilient: there will be sufficient redundancy and recovery capability to absorb the repercussions of cyber threats, such as a system fai- lure. The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone | 17 2. The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone The vision underlying the strategy describes what a digitally secure Netherlands should look like in the future. That is our ultimate goal. 6. In respect of countering cyber threats posed by state actors and criminals: a. The underlying strategic choice with regard to tackling cybercrime consists of two ele- ments: efforts involving the investigation, prosecution and disruption of cybercrimin- als, and efforts involving the prevention of cybercrime.14 7. Cyber risks for members of the public will be minimised by largely removing responsibilities for the security of digital products and services from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals, and placing them with government, manufacturers and service sup- pliers. Members of the public and SMEs will thus be relieved of this burden. 8. The government will use objective criteria to manage the distribution of scarce cybersecu- rity and ICT expertise in a crisis, as part of the National Crisis Plan for Digital Incidents. The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone | 19 Underlying strategic choices 1. In respect of the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships: a. There will be a single national CSIRT, which will incorporate the NCSC, DTC and CSIRT- DSP. This will be the central cyber authority of the Netherlands.13 b. The government will lead and coordinate this process. That means centralised where possible, decentralised/sectoral where necessary. c. More coordination of development of the nationwide network on the basis of added value and desired effect; d. The government will collaborate and ope- rate decisively. Up-to-date knowledge and information about cyber threats, incidents, trends and vulnerabilities must be made available to partners in the nationwide net- work (LDS) to enable them to take action. The government will take the lead in this regard. e. Information-sharing will be based on possi- ble courses of action. There will be differentiation in advice and information and information-sharing, appropriate to organisations’ level of maturity and in com- prehensible language. f. ‘Large helps small’: nationwide network partners are responsible for supplying and picking up information and thus can help boost resilience within their respective chains and sectors. g. There are clear points of contact within the nationwide network, and solutions for gaps relating to the points above will be sought with private parties. 2. It should be possible to alert anyone in the Netherlands who is a (potential) victim or target of a cyberattack. 3. In respect of legislation: a. European legislation where possible, sup- plementary national legislation where necessary. b. New legislation will form the framework in which the system can operate effectively and coherently. c. Regulate market failures in relation to secu- rity through legislation. d. Cybersecurity measures and requirements are proportionate and are differentiated according to the interest a company repre- sents and its level of maturity. Life will be made as easy as possible for SMEs. e. Robust, government-wide statutory secu- rity requirements and compliance monitoring will be arranged. 4. In respect of collaboration: a. Public-private where possible, public where necessary. b. No more commitment-free partnerships. Collaboration is voluntary but not free of obligation. c. ‘Large helps small’ – the strongest/most mature organisations help the less strong/mature organisations (public-public, public-private and private-private). 5. In respect of knowledge and innovation: a. Through the collaboration platform dcypher and via thematic roadmaps and communi- ties, the government will foster discussions between knowledge institutions and the business community regarding the high- end knowledge development needed to generate innovative knowledge and product development. Dcypher can play a facilitating and driving role in the quest for funding for that development. 18 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Public values are key In cyberspace, public values and fundamental rights need to be safeguarded at all times. This includes res- ponsible use of data and responsible behaviour in the digital domain by government organisations. When exercising powers in the interests of national and international digital security, careful consideration must always be given to the balance between collec- tive security on the one hand and individual fundamental rights and public values on the other. Statutory requirements, such as proportionality and subsidiarity, must take precedence when it comes to guaranteeing public values such as privacy, security and non-discrimination. Role and responsibility of central government People should be able to expect the same security in cyberspace as in the physical domain. Cyber risks for members of the public will be minimised by largely removing responsibilities for the security of digital products and services from individuals and placing them with suppliers and manufacturers. People should also be able to count on reliable ser- vice provision by companies and public authorities in cyberspace. Central government is responsible for creating a system in which organisations can take appropriate measures to strengthen their cyber resi- lience and thus guarantee the continuity and reliability of their services. Central government does this by raising awareness, providing information and giving clear and consistent advice on risk management, implementing resilience measures, preparing for incidents and, if necessary, providing support. The level of intervention is determined by the risk to which organisations are exposed, by the organisation’s level of maturity and by the impact such support would have. The assessment will be clear and transparent. Central government also encourages and helps com- panies and other organisations to make the same assessment vis-à-vis their own target groups, inclu- ding consumers. Partnerships, organisations and public authorities exchange information within the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships so that they can all provide customised services for their own target groups. To avoid fragmentation and save time, a single national CSIRT has been established, through which information can be channelled straight to vulnerable or at-risk organisations wherever possi- ble. Operational expertise is pooled within central government and deployed jointly wherever possible. In the future, cybersecurity experts from government will work with the business community and ICT and cybersecurity service providers, in some cases at the same physical location. This will enable them to pool information, knowledge and expertise in order to safeguard cyber resilience and ensure a common stra- tegy for – and response to – cyber incidents or threats. other organisations in which information is gathered, analysed and shared with clients. The provision of help and support to organisations is also a joint effort. Cybersecurity service providers are on hand to make their services available and are working with the government to foster the cyber resilience of orga- nisations at home and abroad. International cooperation Cyber incidents do not stop at national borders, so the government actively exploits the opportunities offered by cooperation within and outside the Euro- pean Union. The Netherlands is driving cooperation between EU member states and is thus contributing to a digitally secure and, where necessary, autonomous EU. This approach serves to tackle cross-border cyber risks and it allows a coordinated response to major cyber incidents and crises within and outside the EU. Constant efforts are being made through cyber-diplomatic means – including capacity building – to reinforce and expand the international coalition driving responsible state behaviour in cyber- space. The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone | 21 Central government provides the framework in which the system can function effectively and coherently. To this end, it deploys a well-balanced combination of instruments, such as legislation (national and EU), financial support or incentives (tax advantages, sub- sidies), skills training, etc. It also serves as launching customer for secure-by-design innovations. Digitally resilient companies, public authorities and organisations In the government’s vision, companies, public autho- rities and civil society organisations are in principle able to determine independently, in collaboration with each other or with the help of ICT or cybersecu- rity service providers, what risks they face in cyberspace and what measures they need to take to adequately manage those risks. Digital risk manage- ment has become a common good and is now expected from all organisations: by their clients and consumers, as well as by insurers and shareholders, for example. Given the importance of critical infrastructure for our society to function, these responsible organisations have a high level of resilience. Partly because of Euro- pean legislation, the government imposes additional requirements on these organisations. This means that measures are sometimes imposed to mitigate risks to national security even if they do not directly serve the commercial interests of an organisation or company. A digitally secure and innovative economy Clients and consumers can rest assured that all digital products and services will be properly protected throughout their specified life-cycle. Organisations negotiate resilience measures with suppliers. Manu- facturers and suppliers have a duty of care in relation to cybersecurity measures for the entire life-cycle of their products and services, partly because of Euro- pean legislation. It is also possible for clients and consumers to find out about the cyber resilience of companies from which they buy products or services, for example through certification or reports. In the development and application of new technolo- gies, security by design and security by default are always the guiding principles. Furthermore, in the purchasing and procurement of digital products and services, the risk of espionage, influencing or sabo- tage by state actors is assessed as standard. The Netherlands has sufficient cybersecurity exper- tise, both in terms of resilience and in relation to cybercrime prevention, thanks to both a growing supply of experts on the labour market and the targe- ted stimulation of innovation. Countering cyber threats Together with the business community, the govern- ment has a clear understanding of the cyber threat emanating from within and beyond the Netherlands’ borders and has its detection mechanisms in order. Most importantly, the Netherlands is capable of limi- ting cyberattacks by state and non-state actors, thanks to the use of broad-based attribution and res- ponse mechanisms, ideally in partnerships and coalitions with EU countries, NATO Allies and other like-minded nations. The government will intervene in identified attacks in order to minimise adverse effects for the Netherlands, repair any damage and address vulnerabilities. Cybercrime will no longer pay to the same extent. The police and the Public Prosecution Service are tar- geting cybercriminals and their service providers with a broad, scalable and innovative approach which inc- reases the likelihood of catching perpetrators and of effectively disrupting criminal activity, prevents crimi- nal behaviour and eliminates criminal proceeds. Besides investigation and criminal prosecution, the Netherlands can also use other means of intervention, such as disruption capabilities, victim notification and/or damage limitation. Victims and/or targets can thus be given advance notification where- ver possible. The government is not tackling this threat alone but in a network of public and private cybersecurity and 20 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Aims | 23 3. Aims To make this vision a reality, aims have been formulated on the basis of four pillars. Those aims offer a response to the current and future challenges set out in Chapter 2. 22 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Pillar I Cyber resilience of the government, businesses and civil society organisations Pillar II Secure and innovative digital products and services Pillar III Countering cyber threats posed by states and criminals Pillar IV Cybersecurity labour market, education and cyber resilience of the public This pillar concerns the cyber resilience of the government, businesses and civil society organisations, focusing on the ability to reduce risks to an acceptable level using a collection of measures to prevent cyber incidents and, if cyber incidents do occur, the ability to minimise damage and facilitate recovery. Aims • Organisations have a clear picture of cyber incidents, threats and risks and know how to deal with them. • Organisations are properly protected against cybersecurity risks and are mindful of their own importance to the sector and other organisations in the chain. • Organisations respond to and recover and learn from cyber incidents and crises swiftly and efficiently. This pillar focuses on the suppliers and consumers of digital products and services, and on boosting cybersecurity knowledge development and innovation. Working towards a secure and innovative digital economy contributes to the digital security and earning capacity of the Netherlands. Aims • Digital products and services are more secure. • The Netherlands has a robust cybersecurity knowledge and innovation chain. This pillar focuses on the national and international approach to combating malicious actors that pose a threat, and on gaining a clearer picture of the cyber threat landscape, thus providing a basis for appropriate action. The government has a particular responsibility here and has a range of instruments with which to address the cyber threat. Aims • The Netherlands has a clear understanding of cyber threats posed by states and criminals. • The Netherlands has a handle on the cyber threats posed by states and criminals. • States adhere to the normative framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This pillar focuses on the human being behind the technology and the cyber resilience of the public. Society as a whole has an important role to play in terms of developing digital skills, from basic knowledge and skills to high-level expertise and specialist cybersecurity skills. Aims • The public are properly protected against cyber risks. • Members of the public respond to cyber incidents swiftly and efficiently. • School pupils are taught digital skills, with an emphasis on security. • The Dutch labour market can meet the growing demand for cybersecurity experts. further to become the national Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT). The NCSC, the DTC and the CSIRT for digital service providers will be merged to form a single organisation. Greater cohesion between existing organisations will also be created by stimula- ting integration wherever it is useful. For all existing sectoral CERTs and CSIRTs, central government is the- refore exploring the extent to which greater cooperation, cohesion or amalgamation with the NCSC would add value. In principle, new CSIRTs are established only where they have added value.18 The range of the system is being extended to every corner of society in order to unlock as far as possible the current situational picture, threat information and victim information available to the government, businesses and civil society organisations. Specifically, the system is being further developed and expanded for the benefit of all layers of govern- ment, such as municipalities, provinces, water authorities, implementing organisations and safety regions. Further development of the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships (LDS) The purpose of the LDS is to enable public and private organisations to boost their resilience level and thus their impact by sharing cybersecu- rity information widely, efficiently and effectively. It is essential that information- exchange via key organisations generates courses of action which can help organisations enhance their resilience. Those functionalities include information-sha- ring, facilitating and boosting collaboration, general target group analysis and situational analysis. CSIRTs and supervisory authorities will work more closely with national, as well as European and inter- national partners. At European level, CSIRTs can benefit from collaboration on technological research into cybersecurity incidents, development of techno- logical solutions and responses to large-scale cyber incidents. Supervisory authorities will increase colla- boration at national level to ensure that scarce capacity is used effectively. In a European context, efforts will be made to step up cooperation and infor- mation exchange and, where possible, assistance on cross-border issues. This leads to the following sub-aims: • The government has a current and comprehensive picture of cyber incidents, threats and risks. • There is an effective and efficient exchange of threat information and possible courses of action between the government and the business sector, appropriate to the knowledge and skills of the recipient. • The LDS is well coordinated, with clear points of contact. • Government organisations, such as CSIRTs and supervisory authorities, share information effecti- vely, nationally and internationally. Aims | 25 Pillar I: Cyber resilience of the government, businesses and civil society organisations Organisations have a clear picture of cyber incidents, threats and risks, and know how to deal with them To ensure that organisations have a good understan- ding of threats and risks and know how to deal with them, it is important that they have access to reliable information. Organisations must be confident that the government will provide up-to-date expertise and information about cyber threats, incidents, trends and vulnerabilities so that they can take the necessary action. Government organisations must collaborate more closely in order to create the most up-to-date situa- tional picture of the cyber risk landscape. This is essential so that the relevant parties can take preven- tive measures and organise appropriate incident response, including effective disruption, investigation and prosecution.16 In order to reach as many organi- sations as possible with information (such as analyses, phenomenon analyses and courses of action) about impending cyber incidents and to orga- nise an appropriate response, the government is working to achieve a detailed level of public-private information exchange which meets the needs of the target group as closely as possible. It will also take account of target groups in which organisations such as small and medium businesses, associations and foundations have limited capacity (time, expertise, resources, network) to apply this information in the right way. General information about digital security and speci- fic threat and risk information can be shared within the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships (LDS),17 the development of which is coordinated by the government. The NCSC will evolve 24 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 For our society to function safely and without disrup- tion, digital security is crucial for all businesses, civil society organisations and government organisations. Consider the task of keeping the country’s critical infrastructure permanently available, and the confidentiality and integrity of processes. Cybersecu- rity allows us to use information and communication technology successfully and to reap the benefits of innovation and computerisation. Organisations that have their cybersecurity in order will protect company profits, competitiveness, intellectual pro- perty and sensitive client data. Cyber incidents affecting businesses and public authorities could lead to a loss of consumer confidence or of public trust in the government. The Dutch cybersecurity system, which is designed to help boost organisations’ cyber resilience, has evol- ved autonomously over recent years into a system of wide-ranging partnerships in sectors, supply chains and regions. The positive effect is that cybersecurity knowledge is now spread widely and sectoral exper- tise has been accumulated. At the same time, this has also led to fragmentation of activities and responsibi- lities.15 As a result, information about vulnerabilities or risks does not always reach the relevant organisa- tion in time, if at all. This means that those organisations are not always able to take the neces- sary steps, and expertise is not deployed optimally. Legal and organisational obstacles have also hampe- red the effective exchange of information. Furthermore, it is not always clear to organisations within and outside government as to what support is available or where they can go with questions concer- ning digital security. Critical infrastructure and the government A high level of cybersecurity is expected from organi- sations within critical infrastructure and government, and requirements are imposed accordingly. The government believes it is important to adopt a risk- based approach in which companies and organisations take measures commensurate with the risk to the organisation. That starts with an understanding of the interests at stake, vulnerabili- ties, threats and risks. Setting up a sound risk management system is essential. Conscious decisions about this process need to be taken by a director or senior management board. Organisations are also expected to take account of risks stemming from (inter)sectoral dependencies, and of the importance of other parties’ security (e.g. suppliers in the chain). Special attention must be paid to operational tech- nology because of its vital importance for the continuity of our infrastructure, critical and otherwise.20 Organisations are expected to take con- crete measures to increase the cyber resilience of this technology. The NCSC and the responsible line mini- stries will help critical infrastructure organisations to boost their cyber resilience. The government makes sure that its own systems are secure, that public services are adequately protected against cyber incidents and that personal data (sensi- tive or otherwise) is secure. Robust legislation covering the whole of government, together with compliance monitoring will be introduced. In the interest of its own security, central government encourages digital autonomy with regard to special products and services.21 Furthermore, central govern- ment constantly monitors vulnerabilities in its own digital systems and processes. Subnational authori- ties, such as municipalities, provinces, water authorities and safety regions, are also expected to be sufficiently resilient; central government organisa- tions and subnational authorities collaborate closely in this respect. Some sectors are also subject to additional legislation that imposes sector-specific cybersecurity requirements at least as stringent as those set out in NIS2.22 The line ministries are responsible for drawing up this sector-specific legislation. The Ministry of Jus- tice and Security ensures that European and national legislation relating to cybersecurity is developed and implemented in a harmonised manner. Insight, supervision and enforcement Providing insight into and accountability for the cybersecurity measures that organisations take should be more of a common good. It should there- fore be easier for stakeholders (e.g. clients, shareholders and insurers) to get an idea of an orga- nisation’s cybersecurity level. Such transparency would also allow stakeholders to properly assess the risk associated with the supplied product or service. Providing insight into cybersecurity measures would thus make organisations more commercially attrac- tive, and it could be accomplished by including cybersecurity in their reports and contracts.23 Under legislation such as the forthcoming NIS2 and/or sectoral legislation, regulated organisations are currently obliged to account for their cybersecu- rity measures to supervisory authorities, which have various instruments to encourage organisations under their supervision to increase and maintain their resilience. They can assess what measures are pro- portionate and appropriate to the risk an organisation faces. Supervisory authorities also have good oversight of the actual resilience of organisati- ons and sectors. At the same time, those authorities will be confronted by new developments and techno- logical advances that occur in a particular sector or market and give rise to new cybersecurity issues. Aims | 27 Organisations are properly protected against cyber risks and are mindful of their own importance to the sector and other organisations in the chain All organisations Commitment from all companies and organisations is essential for the Netherlands’ digital security, not only to ensure the continuity of their own service provision, but also in view of the potentially broader adverse effects for clients, suppliers or dependent third parties. Central government will encourage organisations to implement a basic level of measures in order to contribute to help boost cyber resilience. The government is also working on more secure ICT products and services at European level with the aim of encouraging and enabling organisations to take responsibility for their own cybersecurity. To assist organisations, particularly SMEs, in safeguarding this basic level of security, the government has an impor- tant role to play by ensuring access to information (in comprehensible language) and possible courses of action with regard to cyber threats, for example via the LDS. There is also a role to be played by branch organisations and larger or more cybersecurity- mature organisations, given the potential risks emanating from chain-based and/or sectoral depen- dencies. 26 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Cybersecurity requirements for a greater number of companies (NIS2) requirements, these organisations need to meet a high level of cybersecurity. Incidents that have a significant impact will need to be reported wit- hout undue delay in order to minimise the adverse effects. Organisations such as the NCSC and the sectoral supervisory authorities will see a significant expansion of their tasks as a result of the implementation of this directive. In the revised directive, more organisations are desig- nated than is currently the case under the Dutch Network and Information Systems (Security) Act (WBNI). When the system for the protection of critical infrastructure is reviewed, consistency in national terminology, NIS2 terminology and ter- minology from the EU Directive on the resilience of critical entities (CER Directive) will be impro- ved. This strategy regards organisations that fall within the scope of the NIS2 and CER directives as part of the critical infrastructure.19 Cyber incidents do not stop at national borders, so the EU is also working to boost digital secu- rity and resilience within the Union. As a result of the review of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2), many more sectors and organisations within the EU will be subject to legal obligations for the security of their net- work and information systems. This applies to businesses as well as public authorities. It con- cerns sectors that are already regulated under the original NIS Directive (NIS1), such as energy, transport, drinking water and digital infrastruc- ture. Under NIS2, more sectors will be added, such as waste water, central government, aero- space, food, manufacturing and postal and courier services. Public administration bodies at regional level, such as provinces and municipali- ties, can be included in the scope of NIS2 on the basis of a risk analysis. As part of the security Aims | 29 This leads to the following sub-aims: • Organisations know what basic cybersecurity mea- sures are and apply them. • Government and NIS2 organisations meet high security standards under new and existing legisla- tion. • Organisations are aware at all levels (including management level) of the importance of cyberse- curity. • Organisations also focus their risk management on cybersecurity risks, and increase transparency in this regard. • Supervision of an organisation’s cyber resilience is geared more to risks for the organisation itself, its sector and its significance for others. Organisations respond to and recover and learn from cyber incidents and crises swiftly and efficiently To prepare effectively for cyber incidents, organisati- ons should develop incident, continuity and recovery plans in keeping with the organisation’s risk profile. These plans need to be practised regularly, both wit- hin the organisation itself and with partners in the sector and chain so that employees know what to do in the event of an incident. Attention must also be paid to effects that may occur in the physical world. Should an incident nonetheless occur, it is important that an organisation has arrangements in place for assistance. The NCSC also has a statutory obligation to provide support, with the main focus on national security and prevention of social disruption. The NCSC is responsible for operational coordination and management in times of national crises. The govern- ment also ensures coherent provision of public and private cybersecurity services in the event of an inci- dent, for example in conjunction with trusted cybersecurity firms.24 Central government thus provi- des a stimulus for greater and more effective collaboration between organisations, to ensure that cyber capabilities are deployed as effectively and effi- ciently as possible. In order to prepare a response to a national cyber cri- sis, efficient cooperation must be in place between government organisations, the business sector, the research community and civil society organisations, even across local, regional and national borders. In the event of cross-border cyber incidents and crises, the government encourages fully integrated action on the basis of a national umbrella framework in the form of the National Crisis Plan for Digital Incidents. Lastly, we must continue to learn from incidents and crises. To this end, organisations will need to be more proactive in sharing their experiences and lessons learned with each other, and in this regard trust is paramount. The information shared by government organisations will be more targeted, so as to ensure a clearer picture of the degree of resilience in organisa- tions, sectors and chains, wherever possible in collaboration with, for example, the business sector or branch organisations. The government will use this insight to provide guidance wherever resilience levels are lagging behind the threat. To make this possible, attention must be paid to the measurability of resilience and more insight must be gained into the costs and benefits of cybersecurity incidents and measures This leads to the following sub-aims: • Organisations are capable of swiftly responding to and recovering from a cyber incident and practise accordingly. • The government offers coherent cybersecurity ser- vices with a recognised point of contact for organisations. • The government, business sector and research community collaborate closely to ensure effective use of cybersecurity expertise. • Organisations collaborate effectively in the event of (national) cybersecurity crises, in keeping with regional, supraregional, national and international crisis mechanisms. • Organisations evaluate cyber incidents, learn from them and share these lessons with each other. 28 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Actions and priorities for Pillar I The following actions reflect the government’s priorities for the current term of office which will be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in the appendix. This action plan will be updated annually and will provide insight into underlying actions, expected duration and responsibilities. A. Addressing fragmentation within the system • The ability to receive timely information about threats and vulnerabilities in a way that is appropriate to the maturity level of the orga- nisation is one of the most important elements for the Netherlands’ cyber resilience. To achieve it, the available capacity and exper- tise need to be deployed as effectively as possible. Fragmentation within the cybersecu- rity information exchange system should be counteracted wherever possible. The NCSC, DTC and CSIRT-DSP will therefore be merged to form a single national cybersecurity autho- rity. Working in collaboration with public and private partners, this new organisation will provide critical and non-critical organisations, public authorities and members of the public with security information and possible courses of action appropriate to their maturity level. • The other organisations within the cybersecu- rity information-sharing system will be assessed in terms of which of their tasks (dis- tributing security information, providing support, organising drills, etc) should be cen- tralised (within the national cybersecurity authority) and which should be sector-based. • Cybersecurity is an issue that must be addres- sed by means of a public-private approach. One key element in this respect is the joint col- lection and interpretation of threat informa- tion, so the government will start developing a public-private platform for information and knowledge sharing. B. No more commitment-free partnerships • The implementation of the NIS2 directive means that more than 5,000 companies in the Netherlands will be required to report cyberse- curity incidents and to take specific steps to increase their cyber resilience. Compliance with these obligations will be monitored. At the moment, these requirements apply to only 200 organisations in the Netherlands, so this expansion will increase the cyber resilience of the designated organisations. • The government is also taking various measu- res to boost the cyber resilience of specific sectors. There will, for instance, be additional norms for the healthcare and education sec- tors, and the government will provide various tools to help organisations to comply. Munici- palities and provinces will be subject to tighter security requirements. Multiple support pro- grammes are being offered by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations to help them meet those requirements. Lastly, the government believes that it is not only the cyber resilience of IT systems that needs to be addressed, but also the resilience of operatio- nal technology. This is made up of complex digital systems that control the locks in our waterways or regulate production in factories, and the impact of system failure is considera- ble. The government will therefore work to increase knowledge and awareness of the risks in organisations that use these systems. >> Aims | 3130 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 C. Being prepared for cyber incidents and crises • At the end of 2022, the government will pre- sent the National Crisis Plan for Digital Incidents. This plan will set out how public and private organisations in the Netherlands should prepare for cybersecurity incidents and what they should do if one occurs. • The government will draw up an interministe- rial practice schedule on the basis of a government-wide risk analysis and the Natio- nal Security Strategy. This schedule will incorporate the planning of national and inter- national cyber and hybrid exercises. Pillar II: Secure and innovative digital products and services In order for our digitised society to be secure, we need digital products and services that are well pro- tected throughout their lifecycle. This is difficult to achieve in today’s market. Consumers cannot tell the difference between secure and insecure products or services, which is partly why suppliers and manufac- turers are reluctant to invest sufficiently in the cybersecurity of the products and services they pro- vide. In addition, more and more products and services are now digitalised, from smart televisions to connected cars and medical equipment. Every day, vulnerabilities are discovered in software and there are still too many devices and services on the market that can easily be misused for criminal activities, espionage or large-scale attacks. Given the market dynamics that exist in an international competitive market where there is insufficient incentive for suppliers to make digital products more secure throughout their lifecycle, sta- tutory measures are needed, in many cases at EU level. Such measures impose greater responsibility on suppliers for the security of their product or service, and offer consumers a basis for claiming compensa- tion in the event of cybersecurity incidents.25 The government is a major consumer and purchaser of digital products and services and will use its position to stimulate the development of secure products and services. It is important to anticipate future opportunities and threats. Rapid developments in the digital and tech- nological domain, as in the case of quantum technology or artificial intelligence (AI), require a per- manent commitment to the expansion and application of expertise and innovation for the devel- opment of cybersecurity products and services. To enhance the Netherlands’ competitive position on the EU and international markets, and to minimise undesirable dependence on foreign parties, collabo- ration within the Dutch innovation chain should be encouraged as much as possible. Looking back: Roadmap for Digital Hard- and Software Security The protection of digital products and services is a complex, global issue for which an assortment of measures exist. Under the NCSA, such measu- res were set out in the Roadmap for Digital Hard- and Software Security.26 In recent years, for example, EU market entry requirements were introduced for wireless networking devices, a European system was developed for cybersecu- rity certification of ICT products, services and processes, and the Dutch system was set up, with supervision.27 European consumers are now also entitled to updates for digital products, con- tent and services and European cybersecurity requirements are being imposed on medical devices.28 Cybersecurity requirements are also being imposed at global level for connected cars and vehicles.29 Netherlands capitalise safely on the economic and social opportunities of the digital transformation. A good innovation basis will reduce the Netherlands’ dependence on cybersecurity expertise and solutions in other countries. This is vital in order for us to pro- tect our national security and our most sensitive information, now and in the future. To achieve this, the Netherlands needs high-quality security products, including cryptographic products and services. Given that this rare knowledge and expertise is available in our country, the Netherlands is one of the few coun- tries where cryptographic products and services are developed and manufactured. It is essential that we retain this expertise and develop it further, so that the Netherlands can properly protect its sensitive information. Dcypher The collaboration platform dcypher brings public and private parties and knowledge institutions together, as well as resources and expertise, to effectively engage in cybersecurity education, research, innovation and concrete applications. Dcypher’s mission is to help build a safer, smar- ter, digitally autonomous and economically stronger Netherlands. The mission of dcypher’s partners is to deepen and broaden the development and application of expertise in the field of cybersecurity in the Netherlands. The platform is designed to stimulate knowledge development in the cybersecurity domain, to give a major impetus to the cybersecurity indu- stry and to support the government in its role as launching customer. In order to foster a healthy cybersecurity innovation ecosystem, the government is working via the cen- tralised public-private collaboration platform dcypher, which in recent years has laid the basis for substantive agenda-setting and programming of long-term research and innovation plans in respect of digital security together with government bodies, businesses and knowledge institutions. This approach covers the whole chain, from fundamental research, via applied research to innovative new cybersecurity products and services. This will gene- rate more knowledge and innovation with a lasting impact on the cybersecurity ecosystem, helping us secure a leading position in Europe. It is also impor- tant to ensure a deeply-rooted connection between national and European initiatives and the associated instruments and EU resources. This will be done via the National Crisis Centre (NCC) which liaises between the national cybersecurity network and the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and its associated network. This leads to the following sub-aims: • Dutch (and European) cybersecurity companies supply high-quality products and services that are essential for our digital security and our economy. • The government, business sector and knowledge institutions collaborate closely on knowledge and innovation relating to cybersecurity. • The Netherlands has joined European initiatives and funds to stimulate knowledge development and innovation in cybersecurity in the Netherlands. Aims | 3332 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Digital products and services are more secure Despite efforts to improve the security of digital pro- ducts and services, there is still no comprehensive system of legislation (EU or otherwise) setting out the necessary standards for digital products, processes and services and geared to the individual responsibi- lity of manufacturers and suppliers. EU legislation creates a level playing field and enhances the com- petitiveness of Dutch suppliers. And because EU frameworks have been established on the basis of European public norms and values, they also help to reinforce Europe’s digital autonomy at global level, both in a geopolitical context and in respect of the ‘tech giants’. In the coming period the Netherlands will be pressing at EU level for a coherent system of legislation, together with the associated standards. This will involve a combination of sectoral measures (such as those that apply to medical devices and energy-supply equipment) and more horizontal mea- sures.30 Efforts at EU and national level should ensure that consumers can be confident in demonstrably more secure products and services. Clarity about where responsibility for digital security lies and about the standards such security must meet will also ensure that potential compensation can be claimed more easily via regular liability law. In the Netherlands, cybersecurity purchasing require- ments have been developed for all government organisations. This stricter approach to government procurement and tendering also means that the government can use its role as a market player to greater effect when it comes to encouraging the development of secure ICT products and services. The government also has policy in place stipulating that national security interests must be considered during the procurement and tendering process for all products and services. This leads to the following sub-aims: • Under EU law manufacturers and suppliers have a duty of care for the cybersecurity of digital products and services throughout their entire life- cycle. • There is a more coherent system of EU legislation for the cybersecurity of digital products and services. • European security certificates are issued for diffe- rent categories of digital products and services. • European security requirements and standards are also used in non-EU countries. • Organisations have contractual agreements with clients in respect of cybersecurity. • The government has purchasing and other policy on the security of digital products and services, and is aware of the relevant requirements. The Netherlands has a robust cybersecurity knowledge and innovation chain To ensure measures against cyber threats can be taken both now and in the future, the development and application of Dutch knowledge and cybersecu- rity expertise need to be continually strengthened. A high-quality and autonomous Dutch knowledge and innovation chain in the field of cybersecurity will reduce undesirable dependence on companies, indi- viduals and solutions in other countries, and will generate economic opportunities for Dutch busines- ses. Close cooperation between government, the business sector and knowledge institutions is essen- tial in this respect. Different parts of the chain – such as fundamental and applied research, businesses and public authori- ties – need to develop closer contacts and to collaborate on specific, long-term projects. By crea- ting a healthy innovation ecosystem, we can ensure that valuable cybersecurity knowledge does not drain away to other countries but is converted into practi- cal products and services. Only then can the Aims | 35 B. Government is stimulating the development of secure digital products via procurement • The government must have its own cybersecu- rity in order and can, as a major consumer of ICT products, influence the market by impo- sing procurement requirements. Government procurement policy could thus contribute to the innovation and development of secure products and services. • For example, General Security Requirements for Central Government (ABRO) are being drawn up and will be imposed on companies contracted to carry out sensitive and/or classi- fied government assignments. • The government cybersecurity procurement requirements (ICO) tool will be developed furt- her, expanded and implemented, including the further development of government-wide sets of requirements. The tool will also be available to companies so that they too can apply the procurement requirements. • The development of high-assurance products will be stimulated by means of enhanced and coordinated commissioning on the part of central government so that the Netherlands retains access to reliable cryptographic soluti- ons. 34 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Actions and priorities for Pillar II The following actions reflect the government’s priorities for the current term of office which will be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in the appendix. This action plan will be updated annually and will provide insight into underlying actions, expected duration and responsibilities. A. Security will be mandatory in digital product development • One of the most important steps towards cyber resilient consumers and organisations is the availability of secure digital products. Security should be one of the main considera- tions in the development of digital products. The government will regulate this mainly via the EU Cyber Resilience Act. In the negotiati- ons on this regulation, the Netherlands is pressing for the inclusion of a duty of care for manufacturers and suppliers of all ICT products, services and processes, to last through their entire life cycle, including the associated standards and supervision. • Together with private parties, the government is also contributing to the development and adoption of European cybersecurity certifica- tion schemes for ICT products, services and processes, for example for cloud services, 5G technology and Common Criteria. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is wor- king to stimulate awareness and implementation of certification schemes under the EU Cybersecurity Act. Encouraging and facilitating the use of certification will enable consumers and organisations to make safe choices. C. Robust cybersecurity knowledge and inno- vation chain • Development in the cryptographic domain will continue through the implementation of the National Crypto Strategy. • New projects and work programmes are emer- ging from the interface in knowledge and innovation requirements between government and the business community. The public-private collaboration platform dcypher facilitates connection between government, businesses and knowledge institutions and provides agenda-setting and programming for cybersecurity knowledge and innovation pro- jects and work programmes. Dcypher could play a facilitating and driving role in the quest for funding for high-end knowledge and pro- duct development. The government also needs to step up cooperation with other parties and establish more partnerships in order to gather information from outside central government. Possibilities include the business sector, knowledge institutions and international organisati- ons. On the basis of its own information and that of other parties, the government can form a clearer pic- ture of the cyber threat targeting Dutch interests and those of our partners. This leads to the following sub-aims: • The government has the capabilities to gather, ana- lyse and share information and intelligence relating to cyber threats posed by states and criminals. • There is an effective exchange of cyber threat intel- ligence and information between the government and its international partners. The Netherlands has a handle on the cybersecurity threats posed by states and criminals Over the next few years, the government will work to improve information-sharing and to increase resilience, which will help to mitigate cyber threats.33 The government will also, working within the legal parameters, make more use of the existing scope (both online and off) for detecting, tackling, disrupting and prosecuting malicious actors and their facilitators. To do so, the government can use the AIVD, the MIVD, the police, the Public Prosecution Service, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.34 Statu- tory and other frameworks will need to be taken into consideration, however. The police and the Public Prosecution Service will employ a broad, scalable and effective strategy to tac- kle cybercrime, targeting both the perpetrators of cybercrime and their service providers. As well as pur- suing criminal investigations, the police and the Public Prosecution Service will also focus on alternative inter- ventions. Using this broad approach, criminal activities and networks will be disrupted, criminal behaviour prevented, criminal proceeds confiscated and criminal offences punished. In various international forums, including the EU, the Council of Europe and the UN, the Netherlands contri- butes actively to the ongoing development of legal instruments designed to strengthen international cooperation against cybercrime, while safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms. State-spon- sored cyber operations will be disrupted more effectively by the AIVD and the MIVD. The Ministry of Defence will deploy the its constitutional powers more often and more systematically in the national domain, and must be ready to act when needed: not just as a last resort, but also as an offensive digital force.35 Given the geopolitical dimension of digital threats, our efforts in cyberspace are an integral part of our broa- der foreign policy. Together with partners at home and abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will deploy diplomatic means more effectively in response to cyberattacks and incidents. The Government-wide State Threat Response Framework, which is currently in development, will also be applied in cyberspace wherever possible. The interministerial cyber incident response framework, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will be used for this purpose. This framework has been applied successfully since 2018 and will be developed further in the coming years. Where legal parameters restrict operational effective- ness to such an extent that the aim cannot be achieved, consideration will be given to extending those parameters, based on our public values and keeping in mind the normative framework for respon- sible state behaviour, including fundamental rights and international law (for example, human rights law and international humanitarian law). Aims | 3736 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Pillar III: Countering cyber threats posed by states and criminals The Netherlands has a clear picture of cyber threats posed by states and criminals Addressing this challenge is not merely a matter of better observing the actions of state and non-state actors in cyberspace. In addition, the political, diplo- matic, military and economic behaviour of other countries provides insight into their views and inten- tions regarding the use of cyberspace as a means of gaining geopolitical influence. Deploying diplomatic resources is therefore essential in this respect, con- ducted by means of, say, targeted diplomatic reports, consultations, coalitions with like-minded partners and dialogue with parties who do not share our views. Much of this task falls under the unique res- ponsibility of the government, with, for example, the police, the Public Prosecution Service and the AIVD and MIVD working in collaboration with stakeholders such as the NCSC and the DTC.32 This enables the Netherlands to build and maintain a picture of the rapidly growing threat and some of the main players. We will also need to work more often, more closely and more actively with EU partners and NATO Allies so that we can identify threats and malicious actors at an earlier stage. To encourage a common under- standing of the threat, the government will be more proactive when sharing cyber and other intelligence, thus enabling others to increase their resilience or to take action against cybercriminals. Cyberspace is fast becoming a place where tensions find expression: increasingly, state and non-state actors are conducting malicious cyber campaigns, often as part of a hybrid campaign, in pursuit of wide-ranging goals. In some cases, the capabilities of criminal groups are now comparable to those of sta- tes. And occasionally, states actually seek collaboration with criminal groups, or deliberately allow those groups to act without hindrance. This affects the Netherlands in many ways: theft undermi- nes our earning capacity, sabotage constitutes a direct threat to our national security and cyber threats put pressure on our democracy and the rule of law. The relationship between cyberattacks and geopolitical dynamics could potentially put the allied cohesion of NATO and the EU under strain. Cybersecurity (and thus also efforts to combat cyber- crime) must therefore be regarded as a fixed element of national and international security policy. As this observation makes clear, neither central government nor the Netherlands as a whole can resolve this chal- lenge alone. If we are to keep pace with the countless malicious actors and the increasing vulnerability of cyberspace, we need a clearer picture of what we are dealing with. Although that picture on its own will not make the Netherlands any safer, it is nonetheless an essen- tial step towards effective, scalable action.31 The government endorses the multistakeholder model of internet governance. This model entails open collaboration between stakeholder authori- ties, civil society organisations, the business sector, research community and the internet technical community within organisations such as the Inter- net Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi- neers (IEEE). They must take the lead in adjusting the standards, protocols and procedures for the internet’s core functionality , without inappropriate interference by state or private actors. The Netherlands is committed to preven- ting a situation in which national and regional legislation creates barriers that ultimately lead to the fragmentation of the internet. This leads to the following sub-aims: • States have a common understanding of the importance of norms of conduct and international law in cyberspace, and act accordingly. • The Netherlands forms part of a broad coalition which promotes compliance with international law in cyberspace. • The multistakeholder model continues to be the guiding principle for worldwide governance of the internet. Aims | 39 This leads to the following sub-aims: • The government has an effective, internationally aligned attribution and response framework with clear powers and responsibilities. • The government has offensive and defensive cyber capabilities that are effective in both peacetime and wartime. • The government ensures the well-coordinated national and international deployment of instru- ments against cyber threats posed by states and criminals. • The government can use criminal and non-criminal interventions against cyber criminals and their ser- vice providers (e.g. ransomware attacks). States adhere to the normative framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace Given the geopolitical tensions in the world, cyber threats and cyberattacks are only likely to increase in future. The best way to nip the source of the threat in the bud is to turn the geopolitical arena more to our advantage by promoting the international legal order in cyberspace. The Netherlands will be an integral part of robust coalitions pressing for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and will contribute to the further devel- opment of a uniform and widely supported normative framework in order to reduce geopolitical tensions. To this end we will use cyber diplomacy to promote democratic norms and values governed by the rule of law, including human rights. Central government complies with this normative framework and actively promotes it, on the basis of our norms and values, and our vision of a free, open and safe internet. Normative framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace International agreements are needed to deal with the threat of destabilising cyberattacks. UN negotiations on the rules that apply in cyberspace have been ongoing since 1998.36 The process has now expanded into multiple consul- tation and negotiation mechanisms focused on cyberspace, to which the Netherlands either acti- vely contributes or has done so in the past: the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) and the Programme of Action (PoA). The need for stability gave rise to the establishment of a normative framework for res- ponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, which was reaffirmed by consensus by the UN member states in 2021.37 This framework helps foster sta- bility, as non-compliant countries can be called to account for their behaviour. The guiding prin- ciple is that existing international law is applicable in cyberspace. This means, for example, that the interstate pro- hibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle in international law also apply in cyberspace, and that an actual or imminent cyberattack can in certain circumstan- ces be regarded as an armed attack against which a state can invoke the right of individual or collective self-defence. It is also acknowledged that human rights apply online as well as offline and that states must fulfil their human rights obligations in cyberspace, as well as those per- taining to international humanitarian law. In addition, agreement has been reached on 11 non-binding norms of conduct, which provide for agreements, safeguarding and protection below the threshold of armed conflict. 38 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 B. Increase research and investigative capacity in respect of cybercriminals • As well as understanding the threat, being able to investigate perpetrators is extremely impor- tant. This goes beyond criminal-law interventions alone. The police and the Public Prosecution Service will therefore work with public and private partners to develop other interventions to tackle cybercrime (including ransomware attacks). • Over the coming years, the Public Prosecution Service will expand its knowledge and exper- tise in this area and explore the scope for expediting cases by means of a fast-track sys- tem. • The police will make it possible to report more cybercrime phenomena online from 2023. • In addition, the police will start building a security overview in relation to cybercrime and digitalised criminality, giving society at large Actions and priorities for Pillar III The following actions reflect the government’s priorities for the current term of office which will be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in the appendix. This action plan will be updated annually and will provide insight into underlying actions, expected duration and responsibilities. A. Understanding the cyber threat • Knowing and understanding the threat is the first step towards a cyber resilient Netherlands, so the government is investing heavily in the research capability of the intelli- gence and security services for the purpose of intelligence-oriented in-depth research. This will provide a broader view of current and potential cyber threats. Unique intelligence will thus be translated into specific courses of action so that clients are better able to protect themselves. Aims | 41 an idea of the main criminal phenomena, ope- rating methods and risk levels. This overview will guide the police and the Public Prosecu- tion Service in their choice of where they focus and which investigations are prioritised. C. Expand the diplomatic response and defen- sive cyber capability • The government is investing in the cyber diplomacy network, and its tasks will be expanded to ensure the availability of better information on cyber threats and developments. The government will also work in a coalition setting to boost compliance with international standards of behaviour and the application of international law in cyberspace. Furthermore, the government will work to promote an open, free and secure internet through stronger commitment to internet governance and by engaging with the multis- takeholder community in the Netherlands. • Together with international partners, the government will develop new, more effective options for a diplomatic response to cyber threats. Existing frameworks, such as the national diplomatic cyber response framework, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the NATO Guide are being developed furt- her. The government will build further on the Government-wide State Threat Response Framework, which brings together all possible response options within central government, and includes an escalation ladder and assess- ment framework. • The Ministry of Defence is investing in its over- all cyber capability chain and in increasing staff readiness via training and exercises. It is expanding support structures to provide assis- tance to other organisations in major incidents, for example via the National Response Network (NRN). 40 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Pillar IV: Cybersecurity labour market, education and public cyber resilience The public are properly protected against cyber risks Members of the public need to be as self-reliant as possible and to have the necessary basic knowledge and skills to be able to take effective preventive mea- sures against cyber threats and risks, and they need to actually take those measures in practice. To achieve this, ongoing efforts are needed to make the public more tech-savvy. Awareness-raising campaigns should be run to alert them to what mea- sures they can take to enhance their cybersecurity. In this way, our society will become more cyber resilient. The aim is that the public take basic cybersecurity measures, such as the use of strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, making backups, instal- ling updates and responding appropriately to phishing attacks. So it is important that they have the knowledge and tools to apply such measures. They should therefore have easy access to information and advice, provided in familiar and trusted surroundings, to enhance their cybersecurity skills. This leads to the following sub-aims: • The public are aware of cyber risks, threats and measures, and know where they can obtain help. • People apply basic cybersecurity measures when they use digital products and services. • People can get easy access, in a range of settings, to cybersecurity information and advice appropriate to their knowledge and skill level. Society’s ability to function without disruption depends increasingly on the secure use of digital resources. Pillar II describes the European approach to safeguarding the security of digital products and services. The public’s level of cyber resilience is also an important requirement.38 For many Dutch people, however, achieving and maintaining a sufficient level of cybersecurity is still too big a task. The most vulne- rable groups run the greatest risk39 and many people fall victim to cybercriminals.40 Putting the necessary cybersecurity measures in place can significantly help reduce the number of cybercrime victims.41 Because of the digitalisation of our society, children of ever younger ages are coming into contact with digital products and services. It is imperative that they have the necessary skills to deal with cyber risks and to take cybersecurity measures. This is not yet being adequately addressed in a systematic way by primary or secondary education, even though it is vital that young people learn the skills they need to be safe in our digital world. The Cybersecurity Council has pointed out the need for sufficient qualified professionals in order to boost our society’s long-term cyber resilience.42 There is a general shortage of expertise on the cybersecurity market.43 Ensuring organisations’ security and resi- lience requires specialists at secondary vocational, higher professional and university education level who can make and keep digital systems and proces- ses secure. Aims | 43 Members of the public respond to cyber incidents swiftly and efficiently It is important to enable people to respond swiftly and efficiently to cyber threats, attacks and disrupti- ons. This can be achieved by ensuring that people are informed at an early stage about current threats that could affect them and about what they can do to stay safe. Over the next few years, efforts need to be made to improve the speed and quality of public information. People need to know where they can find this information and what action they can take. They also need an accessible and straightforward process for reporting or lodging a criminal complaint regarding cyber incidents, such as phishing. This leads to the following sub-aims: • People receive sufficient information quickly about urgent cyber incidents and how to respond to them. • It is easy for people to report cyber incidents or to lodge a criminal complaint about them. Schoolchildren are taught digital skills with an emphasis on security It is vital that children learn at a young age how to deal with the digital world and to recognise the risks involved. Pupils need to learn about safe online behaviour. Digital skills, including awareness of cyber risks and security, are not currently part of the natio- nal curriculum for primary or secondary education. To equip pupils with digital skills, teachers must also possess those skills themselves and be able to teach them proficiently. It is important that schools receive appropriate support in this respect. This leads to the following sub-aims: • Digital skills with an emphasis on security are part of the national curriculum in primary and secon- dary education. • Teachers in primary and secondary education are capable (with support) of providing effective instruction in digital skills with an emphasis on security. The Dutch labour market can meet the growing demand for cybersecurity experts In order to meet the growing demand for cybersecu- rity expertise, efforts must be made to make sure there are sufficient specialists on the labour market. Public-private partnerships are essential in this res- pect. To ensure a better supply, it must be clear precisely where the shortfall is and what is needed to cover it. For example, what mechanisms are available to promote and effectively deploy cybersecurity expertise on the labour market? It may, for instance, be possible to link up with the action plan for techno- logy, focusing on such aspects as the digital transition.44 This leads to the following sub-aims: • There is a clear overview of shortfalls on the cyber- security labour market and the options for addressing them. • There are more secondary vocational, higher pro- fessional and university education places in cybersecurity that are properly aligned with the labour market, partly through the involvement of companies and knowledge institutions. • Organisations offer upskilling and reskilling pro- grammes for cybersecurity expertise. 42 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 B. Cyber resilience will be part of the curriculum • Children need to learn from an early age how to deal with digital products and services. The Curriculum Development Foundation Nether- lands (SLO) has been given the task of working with the teaching profession to develop con- crete core objectives for basic skills, including cybersecurity skills, for both primary and secondary education. These detailed core objectives for primary and secondary educa- tion will be submitted to the House of Representatives in a parliamentary bill. • A ‘basic skills master plan’ will be produced to ensure that teachers are properly equipped to provide the best education in language, arith- metic/mathematics, citizenship and computer literacy. C. Addressing cybersecurity in the labour market • The government is working with educational institutions to roll out upskilling and reskilling programmes to enhance employees’ cyberse- curity expertise. They are also working alongside the business community and other relevant parties. Any obstacles and limitations in that collaboration that stem from legisla- tion will be identified and examined to see how they can be resolved. • The government is investing in higher profes- sional education in the sciences, which includes cybersecurity. Resources are being allocated to (1) higher intake, (2) lower drop- out and switch rates, (3) higher lateral intake, and (4) induction/hot transfer to the labour market. Actions and priorities for Pillar IV The following actions reflect the government’s priorities for the current term of office which will be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in the appendix. This action plan will be updated annually and will provide insight into underlying actions, expected duration and responsibilities. A. Increase awareness of cyber risks among members of the public • The risks posed by digital vulnerabilities and threats must be borne as far as possible by the developers and suppliers of digital products and services. However, there will almost always be a residual risk, which means that the individual user or SME will also need to take their own measures. To do so, the public and SMEs must first of all be aware of the risks and the measures they need to take. To this end, the government will use various public-infor- mation-campaign programmes focused on basic cybersecurity measures for specific tar- get groups. • In addition, the government is bolstering its Digital Government Information Units. These will be able to answer people’s questions about cybersecurity and refer them where necessary to support centres, information helpdesks and local support initiatives by pri- vate partners. 4. Governance, evaluation and monitoring organisations. An integrated management model will be set up at the beginning of 2023. This will be linked to existing governance structures and will be based on the positive experience gained in the past few years with public-private partnerships. In this model, the joint efforts of public and private stakeholders will be focused on subsidiary topics and intensified with a view to achieving the objectives. With regard to the objectives aimed at strengthening the labour market, for example, efforts will be made to step up innovation or to enhance the efficiency and effective- ness of the cybersecurity system. It is the task of the Cybersecurity Council (CSR) to advise the government in respect of the implemen- tation and effect of the NLCS. The CSR will be asked to advise periodically on the developments that need to be considered when reviewing the action plan. The NLCS is a clearly defined framework used to ensure that cybersecurity policy evolves in a coherent and structured manner at all levels. Line ministries will translate this general framework into sector-spe- cific frameworks and regulations for the organisations and processes for which they bear sys- tem responsibility. When formulating supplementary policy or legislation in respect of cybersecurity, the government observes the following guiding princi- ples. Governance, evaluatie en monitoring | 45 Governance, coordination and cooperation Digital security is so important that it should be addressed at the highest possible level of an organi- sation. Leadership, coordination and ownership are crucial in this respect. The relevant government ministers are working closely with each other under the responsibility of the Minister of Justice and Secu- rity, the coordinating minister for cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a standing theme in the Cabinet Committee on Defence and International, National and Economic Security (RDINEV), which manages the overall implementation of this strategy and the asso- ciated action plan. Rigorous coordination will help to synchronise and link national initiatives and investments. A key gui- ding principle is that coordination by the Minister of Justice and Security should above all facilitate, sup- port and stimulate the process, and should focus on the effectiveness, coherence and strength of govern- ment policy on cybersecurity. The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS) can only be implemented successfully with close collabo- ration between representatives of the business sector, the research community and decentralised, regional and national authorities and implementing Work has long ceased to be ‘tethered’ to the office. Thanks to laptops, hotspots and Wi-Fi in the train, it’s now possible to send email and attend meetings from any location we choose. But what does this mean for data protection? Evaluation and monitoring The Netherlands’ digital security is inextricably linked to technological and social developments. Cybersecu- rity measures that are effective today might be obsolete by tomorrow, and that is why the government has opted for an adaptive approach to this strategy and the associated action plan. In order to respond to trends, current threats and risks, we need to be able to develop, adjust or intensify the measures arising from the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy over time. In this regard it is important to look at what measures work and what do not, so that the government and other partners can be as effective as possible in their policy and other interventions, and ensure the maxi- mum benefit to society. However, as the Cybersecurity Council has pointed out, measuring the effects of cybersecurity policy is no simple matter.45 First, this strategy consists of different aims designed to enable the Netherlands to capitalise on the economic and social opportunities of digitalisation and at the same time safeguard our security. The successful achieve- ment of the aims in this strategy will thus involve a combination of different factors. Second, security interventions are designed to prevent incidents. Natu- rally it is difficult to measure the number and nature of incidents that have been prevented. Third, cyberse- curity also depends on external factors. It hard to know how much of the improvement in cybersecurity can be attributed to cybersecurity policy itself. This must therefore be factored into the evaluation approach for this strategy. Nevertheless, it is important to continue working to improve our insight into the effects of cybersecurity policy so we can ensure an effective cybersecurity approach in the future too. To this end, a monitoring and evaluation programme has been formulated as part of the NLCS, based on what can be measured. Approach The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy is the coun- try’s fourth integrated cybersecurity strategy. The methodology from the Strategic Evaluation Agenda (SEA)46 was used to compile the monitoring and evaluation programme. This method is designed to plan monitoring and evaluation activities in a more structured way so that relevant insights can be gai- ned at the right moments, with a view to learning and accountability. Evaluation programme Pre-implementation phase Under the previous government, the Netherlands Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA) was evaluated for the first time.47 Based on the experience gained with the NCSA, the compilers of this strategy decided to make a sharper distinction between the strategy and the action plan, resulting in a more future-oriented and longer-term strategy, accompanied by an adaptive action plan that could be adjusted or intensified in the event of changes in the interests at stake, the threat, resilience levels or other political/administra- tive requirements. Completed actions could also generate follow-up actions, for example after a sur- vey or study has been conducted. Further focal points arising from this evaluation (or incorporated in the formulation of the action plans) were the explicit allocation of ownership and respon- sibilities, and a more definitive description of intended actions and effects. Lastly, greater attention needs to be paid to the measurability of the intended results and effects of the strategy and interim evalua- tion. Governance, evaluation and monitoring | 47 Guiding principles from central government for the development of cybersecurity policy and legislation That is necessary to protect our public inte- rests. • Capacity within government must be used effectively and efficiently, through efficient organisation, prompt action and maximum collaboration. The NLCS will serve as the gene- ral framework that prevents fragmentation of effort in the cybersecurity domain; it provides the basic premise. In addition, there is scope for specific interpretation, for example by means of sectoral policy frameworks, strate- gies, agendas, roadmaps for subsidiary topics or additional sets of norms. • Public-private partnership – the pooling of resources – is and will remain the foundation of the strategy. Public-private partnerships must be designed to achieve tangible and measurable results. • Digital security transcends national borders, so international cooperation at EU/NATO level and beyond is vital. The Netherlands is taking a pioneering role in this respect. Wherever possi- ble, solutions will be sought in an international and European context to strengthen cyberse- curity and digital autonomy. 46 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 • Cybersecurity must be an integral part of the Netherlands’ digitalisation process. • Digital security and resilience should be a common good. Cyber risks are an integral part of a broader risk assessment and, on that basis, organisations must take measures that are proportionate, realistic and, where neces- sary, sector-specific. • Organisations, public authorities and companies all have a responsibility to bring and keep their own cyber resilience up to date; the government’s role is to inform, sti- mulate, facilitate and assist on the basis of risk assessment. It will set legal and other frameworks and will intervene where neces- sary, taking account of organisational maturity levels and the interests that organi- sations represent. • It must be clear to organisations and the public how and when they can seek informa- tion, expertise and assistance. • Central government and subnational authori- ties should set the right example and have a level of resilience appropriate to the risks. Governance, evaluation and monitoring | 49 The NCSA evaluation proposes a methodology to enable a logical structure for a strategy. This is follo- wed by the formulation of key aims that define the desired situation or effects to be achieved in the future, and a series of sub-aims which will help to achieve them. The aims will be fleshed out into an action plan describing the government measures that will further the attainment of the goals. The activities or measures will be clearly linked to the intended effect set out in the key and sub-aims. The actions in the plan will be financed in part from the additional funds set aside for cybersecurity in the coalition agreement. A more detailed breakdown can be found in the Financial Overview in the Appendix to the NLCS. Implementation phase The House of Representatives will be informed annually about the progress of the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy. It will also be possible to sup- plement or adapt actions in the progress report on the basis of emerging insights and developments, for example in the light of the new CSBN. In order to track the progress of the measures over time, the Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) of the Ministry of Justice and Security will commission a baseline measurement to be taken, so as to gain a clear picture of the situation before the measures are introduced. Post implementation phase In principle the NLCS will cover a period of six years. There will in any event be an evaluation in 2025, half- way through the term covered by the strategy, with the aim of producing lessons learned that can be incorporated in future policymaking. In order to effectively meet current knowledge needs, a decision will be made at a later stage with regard to the specific focus of the evaluation. Given the breadth of this strategy and the wide variety of acti- ons, an evaluation of all aims and measures is not likely to produce many firm recommendations. For this reason it may make sense to focus on one or more relevant sub-topics, e.g. one about which little is known in terms of the theory of change, or one whose significance will increase in the future. A subsequent government can ultimately decide about the eventual duration and any final evaluation of the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy. 48 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Appendices ment’s further investment in digitalisation more broadly, in enhancing its own ICT infrastructure or in specific policy areas. Examples include improvements to the mission network, (which is home to cyber diplomats, for instance), and streng- thening the Defence organisation, with some of the investment going to cyber capabilities. In cases where no additional investment is possible but there is still a requirement, there will need to be a repriori- tisation within individual budgets. Lastly, the government is exploring the scope for financing additional activities through EU digitalisation funds. Generic national funds, such as the National Growth Fund, could also be used to enhance digital resilience. Besides funding, there are other critical requirements that need to be met in order for the actions to be realised. Sufficient capacity in the labour market requires particular attention in this regard. Appendices | 5150 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 Financial overview Like the previous government, this government has made available structural resources specifically ear- marked for increasing cyber resilience. The previous government made a structural investment of €95 million to boost cyber resilience,48 and this govern- ment is investing a further €111 million in cybersecurity. A breakdown by ministry is shown below. These resources are part of a broader structu- ral investment of €300 million which is being used, for instance, to strengthen the AIVD and the MIVD and to invest in economic security and critical infra- structure. The structural investment of €111 million will contri- bute to the implementation of the ministries’ various actions in pursuit of the strategy’s aims.49 In addition, cyber resilience forms part of the govern- Ministry 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 onwards Economic Affairs and Climate Policy 2,1 6,6 13,5 13,5 13,5 16,1 Infrastructure and Water Management 0,5 1,1 2,3 2,3 2,3 2,8 Justice and Security 8,7 14,8 29,5 29,5 29,5 35,5 of which NCSC 6,6 13,7 27,5 27,5 27,5 33 Interior and Kingdom Relations 5,9 13,5 27,2 27,2 27,2 32,6 of which NCSC 3,8 7,9 15,9 15,9 15,9 19,1 Foreign Affairs 0,5 0,5 0,5 0,5 0,5 0,7 Defence 3,4 7,1 14,2 14,2 14,2 17 of which NCSC 3,4 7,1 14,2 14,2 14,2 17 Education, Culture and Science 0,5 1,3 2,7 2,7 2,7 3,2 Health, Welfare and Sport 0,5 1,3 2,7 2,7 2,7 3,2 TOTAAL 22,1 46,2 92,6 92,6 92,6 111 Online shopping is still enjoying explosive growth.

Glossary Based on the CSBN, the main terms are defined as follows: Attack: see ‘cyberattack’. Cyberattack: Malicious act aimed at using digital resources to disrupt one or more digital processes. Cyber incident: Combination of events or activities that could result in disruption of one or more digital proces- ses. This includes both a cyberattack (malicious action by an actor intent on disrupting one or more digital processes by digital means) and a system failure resulting from natural or technical causes or human error. Cybersecurity: The full spectrum of measures designed to reduce relevant risks to an acceptable level. Measures may focus on the prevention of cyber incidents and, if a cyber incident does occur, on detection, damage limita- tion and recovery. What constitutes an acceptable level of risk is determined by a risk assessment. Digital domain or cyberspace: a complex environment resulting from the interaction of digital processes, sup- ported by globally distributed physical information and communication technology (ICT) devices and connected networks. The digital domain is approached from three different angles or levels: 1) digital processes implemen- ted (or initiated) by humans; 2) the technology (IT and OT) that enables the digital processes; 3) risk management and/or governance that guides the other two levels. Digital process: a process carried out entirely or partly through the complex and interrelated interaction between people and numerous components of hardware, software and/or networks. Fully automated proces- ses, such as process control systems, are also defined as digital processes. Digital security: the undisrupted functioning of information and process control systems, the data processed and stored within them and the services and processes that depend on them. Disruption: adverse effect on the availability, integrity of confidentiality of information or the processing of information; in other words, a disruption of the technological level of the digital domain. Interests: Values, social gains and tangible and intangible assets that may be damaged if a cyber incident occurs, and the importance that society or a party attaches to protecting them. The CSBN focuses on national security interests. Resilience: the ability to reduce relevant risks to an acceptable level by means of a set of measures to prevent cyber incidents and, if they do occur, to detect them, limit the damage and facilitate recovery. What constitutes an acceptable level of resilience is determined by a risk assessment. The risk assessment can help with the selec- tion of the right technical, procedural or organisational measures. Risk: the chance that a threat could lead to a cyber incident and the impact on the interests concerned. Both are viewed in relation to the current level of cyber resilience.

For more definitions of cybersecurity terms (in Dutch), please refer to the Cybersecurity Alliantie’s Cybersecu- rity Dictionary. Appendices | 55 System failure: a situation in which one or more digital processes are disrupted due to natural or technological causes or as a result of human error. Threat: a cyber incident that could occur or a combination of simultaneous or successive cyber incidents. Other terms Central government: central government comprises 12 ministries, many implementing agencies and services, various inspectorates and the High Councils of State. Civil society organisations: civil society organisations operate in a field of activity between government, mar- ket and community. As a rule, they are non-profit-making organisations with a social purpose. This strategy uses the term to refer to foundations and partnerships which help to boost cybersecurity in the Netherlands and other countries. Combating cybercrime: efforts to combat crime in which a computer system is attacked or misused for the purpose of criminal activity. Combating cybercrime is an integral part of the cybersecurity approach. Government: the government as a whole consists of central government, provinces, municipalities and water authorities. Multi-factor authentication: method used to determine whether a user or digital system is actually who or what they claim/it claims to be. This can be done in various ways. One example is a password and a code that the user receives via SMS. Another is a combination of a fingerprint and a password. Organisations: the totality of government bodies, companies, knowledge institutions and civil society organi- sations. Phishing: attack in which the perpetrator tricks someone into revealing important information, such as login data or credit card details. Phishing is usually done via emails, but perpetrators also do it by phone, text mes- sage or in-app messages. Public values: a reflection of what society regards as key values, such as security, democracy, self-determina- tion, non-discrimination, participation, privacy and inclusion. Safety region: an area in which different authorities and services collaborate on tasks relating to fire services, disaster control, crisis management, medical assistance, law enforcement and public order. The Netherlands has 25 safety regions. Security by default: this means that the configuration is based on the highest protection. Security by design: this means that security is factored in at the design phase. 54 | Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028 31 The emphasis in this pillar lies on tackling state actors and criminals as they pose the main threat to Dutch interests. This does not detract from the fact that other malicious actors, such as hacktivists, also pose a potential threat. Where relevant, activities that help to achieve the aims in this pillar could also be useful in tackling other malicious actors. 32 See also the aims in Pillar I. 33 See also the aims in Pillar I. 34 Besides the specified organisations, there are also other investigation services which could, in specific cases, play a part in detecting, tackling and disrupting malicious actors. These services include Customs, the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) and the Royal Military and Bor- der Police. 35 As a last resort, the Ministry of Defence can provide additio- nal sustainment capability in support of the civil authorities, in both normal and exceptional circumstances. 36 United Nations General Assembly resolution (A/RES/53/79) concerning ‘Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international secu- rity’, 1998. 37 United Nations, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyber- space in the context of international security’, 2021; United Nations, ‘Open-ended working group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security: final substantive report’, 2021. 38 NCTV, ‘Cybersecurity Assessment for the Netherlands’, 2022 39 Behavioural Insights Network Netherlands, ‘Gedragsadvie- zen: Gedragswetenschappelijk perspectief op vijf grote maatschappelijke vraagstukken: klimaat, digitalisering, kansengelijkheid, wonen en niet-gebruik van voorzienin- gen’ Behavioural recommendations (Behavioural science approach to five major issues facing society: climate, digita- lisation, equal opportunities, housing and non-use of services) (in Dutch), 2022. 40 Statistics Netherlands (CBS), ‘De Veiligheidsmonitor 2022’ (Safety Monitor 2022) (in Dutch). 41 This pillar is closely related to combating cybercrime, as also discussed in Pillar IV. 42 Cybersecurity Council, ‘Integrated approach to cyber resi- lience’, 2021. 43 Dutch Safety Board, ‘Vulnerable through software - Lessons resulting from security breaches relating to Citrix software’, 2021. 44 In line with the motion submitted by Mustafa Amhaouch et al about an analysis of the effectiveness of initiatives to resolve personnel shortfalls in the technology sector (Parlia- mentary Papers, House of Representatives, 2021-2022, 35925 XIII, no. 38)). 45 Cybersecurity Council, ‘CSR Recommendation Letter concer- ning focus of and approach to the evaluation of the NCSA’, 2020. 46 47 Parliamentary Papers, House of Representatives, 2020- 2021, 26643, no. 763. 48 For allocation by ministry, see the budgetary overview in the coalition agreement ‘Confidence in the Future’, 2017. 49 Some actions are based on the implementation of Euro- pean law, such as NIS2, CER and CRA, for which negotiations are still ongoing.

	"original document": "Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2028   Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy    2022-2028  Ambitions and actions for a digitally secure society     Foreword   |  32  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Foreword   The internet has changed our lives dramatically. We  live and work online. In many respects this makes our  lives easier, and the economic advantages are obvi- ous. It’s important that companies and the public can  enjoy the full benefit of our digital society and eco- nomy, and for that, security is vital.   Security in the digital world, however, still lags far  behind that in the physical world. Anyone buying a  car knows that it meets all kinds of safety and quality  requirements. And the buyer knows exactly what  they are expected to do in order to drive the vehicle:  hold a valid driving licence, refrain from drinking  alcohol and undergo an annual vehicle test.   Things are very different in the digital world. In the  design of many digital systems, security is still not the  main priority. For decades, responsibility for that  security has rested with end users, such as individual  consumers and small businesses and organisations.  But many of those end users are in practice comple- tely unable to meet that responsibility. They do not  know, for example, how to update a Wi-Fi router, and  they struggle with system security, privacy require- ments, and so on.   Meanwhile, the risks keep growing. As a highly deve- loped society, the Netherlands is rapidly becoming  more and more dependent on digital systems. But  even in more mature organisations, tech companies  and government organisations, system security  depends on the actions of individuals. Whole systems  may go down if one employee opens a phishing  email or fails to install the right security.   The government believes that the one-sided focus on  individual responsibility is a dead-end street, and has  chosen to take a different route to a digitally secure  ecosystem. On behalf of the government I am there- fore presenting a new cybersecurity strategy which  contains the following priorities:   1. Understanding the threat. The government will invest in people and systems that provide a clearer picture of the origin of threats and whom they are directed at.  2. More cybersecurity specialists. We will take vari- ous measures to bring more ICT specialists to the labour market.  3. Government and sectors taking responsibility. Responsibility for security will be transferred in part from end users to the government and speci- fic sectors. The most mature and most key organisations will bear the greatest responsibili- ties. Robust government-wide statutory security requirements will be arranged, together with com- pliance monitoring.  4. Better supervision and the necessary legislation. Reorganising responsibilities requires an expan- sion of statutory rules and supervision. Security must become the basis on which new systems are founded. New rules will be introduced for central and subnational government authorities, critical providers and suppliers of digital products and ser- vices.

Almost 96% of these   connections was for a smartphone, 90% of   which were also used to access the internet.   Over 15 million people have one or more   social media accounts.  The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS) is the   result of a broad partnership between public, private   and civil society organisations, coordinated by the   National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Secu-  rity (NCTV).

Clear information via a national cyber authority.  A new central cyber authority will be established in  the Netherlands: the national Cybersecurity Inci- dent Response Team. This new organisation will  collaborate with public and private partners to  provide critical and non-critical organisations,  government authorities and the public with infor- mation relating to cyber incidents (or potential  incidents) to enable them to protect themselves.     This strategy sets out the government’s ambitions for  the next six years. In the first phase, we will be inves- ting heavily in the General Intelligence and Security  Service (AIVD) and the Defence Intelligence and Secu- rity Service (MIVD), in the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) and in reinforcing the Netherlands’   nationwide network of cybersecurity partnerships  (LDS) that provide organisations with security advice,  and in strengthening the cyber resilience of specific  sectors.    This is a shared responsibility of all parties in the  cyber domain, and one that requires targeted public- private cooperation. I am therefore most grateful to  all the public bodies, private parties and academic  institutions – especially the members of the Cyber  Security Council – that contributed to the  development of this strategy. Keep up the good work  as we move forward with implementation!    Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, Minister of Justice and   Security     Introduction and context         In producing the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS), the government’s aim is  to achieve a digitally secure Netherlands. That will enable us as a country to  capitalise safely on the economic and social opportunities presented by  digitalisation and, at the same time, to safeguard our security and public values. The  Netherlands is one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.  Increasingly, we are working, shopping and meeting each other online. Digital  systems now form the ‘central nervous system’ of our society. That presents society  with countless opportunities, but it also poses risks.   butes to the digital resilience of the system as a  whole.    This is the great challenge for the coming years. The  digital ecosystem is now so interconnected and com- plex that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for  individual organisations and people to fathom it  completely, while it is precisely this ecosystem that  powers our modern way of life, our economy and  society as a whole. Criminals and malicious states  take advantage of this complexity by lurking in the  shadows and exploiting digital vulnerabilities to  attack our public values.    Against this backdrop, the government observes that  the increased importance and complexity of the digi- tal ecosystem are no longer commensurate with the  autonomous way in which the cyber landscape has  evolved in recent years. The ecosystem therefore  needs to be adapted to the new reality. In the current  system, a single phishing email or lost password can  have a huge impact. This is because part of the res- ponsibility for risk management for an entire  ecosystem, including critical sectors and processes,  lies with the least digitally mature participants: indi- viduals, small businesses and local authorities. Many  of the more mature organisations, tech companies   Introduction and context   |  76  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Recent history has shown that cyber incidents, such  as ransomware attacks, are now commonplace  occurrences. As a result, cybersecurity is now largely  perceived from the point of view of the threat, and  thus in terms of risks. Which hackers need to be stop- ped? What vulnerabilities need to be patched? How  can information about cyber threats be shared more  quickly and more efficiently? How can organised  cybercrime, such as ransomware attacks, be tackled  effectively? How can potential victims be notified in  time (provided the necessary information is availa- ble)? These are just some of the many relevant  challenges which need to be overcome and which  form part of this strategy.    We must not forget, however, that the ultimate  objective is to safeguard our public values. We want  to create an open, free, stable and secure digital  world in which companies and individuals can partici- pate as securely as in the physical world.  Cybersecurity is an investment in our future and must  not simply be regarded as an expense. To achieve  this, we must realise that each element of the digital  ecosystem, be it specific technology, an organisation,  an information system, a digital product or a person,  forms part of a globally interconnected network. The  cybersecurity of all those individual elements contri-  Increasing digitalisation provides the world of   education with many opportunities, such as   offering online lectures and unlocking vast   reserves of knowledge. At the same time, this   increased dependence on technology entails   risks. In recent years, various universities have   been the targets of ransomware attacks.    Introduction and context   |  9  and government organisations are working towards a  more secure and stable internet, but at the same time  implicitly assume that individuals are capable of deci- ding what security they should install and know how  to use a password manager. It goes without saying  that cyber hygiene is and will remain an essential  issue for everyone, but from a systemic perspective  this will not be enough to guarantee the continued  resilience of our digital interests. The government has  a duty to ensure that the ecosystem contributes to  and serves our public values, and meets the cyberse- curity requirements within it.    Many digital systems, services and processes were  not designed on the basis of cybersecurity and risk  management (i.e. on the basis of security by design  and security by default). This means that end users  are responsible for keeping our systems digitally  secure. In other sectors, ecosystems have evolved  over the years into a balanced composition of instru- ments, such as statutory security requirements,  certifications, warranties and mandatory training.  Similar structures will eventually be created for the  cybersecurity of digital products and services too.    The government is therefore committed to streng- thening and transforming the digital ecosystem so  that no single organisation or individual can be the  weakest link any more. This requires a reorganisation  of the responsibilities of all players in the ecosystem,  so that the relevant rights and obligations are alloca- ted to the right parties. To achieve this, we need to  deploy a well-balanced combination of instruments,  from more intensive public-private partnerships to  new legislation, designed to create an ecosystem in  which businesses and the public can in principle pur- chase secure products and services.    In the context of the European digital single market  and the pursuit of a level playing field and secure  internet-of-things products and services, the govern- ment is concentrating its efforts on the development  of European legislation. Various legal measures have  now been taken and initiatives launched to make this  happen.     We will eventually need to arrive at a situation in  which every party involved in the digital ecosystem  has a clear understanding of their contribution to the  security and stability of the whole. This requires a  system transformation. No single party can do this  alone, not even the government. It will be a joint  effort in which all parties contribute to the transfor- mation. And that will require obligations and  commitments. Cybersecurity will always be a respon- sibility shared among those who build our digital  infrastructure, those who manage it and those who  use it. This requires collaboration as well as robust  coordination to achieve cohesion of effort and ensure  that those efforts ultimately amount to more than  the sum of their parts.     In this strategy, the government sets out its vision of  a digitally secure Netherlands, where companies and  the public can benefit fully from participation in the  digital society, without having to worry about cyber  risks. That is the ultimate goal. For some themes,  achieving this vision will span multiple government  terms or even remain an ongoing pursuit. The  government will use the strategic aims and the action  plan to set out how it will advance the achievement  of this vision over the coming years. Phasing, prioriti- sation and decision-making will be necessary, as  achieving a digitally secure Netherlands will take  years. Not all ambitions will be realised in the short or  medium term. In cases where additional resources  are required, the government will opt at this stage for  structural investment in the AIVD and the MIVD with  a view to getting a better handle on the threat.  Resources will also be made available to boost the  Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships,  partly through the further development of the NCSC  into a national CSIRT, and partly through the centra- lisation of government organisations in the chain  wherever possible and in the public interest. Lastly,  resources will be provided for ministries with major  sectoral challenges to enable them to boost cyber  resilience in the sectors concerned. Generally spea- king, there is sufficient funding for the  implementation of the actions set out in the action  plan. If, however, there is a need for follow-up steps   8  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   or supplementary processes, legislative or otherwise,  as a result of the actions, additional resources will  need to be found. The appendices contain a more  detailed explanation of the financial basis for this  strategy.    This strategy will also show what can be expected  from the government in concrete terms, as well as  what it is accountable for.      Cooperation in the cybersecurity  domain    The strategy has been produced with the extensive  involvement of many public, private and civil society  organisations, and builds on previous government- wide cybersecurity strategies published in 2011, 2013  and 2018. All ministries are working together and  with public and private partners to set out and imple- ment the strategy. The Minister of Justice and  Security is the coordinating minister for cybersecurity,  is responsible for tackling cybercrime, and is in charge  of implementing this strategy and monitoring the  process. However, each party retains its own tasks  and responsibilities for achieving the cybersecurity  goals. Lastly, the strategy is closely aligned with the  government’s efforts in the area of digitalisation,  which are led by the State Secretary for Kingdom  Relations and Digitalisation, as set out in the  framework letter of 8 March 2022 on this subject.1      Cybersecurity: the full spectrum of measures  designed to reduce relevant cyber risks to an  acceptable level. This also includes dealing with  risks of damage to or failure of digital systems  and the availability, integrity and confidentiality  of data. Measures may focus on the prevention  of cyber incidents and – if a cyber incident does  occur – on detection, damage limitation and  recovery. What constitutes an acceptable level of  risk will be determined in a risk assessment.2    Cyber resilience: the ability to reduce relevant  risks to an acceptable level by means of a set of  measures to prevent cyber incidents and, if they  do occur, to detect them, limit the damage and  facilitate recovery. What constitutes an accepta- ble level of resilience is determined by a risk  assessment. This can help with the selection of  the right technical, procedural or organisational  measures.3    Cybercrime prevention: efforts to prevent crime  in which a computer system is attacked or mis- used for the purpose of criminal activity.  Cybercrime prevention is an integral part of the  cybersecurity approach.       10  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Cyber risks have not diminished    Within the broad domain of digitalisation, the central  goal is to achieve a secure, inclusive digital society  with a wealth of opportunities for all Dutch people.  The importance of digital processes is growing  because of technological developments and far-rea- ching digitalisation. For that digital transformation to  succeed, cybersecurity is an essential requirement.4  Digital processes are the central nervous system of  society and the economy: they cannot function pro- perly without them. Digital security is thus  inextricably linked to six national security interests:  territorial security, physical security, economic secu- rity, ecological security, social and political stability  and the international legal order.5 An attack on critical  processes, such as electricity or drinking water sup- plies, shipping or financial transactions, could bring  society to a temporary or even enduring standstill.        Figure 1: Cyber risks are determined by the relationship  between interests, threats to those interests and resilience in  the face of such threats   The digital threat is here to stay and is more likely to  increase than to diminish, with all the repercussions  that entails. The threat could be posed either by a  cyberattack or a digital system failure. Such a failure  could be the result of natural or technical causes, or  the result of human error. State actors and cybercri- minals constitute the main threat in terms of  malicious actions, and are not always distinguishable  from each other because of their interwoven relati- ons. State actors may hire, allow or pressurise  cybercriminals to perpetrate cyberattacks on desig- nated targets.6 Cyberattacks by state actors are no  longer unusual.     National cybersecurity task   |  11  1. National cybersecurity task         This chapter gives an overview of current and future challenges in relation to  cybersecurity, which form the basis for the pillars and aims of the Netherlands  Cybersecurity Strategy. In order to produce a widely supported strategy, parties with  a major cybersecurity role, both within and outside government, were involved at  various stages.   Interests  Threats Resilience  Risks  The Port of Rotterdam has one of the   Netherlands’ most advanced ICT systems,   comprising a dedicated infrastructure designed   to connect terminals, depots and distribution   centres. This makes it possible to see exactly   where a container is located at any given time.   But it also creates a great deal of   interdependence. This became all too clear in   2019, when a hacker attack on shipping giant   Maersk’s systems completely paralysed all   container transport.      Market dynamics complicate cyber risk management.  Supply and demand for digital services, hardware  (and components), software and networks converge  on digital markets. These markets have a number of  unique characteristics, such as the semi-monopolistic  status of certain suppliers, the high level of  interdependence and the focus on gathering as much  data as possible. Moreover, incentives for digital  security are not always the overriding concern in  these markets. These factors complicate risk  management for individuals, organisations, sectors  and countries alike.    Coordinated and integrated risk management is still in its  infancy. Coordinated and integrated risk management  within and between the organisational, sectoral and  national levels is still in its infancy. Cyber risks have  not yet been given a definitive place in broader risk  management within and between these levels. Risk  management is not yet a given, even though a risk- based approach plays a big role in determining and  achieving the desired level of resilience. Of course,  many organisations do have the appropriate risk  management in place, but in many cases it is not  embedded in organisations’ primary process.9     There is also an overarching theme that affects all the  others: restrictions in digital autonomy also limit cyber  resilience.10 European countries, including the Nether- lands, are subject to restrictions in digital autonomy.  That autonomy includes the Netherlands’ ability and  means to make independent choices about ongoing  digitalisation, as well as the desired level of cyber  resilience. This autonomy is restricted by various fac- tors, which relate to the strategic themes referred to  above; they limit the options for influencing and  making decisions about the country’s cyber  resilience, and they reduce the country’s control over  that resilience. Despite their diverse nature, each of  these themes, both separately and in association,  illustrates the complications for strategic risk  management.        Need for an integrated approach to  cyber resilience    Over the past few years, various authoritative organi- sations have issued recommendations to the  government on the subject of cybersecurity and on  how to boost cyber resilience. These recommendati- ons, in addition to the strategic themes listed above,  were taken into account in the creation of this stra- tegy. A wide-ranging group of stakeholders was also  asked – by means of a questionnaire and in work ses- sions11– to identify further challenges.12 This resulted  in the following key additional insights which have  been incorporated in this strategy.     •    There is a growing ‘cyber resilience gap’ between   organisations. Some organisations have their  cybersecurity in order, but others do not.   •    Demand for cybersecurity expertise is expected to  continue rising, leading to a shortfall of qualified  personnel.   •    It has been observed that responsibilities in the  Dutch cybersecurity system are not currently  clearly allocated or clearly defined, which obstructs  effective cooperation.   •    In recent years, information-sharing has been  found to be fragmented, and as a result threat  information has not always reached all organisati- ons in time to enable them to take the necessary  measures.   •    Organisations have limited oversight of the risks of  and damage resulting from failure of digital sys- tems and there is a lack of data on the scale of  damage caused by technical faults or human error.   •    The practice of learning from incidents in  cyberspace is still in development.   •    There is still too little scientific cybersecurity know- ledge and innovation reaching the market.   •    The development of international norms surroun- ding cybersecurity is challenging, and the  formulation, adoption and implementation of  international norms for state responsibility are  proceeding slowly.   National cybersecurity task  |  13  State actors can use a broad range of digital resour- ces for this purpose: influencing and interference  (including the dissemination of disinformation);  espionage, including economic and political espio- nage; preparatory action for attacks and actual  disruption and sabotage. According to the AIVD, the  threat of offensive cyber programmes against the  Netherlands and against Dutch interests remains high  and will only increase in the future.7 Cybercriminals  are also still capable of inflicting serious damage on  digital processes. They are motivated by money and  are not intent on disrupting society, but their attacks  can nonetheless have such an impact that they adver- sely affect national interests. The threat posed by  hacktivists is relatively low, but could affect Dutch  interests indirectly.    In recent years it has become clear that the level of  cyber resilience in the Netherlands is insufficient.8  Despite efforts to boost resilience, there is a disparity  between the growing threat and the development of  resilience. Complete imperviousness to cyber threats  is impossible, but boosting resilience to system failu- res and misuse is the most important tool for  managing cyber risks. Cyber resilience is not yet at  the desired level across the board because basic mea- sures have not been sufficiently implemented. There  are major differences in resilience levels within and  between sectors and supply chains.          Complications of risk management  pose a threat to society    The 2022 Cybersecurity Assessment for the  Netherlands (CSBN2022) includes strategic themes  which have been identified in collaboration with part- ners and which are relevant for the Netherlands’ digital  security, now and in the future:    Risks are the downside of a digital society. Dutch society is  highly digitised. That has a downside: reliance on digi- tal processes has made us vulnerable to system  failures and to the activities of those with malicious  intent. Chain reactions can affect entire sectors or even  society as a whole. The disruption of digital processes  can also have physical consequences.     Cyberspace is an arena for regional and global dominance.  Digital security is closely linked to geopolitics. States  are using cyberspace constantly and intensively to pro- mote their own geopolitical interests. Cyberattacks,  such as those used to gather political and economic  intelligence, are an important instrument in that res- pect; they are relatively inexpensive and scalable, and  they have a significant, often long-term impact. Even  the ultimate form of geopolitical conflict – war – invol- ves cyberattacks. Attribution is also a difficult issue.  Individuals, organisations, sectors and countries can  do little to influence these geopolitical rivalries, even  though they serve to heighten the risks.    Cybercrime is industrially scalable, while resilience – for now  – is not. Serious, organised cybercrime has become  highly scalable and has thus taken on industrial pro- portions in recent years in terms of victims, damage  and criminal proceeds. Ransomware has proved to be  a gamechanger in this regard. Serious cybercriminals  and their service providers are primarily motivated by  money and aim for maximum profit, happily exploi- ting the opportunities offered by cyberspace. Given  the nature and growing scale of the cybercrime threat,  the task of making and keeping the chain of resilience  scalable will be a fundamental challenge in the years  ahead.   12  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     National cybersecurity task   |  15  •    Awareness among small organisations and the  public of the need to protect themselves against  cyber threats is still too limited.     An integrated approach to cybersecurity is required  to overcome these challenges.  will allow information to be shared ever more  widely, efficiently and effectively between  organisations resulting in better provision of  information to their target groups.      • In 2020 the Cyber Intel/Info Cell (CIIC) was   established. This is a body in which the AIVD,  the MIVD, the NCSC, the Public Prosecution  Service and the National Police assemble  threat information, and staff from these orga- nisations evaluate the information jointly.  This makes it possible to both form a picture  of new threats and offer organisations poten- tial courses of action more rapidly.      • The National Detection Network has been   expanded in recent years, enabling steps to be  taken in the detection and monitoring of  threats within central government and critical  infrastructure.     • The new dcypher platform was officially laun-  ched in 2021. Dcypher is the place where  public, private and knowledge-based stake- holders, resources and expertise converge to  ensure effective engagement in cybersecurity  education, research, innovation and concrete  applications.      14  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Looking back on enhancing cyber resilience under the National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA)   • The Network and Information Systems (Secu- rity) Act (WBNI) came into force in 2018.  Among other things, it provides that  operators of essential services and digital ser- vice providers are obliged to take appropriate  and proportionate technical and organisatio- nal measures in relation to cybersecurity.      • The Digital Trust Centre (DTC) was also set up   in 2018 so that non-critical companies too  had a point of contact for cybersecurity  issues. The DTC provides information and  advice and encourages the establishment of  cybersecurity partnerships.     • With the bill on promoting cybersecurity in   the business sector and the establishment of  an information service, the DTC made a start  on receiving and sharing information about  digital threats and risks with companies.      • The Civil Service Strategic Information   Agenda 2019-2021 focused on strengthening  the government-wide information-security  pillar.      • Setting up and strengthening a nationwide   system of cybersecurity partnerships (LDS)          The end of the Dutch public transport smart   card is in sight. Soon it will be possible to check   in with your debit or credit card or smartphone   when boarding a train, bus or tram, which   should make both travel and payments more   convenient. An innovation of this scale is quite   an undertaking: more than 60,000 entry gates   and card readers need to be modified.  Vision    In the future, society will be fully digitised: our way of  life is already closely interwoven with cyberspace.  The risk of abuses, such as those perpetrated by state  or criminal actors, or of process failures, form the  downside of this digital society. Cyber resilience,  including combating cybercrime, is essential for  society and the economy to function. It is not simply  a cost; it is a profitable investment. Cyber resilience  offers competitive advantages and boosts the invest- ment climate, innovation and employment.   By producing this strategy, the government is  working towards a future in which the imbalance  between the cyber threat and cyber resilience is kept  to a minimum. In this vision of the future, cybersecu- rity is at a level commensurate with the threat and  with the importance of ensuring the continuity, inte- grity and reliability of digital systems and processes.  Cyber threats will also be identified and dealt with.  Lastly, society will be resilient: there will be sufficient  redundancy and recovery capability to absorb the  repercussions of cyber threats, such as a system fai- lure.      The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone   |  17  2. The vision: digital security is a   given – for everyone          The vision underlying the strategy describes what a digitally secure Netherlands  should look like in the future. That is our ultimate goal.       6. In respect of countering cyber threats posed  by state actors and criminals:  a. The underlying strategic choice with regard   to tackling cybercrime consists of two ele- ments: efforts involving the investigation,  prosecution and disruption of cybercrimin- als, and efforts involving the prevention of  cybercrime.14     7. Cyber risks for members of the public will be   minimised by largely removing responsibilities   for the security of digital products and services  from small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs) and individuals, and placing them with  government, manufacturers and service sup- pliers. Members of the public and SMEs will  thus be relieved of this burden.     8. The government will use objective criteria to   manage the distribution of scarce cybersecu- rity and ICT expertise in a crisis, as part of the  National Crisis Plan for Digital Incidents.      The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone   |  19    Underlying strategic choices    1. In respect of the Nationwide Network of   Cybersecurity Partnerships:   a. There will be a single national CSIRT, which   will incorporate the NCSC, DTC and CSIRT- DSP. This will be the central cyber authority  of the Netherlands.13   b. The government will lead and coordinate  this process. That means centralised where  possible, decentralised/sectoral where  necessary.   c. More coordination of development of the  nationwide network on the basis of added  value and desired effect;   d. The government will collaborate and ope- rate decisively. Up-to-date knowledge and  information about cyber threats, incidents,  trends and vulnerabilities must be made  available to partners in the nationwide net- work (LDS) to enable them to take action.  The government will take the lead in this  regard.   e. Information-sharing will be based on possi- ble courses of action. There will be  differentiation in advice and information  and information-sharing, appropriate to  organisations’ level of maturity and in com- prehensible language.   f. ‘Large helps small’: nationwide network  partners are responsible for supplying and  picking up information and thus can help  boost resilience within their respective  chains and sectors.   g. There are clear points of contact within the  nationwide network, and solutions for gaps  relating to the points above will be sought  with private parties.     2. It should be possible to alert anyone in the   Netherlands who is a (potential) victim or  target of a cyberattack.   3. In respect of legislation:  a. European legislation where possible, sup-  plementary national legislation where  necessary.   b. New legislation will form the framework in  which the system can operate effectively  and coherently.   c. Regulate market failures in relation to secu- rity through legislation.   d. Cybersecurity measures and requirements  are proportionate and are differentiated  according to the interest a company repre- sents and its level of maturity. Life will be  made as easy as possible for SMEs.   e. Robust, government-wide statutory secu- rity requirements and compliance  monitoring will be arranged.     4. In respect of collaboration:   a. Public-private where possible, public where  necessary.   b. No more commitment-free partnerships.  Collaboration is voluntary but not free of  obligation.   c. ‘Large helps small’ – the strongest/most  mature organisations help the less  strong/mature organisations (public-public,  public-private and private-private).     5. In respect of knowledge and innovation:   a. Through the collaboration platform dcypher  and via thematic roadmaps and communi- ties, the government will foster discussions  between knowledge institutions and the  business community regarding the high- end knowledge development needed to  generate innovative knowledge and  product development. Dcypher can play a  facilitating and driving role in the quest for  funding for that development.   18  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Public values are key  In cyberspace, public values and fundamental rights  need to be safeguarded at all times. This includes res- ponsible use of data and responsible behaviour in the  digital domain by government organisations. When  exercising powers in the interests of national and  international digital security, careful consideration  must always be given to the balance between collec- tive security on the one hand and individual  fundamental rights and public values on the other.  Statutory requirements, such as proportionality and  subsidiarity, must take precedence when it comes to  guaranteeing public values such as privacy, security  and non-discrimination.    Role and responsibility of central government  People should be able to expect the same security in  cyberspace as in the physical domain. Cyber risks for  members of the public will be minimised by largely  removing responsibilities for the security of digital  products and services from individuals and placing  them with suppliers and manufacturers.    People should also be able to count on reliable ser- vice provision by companies and public authorities in  cyberspace. Central government is responsible for  creating a system in which organisations can take  appropriate measures to strengthen their cyber resi- lience and thus guarantee the continuity and  reliability of their services. Central government does   this by raising awareness, providing information and  giving clear and consistent advice on risk  management, implementing resilience measures,  preparing for incidents and, if necessary, providing  support. The level of intervention is determined by  the risk to which organisations are exposed, by the  organisation’s level of maturity and by the impact  such support would have. The assessment will be  clear and transparent.    Central government also encourages and helps com- panies and other organisations to make the same  assessment vis-à-vis their own target groups, inclu- ding consumers. Partnerships, organisations and  public authorities exchange information within the  Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships so  that they can all provide customised services for their  own target groups. To avoid fragmentation and save  time, a single national CSIRT has been established,  through which information can be channelled straight  to vulnerable or at-risk organisations wherever possi- ble. Operational expertise is pooled within central  government and deployed jointly wherever possible.  In the future, cybersecurity experts from government  will work with the business community and ICT and  cybersecurity service providers, in some cases at the  same physical location. This will enable them to pool  information, knowledge and expertise in order to  safeguard cyber resilience and ensure a common stra- tegy for – and response to – cyber incidents or threats.       other organisations in which information is gathered,  analysed and shared with clients. The provision of  help and support to organisations is also a joint  effort. Cybersecurity service providers are on hand to  make their services available and are working with  the government to foster the cyber resilience of orga- nisations at home and abroad.    International cooperation  Cyber incidents do not stop at national borders, so  the government actively exploits the opportunities  offered by cooperation within and outside the Euro- pean Union. The Netherlands is driving cooperation  between EU member states and is thus contributing  to a digitally secure and, where necessary,  autonomous EU. This approach serves to tackle  cross-border cyber risks and it allows a coordinated  response to major cyber incidents and crises within  and outside the EU. Constant efforts are being made  through cyber-diplomatic means – including capacity  building – to reinforce and expand the international  coalition driving responsible state behaviour in cyber- space.     The vision: digital security is a given – for everyone   |  21  Central government provides the framework in which  the system can function effectively and coherently. To  this end, it deploys a well-balanced combination of  instruments, such as legislation (national and EU),  financial support or incentives (tax advantages, sub- sidies), skills training, etc. It also serves as launching  customer for secure-by-design innovations.    Digitally resilient companies, public authorities  and organisations  In the government’s vision, companies, public autho- rities and civil society organisations are in principle  able to determine independently, in collaboration  with each other or with the help of ICT or cybersecu- rity service providers, what risks they face in  cyberspace and what measures they need to take to  adequately manage those risks. Digital risk manage- ment has become a common good and is now  expected from all organisations: by their clients and  consumers, as well as by insurers and shareholders,  for example.    Given the importance of critical infrastructure for our  society to function, these responsible organisations  have a high level of resilience. Partly because of Euro- pean legislation, the government imposes additional  requirements on these organisations. This means  that measures are sometimes imposed to mitigate  risks to national security even if they do not directly  serve the commercial interests of an organisation or  company.    A digitally secure and innovative economy  Clients and consumers can rest assured that all digital  products and services will be properly protected  throughout their specified life-cycle. Organisations  negotiate resilience measures with suppliers. Manu- facturers and suppliers have a duty of care in relation  to cybersecurity measures for the entire life-cycle of  their products and services, partly because of Euro- pean legislation. It is also possible for clients and  consumers to find out about the cyber resilience of  companies from which they buy products or services,  for example through certification or reports.     In the development and application of new technolo- gies, security by design and security by default are  always the guiding principles. Furthermore, in the  purchasing and procurement of digital products and  services, the risk of espionage, influencing or sabo- tage by state actors is assessed as standard.    The Netherlands has sufficient cybersecurity exper- tise, both in terms of resilience and in relation to  cybercrime prevention, thanks to both a growing  supply of experts on the labour market and the targe- ted stimulation of innovation.    Countering cyber threats  Together with the business community, the govern- ment has a clear understanding of the cyber threat  emanating from within and beyond the Netherlands’  borders and has its detection mechanisms in order.  Most importantly, the Netherlands is capable of limi- ting cyberattacks by state and non-state actors,  thanks to the use of broad-based attribution and res- ponse mechanisms, ideally in partnerships and  coalitions with EU countries, NATO Allies and other  like-minded nations. The government will intervene  in identified attacks in order to minimise adverse  effects for the Netherlands, repair any damage and  address vulnerabilities.    Cybercrime will no longer pay to the same extent.  The police and the Public Prosecution Service are tar- geting cybercriminals and their service providers with  a broad, scalable and innovative approach which inc- reases the likelihood of catching perpetrators and of  effectively disrupting criminal activity, prevents crimi- nal behaviour and eliminates criminal proceeds.  Besides investigation and criminal prosecution, the  Netherlands can also use other means of  intervention, such as disruption capabilities, victim  notification and/or damage limitation. Victims and/or  targets can thus be given advance notification where- ver possible.    The government is not tackling this threat alone but  in a network of public and private cybersecurity and   20  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     Aims   |  23  3. Aims       To make this vision a reality, aims have been formulated on the basis of four   pillars. Those aims offer a response to the current and future challenges set out   in Chapter 2.   22  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028        Pillar I     Cyber resilience of the government,  businesses and civil society  organisations       Pillar II     Secure and innovative digital  products and services       Pillar III     Countering cyber threats posed by  states and criminals       Pillar IV     Cybersecurity labour market, education  and cyber resilience of the public  This pillar concerns the cyber resilience of the  government, businesses and civil society  organisations, focusing on the ability to reduce  risks to an acceptable level using a collection of  measures to prevent cyber incidents and, if  cyber incidents do occur, the ability to minimise  damage and facilitate recovery.        Aims  • Organisations have a clear picture of cyber   incidents, threats and risks and know how to  deal with them.   • Organisations are properly protected against  cybersecurity risks and are mindful of their  own importance to the sector and other  organisations in the chain.   • Organisations respond to and recover and  learn from cyber incidents and crises swiftly  and efficiently.      This pillar focuses on the suppliers and  consumers of digital products and services, and  on boosting cybersecurity knowledge  development and innovation. Working towards  a secure and innovative digital economy  contributes to the digital security and earning  capacity of the Netherlands.        Aims  • Digital products and services are more secure.  • The Netherlands has a robust cybersecurity   knowledge and innovation chain.         This pillar focuses on the national and  international approach to combating malicious  actors that pose a threat, and on gaining a  clearer picture of the cyber threat landscape,  thus providing a basis for appropriate action.  The government has a particular responsibility  here and has a range of instruments with which  to address the cyber threat.      Aims  • The Netherlands has a clear understanding of   cyber threats posed by states and criminals.  • The Netherlands has a handle on the cyber   threats posed by states and criminals.  • States adhere to the normative framework   for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.         This pillar focuses on the human being behind  the technology and the cyber resilience of the  public. Society as a whole has an important role  to play in terms of developing digital skills, from  basic knowledge and skills to high-level  expertise and specialist cybersecurity skills.          Aims  • The public are properly protected against   cyber risks.  • Members of the public respond to cyber   incidents swiftly and efficiently.  • School pupils are taught digital skills, with an   emphasis on security.  • The Dutch labour market can meet the   growing demand for cybersecurity experts.           further to become the national Cybersecurity Incident  Response Team (CSIRT). The NCSC, the DTC and the  CSIRT for digital service providers will be merged to  form a single organisation. Greater cohesion between  existing organisations will also be created by stimula- ting integration wherever it is useful. For all existing  sectoral CERTs and CSIRTs, central government is the- refore exploring the extent to which greater  cooperation, cohesion or amalgamation with the  NCSC would add value. In principle, new CSIRTs are  established only where they have added value.18    The range of the system is being extended to every  corner of society in order to unlock as far as possible  the current situational picture, threat information  and victim information available to the government,  businesses and civil society organisations.  Specifically, the system is being further developed  and expanded for the benefit of all layers of govern- ment, such as municipalities, provinces, water  authorities, implementing organisations and safety  regions.        Further development of the Nationwide  Network of Cybersecurity Partnerships  (LDS)    The purpose of the LDS is to enable public and  private organisations to boost their resilience  level and thus their impact by sharing cybersecu- rity information widely, efficiently and  effectively. It is essential that information- exchange via key organisations generates  courses of action which can help organisations  enhance their resilience.    Those functionalities include information-sha- ring, facilitating and boosting collaboration,  general target group analysis and situational  analysis.          CSIRTs and supervisory authorities will work more  closely with national, as well as European and inter- national partners. At European level, CSIRTs can  benefit from collaboration on technological research  into cybersecurity incidents, development of techno- logical solutions and responses to large-scale cyber  incidents. Supervisory authorities will increase colla- boration at national level to ensure that scarce  capacity is used effectively. In a European context,  efforts will be made to step up cooperation and infor- mation exchange and, where possible, assistance on  cross-border issues.    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    The government has a current and comprehensive   picture of cyber incidents, threats and risks.  •    There is an effective and efficient exchange of   threat information and possible courses of action  between the government and the business sector,  appropriate to the knowledge and skills of the  recipient.   •    The LDS is well coordinated, with clear points of  contact.   •    Government organisations, such as CSIRTs and  supervisory authorities, share information effecti- vely, nationally and internationally.          Aims   |  25  Pillar I: Cyber resilience of the  government, businesses and civil society  organisations   Organisations have a clear picture of  cyber incidents, threats and risks, and  know how to deal with them    To ensure that organisations have a good understan- ding of threats and risks and know how to deal with  them, it is important that they have access to reliable  information. Organisations must be confident that  the government will provide up-to-date expertise  and information about cyber threats, incidents,  trends and vulnerabilities so that they can take the  necessary action.     Government organisations must collaborate more  closely in order to create the most up-to-date situa- tional picture of the cyber risk landscape. This is  essential so that the relevant parties can take preven- tive measures and organise appropriate incident  response, including effective disruption, investigation  and prosecution.16 In order to reach as many organi- sations as possible with information (such as  analyses, phenomenon analyses and courses of  action) about impending cyber incidents and to orga- nise an appropriate response, the government is  working to achieve a detailed level of public-private  information exchange which meets the needs of the  target group as closely as possible. It will also take  account of target groups in which organisations such  as small and medium businesses, associations and  foundations have limited capacity (time, expertise,  resources, network) to apply this information in the  right way.    General information about digital security and speci- fic threat and risk information can be shared within  the Nationwide Network of Cybersecurity  Partnerships (LDS),17 the development of which is  coordinated by the government. The NCSC will evolve   24  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   For our society to function safely and without disrup- tion, digital security is crucial for all businesses, civil  society organisations and government organisations.  Consider the task of keeping the country’s critical  infrastructure permanently available, and the  confidentiality and integrity of processes. Cybersecu- rity allows us to use information and communication  technology successfully and to reap the benefits of  innovation and computerisation. Organisations that  have their cybersecurity in order will protect  company profits, competitiveness, intellectual pro- perty and sensitive client data. Cyber incidents  affecting businesses and public authorities could lead  to a loss of consumer confidence or of public trust in  the government.    The Dutch cybersecurity system, which is designed to  help boost organisations’ cyber resilience, has evol- ved autonomously over recent years into a system of  wide-ranging partnerships in sectors, supply chains  and regions. The positive effect is that cybersecurity  knowledge is now spread widely and sectoral exper- tise has been accumulated. At the same time, this has  also led to fragmentation of activities and responsibi- lities.15 As a result, information about vulnerabilities  or risks does not always reach the relevant organisa- tion in time, if at all. This means that those  organisations are not always able to take the neces- sary steps, and expertise is not deployed optimally.  Legal and organisational obstacles have also hampe- red the effective exchange of information.  Furthermore, it is not always clear to organisations  within and outside government as to what support is  available or where they can go with questions concer- ning digital security.         Critical infrastructure and the government  A high level of cybersecurity is expected from organi- sations within critical infrastructure and government,  and requirements are imposed accordingly. The  government believes it is important to adopt a risk- based approach in which companies and  organisations take measures commensurate with the  risk to the organisation. That starts with an  understanding of the interests at stake, vulnerabili- ties, threats and risks. Setting up a sound risk  management system is essential. Conscious decisions  about this process need to be taken by a director or  senior management board. Organisations are also  expected to take account of risks stemming from  (inter)sectoral dependencies, and of the importance  of other parties’ security (e.g. suppliers in the chain).  Special attention must be paid to operational tech- nology because of its vital importance for the  continuity of our infrastructure, critical and  otherwise.20 Organisations are expected to take con- crete measures to increase the cyber resilience of this  technology. The NCSC and the responsible line mini- stries will help critical infrastructure organisations to  boost their cyber resilience.    The government makes sure that its own systems are  secure, that public services are adequately protected  against cyber incidents and that personal data (sensi- tive or otherwise) is secure. Robust legislation  covering the whole of government, together with  compliance monitoring will be introduced. In the  interest of its own security, central government  encourages digital autonomy with regard to special  products and services.21 Furthermore, central govern- ment constantly monitors vulnerabilities in its own  digital systems and processes. Subnational authori- ties, such as municipalities, provinces, water  authorities and safety regions, are also expected to  be sufficiently resilient; central government organisa- tions and subnational authorities collaborate closely  in this respect.     Some sectors are also subject to additional legislation  that imposes sector-specific cybersecurity  requirements at least as stringent as those set out in  NIS2.22 The line ministries are responsible for drawing  up this sector-specific legislation. The Ministry of Jus- tice and Security ensures that European and national  legislation relating to cybersecurity is developed and  implemented in a harmonised manner.    Insight, supervision and enforcement  Providing insight into and accountability for the  cybersecurity measures that organisations take  should be more of a common good. It should there- fore be easier for stakeholders (e.g. clients,  shareholders and insurers) to get an idea of an orga- nisation’s cybersecurity level. Such transparency  would also allow stakeholders to properly assess the  risk associated with the supplied product or service.  Providing insight into cybersecurity measures would  thus make organisations more commercially attrac- tive, and it could be accomplished by including  cybersecurity in their reports and contracts.23    Under legislation such as the forthcoming NIS2  and/or sectoral legislation, regulated organisations  are currently obliged to account for their cybersecu- rity measures to supervisory authorities, which have  various instruments to encourage organisations  under their supervision to increase and maintain their  resilience. They can assess what measures are pro- portionate and appropriate to the risk an  organisation faces. Supervisory authorities also have  good oversight of the actual resilience of organisati- ons and sectors. At the same time, those authorities  will be confronted by new developments and techno- logical advances that occur in a particular sector or  market and give rise to new cybersecurity issues.       Aims   |  27  Organisations are properly protected  against cyber risks and are mindful of  their own importance to the sector  and other organisations in the chain    All organisations  Commitment from all companies and organisations  is essential for the Netherlands’ digital security, not  only to ensure the continuity of their own service  provision, but also in view of the potentially broader  adverse effects for clients, suppliers or dependent  third parties. Central government will encourage  organisations to implement a basic level of measures  in order to contribute to help boost cyber resilience.   The government is also working on more secure ICT  products and services at European level with the aim  of encouraging and enabling organisations to take  responsibility for their own cybersecurity. To assist  organisations, particularly SMEs, in safeguarding this  basic level of security, the government has an impor- tant role to play by ensuring access to information (in  comprehensible language) and possible courses of  action with regard to cyber threats, for example via  the LDS. There is also a role to be played by branch  organisations and larger or more cybersecurity- mature organisations, given the potential risks  emanating from chain-based and/or sectoral depen- dencies.     26  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Cybersecurity requirements for a greater number of companies (NIS2)     requirements, these organisations need to meet  a high level of cybersecurity. Incidents that have  a significant impact will need to be reported wit- hout undue delay in order to minimise the  adverse effects. Organisations such as the NCSC  and the sectoral supervisory authorities will see  a significant expansion of their tasks as a result  of the implementation of this directive. In the  revised directive, more organisations are desig- nated than is currently the case under the Dutch  Network and Information Systems (Security) Act  (WBNI). When the system for the protection of  critical infrastructure is reviewed, consistency in  national terminology, NIS2 terminology and ter- minology from the EU Directive on the resilience  of critical entities (CER Directive) will be impro- ved. This strategy regards organisations that fall  within the scope of the NIS2 and CER directives  as part of the critical infrastructure.19  Cyber incidents do not stop at national borders,  so the EU is also working to boost digital secu- rity and resilience within the Union. As a result  of the review of the Network and Information  Systems Directive (NIS2), many more sectors  and organisations within the EU will be subject  to legal obligations for the security of their net- work and information systems. This applies to  businesses as well as public authorities. It con- cerns sectors that are already regulated under  the original NIS Directive (NIS1), such as energy,  transport, drinking water and digital infrastruc- ture. Under NIS2, more sectors will be added,  such as waste water, central government, aero- space, food, manufacturing and postal and  courier services. Public administration bodies at  regional level, such as provinces and municipali- ties, can be included in the scope of NIS2 on the  basis of a risk analysis. As part of the security     Aims  |  29  This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    Organisations know what basic cybersecurity mea-  sures are and apply them.  •    Government and NIS2 organisations meet high   security standards under new and existing legisla- tion.   •    Organisations are aware at all levels (including  management level) of the importance of cyberse- curity.   •    Organisations also focus their risk management on  cybersecurity risks, and increase transparency in  this regard.   •    Supervision of an organisation’s cyber resilience is  geared more to risks for the organisation itself, its  sector and its significance for others.       Organisations respond to and recover  and learn from cyber incidents and  crises swiftly and efficiently    To prepare effectively for cyber incidents, organisati- ons should develop incident, continuity and recovery  plans in keeping with the organisation’s risk profile.  These plans need to be practised regularly, both wit- hin the organisation itself and with partners in the  sector and chain so that employees know what to do  in the event of an incident. Attention must also be  paid to effects that may occur in the physical world.    Should an incident nonetheless occur, it is important  that an organisation has arrangements in place for  assistance. The NCSC also has a statutory obligation  to provide support, with the main focus on national  security and prevention of social disruption. The  NCSC is responsible for operational coordination and  management in times of national crises. The govern- ment also ensures coherent provision of public and  private cybersecurity services in the event of an inci- dent, for example in conjunction with trusted  cybersecurity firms.24 Central government thus provi- des a stimulus for greater and more effective  collaboration between organisations, to ensure that  cyber capabilities are deployed as effectively and effi- ciently as possible.     In order to prepare a response to a national cyber cri- sis, efficient cooperation must be in place between  government organisations, the business sector, the  research community and civil society organisations,  even across local, regional and national borders. In  the event of cross-border cyber incidents and crises,  the government encourages fully integrated action  on the basis of a national umbrella framework in the  form of the National Crisis Plan for Digital Incidents.    Lastly, we must continue to learn from incidents and  crises. To this end, organisations will need to be more  proactive in sharing their experiences and lessons  learned with each other, and in this regard trust is  paramount. The information shared by government  organisations will be more targeted, so as to ensure a  clearer picture of the degree of resilience in organisa- tions, sectors and chains, wherever possible in  collaboration with, for example, the business sector  or branch organisations. The government will use this  insight to provide guidance wherever resilience levels  are lagging behind the threat.    To make this possible, attention must be paid to the  measurability of resilience and more insight must be  gained into the costs and benefits of cybersecurity  incidents and measures    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    Organisations are capable of swiftly responding to   and recovering from a cyber incident and practise  accordingly.   •    The government offers coherent cybersecurity ser- vices with a recognised point of contact for  organisations.   •    The government, business sector and research  community collaborate closely to ensure effective  use of cybersecurity expertise.   •    Organisations collaborate effectively in the event  of (national) cybersecurity crises, in keeping with  regional, supraregional, national and international  crisis mechanisms.   •    Organisations evaluate cyber incidents, learn from  them and share these lessons with each other.      28  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     Actions and priorities for Pillar I        The following actions reflect the government’s  priorities for the current term of office which will  be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this  pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in  the appendix. This action plan will be updated  annually and will provide insight into underlying  actions, expected duration and responsibilities.    A. Addressing fragmentation within the system    • The ability to receive timely information about   threats and vulnerabilities in a way that is  appropriate to the maturity level of the orga- nisation is one of the most important  elements for the Netherlands’ cyber resilience.  To achieve it, the available capacity and exper- tise need to be deployed as effectively as  possible. Fragmentation within the cybersecu- rity information exchange system should be  counteracted wherever possible. The NCSC,  DTC and CSIRT-DSP will therefore be merged  to form a single national cybersecurity autho- rity. Working in collaboration with public and  private partners, this new organisation will  provide critical and non-critical organisations,  public authorities and members of the public  with security information and possible courses  of action appropriate to their maturity level.   • The other organisations within the cybersecu- rity information-sharing system will be  assessed in terms of which of their tasks (dis- tributing security information, providing  support, organising drills, etc) should be cen- tralised (within the national cybersecurity  authority) and which should be sector-based.   • Cybersecurity is an issue that must be addres- sed by means of a public-private approach.  One key element in this respect is the joint col-  lection and interpretation of threat informa- tion, so the government will start developing a  public-private platform for information and  knowledge sharing.      B. No more commitment-free partnerships    • The implementation of the NIS2 directive   means that more than 5,000 companies in the  Netherlands will be required to report cyberse- curity incidents and to take specific steps to   increase their cyber resilience. Compliance  with these obligations will be monitored. At  the moment, these requirements apply to only  200 organisations in the Netherlands, so this  expansion will increase the cyber resilience of  the designated organisations.   • The government is also taking various measu- res to boost the cyber resilience of specific  sectors. There will, for instance, be additional  norms for the healthcare and education sec- tors, and the government will provide various  tools to help organisations to comply. Munici- palities and provinces will be subject to tighter  security requirements. Multiple support pro- grammes are being offered by the Ministry of  the Interior and Kingdom Relations to help  them meet those requirements. Lastly, the  government believes that it is not only the  cyber resilience of IT systems that needs to be  addressed, but also the resilience of operatio- nal technology. This is made up of complex  digital systems that control the locks in our  waterways or regulate production in factories,  and the impact of system failure is considera- ble. The government will therefore work to  increase knowledge and awareness of the risks  in organisations that use these systems.   >>       Aims   |  3130  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     C. Being prepared for cyber incidents and crises    • At the end of 2022, the government will pre-  sent the National Crisis Plan for Digital  Incidents. This plan will set out how public and  private organisations in the Netherlands  should prepare for cybersecurity incidents and  what they should do if one occurs.   • The government will draw up an interministe- rial practice schedule on the basis of a  government-wide risk analysis and the Natio- nal Security Strategy. This schedule will  incorporate the planning of national and inter- national cyber and hybrid exercises.   Pillar II: Secure and innovative digital  products and services   In order for our digitised society to be secure, we  need digital products and services that are well pro- tected throughout their lifecycle. This is difficult to  achieve in today’s market. Consumers cannot tell the  difference between secure and insecure products or  services, which is partly why suppliers and manufac- turers are reluctant to invest sufficiently in the  cybersecurity of the products and services they pro- vide. In addition, more and more products and  services are now digitalised, from smart televisions to  connected cars and medical equipment. Every day,  vulnerabilities are discovered in software and there  are still too many devices and services on the market  that can easily be misused for criminal activities,  espionage or large-scale attacks.    Given the market dynamics that exist in an  international competitive market where there is  insufficient incentive for suppliers to make digital  products more secure throughout their lifecycle, sta- tutory measures are needed, in many cases at EU  level. Such measures impose greater responsibility on  suppliers for the security of their product or service,  and offer consumers a basis for claiming compensa- tion in the event of cybersecurity incidents.25 The  government is a major consumer and purchaser of  digital products and services and will use its position  to stimulate the development of secure products and  services.   It is important to anticipate future opportunities and  threats. Rapid developments in the digital and tech- nological domain, as in the case of quantum  technology or artificial intelligence (AI), require a per- manent commitment to the expansion and  application of expertise and innovation for the devel- opment of cybersecurity products and services. To  enhance the Netherlands’ competitive position on  the EU and international markets, and to minimise  undesirable dependence on foreign parties, collabo- ration within the Dutch innovation chain should be  encouraged as much as possible.       Looking back: Roadmap for Digital Hard-  and Software Security     The protection of digital products and services is  a complex, global issue for which an assortment  of measures exist. Under the NCSA, such measu- res were set out in the Roadmap for Digital  Hard- and Software Security.26 In recent years,  for example, EU market entry requirements were  introduced for wireless networking devices, a  European system was developed for cybersecu- rity certification of ICT products, services and  processes, and the Dutch system was set up,  with supervision.27 European consumers are now  also entitled to updates for digital products, con- tent and services and European cybersecurity  requirements are being imposed on medical  devices.28 Cybersecurity requirements are also  being imposed at global level for connected cars  and vehicles.29          Netherlands capitalise safely on the economic and  social opportunities of the digital transformation.    A good innovation basis will reduce the Netherlands’  dependence on cybersecurity expertise and solutions  in other countries. This is vital in order for us to pro- tect our national security and our most sensitive  information, now and in the future. To achieve this,  the Netherlands needs high-quality security products,  including cryptographic products and services. Given  that this rare knowledge and expertise is available in  our country, the Netherlands is one of the few coun- tries where cryptographic products and services are  developed and manufactured. It is essential that we  retain this expertise and develop it further, so that  the Netherlands can properly protect its sensitive  information.         Dcypher    The collaboration platform dcypher brings public  and private parties and knowledge institutions  together, as well as resources and expertise, to  effectively engage in cybersecurity education,  research, innovation and concrete applications.  Dcypher’s mission is to help build a safer, smar- ter, digitally autonomous and economically  stronger Netherlands. The mission of dcypher’s  partners is to deepen and broaden the  development and application of expertise in the  field of cybersecurity in the Netherlands. The  platform is designed to stimulate knowledge  development in the cybersecurity domain, to  give a major impetus to the cybersecurity indu- stry and to support the government in its role as  launching customer.        In order to foster a healthy cybersecurity innovation  ecosystem, the government is working via the cen- tralised public-private collaboration platform  dcypher, which in recent years has laid the basis for  substantive agenda-setting and programming of  long-term research and innovation plans in respect of  digital security together with government bodies,  businesses and knowledge institutions. This  approach covers the whole chain, from fundamental  research, via applied research to innovative new  cybersecurity products and services. This will gene- rate more knowledge and innovation with a lasting  impact on the cybersecurity ecosystem, helping us  secure a leading position in Europe. It is also impor- tant to ensure a deeply-rooted connection between  national and European initiatives and the associated  instruments and EU resources. This will be done via  the National Crisis Centre (NCC) which liaises  between the national cybersecurity network and the  European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC)  and its associated network.    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    Dutch (and European) cybersecurity companies   supply high-quality products and services that are  essential for our digital security and our economy.   •    The government, business sector and knowledge  institutions collaborate closely on knowledge and  innovation relating to cybersecurity.   •    The Netherlands has joined European initiatives  and funds to stimulate knowledge development  and innovation in cybersecurity in the Netherlands.         Aims   |  3332  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Digital products and services are more  secure    Despite efforts to improve the security of digital pro- ducts and services, there is still no comprehensive  system of legislation (EU or otherwise) setting out the  necessary standards for digital products, processes  and services and geared to the individual responsibi- lity of manufacturers and suppliers. EU legislation  creates a level playing field and enhances the com- petitiveness of Dutch suppliers. And because EU  frameworks have been established on the basis of  European public norms and values, they also help to  reinforce Europe’s digital autonomy at global level,  both in a geopolitical context and in respect of the  ‘tech giants’. In the coming period the Netherlands  will be pressing at EU level for a coherent system of  legislation, together with the associated standards.  This will involve a combination of sectoral measures  (such as those that apply to medical devices and  energy-supply equipment) and more horizontal mea- sures.30 Efforts at EU and national level should ensure  that consumers can be confident in demonstrably  more secure products and services. Clarity about  where responsibility for digital security lies and about  the standards such security must meet will also  ensure that potential compensation can be claimed  more easily via regular liability law.    In the Netherlands, cybersecurity purchasing require- ments have been developed for all government  organisations. This stricter approach to government  procurement and tendering also means that the  government can use its role as a market player to  greater effect when it comes to encouraging the  development of secure ICT products and services.  The government also has policy in place stipulating  that national security interests must be considered  during the procurement and tendering process for all  products and services.      This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    Under EU law manufacturers and suppliers have a   duty of care for the cybersecurity of digital  products and services throughout their entire life- cycle.   •    There is a more coherent system of EU legislation  for the cybersecurity of digital products and  services.   •    European security certificates are issued for diffe- rent categories of digital products and services.   •    European security requirements and standards are  also used in non-EU countries.   •    Organisations have contractual agreements with  clients in respect of cybersecurity.   •    The government has purchasing and other policy  on the security of digital products and services,  and is aware of the relevant requirements.       The Netherlands has a robust  cybersecurity knowledge and  innovation chain    To ensure measures against cyber threats can be  taken both now and in the future, the development  and application of Dutch knowledge and cybersecu- rity expertise need to be continually strengthened. A  high-quality and autonomous Dutch knowledge and  innovation chain in the field of cybersecurity will  reduce undesirable dependence on companies, indi- viduals and solutions in other countries, and will  generate economic opportunities for Dutch busines- ses. Close cooperation between government, the  business sector and knowledge institutions is essen- tial in this respect.     Different parts of the chain – such as fundamental  and applied research, businesses and public authori- ties – need to develop closer contacts and to  collaborate on specific, long-term projects. By  crea- ting a healthy innovation ecosystem, we can ensure  that valuable cybersecurity knowledge does not drain  away to other countries but is converted into practi- cal products and services. Only then can the     Aims   |  35  B. Government is stimulating the development  of secure digital products via procurement     • The government must have its own cybersecu-  rity in order and can, as a major consumer of  ICT products, influence the market by impo- sing procurement requirements. Government  procurement policy could thus contribute to  the innovation and development of secure  products and services.   • For example, General Security Requirements  for Central Government (ABRO) are being  drawn up and will be imposed on companies  contracted to carry out sensitive and/or classi- fied government assignments.   • The government cybersecurity procurement  requirements (ICO) tool will be developed furt- her, expanded and implemented, including the  further development of government-wide sets  of requirements. The tool will also be available  to companies so that they too can apply the  procurement requirements.   • The development of high-assurance products  will be stimulated by means of enhanced and  coordinated commissioning on the part of  central government so that the Netherlands  retains access to reliable cryptographic soluti- ons.        34  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     Actions and priorities for Pillar II        The following actions reflect the government’s  priorities for the current term of office which will  be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this  pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in  the appendix. This action plan will be updated  annually and will provide insight into underlying  actions, expected duration and responsibilities.    A. Security will be mandatory in digital product   development    • One of the most important steps towards   cyber resilient consumers and organisations is  the availability of secure digital products.  Security should be one of the main considera- tions in the development of digital products.  The government will regulate this mainly via  the EU Cyber Resilience Act. In the negotiati- ons on this regulation, the Netherlands is  pressing for the inclusion of a duty of care for  manufacturers and suppliers of all ICT  products, services and processes, to last  through their entire life cycle, including the  associated standards and supervision.   • Together with private parties, the government  is also contributing to the development and  adoption of European cybersecurity certifica- tion schemes for ICT products, services and  processes, for example for cloud services, 5G  technology and Common Criteria. The Ministry  of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is wor- king to stimulate awareness and  implementation of certification schemes  under the EU Cybersecurity Act. Encouraging  and facilitating the use of certification will  enable consumers and organisations to make  safe choices.        C. Robust cybersecurity knowledge and inno- vation chain     • Development in the cryptographic domain will   continue through the implementation of the  National Crypto Strategy.   • New projects and work programmes are emer- ging from the interface in knowledge and  innovation requirements between  government and the business community. The  public-private collaboration platform dcypher  facilitates connection between government,  businesses and knowledge institutions and  provides agenda-setting and programming for  cybersecurity knowledge and innovation pro- jects and work programmes. Dcypher could  play a facilitating and driving role in the quest  for funding for high-end knowledge and pro- duct development.        The government also needs to step up cooperation  with other parties and establish more partnerships in  order to gather information from outside central  government. Possibilities include the business sector,  knowledge institutions and international organisati- ons. On the basis of its own information and that of  other parties, the government can form a clearer pic- ture of the cyber threat targeting Dutch interests and  those of our partners.     This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    The government has the capabilities to gather, ana-  lyse and share information and intelligence relating  to cyber threats posed by states and criminals.   •    There is an effective exchange of cyber threat intel- ligence and information between the government  and its international partners.        The Netherlands has a handle on the  cybersecurity threats posed by states  and criminals    Over the next few years, the government will work to  improve information-sharing and to increase  resilience, which will help to mitigate cyber threats.33  The government will also, working within the legal  parameters, make more use of the existing scope  (both online and off) for detecting, tackling, disrupting  and prosecuting malicious actors and their facilitators.  To do so, the government can use the AIVD, the MIVD,  the police, the Public Prosecution Service, the Ministry  of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.34 Statu- tory and other frameworks will need to be taken into  consideration, however.     The police and the Public Prosecution Service will  employ a broad, scalable and effective strategy to tac- kle cybercrime, targeting both the perpetrators of  cybercrime and their service providers. As well as pur- suing criminal investigations, the police and the Public  Prosecution Service will also focus on alternative inter- ventions. Using this broad approach, criminal activities  and networks will be disrupted, criminal behaviour  prevented, criminal proceeds confiscated and criminal  offences punished.     In various international forums, including the EU, the  Council of Europe and the UN, the Netherlands contri- butes actively to the ongoing development of legal  instruments designed to strengthen international  cooperation against cybercrime, while safeguarding  human rights and fundamental freedoms. State-spon- sored cyber operations will be disrupted more  effectively by the AIVD and the MIVD. The Ministry of  Defence will deploy the its constitutional powers more  often and more systematically in the national domain,  and must be ready to act when needed: not just as a  last resort, but also as an offensive digital force.35    Given the geopolitical dimension of digital threats, our  efforts in cyberspace are an integral part of our broa- der foreign policy. Together with partners at home and  abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will deploy  diplomatic means more effectively in response to  cyberattacks and incidents. The Government-wide  State Threat Response Framework, which is currently  in development, will also be applied in cyberspace  wherever possible. The interministerial cyber incident  response framework, coordinated by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, will be used for this purpose. This  framework has been applied successfully since 2018  and will be developed further in the coming years.    Where legal parameters restrict operational effective- ness to such an extent that the aim cannot be  achieved, consideration will be given to extending  those parameters, based on our public values and  keeping in mind the normative framework for respon- sible state behaviour, including fundamental rights  and international law (for example, human rights law  and international humanitarian law).     Aims   |  3736  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Pillar III: Countering cyber threats posed  by states and criminals   The Netherlands has a clear picture of  cyber threats posed by states and  criminals    Addressing this challenge is not merely a matter of  better observing the actions of state and non-state  actors in cyberspace. In addition, the political, diplo- matic, military and economic behaviour of other  countries provides insight into their views and inten- tions regarding the use of cyberspace as a means of  gaining geopolitical influence. Deploying diplomatic  resources is therefore essential in this respect, con- ducted by means of, say, targeted diplomatic reports,  consultations, coalitions with like-minded partners  and dialogue with parties who do not share our  views. Much of this task falls under the unique res- ponsibility of the government, with, for example, the  police, the Public Prosecution Service and the AIVD  and MIVD working in collaboration with stakeholders  such as the NCSC and the DTC.32 This enables the  Netherlands to build and maintain a picture of the  rapidly growing threat and some of the main players.  We will also need to work more often, more closely  and more actively with EU partners and NATO Allies  so that we can identify threats and malicious actors  at an earlier stage. To encourage a common under- standing of the threat, the government will be more  proactive when sharing cyber and other intelligence,  thus enabling others to increase their resilience or to  take action against cybercriminals.      Cyberspace is fast becoming a place where tensions  find expression: increasingly, state and non-state  actors are conducting malicious cyber campaigns,  often as part of a hybrid campaign, in pursuit of  wide-ranging goals. In some cases, the capabilities of  criminal groups are now comparable to those of sta- tes. And occasionally, states actually seek  collaboration with criminal groups, or deliberately  allow those groups to act without hindrance. This  affects the Netherlands in many ways: theft undermi- nes our earning capacity, sabotage constitutes a  direct threat to our national security and cyber  threats put pressure on our democracy and the rule  of law. The relationship between cyberattacks and  geopolitical dynamics could potentially put the allied  cohesion of NATO and the EU under strain.     Cybersecurity (and thus also efforts to combat cyber- crime) must therefore be regarded as a fixed element  of national and international security policy. As this  observation makes clear, neither central government  nor the Netherlands as a whole can resolve this chal- lenge alone.     If we are to keep pace with the countless malicious  actors and the increasing vulnerability of cyberspace,  we need a clearer picture of what we are dealing  with. Although that picture on its own will not make  the Netherlands any safer, it is nonetheless an essen- tial step towards effective, scalable action.31        The government endorses the multistakeholder  model of internet governance. This model entails  open collaboration between stakeholder authori- ties, civil society organisations, the business sector,  research community and the internet technical  community within organisations such as the Inter- net Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi- neers (IEEE). They must take the lead in adjusting  the standards, protocols and procedures for the  internet’s core functionality , without  inappropriate interference by state or private  actors. The Netherlands is committed to preven- ting a situation in which national and regional   legislation creates barriers that ultimately lead to  the fragmentation of the internet.    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    States have a common understanding of the   importance of norms of conduct and international  law in cyberspace, and act accordingly.   •    The Netherlands forms part of a broad coalition  which promotes compliance with international law  in cyberspace.   •    The multistakeholder model continues to be the  guiding principle for worldwide governance of the  internet.        Aims   |  39  This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    The government has an effective, internationally   aligned attribution and response framework with  clear powers and responsibilities.   •    The government has offensive and defensive cyber  capabilities that are effective in both peacetime  and wartime.   •    The government ensures the well-coordinated  national and international deployment of instru- ments against cyber threats posed by states and  criminals.   •    The government can use criminal and non-criminal  interventions against cyber criminals and their ser- vice providers (e.g. ransomware attacks).       States adhere to the normative  framework for responsible state  behaviour in cyberspace    Given the geopolitical tensions in the world, cyber  threats and cyberattacks are only likely to increase in  future. The best way to nip the source of the threat in  the bud is to turn the geopolitical arena more to our  advantage by promoting the international legal order  in cyberspace.    The Netherlands will be an integral part of robust  coalitions pressing for responsible state behaviour in  cyberspace and will contribute to the further devel- opment of a uniform and widely supported  normative framework in order to reduce geopolitical  tensions. To this end we will use cyber diplomacy to  promote democratic norms and values governed by  the rule of law, including human rights. Central  government complies with this normative framework  and actively promotes it, on the basis of our norms  and values, and our vision of a free, open and safe  internet.      Normative framework for responsible  state behaviour in cyberspace    International agreements are needed to deal  with the threat of destabilising cyberattacks. UN  negotiations on the rules that apply in  cyberspace have been ongoing since 1998.36 The  process has now expanded into multiple consul- tation and negotiation mechanisms focused on  cyberspace, to which the Netherlands either acti- vely contributes or has done so in the past: the  Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), the  Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) and the  Programme of Action (PoA).    The need for stability gave rise to the  establishment of a normative framework for res- ponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, which  was reaffirmed by consensus by the UN member  states in 2021.37 This framework helps foster sta- bility, as non-compliant countries can be called  to account for their behaviour. The guiding prin- ciple is that existing international law is  applicable in cyberspace.    This means, for example, that the interstate pro- hibition on the use of force and the  non-intervention principle in international law  also apply in cyberspace, and that an actual or  imminent cyberattack can in certain circumstan- ces be regarded as an armed attack against  which a state can invoke the right of individual or  collective self-defence. It is also acknowledged  that human rights apply online as well as offline  and that states must fulfil their human rights  obligations in cyberspace, as well as those per- taining to international humanitarian law. In  addition, agreement has been reached on 11  non-binding norms of conduct, which provide  for agreements, safeguarding and protection  below the threshold of armed conflict.     38  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   B. Increase research and investigative capacity  in respect of cybercriminals     • As well as understanding the threat, being able   to investigate perpetrators is extremely impor- tant. This goes beyond criminal-law  interventions alone. The police and the Public  Prosecution Service will therefore work with  public and private partners to develop other  interventions to tackle cybercrime (including  ransomware attacks).   • Over the coming years, the Public Prosecution  Service will expand its knowledge and exper- tise in this area and explore the scope for  expediting cases by means of a fast-track sys- tem.   • The police will make it possible to report more  cybercrime phenomena online from 2023.   • In addition, the police will start building a  security overview in relation to cybercrime and  digitalised criminality, giving society at large     Actions and priorities for Pillar III        The following actions reflect the government’s  priorities for the current term of office which will  be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this  pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in  the appendix. This action plan will be updated  annually and will provide insight into underlying  actions, expected duration and responsibilities.     A. Understanding the cyber threat    • Knowing and understanding the threat is the   first step towards a cyber resilient  Netherlands, so the government is investing  heavily in the research capability of the intelli- gence and security services for the purpose of  intelligence-oriented in-depth research. This  will provide a broader view of current and  potential cyber threats. Unique intelligence  will thus be translated into specific courses of  action so that clients are better able to protect  themselves.        Aims   |  41  an idea of the main criminal phenomena, ope- rating methods and risk levels. This overview  will guide the police and the Public Prosecu- tion Service in their choice of where they focus  and which investigations are prioritised.     C. Expand the diplomatic response and defen-  sive cyber capability    • The government is investing in the cyber   diplomacy network, and its tasks will be  expanded to ensure the availability of better  information on cyber threats and  developments. The government will also work  in a coalition setting to boost compliance with  international standards of behaviour and the  application of international law in cyberspace.  Furthermore, the government will work to  promote an open, free and secure internet  through stronger commitment to internet  governance and by engaging with the multis- takeholder community in the Netherlands.    • Together with international partners, the  government will develop new, more effective  options for a diplomatic response to cyber  threats. Existing frameworks, such as the  national diplomatic cyber response  framework, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox  and the NATO Guide are being developed furt- her. The government will build further on the  Government-wide State Threat Response  Framework, which brings together all possible  response options within central government,  and includes an escalation ladder and assess- ment framework.   • The Ministry of Defence is investing in its over- all cyber capability chain and in increasing staff  readiness via training and exercises. It is  expanding support structures to provide assis- tance to other organisations in major  incidents, for example via the National  Response Network (NRN).      40  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Pillar IV: Cybersecurity labour market,  education and public cyber resilience    The public are properly protected  against cyber risks    Members of the public need to be as self-reliant as  possible and to have the necessary basic knowledge  and skills to be able to take effective preventive mea- sures against cyber threats and risks, and they need  to actually take those measures in practice. To  achieve this, ongoing efforts are needed to make the  public more tech-savvy. Awareness-raising  campaigns should be run to alert them to what mea- sures they can take to enhance their cybersecurity. In  this way, our society will become more cyber  resilient.    The aim is that the public take basic cybersecurity  measures, such as the use of strong passwords,  multi-factor authentication, making backups, instal- ling updates and responding appropriately to  phishing attacks. So it is important that they have the  knowledge and tools to apply such measures. They  should therefore have easy access to information and  advice, provided in familiar and trusted surroundings,  to enhance their cybersecurity skills.    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    The public are aware of cyber risks, threats and   measures, and know where they can obtain help.  •    People apply basic cybersecurity measures when   they use digital products and services.  •    People can get easy access, in a range of settings,   to cybersecurity information and advice  appropriate to their knowledge and skill level.        Society’s ability to function without disruption  depends increasingly on the secure use of digital  resources. Pillar II describes the European approach  to safeguarding the security of digital products and  services. The public’s level of cyber resilience is also  an important requirement.38 For many Dutch people,  however, achieving and maintaining a sufficient level  of cybersecurity is still too big a task. The most vulne- rable groups run the greatest risk39 and many people  fall victim to cybercriminals.40 Putting the necessary  cybersecurity measures in place can significantly help  reduce the number of cybercrime victims.41    Because of the digitalisation of our society, children  of ever younger ages are coming into contact with  digital products and services. It is imperative that  they have the necessary skills to deal with cyber risks  and to take cybersecurity measures. This is not yet  being adequately addressed in a systematic way by  primary or secondary education, even though it is  vital that young people learn the skills they need to  be safe in our digital world.    The Cybersecurity Council has pointed out the need  for sufficient qualified professionals in order to boost  our society’s long-term cyber resilience.42 There is a  general shortage of expertise on the cybersecurity  market.43 Ensuring organisations’ security and resi- lience requires specialists at secondary vocational,  higher professional and university education level  who can make and keep digital systems and proces- ses secure.       Aims   |  43  Members of the public respond to  cyber incidents swiftly and efficiently    It is important to enable people to respond swiftly  and efficiently to cyber threats, attacks and disrupti- ons. This can be achieved by ensuring that people are  informed at an early stage about current threats that  could affect them and about what they can do to stay  safe. Over the next few years, efforts need to be  made to improve the speed and quality of public  information. People need to know where they can  find this information and what action they can take.  They also need an accessible and straightforward  process for reporting or lodging a criminal complaint  regarding cyber incidents, such as phishing.    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    People receive sufficient information quickly about   urgent cyber incidents and how to respond to  them.   •    It is easy for people to report cyber incidents or to  lodge a criminal complaint about them.       Schoolchildren are taught digital skills  with an emphasis on security    It is vital that children learn at a young age how to  deal with the digital world and to recognise the risks  involved. Pupils need to learn about safe online  behaviour. Digital skills, including awareness of cyber  risks and security, are not currently part of the natio- nal curriculum for primary or secondary education. To  equip pupils with digital skills, teachers must also  possess those skills themselves and be able to teach  them proficiently. It is important that schools receive  appropriate support in this respect.   This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    Digital skills with an emphasis on security are part   of the national curriculum in primary and secon- dary education.   •    Teachers in primary and secondary education are  capable (with support) of providing effective  instruction in digital skills with an emphasis on  security.       The Dutch labour market can meet the  growing demand for cybersecurity  experts    In order to meet the growing demand for cybersecu- rity expertise, efforts must be made to make sure  there are sufficient specialists on the labour market.  Public-private partnerships are essential in this res- pect. To ensure a better supply, it must be clear  precisely where the shortfall is and what is needed to  cover it. For example, what mechanisms are available  to promote and effectively deploy cybersecurity  expertise on the labour market? It may, for instance,  be possible to link up with the action plan for techno- logy, focusing on such aspects as the digital  transition.44    This leads to the following sub-aims:  •    There is a clear overview of shortfalls on the cyber-  security labour market and the options for  addressing them.   •    There are more secondary vocational, higher pro- fessional and university education places in  cybersecurity that are properly aligned with the  labour market, partly through the involvement of  companies and knowledge institutions.   •    Organisations offer upskilling and reskilling pro- grammes for cybersecurity expertise.        42  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   B. Cyber resilience will be part of the curriculum    • Children need to learn from an early age how   to deal with digital products and services. The  Curriculum Development Foundation Nether- lands (SLO) has been given the task of working  with the teaching profession to develop con- crete core objectives for basic skills, including  cybersecurity skills, for both primary and  secondary education. These detailed core  objectives for primary and secondary educa- tion will be submitted to the House of  Representatives in a parliamentary bill.   • A ‘basic skills master plan’ will be produced to  ensure that teachers are properly equipped to  provide the best education in language, arith- metic/mathematics, citizenship and computer  literacy.     C. Addressing cybersecurity in the labour    market    • The government is working with educational   institutions to roll out upskilling and reskilling  programmes to enhance employees’ cyberse- curity expertise. They are also working  alongside the business community and other  relevant parties. Any obstacles and limitations  in that collaboration that stem from legisla- tion will be identified and examined to see  how they can be resolved.   • The government is investing in higher profes- sional education in the sciences, which  includes cybersecurity. Resources are being  allocated to (1) higher intake, (2) lower drop- out and switch rates, (3) higher lateral intake,  and (4) induction/hot transfer to the labour  market.        Actions and priorities for Pillar IV        The following actions reflect the government’s  priorities for the current term of office which will  be rolled out in pursuit of the objectives in this  pillar. A detailed overview of actions is shown in  the appendix. This action plan will be updated  annually and will provide insight into underlying  actions, expected duration and responsibilities.    A. Increase awareness of cyber risks among   members of the public    • The risks posed by digital vulnerabilities and   threats must be borne as far as possible by the  developers and suppliers of digital products  and services. However, there will almost  always be a residual risk, which means that the  individual user or SME will also need to take  their own measures. To do so, the public and  SMEs must first of all be aware of the risks and  the measures they need to take. To this end,  the government will use various public-infor- mation-campaign programmes focused on  basic cybersecurity measures for specific tar- get groups.   • In addition, the government is bolstering its  Digital Government Information Units. These  will be able to answer people’s questions  about cybersecurity and refer them where  necessary to support centres, information  helpdesks and local support initiatives by pri- vate partners.          4. Governance, evaluation and   monitoring      organisations. An integrated management model will  be set up at the beginning of 2023. This will be linked  to existing governance structures and will be based  on the positive experience gained in the past few  years with public-private partnerships. In this model,  the joint efforts of public and private stakeholders  will be focused on subsidiary topics and intensified  with a view to achieving the objectives. With regard  to the objectives aimed at strengthening the labour  market, for example, efforts will be made to step up  innovation or to enhance the efficiency and effective- ness of the cybersecurity system.    It is the task of the Cybersecurity Council (CSR) to  advise the government in respect of the implemen- tation and effect of the NLCS. The CSR will be asked  to advise periodically on the developments that need  to be considered when reviewing the action plan.    The NLCS is a clearly defined framework used to  ensure that cybersecurity policy evolves in a coherent  and structured manner at all levels. Line ministries  will translate this general framework into sector-spe- cific frameworks and regulations for the  organisations and processes for which they bear sys- tem responsibility. When formulating supplementary  policy or legislation in respect of cybersecurity, the  government observes the following guiding princi- ples.   Governance, evaluatie en monitoring    |  45  Governance, coordination and  cooperation    Digital security is so important that it should be  addressed at the highest possible level of an organi- sation. Leadership, coordination and ownership are  crucial in this respect. The relevant government  ministers are working closely with each other under  the responsibility of the Minister of Justice and Secu- rity, the coordinating minister for cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity is a standing theme in the Cabinet  Committee on Defence and International, National  and Economic Security (RDINEV), which manages the  overall implementation of this strategy and the asso- ciated action plan.    Rigorous coordination will help to synchronise and  link national initiatives and investments. A key gui- ding principle is that coordination by the Minister of  Justice and Security should above all facilitate, sup- port and stimulate the process, and should focus on  the effectiveness, coherence and strength of govern- ment policy on cybersecurity.    The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy (NLCS) can  only be implemented successfully with close collabo- ration between representatives of the business  sector, the research community and decentralised,  regional and national authorities and implementing   Work has long ceased to be ‘tethered’ to the   office. Thanks to laptops, hotspots and Wi-Fi   in the train, it’s now possible to send email and   attend meetings from any location we choose.   But what does this mean for data protection?    Evaluation and monitoring     The Netherlands’ digital security is inextricably linked  to technological and social developments. Cybersecu- rity measures that are effective today might be  obsolete by tomorrow, and that is why the  government has opted for an adaptive approach to  this strategy and the associated action plan. In order  to respond to trends, current threats and risks, we  need to be able to develop, adjust or intensify the  measures arising from the Netherlands Cybersecurity  Strategy over time.    In this regard it is important to look at what measures  work and what do not, so that the government and  other partners can be as effective as possible in their  policy and other interventions, and ensure the maxi- mum benefit to society. However, as the Cybersecurity  Council  has pointed out, measuring the effects of  cybersecurity policy is no simple matter.45 First, this  strategy consists of different aims designed to enable  the Netherlands to capitalise on the economic and  social opportunities of digitalisation and at the same  time safeguard our security. The successful achieve- ment of the aims in this strategy will thus involve a  combination of different factors. Second, security  interventions are designed to prevent incidents. Natu- rally it is difficult to measure the number and nature  of incidents that have been prevented. Third, cyberse- curity also depends on external factors. It hard to  know how much of the improvement in cybersecurity  can be attributed to cybersecurity policy itself. This  must therefore be factored into the evaluation  approach for this strategy.    Nevertheless, it is important to continue working to  improve our insight into the effects of cybersecurity  policy so we can ensure an effective cybersecurity  approach in the future too. To this end, a monitoring  and evaluation programme has been formulated as  part of the NLCS, based on what can be measured.          Approach    The Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy is the coun- try’s fourth integrated cybersecurity strategy.    The methodology from the Strategic Evaluation  Agenda (SEA)46 was used to compile the monitoring  and evaluation programme. This method is designed  to plan monitoring and evaluation activities in a more  structured way so that relevant insights can be gai- ned at the right moments, with a view to learning and  accountability.      Evaluation programme    Pre-implementation phase  Under the previous government, the Netherlands  Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA) was evaluated for the  first time.47 Based on the experience gained with the  NCSA, the compilers of this strategy decided to make  a sharper distinction between the strategy and the  action plan, resulting in a more future-oriented and  longer-term strategy, accompanied by an adaptive  action plan that could be adjusted or intensified in  the event of changes in the interests at stake, the  threat, resilience levels or other political/administra- tive requirements. Completed actions could also  generate follow-up actions, for example after a sur- vey or study has been conducted.    Further focal points arising from this evaluation (or  incorporated in the formulation of the action plans)  were the explicit allocation of ownership and respon- sibilities, and a more definitive description of  intended actions and effects. Lastly, greater attention  needs to be paid to the measurability of the intended  results and effects of the strategy and interim evalua- tion.     Governance, evaluation and monitoring  |  47    Guiding principles from central government for the development of cybersecurity policy  and legislation     That is necessary to protect our public inte- rests.     • Capacity within government must be used   effectively and efficiently, through efficient  organisation, prompt action and maximum  collaboration. The NLCS will serve as the gene- ral framework that prevents fragmentation of  effort in the cybersecurity domain; it provides  the basic premise. In addition, there is scope  for specific interpretation, for example by  means of sectoral policy frameworks, strate- gies, agendas, roadmaps for subsidiary topics  or additional sets of norms.     • Public-private partnership – the pooling of   resources – is and will remain the foundation  of the strategy. Public-private partnerships  must be designed to achieve tangible and  measurable results.     • Digital security transcends national borders, so   international cooperation at EU/NATO level  and beyond is vital. The Netherlands is taking a  pioneering role in this respect. Wherever possi- ble, solutions will be sought in an international  and European context to strengthen cyberse- curity and digital autonomy.          46  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   • Cybersecurity must be an integral part of the  Netherlands’ digitalisation process.     • Digital security and resilience should be a   common good. Cyber risks are an integral  part of a broader risk assessment and, on that  basis, organisations must take measures that  are proportionate, realistic and, where neces- sary, sector-specific.     • Organisations, public authorities and   companies all have a responsibility to bring  and keep their own cyber resilience up to  date; the government’s role is to inform, sti- mulate, facilitate and assist on the basis of  risk assessment. It will set legal and other  frameworks and will intervene where neces- sary, taking account of organisational  maturity levels and the interests that organi- sations represent.     • It must be clear to organisations and the   public how and when they can seek informa- tion, expertise and assistance.     • Central government and subnational authori-  ties should set the right example and have a  level of resilience appropriate to the risks.     Governance, evaluation and monitoring   |  49  The NCSA evaluation proposes a methodology to  enable a logical structure for a strategy. This is follo- wed by the formulation of key aims that define the  desired situation or effects to be achieved in the  future, and a series of sub-aims which will help to  achieve them. The aims will be fleshed out into an  action plan describing the government measures that  will further the attainment of the goals. The activities  or measures will be clearly linked to the intended  effect set out in the key and sub-aims.   The actions in the plan will be financed in part from  the additional funds set aside for cybersecurity in the  coalition agreement. A more detailed breakdown can  be found in the Financial Overview in the Appendix to  the NLCS.    Implementation phase  The House of Representatives will be informed  annually about the progress of the Netherlands  Cybersecurity Strategy. It will also be possible to sup- plement or adapt actions in the progress report on  the basis of emerging insights and developments, for  example in the light of the new CSBN.   In order to track the progress of the measures over  time, the Research and Documentation Centre  (WODC) of the Ministry of Justice and Security will  commission a baseline measurement to be taken, so  as to gain a clear picture of the situation before the  measures are introduced.     Post implementation phase  In principle the NLCS will cover a period of six years.  There will in any event be an evaluation in 2025, half- way through the term covered by the strategy, with  the aim of producing lessons learned that can be  incorporated in future policymaking.   In order to effectively meet current knowledge needs,  a decision will be made at a later stage with regard to  the specific focus of the evaluation. Given the  breadth of this strategy and the wide variety of acti- ons, an evaluation of all aims and measures is not  likely to produce many firm recommendations. For  this reason it may make sense to focus on one or  more relevant sub-topics, e.g. one about which little  is known in terms of the theory of change, or one  whose significance will increase in the future.    A subsequent government can ultimately decide  about the eventual duration and any final evaluation  of the Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy.   48  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     Appendices     ment’s further investment in digitalisation more  broadly, in enhancing its own ICT infrastructure or in  specific policy areas. Examples include  improvements to the mission network, (which is  home to cyber diplomats, for instance), and streng- thening the Defence organisation, with some of the  investment going to cyber capabilities. In cases  where no additional investment is possible but there  is still a requirement, there will need to be a repriori- tisation within individual budgets. Lastly, the  government is exploring the scope for financing  additional activities through EU digitalisation funds.  Generic national funds, such as the National Growth  Fund, could also be used to enhance digital  resilience. Besides funding, there are other critical  requirements that need to be met in order for the  actions to be realised. Sufficient capacity in the  labour market requires particular attention in this  regard.     Appendices  |  5150  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028   Financial overview    Like the previous government, this government has  made available structural resources specifically ear- marked for increasing cyber resilience. The previous  government made a structural investment of €95  million to boost cyber resilience,48 and this govern- ment is investing a further €111 million in  cybersecurity. A breakdown by ministry is shown  below. These resources are part of a broader structu- ral investment of €300 million which is being used,  for instance, to strengthen the AIVD and the MIVD  and to invest in economic security and critical infra- structure.

Owing to the COVID-19 measures, in   2020 the number of parcels delivered rose by   100%. Digital systems are essential for   ordering and delivering all these products.    Glossary    Based on the CSBN, the main terms are defined as follows:    Attack: see ‘cyberattack’.    Cyberattack: Malicious act aimed at using digital resources to disrupt one or more digital processes.    Cyber incident: Combination of events or activities that could result in disruption of one or more digital proces- ses. This includes both a cyberattack (malicious action by an actor intent on disrupting one or more digital  processes by digital means) and a system failure resulting from natural or technical causes or human error.    Cybersecurity: The full spectrum of measures designed to reduce relevant risks to an acceptable level. Measures  may focus on the prevention of cyber incidents and, if a cyber incident does occur, on detection, damage limita- tion and recovery. What constitutes an acceptable level of risk is determined by a risk assessment.    Digital domain or cyberspace: a complex environment resulting from the interaction of digital processes, sup- ported by globally distributed physical information and communication technology (ICT) devices and connected  networks. The digital domain is approached from three different angles or levels: 1) digital processes implemen- ted (or initiated) by humans; 2) the technology (IT and OT) that enables the digital processes; 3) risk  management and/or governance that guides the other two levels.    Digital process: a process carried out entirely or partly through the complex and interrelated interaction  between people and numerous components of hardware, software and/or networks. Fully automated proces- ses, such as process control systems, are also defined as digital processes.    Digital security: the undisrupted functioning of information and process control systems, the data processed  and stored within them and the services and processes that depend on them.    Disruption: adverse effect on the availability, integrity of confidentiality of information or the processing of  information; in other words, a disruption of the technological level of the digital domain.    Interests: Values, social gains and tangible and intangible assets that may be damaged if a cyber incident  occurs, and the importance that society or a party attaches to protecting them. The CSBN focuses on national  security interests.    Resilience: the ability to reduce relevant risks to an acceptable level by means of a set of measures to prevent  cyber incidents and, if they do occur, to detect them, limit the damage and facilitate recovery. What constitutes  an acceptable level of resilience is determined by a risk assessment. The risk assessment can help with the selec- tion of the right technical, procedural or organisational measures.    Risk: the chance that a threat could lead to a cyber incident and the impact on the interests concerned. Both are  viewed in relation to the current level of cyber resilience.

Threat: a cyber incident that could occur or a combination of simultaneous or successive cyber incidents.      Other terms    Central government: central government comprises 12 ministries, many implementing agencies and services,  various inspectorates and the High Councils of State.    Civil society organisations: civil society organisations operate in a field of activity between government, mar- ket and community. As a rule, they are non-profit-making organisations with a social purpose. This strategy  uses the term to refer to foundations and partnerships which help to boost cybersecurity in the Netherlands  and other countries.    Combating cybercrime: efforts to combat crime in which a computer system is attacked or misused for the  purpose of criminal activity. Combating cybercrime is an integral part of the cybersecurity approach.    Government: the government as a whole consists of central government, provinces, municipalities and water  authorities.    Multi-factor authentication: method used to determine whether a user or digital system is actually who or  what they claim/it claims to be. This can be done in various ways. One example is a password and a code that  the user receives via SMS. Another is a combination of a fingerprint and a password.    Organisations: the totality of government bodies, companies, knowledge institutions and civil society organi- sations.    Phishing: attack in which the perpetrator tricks someone into revealing important information, such as login  data or credit card details. Phishing is usually done via emails, but perpetrators also do it by phone, text mes- sage or in-app messages.    Public values: a reflection of what society regards as key values, such as security, democracy, self-determina- tion, non-discrimination, participation, privacy and inclusion.    Safety region: an area in which different authorities and services collaborate on tasks relating to fire services,  disaster control, crisis management, medical assistance, law enforcement and public order. The Netherlands  has 25 safety regions.     Security by default: this means that the configuration is based on the highest protection.    Security by design: this means that security is factored in at the design phase.     54  |  Netherlands Cybersecurity Strategy  2022-2028     31 The emphasis in this pillar lies on tackling state actors and  criminals as they pose the main threat to Dutch interests.  This does not detract from the fact that other malicious  actors, such as hacktivists, also pose a potential threat.

According to estimates, there are about 8 billi- on of inter-connected devices in the world. It is estimated that by 2020, the number of devices would exceed 20 billion, which speaks for the de- gree of integration of physical systems with the computer systems, resulting in greater effective- ness, accuracy, greater economic benefits, but also more serious adverse consequences in case of a cyber attack. Bearing in mind increasing integration of cyber and physical systems and adverse consequen- ces which could be caused by a compromised cyber system, cyber security and its developed national, regional and international architectures play a crucial role. The accelerated development of inter-connected, innovative technologies must also be followed by a fast development of cyber-security solutions, namely the protection from a wide spectrum of threats and that certainly represents a challenge to which all of us must respond with joint forces. Undoubtedly, cyber security is a challenge of the modern age and, as such, not even Montene- 1 Global Cybersecurity Index 2017. Link: gro is exempt from it. We witness an increasing number of cyber incidents which affect Montene- gro, through the recent ransomware campaigns, DDoS attacks against the public infrastructure, various online frauds, etc. Year after year, the number of these cyber incidents is significantly increasing. We must be aware that the threats to the IC infra- structure which may threaten its availability, pri- vacy and integrity may also affect the functioning of the society as a whole. Countries, international organisations, security companies, and various other entities are constantly developing and im- plementing new security mechanisms, however, simultaneously there is a process in which cyber criminals are inventing innovative and sophisti- cated techniques to bypass them. With regard to the development of information technologies and cyber security, according to the UN report i.e. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) report called “Global Cybersecurity Index1 2017”, Montenegro ranks 71st out of 193 member states. However, due to daily occurren- ce of new threats, our efforts with regard to cy- ber security must follow that pace as well.  Due to the constant growth of the number of online services that public and private sectors provide to the citizens as well as to other legal entities, safe cyberspace of Montenegro is becoming one of national priorities. 02 Modern risks, threats and challenges CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 7 There are numerous risks and challenges faced by a large number of countries. The increase in the number of information systems and tech- nologies, among other things, conditioned the setting up of new memory environments (Clo- ud Storage), which certainly represents a great challenge and is the subject of separate analy- ses. Furthermore, there is an evident increase in the number of malicious programs for mobile devices. According to the research presented by Sy- mantec in April 2017 2, about 18.4 million of malicious programs were detected in 2016, which is 105% more than in 2015 (9 million). In 2014, approximately 3.6 million pieces of malware were detected. Revolution of new technologies The Internet revolution carries a number of 2 Symantec Internet Security Report vol. 22 - 3 4 RFID Journal – “That ‘Internet of Things’ Thing”: extremely useful possibilities, so an evident huge increase in the number of users every day is no surprise. It is interesting to note that, since the be- ginning of the implementation of the previo- us Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro (2013), the number of internet users on a global level has increased from 2.5 billion to 3.9 billion (until June 2017) 3. We can come across the expression “prolifera- tion of cyber technology” in the literature. This term refers to the parsing or multiplication of technologies which, by connecting to the global network, also become a part of the cyberspace. One of the sources of cyber risk proliferation is the Internet of Things (IoT), a term first defined by Kevin Ashton, founder of the Auto-ID Centre at the MIT, in his presentation on the new po- ssibilities of RFID in Procter & Gamble’s supply chain in 1999.4 Continuous advancement of information technologies and enlargement of the cy- berspace to a large extent stimulates economic and social progress of every co- untry in the world. Information security represents a common interest of the entire mankind and it refers both to the global peace and development and to the national security of all countries. However, this advantage also entails new security risks and challenges. 8 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 Global penetration of Internet users in the period 2013-2017 IoT is a set of devices, vehicles, household appliances, as well as other items with built-in electronics, software, sensors, etc. connected to a shared network. Taking into account the fact 5 6 IHS Technology – IoT platforms: enabling the Internet of Things: that the connecting of the aforementioned items enables unhindered communication, recording of information and data exchange, the concern in the world of informatics is quite justified. The- refore, this concept represents one of the leading security issues in the world. The term that includes a larger domain is called the Internet of Everything (IoE) and was first defi- ned by CISCO as a part of the 2013 study entitled “Internet of Everything Value Index5. IoE represents an intelligent network of people, processes, data and things. More accurately, it is based on IoT, adding network intelligence that enables the efficient use of telephone, video and data communications via the same network (convergence), automation or process improve- ment with potential synchronisation of real-time data (orchestration), as well as visibility in diffe- rent systems. On the other hand, an abundance of different op- tions brings with it threats that can cause adver- se consequences to a large extent. “We are entering the fourth generation of the Internet. In the next 10 years, we will see that the competitiveness of the company will be measured by how well they understand the IoE concept and how much they use it.” Michael Ganser Senior Vice President of CISCO Central Europe According to a study presented by one of the Britain’s and global leading research companies in 2017, IHS technology, more than 20 billion devices are connected via the Internet. It is estimated that by the end of 2020 there will be at least 30 billion, while by 2025 this number will exceed an incredible 75 billion. 6 Such an expansion of devices will definitely bring about new opportunities, but will also make addi- tional room for actions of malicious individuals or groups, because in most cases the devices are not designed in compliance with the online secu- rity standards. 9 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 Numerous activities can be listed under cyber attacks. In many cases the attacks are carried out for the purposes of espionage and sabotage. Espionage refers to the unnoticeable tracking and collection of information and confidential data about a person or a company using diffe- rent software and services, which can eventually be publicly presented, most often through me- dia. The activities are usually carried out using a method called “backdoor”, which can be special software or be incorporated as a program code in the firmware of a network device and thus de- liver information to the attacker. Sabotage achieves certain goals, most often of political nature. In this manner, the processes of institutional work or military action are delibera- tely interfered with and this enables the removal or takeover of control and command. The most common examples of sabotage are carried out using botnets for DDoS/DoS attacks. During 2016, the companies Kaspersky Lab and B2B International polled about 4,000 7 Kaspersky Lab Finds Businesses are Unclear on How to Combat Targeted Attacks and DDoS Link: companies from 25 countries that were affected by some of the DDoS attacks.7 About 40% of the companies said they be- lieved that the attack had been caused by their competitors, 20% blamed foreign go- vernments and secret service organisati- ons, while 20% suspected that the attacks had been carried out by former employees. The second problem refers to cyber crime and hacktivism. Worldwide, there is an evident in- crease in the number of malicious software be- ing distributed in different ways. The launching of such software enables stealing of sensitive data, monetary gains, loss of service and eventual de- struction of data and devices. Hacktivism is the act of hacking or breaking into a computer system, for political or social rea- sons. Furthermore, internet penetration enables adequate action by perpetrators of cyber terro- rism. Nowadays it is much easier to create terro- rist organisations, smaller organised groups, or Threats and risks in cyberspace Taking into consideration the ultimate goal of cyber activities, threats can be classified into two basic categories: • cyber attacks (attacks by other coun- tries, hacktivism, espionage and sabo- tage), cyber terrorism and cyber crime (creation of terrorist organisations, attacks by individuals or groups, organised crime), cyberwarfare, • risks caused by human error or natural phenomena. Cyber attacks 10 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 hire individuals who, in the name of certain inte- rests, will have considerable power to inflict as much damage as possible using modern Internet technology. In this regard, numerous attacks on critical information infrastructure of the countries are being organised, which is developing into a model of cyberwarfare. The attack and/or destruction of critical informa- tion infrastructure achieves the goals of disrup- tion or complete outage of vital state or military communications, resulting in certain consequen- ces for the civilian population. For example, an attack on industrial control systems in the ener- gy supply system may result in a breakdown of production and/or distribution of electricity for the population, causing numerous problems. Furthermore, the attack on information systems in the healthcare sector can cause damage to people’s health, through possible modification of parameters on devices which the patients use to communicate online with the system in the heal- thcare institution. In addition to the above mentioned, it should be noted that a great challenge is also the fact that nowadays online instructions for organising cy- ber attacks using the “know-how to launch cyber attacks” model are widely available. Risks caused by natural disasters or human error In its “2014 Cyber Security Intelligence In- dex” research report, IBM’s presented a highly intriguing piece of information saying that 95% of all security incidents were cau- sed by the factor of human error. Many successful attacks were carried out by attackers using human weaknesses and various forms of intimidation to turn employees into insi- ders, who reluctantly allowed access to classified information. Contrary to that, there are constant risks that are difficult to predict and the entire mankind struggles with them; they are caused by natu- ral disasters, such as: earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Great physical damage can also be caused by fires, extremely high temperatures and lightning strikes, which can also lead to data loss. Other significant challenges Challenges relating to the home affairs of a country are equally significant as the ri- sks and threats described above. More spe- cifically, they represent one of the important prerequisites for adequate cyber protection. A need for further investment of funds in the strengthening of resources, expertise and con- tinuous progress in the field of proactive action within the cyberspace of Montenegro was reco- gnised. In a large number of countries and in- ternational organisations, such as NATO and the EU, cyber security is one of the top priorities, and so this problem has also been defined in re- levant strategies and concepts of cyber security. In addition to the above mentioned, the legal fra- mework limitations in this field are causing di- fficulties in procedure implementation. Namely, the cyber attacks on a country to be labelled as digital “armed attacks” remains a challenge. For this reason, there is a lack of adequate in- ternational level cooperation, while the role of international organisations is also very limited. Inadequate communication and cooperati- on between the public and private sectors largely results in the lack of trust of citizens in institutions and companies doing business on- line. On the other hand, insufficient digital li- 11 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 teracy of end-users and failure to observe best practices when using a communication device is a separate challenge. The reason for the above mentioned problem is insufficien- tly raised awareness among the population about the problem of cyber security in general. Finally, a great challenge for countries is a small number of experts who would be able to constantly participate in the cyber securi- ty domain and adequately implement reforms. Following the best security practices, one of the challenges is to clearly separate the fun- ctions of administration and governance of information systems from the security ma- nagement function of these systems. In cases when human resources are limited, in some institutions the functions of security and admi- nistration overlap. This fact directly causes a decrease in the level of security of the system because there is no second instance control over administrators, but they themselves also perform the security function of their institution.  03 Retrospect CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 13 The Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021 is a continuation of the previous stra- tegy, whose life cycle ends at the end of 2017. The starting point for the activities to be underta- ken in order to define and implement the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2013-2017 was, in the legislative sense - the Law on Infor- mation Security (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 014/10), and in the institutional sense - Di- rectorate for Protection against Computer and Security Incidents Online (CIRT), which operated within the then Ministry of Information Society and Telecommunications, and now belongs to the newly established Ministry of Public Admini- stration of the 41st Government of Montenegro, with the task of enabling early detection of cyber threats and incidents and adequately reacting and responding to them. The first Cyber Security Strategy for Montene- gro was adopted in 2013 for the period until 2017 and contains seven key strategic objectives: 1. Defining institutional and organisational stru- cture in the field of cyber security in the country; 2. Protection of critical information infrastructure in Montenegro; 3. Strengthening capacities of state law enforce- ment authorities; 4. Incident response; 5. Defining the role of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Montenegro in cyber- space; 6. Partnership of public and private sectors; 7. Raising public awareness and online protecti- on. The implementation of the above strategic obje- ctives was defined in more detail in two action plans for the implementation of the Strategy. The insight into the status of their implementati- on shows the intensive activity of the responsible authorities in fulfilling the set strategic objectives, which resulted in the successful implementation of a part of the activities identified in the action plans. The chapter continues to describe in detail the activities undertaken in order to deliver the main strategic objectives of the Cyber Security Stra- tegy for Montenegro 2013-2017, as well as the activities not undertaken on a satisfactory level which will be covered by the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021. 1. Defining institutional and organisatio- nal structure in the field of cyber securi- ty in the country This strategic objective recognises the need to have a clear organisational hierarchy within the The Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021 is a continuation of the previous strategy, whose life cycle ends at the end of 2017. 14 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 public administration, with defined responsibi- lities, which will ensure effective cyber security governance in Montenegro. The following have been identified as the institutions accountable for cyber security in Montenegro: • Ministry of Public Administration within which the national CIRT operates; • National Security Agency; • Ministry of Defence / Army of Montenegro; • Ministry of Interior / Police Administration; • Ministry of Justice; • Ministry of Education; • Directorate for Protection of Confidential Data. The accompanying two-year action plan for the implementation of the Strategy envisages the formation of the Information Security Council, which was formed at the 29th Session of the Go- vernment on 08 June 2017. Furthermore, the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2013-2017 envisages the formation of local CIRTs or appointment of contact persons in all state authorities, aimed at strengthening cyber infrastructure at the local level. A total of 31 local teams were created, in charge of coope- rating with members of the national CIRT on the issues of protection against computer security incidents on the Internet. Degree of implementation: It is evident that cyber security is becoming in- creasingly important in state authorities and that the institutions have largely recognised their role in cyberspace. Further activities aimed at completing the list of local CIRTs and appointing contact persons for cyber security issues will be the subject of activities of the relevant instituti- ons through the Action Plan 2018-2019, which will accompany the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021. 2. Protection of critical information in- frastructure in Montenegro In accordance with the task, the then Ministry of Information Society and Telecommunications of the 40th Government of Montenegro drafted the Law on Amendments to the Law on Informati- on Security (Official Gazette of Montenegro No 040/16) defining critical information infrastructu- re (CII). Critical information infrastructure consists of in- formation systems which, if compromised or destroyed, would endanger the life, health, and safety of citizens, as well as the functioning of the country, while the performance of public interest activities depends on their proper functioning. Upon the proposal of the then Ministry of Infor- mation Society and Telecommunications, the Government of Montenegro adopted the Met- hodology for selecting critical information in- frastructure. Based on the Methodology and in cooperation with other relevant institutions, the Ministry of Public Administration, which inheri- ted certain responsibilities of the former Ministry of Information Society and Telecommunications, has defined the list of critical information infra- structure in Montenegro, and the drafting of a Decree on measures for protecting CII is under way. Degree of implementation: The initial list of critical information infrastructu- re in Montenegro has been adopted, however, it should be taken into consideration that the list is to be regularly updated. After the adoption of the Decree on measures for protecting CII, it is ne- cessary to implement it in cooperation with the owners of the CII. 15 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 3. Strengthening capacities of state law enforcement authorities In the previous period, through legislation and strategic documents, Montenegro has followed the main standards, guidelines and recommen- dations of the EU and NATO regarding the cyber security capacity building. The information security legislation has been harmonised with the EU acquis to a significant extent. In addition, in 2016, the Law on Amen- dments to the Law on Information Security (Of- ficial Gazette of Montenegro, No 040/16) was adopted, providing for two key activities: the formation of the Information Security Council and the protection of critical information infra- structure, which are in line with the NIS Directive (2016/1148)8. In order to strengthen the capacities of state law enforcement authorities, a High-Tech Crime Gro- up has been set up at the Ministry of Interior, and it belongs to the Section for Fighting against Organised Crime and Corruption. The said Group provides for three working positions for staff de- aling with the issue of high-tech crime (classical acts of computer crime, child pornography, cre- dit card abuse, and copyright abuse). As of June 2013, a group for testing information technologies has been envisaged within the Fo- rensic Centre of the Police Administration in Da- nilovgrad. With regard to technical capacities, in addition to computer testing tools, mobile phone testing tools were also procured. The National Security Agency is making signi- ficant efforts aimed at creating normative and operational mechanisms for fighting against cyber crime and espionage, which, along with terrorism and organised crime, are becoming the greatest security challenges of today. The agency is working continuously and intensively 8 in order to strengthen cyber security organisati- onal and technical capacities. In order to strengthen the resilience of informa- tion systems, the ICT Service at the Ministry of Justice has carried out a series of activities in line with the tasks set out in the Strategy, whi- ch greatly reduce the vulnerability of the existing systems of the Ministry in cyberspace. Degree of implementation: Although the state authorities have recognised the need to strengthen their cyber security and cyber crime capacities in the previous period, it is necessary to continuously invest in further im- provement of national cyber defence capacities. 4. Incident Response The analysis of the incident reports in Montene- gro, which are drafted annually by CIRT, shows an evident trend of growth in the number of re- ported incidents year after year, as well as an increasing degree of sophistication of the attacks themselves. With the establishment of the national CIRT, a major step has been taken towards increasing the ability of state authorities to respond to cyber incidents affecting Montenegro. Degree of implementation: CIRT has been recognised as a focal point for responding to incidents in Montenegro, howe- ver, there is an evident lack of highly speciali- sed personnel for successfully responding to this challenge. In addition to the above, in order to respond to incidents, it is also necessary to im- plement tasks relating to the completion of the list of local CIRTs, as well as to the trainings for 16 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 the narrow specialisation of employees from the field of cyber security. 5. Defining the role of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Montenegro in cyberspace The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Armed Forces of Montenegro (AFoM) are fully respon- sible for the cyberspace created within MoD and AFoM and they cooperate with the national CIRT in Montenegro’s cyberspace protection. NATO targets (E 6202 N) have been adopted, defining the capacities that MoD and AFoM sho- uld develop in the next 2 to 5 year period. Degree of implementation: MoD and AFoM have a clear vision of their role in cyberspace. The role of MoD and AFoM will be further strengthened through the additional activities planned for the upcoming period. 6. Partnership of public and private sectors A large part of critical information infrastructu- re belongs to the private sector. Therefore it is necessary to clearly define cooperation with the private sector in the field of cyber security. With regard to the private sector, seven CIRTs were created within the companies Crnogorski Telekom, Telenor, M:tel, Wireless Montenegro, Telemach, M-kabl and Societe Generale Monte- negro Bank. One of the best examples of cooperation with the private sector is the activities undertaken 9 to organise joint promotional campaigns on the protection of children in cyberspace and the safe use of the Internet. Bearing in mind that CIRT recognised malware as one of the biggest threats in Montenegrin cy- berspace, a pilot project was launched on 4 No- vember 2016, in cooperation with the Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Services (EKIP) and Internet providers in Montenegro. The project was aimed at identifying infected computers as well as undertaking activities in order to recover from the consequences. The above was done in cooperation with EKIP and the Internet providers operating in Montenegro. In November 2016, joint meetings were held on this topic, and the test stage of the project was carried out. Degree of implementation: Evident progress has been made in terms of strengthening cooperation with the private se- ctor. Bearing in mind the significance of having a partnership of public and private sectors, it has been recognised as a priority by the Cyber Secu- rity Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021. 7. Raising public awareness and online protection In line with the task from the Strategy, the Mi- nistry of Public Administration has actively wor- ked on educating citizens through the leading of various promotional campaigns with a special focus on the protection of children on the Inter- net9. Additionally, in 2017, the Ministry of Public Administration decided to organise a special se- gment within INFOFEST dealing with the issue of cyber security. 17 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 The Human Resources Administration also inclu- ded a training for civil servants and employees on the topic of cyber security in its regular training program, which is being carried out in cooperati- on with the Ministry of Public Administration. So far, 350 civil servants and state employees have completed the training. In addition to this, a highly specialised training was conducted for staff members working on cy- ber security tasks. Some of the most important trainings were conducted in cooperation with NATO: M6-108 Network Security Course and M6-109 Network Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Mitigation Course, attended by 30 civil ser- vants each. Degree of implementation: This strategic objective has been implemented to a significant extent. However, given the speed of the development of information technologies, the increasing number of threats in the cyber space, as well as the lack of highly specialised personnel, this activity needs to be continuously implemented.  04 National organisational structure CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 19 National cyber security structure of Montenegro 20 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 It is necessary to have a good organisational hierar- chy within the state administration, that will ensure the most efficient and long-term sustainable provi- sion of adequate cyber security governance in Mon- tenegro. In line with the task of providing early detection of cyber threats and incidents and adequately reacting and responding to them, the Directorate for Protecti- on against Computer and Security Incidents Online (CIRT) was formed in 2012. CIRT is the central body for the coordination of pre- vention and protection against computer security incidents on the Internet and other security risks to information systems for the territory of Montenegro. In accordance with its responsibilities, CIRT acts: • In a preventive manner - through education, ra- ising awareness, providing useful information and advice on internet security, and • In a reactive manner - through analysis and con- ducting detailed investigations in case of online inci- dents at the national level. In addition to this, CIRT carries out activities to esta- blish and promote partner relations both at the na- tional level (with relevant authorities, private sector partners, and academic community), and the inter- national level, in order to respond to cyber threats in a better and more efficient manner. The analysis of the incident reports in Montenegro, which are drafted annually by CIRT, records a trend of growth in the number of reported incidents year after year, as well as a degree of sophistication of the attacks themselves. In accordance with the Law on Amendments to the Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 40/2016) the Information Security Council was formed on August 1, 2017 (Official Ga- zette of Montenegro, No 48/2017), thus providing a national parent organisation to advise the Govern- ment of Montenegro on all important issues in this field. The Council’s tasks are to: - inform the Government of Montenegro on all im- portant issues related to cyber security; - monitor the implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro and the action plans for its implementation; - monitor and coordinate activities in the field of cy- ber security; - propose measures for harmonisation of the legisla- tive and administrative frameworks in order to im- prove the cyber security of Montenegro; - work to improve cooperation between state autho- rities and administrative bodies in the field of cyber security and coordinate their activities; - work to improve cooperation with the private se- ctor in the field of cyber security; - submit its performance report to the Government of Montenegro at least once a year.

The goal of this Directive is a comprehensive re- gulation of national cyber security of the Member States. It consists of five chapters and, in order to fulfil the obligations, the Member States, shall: • adopt a national cyber security strategy; • define the relevant authorities in the field of cy- ber security; • have at least one Computer Emergency Res- ponse Team (CERT). These teams have to cover relevant sectors and services. These teams must also have adequate resources and tools in order to fulfil their complex functions and tasks; • regulate the security of the information systems of the owners of essential, critical services in the technical and organisational manner stipulated by the Directive; • regulate the security of the information systems of the owners of digital services in the technical and organisational manner stipulated by the Di- rective; • voluntarily use the recommended EU standar- ds. The extent of the differences between the EU member states regarding the protection of network and information security can be conclu- ded from the directive itself: „Existing capabilities are not sufficient to ensure a high level of security of network and information systems within the Union. Member States have very different levels of preparedness, which has led to fragmented approaches across the Union. This results in an unequal level of protection of consumers and businesses, and undermines the overall level of security of network and information systems within the Union.“ „National strategy on the security of network and information systems’ means a framework providing strategic objectives and priorities on the security of network and information systems at national level.“ Pursuant to Article 7 of the NIS Directive, each Member State shall adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems by 9 May 2018, which may be considered as equivalent to the National Cyber Security Stra- The development of a national concept for cyber security should now be directed through two newly formed important factors, from the adoption and implementa- tion of the first national cyber security strategy - accession to the NATO alliance and the opening of the negotiation Chapter 10 - Information Society. 24 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 tegy, and six months after that Member States must complete the identification of operators of essential services. The Commission adopted an Annex on the effective application of the NIS Di- rective COM (2017) 476 of 4 October 2017. Furt- hermore, the Commission presented a proposal for the ENISA reform, which includes its per- manent mandate as a reference point in the EU cyber system, and that is will ensure the imple- mentation of the NIS Directive and the proposed Information and Communication Technology cy- ber security certification Framework COM (2017) 477 of 4 October 2017. For some companies that hold critical sectors, the EU’s General Data Pro- tection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 is very important, and it will be in application as of May 2018. Companies will have to take care of the data processing of the entities from the EU due to severe penalties for non-compliance, therefore they are obliged to start adapting their business to the new requirements of the Regula- tion that deal with information risks, ICT security, rapid reaction to discovering threats and data breach, recovery of information and continuity of successful business. Although the NIS Directive is not binding for Montenegro, the implementation of its recom- mendations would contribute to the development of a modern, efficient and European compatible national cyber security concept. And while there could be room for discussion about the application of ENISA recommendati- ons, when it comes to the NATO alliance, there is no dilemma for Montenegro as its full member. At the Warsaw Summit of 2016, NATO declared the cyber domain the fourth operational domain, making the effects and consequences in cyber- space equal to that within the remaining three domains: water, air and land. Additionally, in July 2016, the heads and presidents of the govern- ments of the NATO Member States committed themselves to treating cyberspace in strategic 10 Globalni sajber bezbjednosni indeks za 2017. Link: sense the same as the remaining three opera- tional domains in their so-called “cyber pledge”. Among other things, Member States pledged to: • strengthen and enhance the cyber defences of national networks and infrastructures, as a matter of priority; • allocate adequate resources nationally to strengthen their cyber defence capabilities; • reinforce the interaction amongst their res- pective national cyber defence stakeholders to deepen co-operation and the exchange of best practices; • enhance skills and awareness, among all defen- ce stakeholders at national level, of fundamental cyber hygiene through to the most sophisticated and robust cyber defences; • foster cyber education, training and exercising of their forces, and enhance their educational institutions, to build trust and knowledge across the Alliance. The Government of Montenegro will continue to undertake activities towards the implementation of the strategic objectives defined in the Strategy so as to ensure further improvement of the con- cept of cyber security of Montenegro in order to be compatible with the concepts of the most de- veloped EU and NATO Member States. Special attention will be paid to harmonisation with regard to the standardisation of concepts, methods, policies and procedures in line with the accepted European and international standards. 1. Cyber defence capacities According to the Global Cybersecurity Index10, drafted in 2017 by the International Telecommu- nication Union, Montenegro ranks 71st in the field of cyber security with a coefficient of 0.422, 25 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 out of 193 countries covered by this research. Compared to the region, Montenegro ranks hig- her than Albania (89), Serbia (90), Bosnia and Herzegovina (136), and Slovenia (84), while Cro- atia (41) and Macedonia (55) rank higher than Montenegro. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: The Government of Montenegro will conti- nue its dedicated work on the further stren- gthening of the cyber security capacities in the sense of providing adequate human and financial resources as well as meeting other needs necessary for efficient and agile cyber capacities of Montenegrin institutions aimed at ensuring safe cyber space, providing busi- ness incentives and ultimately contributing to the economic prosperity of Montenegro. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) Relevant institutions in the field of cyber secu- rity will establish CIRTs or identify staff members whose basic tasks will be related to the activities from the cyber security domain - so-called local CIRTs. Indicator of success: the percentage-wise increase of the current number of CIRTs com- pared to the number of established teams and the number of institutions that should have CIRTs. b) Relevant institutions must have capacities to recognise, identify and conduct annual risk analysis, or if necessary, risk analysis for a shor- ter period of time, which will be related to infor- mation systems within their own institutions or within their scope of work. Indicator of success: the number of condu- cted risk analyses compared to the number of institutions. 11 More information via link: c) Budgetary funds must be allocated every year to separate bodies or organisational units within institutions that have been identified as key for Montenegrin cyber security system so that they can procure adequate resources and tools for the effective functioning. Indicator of success: the number of instituti- ons which have budgetary funds intended for cyber security and the number of institutions that have a trend of increasing the annual budget for these needs. d) Relevant bodies must define an optimal num- ber of staff members in their CIRT, i.e. the num- ber of employees who will be in charge of cyber security, with the aim of providing an adequate response to threats, challenges, risk analysis and possible attacks to their information systems. The previously said must be done at the annu- al level in order to obtain the current number of employees and also the necessary number of employees at the national level. ENISA11 recom- mends that CIRT should have a minimum of 12 staff members for a fully staffed 24/7 shift. Indicator of success: a report on the minimal number of staff members in charge of cyber security. 2. Centralisation of cyber expertise and resources STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: The Government of Montenegro will underta- ke activities with a view to centralising and gat- hering expertise in the field of cyber security in order to: strengthen capacities for the purpose of responding efficiently to sophisticated cyber threats against critical information structures and other important information systems; un- derstand risks to cyberspace of Montenegro; 26 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 provide adequate recommendations and im- prove cooperation with the private and public sectors. With regard to cyber capacities and defence, the leading states have started establishing cyber security and incident response independent insti- tutions, which has proven to be a necessary and very efficient step. Thus, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland established the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2015, gathering several institutions, including the natio- nal Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT). In 2012, the Republic of Croatia established the In- formation Systems Security Bureau (ISSB) which also serves the function of a National CIRT, while Australia, apart from the Cyber Security Centre, representing a major cyber security capability, has also the Joint Cyber Security Centre, which brin- gs together business, government and academia, and represents innovative and efficient approach to cyber security in the sense of better sharing of information and trust among different actors, strengthening of cooperation and pooling forces, in order to provide a unique response to cyber thre- ats, attacks and challenges. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) In line with the Strategy for the Development of Information Society 2020 , the National CIRT will have ten staff members by 2018, and 20 staff members by 2020. Indicator of success: the fulfilment of set dead- lines and the number of employees in the Nati- onal CIRT. b) National CIRT will have two departments - for incident response, of technical character, and for strategic goals, politics and preventive. Indicator of success: amendments to the Ru- lebook on the Internal Organisation and Syste- matisation of working positions of the Ministry of Public Administration. c) Two specialised rooms will be provided for ope- rations of the National CIRT, where experts from other institutions will be allowed to work in the event of attacks against CII and large scale attacks against Montenegro. Indicator of success: the number of rooms meeting a minimum of technical standards compared to the number of envisaged ones. d) National CIRT will regularly organise specialist exercises, simulation of attacks against CII and lar- ge scale attacks, for members of relevant bodies, as well as companies accountable for CII. Indicator of success: the number of organised exercises and actors included. 3. Protection of critical information infrastructure No. Critical sector Accountable institution for critical sector 1.

State authorities | Services of the Government of MNE Ministry of Public Administration 27 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 In accordance with the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021, the amendments to the Law on Information Security were adopted (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 40/2016), through which formally and legally critical in- formation structure have been defined as (pre- viously it was defined through Methodology for selecting CII): „information systems of bodies which, if compromised or destroyed, would en- danger the life, health, and safety of citizens, as well as the functioning of the country, while the performance of public interest activities depends on their proper functioning“. A detailed analysis of information systems of the responsible authorities was drafted within the first stage. A detailed analysis of information systems of the state authorities was drafted within the second stage. Within the third stage, a questionnaire was sent to the private sector, on the basis of which the analysis of their information systems was acqui- red, thereby analyses of information systems of all critical sectors have been completed. On the basis of the said analysis, and the analysis of criticality, a proposal list of critical information systems was adopted, after which the Govern- ment of Montenegro tasked the Ministry of Pu- blic Administration to adopt a final list of CII, and subsequently the define protection measures. The European Union identifies two main met- hods for protecting CII: The first one, where the overall process is governed by the state, applied by Montenegro, and the second one, where the main function belongs to operators/owners of CII. Eight critical sectors have been identified in Montenegro which include one or more CIIs: Se- curity control of CII within a sector belongs to line ministries or other state authorities that have the legal basis and obligation for securing and regu- lating these sectors. National CIRT is a central point for coordination of activities, development of cooperation and other activities related to this field. Case study In February 2017, a number of services belonging to the state authorities were under intensive and continuous DDoS attack, lasting for two weeks. The analysis showed that the attack originated from a wide range of IP addresses spread all over the world, and represented a network of so-called zombies - compromised computers characteristic of this kind of attacks, and during this period of time, several state services were under a conti- nuous cyber attack. The said incident influenced on raising awarene- ss of the consequences that can be caused by an attack in cyberspace. Simultaneously, the state authorities dealing with the defence had an oppor- tunity to test their capacities and to develop faster and more efficient cooperation with partners from private sector with the aim of more efficient defen- ce from this type of attacks. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: The Government of Montenegro will continue to strengthen the CII defence capabilities, and since the National CIRT has a key role in this field - it must have adequate resources and tools to effectively understand, analyse and respond to the wide spectrum of threats in this field. The resources of state authorities in charge of safety control of CII must be adequate to the task, i.e. the state authorities must have staff members who understand threats and risks for specific CII belonging to their sector. Hu- man and technical resources must be strengt- hened with the aim of efficient performance of this function. 28 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 With the aim of efficient defence, it is necessary to identify and essentially understand risks rela- ted to CII, namely related to the fields of action, different information platforms, systems, functi- ons and technologies that CII is made up from, which is a complex task and a challenge. Bea- ring in mind that a large part of CII belongs to a private sector, the Government of Montenegro will provide support in identifying risks for critical systems, and, when necessary, establish addi- tional protection measures aimed at protecting national resources. The Government of Montenegro will also conti- nue to improve the legislative framework, stan- dards and obligations that the owners of CII must comply with, due to harmonisation with the EU Network Information Security Directive of Eu- ropean Parliament and of the Council. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) Owners of identified CII are required to condu- ct annual risk analysis. National CIRT, in coope- ration with other responsible CIRTs, is in charge of reviewing the analyses, and providing assi- stance in making analyses where CII owners do not have sufficient capacities. Indicator of success: the number of condu- cted analyses compared to the number of CIIs, as well as their quality. b) Adoption of secondary legislation for prote- cting CII. This regulation should define the proce- dures for communication between owners of CII and responsible institutions, as well as basic te- chnical and organisational measures that owners of CII have to implement. Indicator of success: an adopted Decree on measures for protecting CII. c) National CIRT, in cooperation with other CIRTs, should establish and formalise strategic partner- ships with owners of CII, where, among other things, exchange of information should be speci- fied, as well as the manners of exchanging infor- mation and expertise. Indicator of success: the number of formali- sed partnerships with holders of CII. 4.Inter-institutional cooperation STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: The need for strengthening inter-institutional cooperation has been identified, whereby a special accent will be placed on efficient and timely exchange of information and best pra- ctices. In this context, the responsible instituti- ons will work on strengthening communication methods through, among other things, orga- nisation of exercises for crisis communication in the case of cyber incidents and large scale attacks. The exercises will be aimed at defi- ning clear communication procedures in crisis situations as well as their timely revision. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) In order to further facilitate cooperation and communication among institutions, there is a need for appointing contact persons for cyber security on behalf of all actors involved. Indicator of success: the number of appoin- ted contact persons compared to the number of institutions. b) Establishment of a publicly available registry of cyber experts which would be managed by the ministry responsible for this field. Indicator of success: the functioning of regi- stries of cyber experts. c) Development of a platform for dialogue and exchange of information which would connect 29 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 cyber security experts from public and private sectors, both at local and national level. Indicator of success: an operational platform. d) Setting up of an inter-ministerial working gro- up at technical level which would gather cyber security experts and create capacity to defend against cyber attacks. Indicator of success: the formed inter-mini- sterial working group. e) Inter-ministerial working group will organise simulations and exercises aimed at efficiency, coordination and communication. Indicator of success: the number of orga- nised exercises at annual level, duration of exercises as well as the number of covered situations. f) Drafting of a rulebook and procedures for ex- change of information on cyber incidents, the manner of communication in the event of cyber attacks, and the manner of assistance and co- operation among state authorities. Indikcator of success: a defined rulebook and procedures on the exchange of informa- tion on cyber incidents and communication among bodies. 5. Data protection STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: For the purpose of providing an adequate pro- tection of the important part of information in- frastructure, the Government of Montenegro will strengthen the national capacities nece- ssary for security accreditation of communi- cation and information systems and the pro- cesses where classified information is used, as well as the capacities in the field of crypto protection. 12 Law on Data Confidentiality (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 14/13 of 15 March 2013) and the Decree on detailed conditions and manner of implementing measures of classified information protection (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 57/10 of 1 October 2010) The Law on Data Confidentiality acknowledges the principle of marking information with a cer- tain level of classification and the way of dealing with these data, from those marked with the lowest level of classification whose disclosure would make harmful consequences for functio- ning of the body, to those with the highest level of classification whose disclosure would endan- ger or cause irreparable harmful consequences for security and interests of Montenegro. As a result of computerisation of business proces- ses, these data are created, processed and kept electronically, and due to the need for efficient exchange of information, they are all the more transferred through cyberspace. With a view to providing adequate protection and raising the level of culture of handling classified and sensi- tive information electronically, it is necessary to strengthen the national capacities needed for the implementation of the legally prescribed security accreditation of communication and information systems and processes where classified data are marked as CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET, and also provide a proper management system for security of information in the systems where data marked as INTERNAL are used12, as well as in the systems where unclassified sensitive data are handled. Also, it is necessary to plan national capacities in the long run with the aim of develo- ping domestic cryptographic solutions. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) In March 2017, a set of legal regulations was adopted necessary for implementing certificati- on of communication and information systems and processes where secret data of higher cla- ssification are used. It has been recognised that there is a room for improvement of this set of regulations, particularly in the part of certification of “standalone” machines and inter-connection 30 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 of communication and information systems. Indicator of success: the drafting of relevant legal acts and supporting documents by the inter-ministerial working group. b) Strengthening of information capacities of the state authority in charge of security accreditation of communication and information systems and processes where classified information is used (Security Accreditation Authority - SAA), and the state authority responsible for handling materials for cryptographic protection of secret data (Nati- onal Distribution Authority - NDA). Indicator of success: the number of newly employed IT specialists in the Directorate for Protection of Confidential Data which will deal with accreditation of communication and in- formation systems and with management of crypto materials. c) Strengthening of the institutional capacities necessary for carrying out certification of com- munication and information systems and their inter-connections through the introduction of a systematised function that includes a job des- cription for information security of classified in- formation in state institutions where classified information is mostly handled electronically (for higher levels of classification a separate working position is provided, while for the lowest level of classification it is possible to add a job description to the existing working position). Indicator of success: the number of systemi- sed working positions with a job description related to information security of classified data. d) Certification of communication and informati- on systems where information marked with hig- her level of classification is used, the introduction of security information management system and risk management in communication and infor- mation systems where classified data marked as INTERNAL are used (ISO/IEC 27000 certification with additional security measures) and unclassi- fied sensitive information (ISO/IEC 27001). Indicator of success: the number of certified communication and information systems and the number of conducted internal reviews aimed at controlling the implementation of standards. e) Establishing cooperation with educational and scientific institutions with the aim of long-term education and training of personnel, for the needs of creating national cryptographic solutions. Indicator of success: the degree of establis- hed cooperation and the number of educati- onal or scientific projects resulting from that. 6. Cyber security education STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: In order to achieve the best cyber security pra- ctice, the responsible bodies will learn about the newest cyber threats and undertake acti- vities on educating citizens and organisations about protection mechanisms in cyberspa- ce. Sustainable, continuous and coordinated efforts are necessary to achieve wider chan- ges in behaviour and secure that all target groups, public and private sectors, as well as individual citizens, understand risks and thre- ats in cyberspace. Raising awareness of threats in cyberspace and their influence on the overall society is of vital im- portance. Through raising awareness, individual and corporative users may learn how to behave and feel secure and ready to do business online. Education of employees and citizens through pu- blishing of various security tips, instructions and warnings is based on current trends in techno- logy and distribution of relevant knowledge of regional and international experts. An important 31 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 segment in spreading awareness is also impro- ving contents on the portal with materials, whi- ch are continuously updated in accordance with new technologies related to information security (guidelines, rulebook, presentations, webinars, lectures). Focus on different target groups is a result of successful and efficient campaigns of raising awareness of security challenges. Continuous following and evaluation of campaigns serve for identifying new emerging needs and for adapting the campaign processes. Sustainable human and financial resources and continuous monito- ring can contribute to increasing flexibility and adaptability of the campaigns. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) In order to promote and spread the cyber se- curity culture, it is necessary to progressively continue with participation in and organisation of conferences, workshops, trainings, as well as with production of publications, drafting of pa- pers and articles, and participation in educational programmes. Indicator of success: the number of held con- ferences/workshops/trainings and the num- ber of appearing in educational programmes. b. Given that constant education, following of trends and awareness raising are of major im- portance for cyber security, it is necessary to constantly improve the contents on the portal CIRT.ME, with materials related to security, whi- ch are continuously updated in accordance with the new technologies (tips, warnings, announce- ments, guidelines, rulebooks, presentations, we- binars, lectures). Indicator of success: an amount of published contents on the portal CIRT.ME and an amo- unt of updated materials. c) It is necessary to educate teaching staff in or- der to raise their awareness of cyber security because they spend the most of the time dire- ctly working with children, so they are able to in- fluence on raising awareness of this topic among children. Indicator of success: the number of teachers trained according to the previously establis- hed training programme. d) A special target group that has been recogni- sed are school pedagogues and psychologists. The majority of problems in school are resolved in pedagogical and psychological service, there- fore their knowledge and understanding of this topic is of great importance for helping children. Previously, it is necessary to determine whether all school pedagogues are digitally literate, and if not, it is necessary to teach them basic computer skills, and afterwards, carry out trainings related to cyber security. Indicator of success: the number of trained pedagogues and psychologists according to the previously established training agenda. e) Regular subject Informatics with Technique which is learnt from the fifth grade of primary school, comprising a certain number of lessons, is not sufficient when it comes to the topic of cy- ber security, therefore it is necessary to organise extra-curriculum activities for school-age chil- dren on these topics, especially for children of very young age. Indicator of success: the number of held workshops, competitions, debates, and so on, as well as the number of children included in these activities. f) It is necessary to develop a set of materials on various topics of cyber security which will be adjusted to various ages of children. Materials should be published on the school portal ( skolskiportal.edu.me) in the category Online Se- curity of Children. Indicator of success: the number of created 32 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 materials (photos, videos, rulebooks, guideli- nes, recommendations, games, etc.). 7. Partnership of public and private sectors STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: In the upcoming period, the Government of Montenegro will continue its dedicated work aimed at supporting the both - response to incidents and sharing of information and joint initiatives in partnership with private sector. Therefore, only high level of communication, cooperation and integration can be an efficient way to understand and properly respond to the needs and challenges of private compa- nies, with the aim of undertaking the nece- ssary measures and achieving a sufficient de- gree of security. Improving of cyber security demands a combi- ned, multi-user, comprehensive approach focu- sed on cooperation with private companies. The cooperation provides, through joint research and exchange of experiences and practice, that no part of the critical infrastructure, whether in pu- blic or private hands, become a weak link and vulnerability. Partnership of public and private sectors is an efficient tool in protecting national interests. Sha- ring of information, expertise and knowledge is a form of strategic partnership between share- holders from public and private sectors. In ac- cordance with the Law on Amendments to the Law on Information Security, the Information Se- curity Council has been formed, representing a framework for constant exchange of information among public administration, representatives of the economy, science and research. The Infor- mation Security Council should provide proce- dures for exchanging information between state authorities and key private sector institutions, particularly the Internet provider, the banking sector and the Electric Power Industry of Mon- tenegro (EPCG). Building of a successful public and private sectors partnership takes into con- sideration different elements as well as challen- ges and barriers that such structures can face. Establishing of efficient cooperation among sta- keholders is one of the main challenges due to different interests, trust, competition and lack of clear managerial structure. Companies reluctantly report security incidents due to potential loss of reputation, so building of trust is a process that requires an extensive dialogue, time and effort. Partnerships demand a clear framework which determines roles of pu- blic and private sectors, their relations and areas of cooperation. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) With the aim of developing efficient respon- se to cyber security, it is necessary to work on improving and institutionalisation of cooperation among public and private sectors. Indicator of success: the number of establis- hed public and private partnerships. b) Drafting of procedures for exchange of infor- mation on cyber incidents, the ways of commu- nicating in the case of cyber attacks, the ways of assistance and cooperation between public and private sectors. Indicator of success: a defined rulebook on procedure for exchange of information on cyber incidents and communication between public and private sectors. 33 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 8. Regional and international cooperati- on STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: The Government of Montenegro will continue with its regional and international activities and exercise its influence by investing in par- tnerships which shape global evolution of cy- berspace in the manner which improves and spreads economic and security interests and strengthens collective security. Considering the global nature of the Internet and, consequently, the problems of cyber security, re- gional and international cooperation is necessary for securing the cyberspace of Montenegro. Due to an increasing number of security inci- dents, the existing capabilities of Computer In- cident Response Team (CIRT) are no longer sufficient. In order to provide a proper response and protect national interests, cooperation and activities with regional and international partners should continue. It is necessary to further strengthen relations with bilateral and multilateral partners, including the EU, NATO, OSCE and UN, particularly throu- gh collective defence and collective security. Such cooperation facilitates positive exchange of experiences, knowledge and best practices, all of which contribute to the strengthening of national security. Therefore, Montenegro will continue to promote the participation of its representatives in international organisations, as well as in pro- fessional exercises and associations in this field. PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS: a) As the exchange of regional and internatio- nal experiences and best practices contributes to the strengthening and development of cyber security, the active participation should continue through joint exercises, trainings, meetings, fora, conferences, seminars. Indicator of success: the number of held trainings, conferences, seminars, exercises, meetings, and it will be of qualitative chara- cter. b) With a view to strengthening cooperation with key international institutions in the field of cyber security, it is necessary to continue cooperating with organisations that we belong to (FIRST, ITU, NATO), and work on establishing and promoting new partnerships. Indicator of success: the number of establi- shed partnerships, signed agreements and memoranda.  06 Monitoring CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 35 For the purpose of providing an adequate im- plementation of the Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021 and accompanying acti- on plans, pursuant to Art. 13 para.1 of the Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of MNE, No 14/10 and 40/16), the Government of Mon- tenegro adopted a Decision on forming the In- formation Security Council with the task, among others, to monitor the implementation of the Strategy and the action plans. The bodies identified as accountable for activities defined by the Strategy and accompanying acti- on plans are obliged to submit quarterly reports on the implementation thereof to the Information Security Council. On the basis of the delivered reports, the Council will analyse the achieved results and, in accor- dance with its powers, give opinions and recom- mendations if the degree of the implementation does not follow the established dynamics. The Council will submit annual performance re- ports to the Government, which will address the degree of fulfilment of strategic goals defined by the Strategy and activities from the Action Plan, and it will also contain proposal measures for further improvement of Montenegro’s cyber se- curity.  07 Concluding review CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 37 Functioning of every individual in the modern era cannot be imagined without the use of informa- tion and communication technologies. Develop- ment of technologies stimulates the economic and social development of a state, ensuring its competiveness and positioning in the region and Europe. Therefore, Montenegro cannot and must not be an exception. Taking into consideration the previously said, and the fact that a number of threats in cybers- pace is constantly growing, simultaneously with further development of information society, it is necessary to constantly work on improving cy- ber security. The Government of Montenegro is devoted to growth and prosperity through strong cyber se- curity. In the past period, on the basis of Art. 13a of the Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of MNE, No 14/10 and 40/16), the Government of Montenegro adopted the Decision on forming the Council on Information Security. The Council will, inter alia, monitor the implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy, by delivering quarterly reports submitted by the bodies identified as the main holders of activities defined by the Strategy the accompanying action plans. In this manner, analyses will be conducted, and opinions and re- commendations will be provided, in accordance with respective responsibilities of bodies, while annually a performance report will be delivered to the Government of Montenegro. When it comes to critical information structure of Montenegro, on the basis of the Cyber Se- curity Strategy 2013-2017, amendments to the Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of MNE, No 40/16) were adopted, where critical in- formation structure has been defined, and on the basis of that - eight critical sectors identified. The process of protecting CII is governed by the state of Montenegro, and this model of governance is one of the two management models in the Eu- ropean Union. National CIRT is a central point for coordination of activities, development of co- operation and other activities related to this field. In the period to come, the Government of Monte- negro will continue to strengthen cyber defence of CII, by providing adequate resources and tools for understanding, analysing and responding to threats by national CIRT and other state autho- rities in charge of controlling the security of CII. This Strategy identifies a total of eight objectives for improving the National Cyber Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021, namely: 1. reliance on European and Euro-Atlantic con- cepts, 2. strengthening the cyber defence capacities, 3. centralisation of cyber expertise and resour- ces, Security of Montenegrin cyberspace is of major importance for the overall security of the state and its citizens. Greater engagement of the representatives from the public, private, academic and civil sector in the upcoming period will contribute to providing cyber security. 38 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 4. strengthening of inter-institutional cooperati- on, 5. data protection, 6. cyber security education, 7. strengthening partnership between public and private sectors, 8. strengthening regional and international co- operation. Through clearly defined strategic aims, Mon- tenegro will develop fully compatible concept with concepts of the most developed EU and NATO member states. Such concept will crea- te a pre-condition for a more secure information society and provide successful implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy and existing legal regulations dealing with this field. With the aim of strengthening cyber security capacities, the Government of Montenegro will continue to pay a great attention to providing ad- ditional human and financial resources and other needs of institutions which work actively on se- curity of Montenegro’s cyberspace. Activities aimed at attracting a wider pool of cy- ber expertise and resources will ensure stren- gthening of capacities for responding to threats against critical information infrastructure and ot- her systems of state importance, understanding of risks for Montenegro’s cyberspace, provision of adequate recommendations and encourage- ment of cooperation between public and private sectors. Also, Montenegro will strengthen national ca- pacities necessary for security accreditation of communications and information systems and processes where classified information is used, as well as the capacities in the field of crypto- graphic protection of data. The responsible institutions will actively work on strengthening inter-institutional cooperation, through efficient and timely exchange of infor- mation and best practices, organisation of exer- cises and simulation of large scale attacks. In this way, clear procedures for communication in cri- sis situations will be defined and the shortcomin- gs identified, to be eliminated in a timely manner. Regional and international cooperation is an im- portant segment in providing national cyber se- curity, so Montenegro will continue with regional and international activities and invest in partner- ships, with the aim of improving and spreading economic and security interests, as well as im- proving collective security. The Government of Montenegro will undertake further steps with the aim of raising awareness of the problem of cyber security of both - insti- tutions and organisations, and citizens as well. Raising awareness through providing informati- on on what should be done to protect oneself on the Internet will result in the overall change of behaviour and ensure that everybody is aware of protection at home, in school and at work. In the period to come, the work on strengthening public and private partnerships will be continued with the intention of information sharing, launc- hing of joint initiatives and response to incidents. Public-private partnership is the efficient way to understand and properly respond to the needs and challenges of private companies, with the aim of undertaking the necessary measures and achieving a sufficient degree of security. Finally, safe cyberspace encourages favourable environment for further development and pro- gress, to the satisfaction of all citizens.  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021 Annex Definitions and terms 41 Active Cyber Defence The principle of implementing security measures to strengthen the security of a network or sys- tem to make it more robust against attack.

According to estimates, there are about 8 billi- on of inter-connected devices in the world. It is  estimated that by 2020, the number of devices  would exceed 20 billion, which speaks for the de- gree of integration of physical systems with the  computer systems, resulting in greater effective- ness, accuracy, greater economic benefits, but  also more serious adverse consequences in case  of a cyber attack.  Bearing in mind increasing integration of cyber  and physical systems and adverse consequen- ces which could be caused by a compromised  cyber system, cyber security and its developed  national, regional and international architectures  play a crucial role.   The accelerated development of inter-connected,  innovative technologies must also be followed by  a fast development of cyber-security solutions,  namely the protection from a wide spectrum of  threats and that certainly represents a challenge  to which all of us must respond with joint forces.  Undoubtedly, cyber security is a challenge of the  modern age and, as such, not even Montene-  1 Global Cybersecurity Index 2017.   Link: https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/str/D-STR-GCI.01-2017-PDF-E.pdf  gro is exempt from it. We witness an increasing  number of cyber incidents which affect Montene- gro, through the recent ransomware campaigns,  DDoS attacks against the public infrastructure,  various online frauds, etc. Year after year, the  number of these cyber incidents is significantly  increasing.  We must be aware that the threats to the IC infra- structure which may threaten its availability, pri- vacy and integrity may also affect the functioning  of the society as a whole. Countries, international  organisations, security companies, and various  other entities are constantly developing and im- plementing new security mechanisms, however,  simultaneously there is a process in which cyber  criminals are inventing innovative and sophisti- cated techniques to bypass them.   With regard to the development of information  technologies and cyber security, according to the  UN report i.e. International Telecommunication  Union (ITU) report called “Global Cybersecurity  Index1 2017”, Montenegro ranks 71st out of 193  member states. However, due to daily occurren- ce of new threats, our efforts with regard to cy- ber security must follow that pace as well.             Due to the constant growth of the number of online services that public and private  sectors provide to the citizens as well as to other legal entities, safe cyberspace of  Montenegro is becoming one of national priorities.     02 Modern risks, threats and  challenges  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021    7  There are numerous risks and challenges faced  by a large number of countries. The increase in  the number of information systems and tech- nologies, among other things, conditioned the  setting up of new memory environments (Clo- ud Storage), which certainly represents a great  challenge and is the subject of separate analy- ses. Furthermore, there is an evident increase  in the number of malicious programs for mobile  devices.  According to the research presented by Sy- mantec in April 2017 2, about 18.4 million of  malicious programs were detected in 2016,  which is 105% more than in 2015 (9 million).  In 2014, approximately 3.6 million pieces of  malware were detected.  Revolution of new technologies  The Internet revolution carries a number of  2 Symantec Internet Security Report vol. 22 - https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/gistr22-government-report.pdf 3 http://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm  4 RFID Journal – “That ‘Internet of Things’ Thing”: http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986  extremely useful possibilities, so an evident huge  increase in the number of users every day is no  surprise.  It is interesting to note that, since the be- ginning of the implementation of the previo- us Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro  (2013), the number of internet users on a  global level has increased from 2.5 billion to  3.9 billion (until June 2017) 3.  We can come across the expression “prolifera- tion of cyber technology” in the literature. This  term refers to the parsing or multiplication of  technologies which, by connecting to the global  network, also become a part of the cyberspace.   One of the sources of cyber risk proliferation is  the Internet of Things (IoT), a term first defined  by Kevin Ashton, founder of the Auto-ID Centre  at the MIT, in his presentation on the new po- ssibilities of RFID in Procter & Gamble’s supply  chain in 1999.4  Continuous advancement of information technologies and enlargement of the cy- berspace to a large extent stimulates economic and social progress of every co- untry in the world. Information security represents a common interest of the entire  mankind and it refers both to the global peace and development and to the national  security of all countries. However, this advantage also entails new security risks  and challenges.    8  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  Global penetration of Internet users  in the period 2013-2017  IoT is a set of devices, vehicles, household  appliances, as well as other items with built-in  electronics, software, sensors, etc. connected to  a shared network. Taking into account the fact   5 https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1209280 6 IHS Technology – IoT platforms: enabling the Internet of Things: https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/enabling-IOT.pdf  that the connecting of the aforementioned items  enables unhindered communication, recording  of information and data exchange, the concern  in the world of informatics is quite justified. The- refore, this concept represents one of the leading  security issues in the world.   The term that includes a larger domain is called  the Internet of Everything (IoE) and was first defi- ned by CISCO as a part of the 2013 study entitled  “Internet of Everything Value Index5.  IoE represents an intelligent network of people,  processes, data and things. More accurately,  it is based on IoT, adding network intelligence  that enables the efficient use of telephone, video  and data communications via the same network  (convergence), automation or process improve- ment with potential synchronisation of real-time  data (orchestration), as well as visibility in diffe- rent systems.  On the other hand, an abundance of different op- tions brings with it threats that can cause adver- se consequences to a large extent.  “We are entering the fourth generation of the Internet.  In the next 10 years, we will see that the competitiveness of the company will be   measured by how well they understand the IoE concept and how much they use it.”  Michael Ganser Senior Vice President of CISCO Central Europe  According to a study presented by one of  the Britain’s and global leading research  companies in 2017, IHS technology, more  than 20 billion devices are connected via the  Internet. It is estimated that by the end of  2020 there will be at least 30 billion, while by  2025 this number will exceed an incredible  75 billion. 6  Such an expansion of devices will definitely bring  about new opportunities, but will also make addi- tional room for actions of malicious individuals or  groups, because in most cases the devices are  not designed in compliance with the online secu- rity standards.    9  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  Numerous activities can be listed under cyber  attacks. In many cases the attacks are carried  out for the purposes of espionage and sabotage.  Espionage refers to the unnoticeable tracking  and collection of information and confidential  data about a person or a company using diffe- rent software and services, which can eventually  be publicly presented, most often through me- dia. The activities are usually carried out using a  method called “backdoor”, which can be special  software or be incorporated as a program code  in the firmware of a network device and thus de- liver information to the attacker.  Sabotage achieves certain goals, most often of  political nature. In this manner, the processes of  institutional work or military action are delibera- tely interfered with and this enables the removal  or takeover of control and command. The most  common examples of sabotage are carried out  using botnets for DDoS/DoS attacks.   During 2016, the companies Kaspersky Lab  and B2B International polled about 4,000   7 Kaspersky Lab Finds Businesses are Unclear on How to Combat Targeted Attacks and DDoS Link: https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2017_kaspersky-lab-finds-businesses-are-unclear-on-how-to-combat-targeted-attacks-and-ddos  companies from 25 countries that were  affected by some of the DDoS attacks.7   About 40% of the companies said they be- lieved that the attack had been caused by  their competitors, 20% blamed foreign go- vernments and secret service organisati- ons, while 20% suspected that the attacks  had been carried out by former employees.  The second problem refers to cyber crime and  hacktivism. Worldwide, there is an evident in- crease in the number of malicious software be- ing distributed in different ways. The launching of  such software enables stealing of sensitive data,  monetary gains, loss of service and eventual de- struction of data and devices.  Hacktivism is the act of hacking or breaking into  a computer system, for political or social rea- sons.  Furthermore, internet penetration enables  adequate action by perpetrators of cyber terro- rism. Nowadays it is much easier to create terro- rist organisations, smaller organised groups, or   Threats and risks in cyberspace  Taking into consideration the ultimate goal  of cyber activities, threats can be classified  into two basic categories: • cyber attacks (attacks by other coun- tries, hacktivism, espionage and sabo- tage), cyber terrorism and cyber crime  (creation of terrorist organisations, attacks  by individuals or groups, organised crime),  cyberwarfare, • risks caused by human error or natural  phenomena.  Cyber attacks    10  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  hire individuals who, in the name of certain inte- rests, will have considerable power to inflict as  much damage as possible using modern Internet  technology. In this regard, numerous attacks on  critical information infrastructure of the countries  are being organised, which is developing into a  model of cyberwarfare.  The attack and/or destruction of critical informa- tion infrastructure achieves the goals of disrup- tion or complete outage of vital state or military  communications, resulting in certain consequen- ces for the civilian population. For example, an  attack on industrial control systems in the ener- gy supply system may result in a breakdown of  production and/or distribution of electricity for  the population, causing numerous problems.  Furthermore, the attack on information systems  in the healthcare sector can cause damage to  people’s health, through possible modification of  parameters on devices which the patients use to  communicate online with the system in the heal- thcare institution.  In addition to the above mentioned, it should be  noted that a great challenge is also the fact that  nowadays online instructions for organising cy- ber attacks using the “know-how to launch cyber  attacks” model are widely available.  Risks caused by natural disasters or human  error    In its “2014 Cyber Security Intelligence In- dex” research report, IBM’s presented a  highly intriguing piece of information saying  that 95% of all security incidents were cau- sed by the factor of human error.   Many successful attacks were carried out by  attackers using human weaknesses and various  forms of intimidation to turn employees into insi-  ders, who reluctantly allowed access to classified  information.  Contrary to that, there are constant risks that  are difficult to predict and the entire mankind  struggles with them; they are caused by natu- ral disasters, such as: earthquakes, floods, and  hurricanes. Great physical damage can also be  caused by fires, extremely high temperatures  and lightning strikes, which can also lead to data  loss.  Other significant challenges  Challenges relating to the home affairs of  a country are equally significant as the ri- sks and threats described above. More spe- cifically, they represent one of the important  prerequisites for adequate cyber protection.  A need for further investment of funds in the  strengthening of resources, expertise and con- tinuous progress in the field of proactive action  within the cyberspace of Montenegro was reco- gnised. In a large number of countries and in- ternational organisations, such as NATO and the  EU, cyber security is one of the top priorities,  and so this problem has also been defined in re- levant strategies and concepts of cyber security.  In addition to the above mentioned, the legal fra- mework limitations in this field are causing di- fficulties in procedure implementation. Namely,  the cyber attacks on a country to be labelled  as digital “armed attacks” remains a challenge.  For this reason, there is a lack of adequate in- ternational level cooperation, while the role of  international organisations is also very limited.  Inadequate communication and cooperati- on between the public and private sectors  largely results in the lack of trust of citizens in  institutions and companies doing business on- line. On the other hand, insufficient digital li-    11  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  teracy of end-users and failure to observe  best practices when using a communication  device is a separate challenge. The reason for  the above mentioned problem is insufficien- tly raised awareness among the population  about the problem of cyber security in general.  Finally, a great challenge for countries is a  small number of experts who would be able  to constantly participate in the cyber securi- ty domain and adequately implement reforms.   Following the best security practices, one of  the challenges is to clearly separate the fun-  ctions of administration and governance of  information systems from the security ma- nagement function of these systems. In cases  when human resources are limited, in some  institutions the functions of security and admi- nistration overlap. This fact directly causes a  decrease in the level of security of the system  because there is no second instance control  over administrators, but they themselves also  perform the security function of their institution.      03 Retrospect  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021    13  The Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro  2018-2021 is a continuation of the previous stra- tegy, whose life cycle ends at the end of 2017.   The starting point for the activities to be underta- ken in order to define and implement the Cyber  Security Strategy for Montenegro 2013-2017  was, in the legislative sense - the Law on Infor- mation Security (Official Gazette of Montenegro,  No 014/10), and in the institutional sense - Di- rectorate for Protection against Computer and  Security Incidents Online (CIRT), which operated  within the then Ministry of Information Society  and Telecommunications, and now belongs to  the newly established Ministry of Public Admini- stration of the 41st Government of Montenegro,  with the task of enabling early detection of cyber  threats and incidents and adequately reacting  and responding to them.   The first Cyber Security Strategy for Montene- gro was adopted in 2013 for the period until 2017  and contains seven key strategic objectives:  1. Defining institutional and organisational stru- cture in the field of cyber security in the country; 2. Protection of critical information infrastructure  in Montenegro; 3. Strengthening capacities of state law enforce- ment authorities; 4. Incident response; 5. Defining the role of the Ministry of Defence  and the Armed Forces of Montenegro in cyber- space; 6. Partnership of public and private sectors; 7. Raising public awareness and online protecti- on.  The implementation of the above strategic obje- ctives was defined in more detail in two action  plans for the implementation of the Strategy.  The insight into the status of their implementati- on shows the intensive activity of the responsible  authorities in fulfilling the set strategic objectives,  which resulted in the successful implementation  of a part of the activities identified in the action  plans.   The chapter continues to describe in detail the  activities undertaken in order to deliver the main  strategic objectives of the Cyber Security Stra- tegy for Montenegro 2013-2017, as well as the  activities not undertaken on a satisfactory level  which will be covered by the Cyber Security  Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021.  1. Defining institutional and organisatio- nal structure in the field of cyber securi- ty in the country  This strategic objective recognises the need to  have a clear organisational hierarchy within the   The Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021 is a continuation of the  previous strategy, whose life cycle ends at the end of 2017.    14  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  public administration, with defined responsibi- lities, which will ensure effective cyber security  governance in Montenegro. The following have  been identified as the institutions accountable for  cyber security in Montenegro:  • Ministry of Public Administration within which  the national CIRT operates; • National Security Agency; • Ministry of Defence / Army of Montenegro; • Ministry of Interior / Police Administration; • Ministry of Justice; • Ministry of Education; • Directorate for Protection of Confidential Data.  The accompanying two-year action plan for the  implementation of the Strategy envisages the  formation of the Information Security Council,  which was formed at the 29th Session of the Go- vernment on 08 June 2017.  Furthermore, the Cyber Security Strategy for  Montenegro 2013-2017 envisages the formation  of local CIRTs or appointment of contact persons  in all state authorities, aimed at strengthening  cyber infrastructure at the local level. A total of  31 local teams were created, in charge of coope- rating with members of the national CIRT on the  issues of protection against computer security  incidents on the Internet.  Degree of implementation:   It is evident that cyber security is becoming in- creasingly important in state authorities and that  the institutions have largely recognised their  role in cyberspace. Further activities aimed at  completing the list of local CIRTs and appointing  contact persons for cyber security issues will be  the subject of activities of the relevant instituti- ons through the Action Plan 2018-2019, which  will accompany the Cyber Security Strategy for  Montenegro 2018-2021.  2. Protection of critical information in- frastructure in Montenegro  In accordance with the task, the then Ministry of  Information Society and Telecommunications of  the 40th Government of Montenegro drafted the  Law on Amendments to the Law on Informati- on Security (Official Gazette of Montenegro No  040/16) defining critical information infrastructu- re (CII).  Critical information infrastructure consists of in- formation systems which, if compromised or  destroyed, would endanger the life, health, and  safety of citizens, as well as the functioning of the  country, while the performance of public interest  activities depends on their proper functioning.   Upon the proposal of the then Ministry of Infor- mation Society and Telecommunications, the  Government of Montenegro adopted the Met- hodology for selecting critical information in- frastructure. Based on the Methodology and in  cooperation with other relevant institutions, the  Ministry of Public Administration, which inheri- ted certain responsibilities of the former Ministry  of Information Society and Telecommunications,  has defined the list of critical information infra- structure in Montenegro, and the drafting of a  Decree on measures for protecting CII is under  way.  Degree of implementation:   The initial list of critical information infrastructu- re in Montenegro has been adopted, however, it  should be taken into consideration that the list is  to be regularly updated. After the adoption of the  Decree on measures for protecting CII, it is ne- cessary to implement it in cooperation with the  owners of the CII.     15  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  3. Strengthening capacities of state law  enforcement authorities  In the previous period, through legislation and  strategic documents, Montenegro has followed  the main standards, guidelines and recommen- dations of the EU and NATO regarding the cyber  security capacity building.  The information security legislation has been  harmonised with the EU acquis to a significant  extent. In addition, in 2016, the Law on Amen- dments to the Law on Information Security (Of- ficial Gazette of Montenegro, No 040/16) was  adopted, providing for two key activities: the  formation of the Information Security Council  and the protection of critical information infra- structure, which are in line with the NIS Directive  (2016/1148)8.  In order to strengthen the capacities of state law  enforcement authorities, a High-Tech Crime Gro- up has been set up at the Ministry of Interior,  and it belongs to the Section for Fighting against  Organised Crime and Corruption. The said Group  provides for three working positions for staff de- aling with the issue of high-tech crime (classical  acts of computer crime, child pornography, cre- dit card abuse, and copyright abuse).  As of June 2013, a group for testing information  technologies has been envisaged within the Fo- rensic Centre of the Police Administration in Da- nilovgrad. With regard to technical capacities, in  addition to computer testing tools, mobile phone  testing tools were also procured.  The National Security Agency is making signi- ficant efforts aimed at creating normative and  operational mechanisms for fighting against  cyber crime and espionage, which, along with  terrorism and organised crime, are becoming  the greatest security challenges of today. The  agency is working continuously and intensively   8 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  in order to strengthen cyber security organisati- onal and technical capacities.  In order to strengthen the resilience of informa- tion systems, the ICT Service at the Ministry of  Justice has carried out a series of activities in  line with the tasks set out in the Strategy, whi- ch greatly reduce the vulnerability of the existing  systems of the Ministry in cyberspace.  Degree of implementation:   Although the state authorities have recognised  the need to strengthen their cyber security and  cyber crime capacities in the previous period, it  is necessary to continuously invest in further im- provement of national cyber defence capacities.   4. Incident Response  The analysis of the incident reports in Montene- gro, which are drafted annually by CIRT, shows  an evident trend of growth in the number of re- ported incidents year after year, as well as an  increasing degree of sophistication of the attacks  themselves.  With the establishment of the national CIRT, a  major step has been taken towards increasing  the ability of state authorities to respond to cyber  incidents affecting Montenegro.  Degree of implementation:   CIRT has been recognised as a focal point for  responding to incidents in Montenegro, howe- ver, there is an evident lack of highly speciali- sed personnel for successfully responding to this  challenge. In addition to the above, in order to  respond to incidents, it is also necessary to im- plement tasks relating to the completion of the  list of local CIRTs, as well as to the trainings for     16  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  the narrow specialisation of employees from the  field of cyber security.  5. Defining the role of the Ministry  of Defence and the Armed Forces of  Montenegro in cyberspace  The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Armed  Forces of Montenegro (AFoM) are fully respon- sible for the cyberspace created within MoD and  AFoM and they cooperate with the national CIRT  in Montenegro’s cyberspace protection.  NATO targets (E 6202 N) have been adopted,  defining the capacities that MoD and AFoM sho- uld develop in the next 2 to 5 year period.  Degree of implementation:   MoD and AFoM have a clear vision of their role  in cyberspace. The role of MoD and AFoM will  be further strengthened through the additional  activities planned for the upcoming period.   6. Partnership of public and private  sectors  A large part of critical information infrastructu- re belongs to the private sector. Therefore it is  necessary to clearly define cooperation with the  private sector in the field of cyber security.   With regard to the private sector, seven CIRTs  were created within the companies Crnogorski  Telekom, Telenor, M:tel, Wireless Montenegro,  Telemach, M-kabl and Societe Generale Monte- negro Bank.  One of the best examples of cooperation with  the private sector is the activities undertaken   9 https://www.telenor.me/cg/o-telenoru/o-nama/drustvena-odgovornost/odgovorno-poslovanje/surfuj-pametno/;  http://www.cirt.me/O_Nama/prijavisadrzaj  to organise joint promotional campaigns on the  protection of children in cyberspace and the safe  use of the Internet.  Bearing in mind that CIRT recognised malware  as one of the biggest threats in Montenegrin cy- berspace, a pilot project was launched on 4 No- vember 2016, in cooperation with the Agency for  Electronic Communications and Postal Services  (EKIP) and Internet providers in Montenegro.   The project was aimed at identifying infected  computers as well as undertaking activities in  order to recover from the consequences.  The  above was done in cooperation with EKIP and  the Internet providers operating in Montenegro.  In November 2016, joint meetings were held on  this topic, and the test stage of the project was  carried out.  Degree of implementation:   Evident progress has been made in terms of  strengthening cooperation with the private se- ctor. Bearing in mind the significance of having  a partnership of public and private sectors, it has  been recognised as a priority by the Cyber Secu- rity Strategy for Montenegro 2018-2021.  7. Raising public awareness and online  protection  In line with the task from the Strategy, the Mi- nistry of Public Administration has actively wor- ked on educating citizens through the leading of  various promotional campaigns with a special  focus on the protection of children on the Inter- net9. Additionally, in 2017, the Ministry of Public  Administration decided to organise a special se- gment within INFOFEST dealing with the issue of  cyber security.    17  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  The Human Resources Administration also inclu- ded a training for civil servants and employees on  the topic of cyber security in its regular training  program, which is being carried out in cooperati- on with the Ministry of Public Administration. So  far, 350 civil servants and state employees have  completed the training.  In addition to this, a highly specialised training  was conducted for staff members working on cy- ber security tasks. Some of the most important  trainings were conducted in cooperation with  NATO: M6-108 Network Security Course and  M6-109 Network Vulnerability Assessment and   Risk Mitigation Course, attended by 30 civil ser- vants each.  Degree of implementation:   This strategic objective has been implemented to  a significant extent. However, given the speed  of the development of information technologies,  the increasing number of threats in the cyber  space, as well as the lack of highly specialised  personnel, this activity needs to be continuously  implemented.      04 National   organisational structure  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021    19  National cyber security structure of Montenegro    20  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  It is necessary to have a good organisational hierar- chy within the state administration, that will ensure  the most efficient and long-term sustainable provi- sion of adequate cyber security governance in Mon- tenegro.    In line with the task of providing early detection of  cyber threats and incidents and adequately reacting  and responding to them, the Directorate for Protecti- on against Computer and Security Incidents Online  (CIRT) was formed in 2012.   CIRT is the central body for the coordination of pre- vention and protection against computer security  incidents on the Internet and other security risks to  information systems for the territory of Montenegro.  In accordance with its responsibilities, CIRT acts:   • In a preventive manner - through education, ra-  ising awareness, providing useful information and  advice on internet security, and  • In a reactive manner - through analysis and con- ducting detailed investigations in case of online inci- dents at the national level.   In addition to this, CIRT carries out activities to esta- blish and promote partner relations both at the na- tional level (with relevant authorities, private sector  partners, and academic community), and the inter- national level, in order to respond to cyber threats in  a better and more efficient manner.  The analysis of the incident reports in Montenegro,  which are drafted annually by CIRT, records a trend  of growth in the number of reported incidents year  after year, as well as a degree of sophistication of the  attacks themselves.  In accordance with the Law on Amendments to  the Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of  Montenegro, No 40/2016)  the Information Security  Council was formed on August 1, 2017 (Official Ga- zette of Montenegro, No 48/2017), thus providing a  national parent organisation to advise the Govern- ment of Montenegro on all important issues in this  field.   The Council’s tasks are to:  - inform the Government of Montenegro on all im- portant issues related to cyber security; - monitor the implementation of the Cyber Security   Strategy for Montenegro and the action plans for its  implementation; - monitor and coordinate activities in the field of cy- ber security; - propose measures for harmonisation of the legisla- tive and administrative frameworks in order to im- prove the cyber security of Montenegro; - work to improve cooperation between state autho- rities and administrative bodies in the field of cyber  security and coordinate their activities; - work to improve cooperation with the private se- ctor in the field of cyber security; - submit its performance report to the Government of  Montenegro at least once a year.

The goal of this Directive is a comprehensive re- gulation of national cyber security of the Member  States. It consists of five chapters and, in order  to fulfil the obligations, the Member States, shall:  • adopt a national cyber security strategy; • define the relevant authorities in the field of cy- ber security; • have at least one Computer Emergency Res- ponse Team (CERT). These teams have to cover  relevant sectors and services. These teams must  also have adequate resources and tools in order  to fulfil their complex functions and tasks; • regulate the security of the information systems  of the owners of essential, critical services in the  technical and organisational manner stipulated  by the Directive; • regulate the security of the information systems  of the owners of digital services in the technical  and organisational manner stipulated by the Di- rective; • voluntarily use the recommended EU standar- ds.  The extent of the differences between the EU  member states regarding the protection of  network and information security can be conclu- ded from the directive itself:  „Existing capabilities are not sufficient to  ensure a high level of security of network  and information systems within the Union.  Member States have very different levels of  preparedness, which has led to fragmented  approaches across the Union. This results in  an unequal level of protection of consumers  and businesses, and undermines the overall  level of security of network and information  systems within the Union.“  „National strategy on the security of  network and information systems’ means  a framework providing strategic objectives  and priorities on the security of network and  information systems at national level.“  Pursuant to Article 7 of the NIS Directive, each  Member State shall adopt a national strategy on  the security of network and information systems  by 9 May 2018, which may be considered as  equivalent to the National Cyber Security Stra-  The development of a national concept for cyber security should now be directed  through two newly formed important factors, from the adoption and implementa- tion of the first national cyber security strategy - accession to the NATO alliance  and the opening of the negotiation Chapter 10 - Information Society.    24  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  tegy, and six months after that Member States  must complete the identification of operators of  essential services. The Commission adopted an  Annex on the effective application of the NIS Di- rective COM (2017) 476 of 4 October 2017. Furt- hermore, the Commission presented a proposal  for the ENISA reform, which includes its per- manent mandate as a reference point in the EU  cyber system, and that is will ensure the imple- mentation of the NIS Directive and the proposed  Information and Communication Technology cy- ber security certification Framework COM (2017)  477 of 4 October 2017. For some companies that  hold critical sectors, the EU’s General Data Pro- tection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016  is very important, and it will be in application as  of May 2018. Companies will have to take care  of the data processing of the entities from the  EU due to severe penalties for non-compliance,  therefore they are obliged to start adapting their  business to the new requirements of the Regula- tion that deal with information risks, ICT security,  rapid reaction to discovering threats and data  breach, recovery of information and continuity of  successful business.  Although the NIS Directive is not binding for  Montenegro, the implementation of its recom- mendations would contribute to the development  of a modern, efficient and European compatible  national cyber security concept.   And while there could be room for discussion  about the application of ENISA recommendati- ons, when it comes to the NATO alliance, there  is no dilemma for Montenegro as its full member.  At the Warsaw Summit of 2016, NATO declared  the cyber domain the fourth operational domain,  making the effects and consequences in cyber- space equal to that within the remaining three  domains: water, air and land. Additionally, in July  2016, the heads and presidents of the govern- ments of the NATO Member States committed  themselves to treating cyberspace in strategic  10 Globalni sajber bezbjednosni indeks za 2017. Link: https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/str/D-STR-GCI.01-2017-PDF-E.pdf  sense the same as the remaining three opera- tional domains in their so-called “cyber pledge”.  Among other things, Member States pledged to:  • strengthen and enhance the cyber defences  of national networks and infrastructures, as a  matter of priority; • allocate adequate resources nationally to  strengthen their cyber defence capabilities; • reinforce the interaction amongst their res- pective national cyber defence stakeholders to  deepen co-operation and the exchange of best  practices; • enhance skills and awareness, among all defen- ce stakeholders at national level, of fundamental  cyber hygiene through to the most sophisticated  and robust cyber defences; • foster cyber education, training and exercising  of their forces, and enhance their educational  institutions, to build trust and knowledge across  the Alliance.  The Government of Montenegro will continue to  undertake activities towards the implementation  of the strategic objectives defined in the Strategy  so as to ensure further improvement of the con- cept of cyber security of Montenegro in order to  be compatible with the concepts of the most de- veloped EU and NATO Member States.   Special attention will be paid to harmonisation  with regard to the standardisation of concepts,  methods, policies and procedures in line with the  accepted European and international standards.   1. Cyber defence capacities   According to the Global Cybersecurity Index10,  drafted in 2017 by the International Telecommu- nication Union, Montenegro ranks 71st in the  field of cyber security with a coefficient of 0.422,     25  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  out of 193 countries covered by this research.  Compared to the region, Montenegro ranks hig- her than Albania (89), Serbia (90), Bosnia and  Herzegovina (136), and Slovenia (84), while Cro- atia (41) and Macedonia (55) rank higher than  Montenegro.  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  The Government of Montenegro will conti- nue its dedicated work on the further stren- gthening of the cyber security capacities in  the sense of providing adequate human and  financial resources as well as meeting other  needs necessary for efficient and agile cyber  capacities of Montenegrin institutions aimed  at ensuring safe cyber space, providing busi- ness incentives and ultimately contributing to  the economic prosperity of Montenegro.   PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) Relevant institutions in the field of cyber secu- rity will establish CIRTs or identify staff members  whose basic tasks will be related to the activities  from the cyber security domain - so-called local  CIRTs.   Indicator of success: the percentage-wise  increase of the current number of CIRTs com- pared to the number of established teams and  the number of institutions that should have  CIRTs.  b) Relevant institutions must have capacities  to recognise, identify and conduct annual risk  analysis, or if necessary, risk analysis for a shor- ter period of time, which will be related to infor- mation systems within their own institutions or  within their scope of work.   Indicator of success: the number of condu- cted risk analyses compared to the number of  institutions.  11 More information via link: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-setting-up-guide  c) Budgetary funds must be allocated every year  to separate bodies or organisational units within  institutions that have been identified as key for  Montenegrin cyber security system so that they  can procure adequate resources and tools for  the effective functioning.   Indicator of success: the number of instituti- ons which have budgetary funds intended for  cyber security and the number of institutions  that have a trend of increasing the annual  budget for these needs.  d) Relevant bodies must define an optimal num- ber of staff members in their CIRT, i.e. the num- ber of employees who will be in charge of cyber  security, with the aim of providing an adequate  response to threats, challenges, risk analysis and  possible attacks to their information systems.  The previously said must be done at the annu- al level in order to obtain the current number of  employees and also the necessary number of  employees at the national level. ENISA11 recom- mends that CIRT should have a minimum of 12  staff members for a fully staffed 24/7 shift.   Indicator of success: a report on the minimal  number of staff members in charge of cyber  security.   2. Centralisation of cyber expertise and  resources  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:   The Government of Montenegro will underta- ke activities with a view to centralising and gat- hering expertise in the field of cyber security in  order to: strengthen capacities for the purpose  of responding efficiently to sophisticated cyber  threats against critical information structures  and other important information systems; un- derstand risks to cyberspace of Montenegro;     26  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  provide adequate recommendations and im- prove cooperation with the private and public  sectors.   With regard to cyber capacities and defence, the  leading states have started establishing cyber  security and incident response independent insti- tutions, which has proven to be a necessary and  very efficient step. Thus, the United Kingdom of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland established the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2015,  gathering several institutions, including the natio- nal Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT). In  2012, the Republic of Croatia established the In- formation Systems Security Bureau (ISSB) which  also serves the function of a National CIRT, while  Australia, apart from the Cyber Security Centre,  representing a major cyber security capability, has  also the Joint Cyber Security Centre, which brin- gs together business, government and academia,  and represents innovative and efficient approach  to cyber security in the sense of better sharing  of information and trust among different actors,  strengthening of cooperation and pooling forces, in  order to provide a unique response to cyber thre- ats, attacks and challenges.     PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) In line with the Strategy for the Development   of Information Society 2020 , the National CIRT  will have ten staff members by 2018, and 20 staff  members by 2020.   Indicator of success: the fulfilment of set dead- lines and the number of employees in the Nati- onal CIRT.  b) National CIRT will have two departments - for  incident response, of technical character, and for  strategic goals, politics and preventive.   Indicator of success: amendments to the Ru- lebook on the Internal Organisation and Syste- matisation of working positions of the Ministry  of Public Administration.  c) Two specialised rooms will be provided for ope- rations of the National CIRT, where experts from  other institutions will be allowed to work in the  event of attacks against CII and large scale attacks  against Montenegro.   Indicator of success: the number of rooms  meeting a minimum of technical standards  compared to the number of envisaged ones.  d) National CIRT will regularly organise specialist  exercises, simulation of attacks against CII and lar- ge scale attacks, for members of relevant bodies,  as well as companies accountable for CII.   Indicator of success: the number of organised   exercises and actors included.  3.

A detailed analysis of information systems of the  responsible authorities was drafted within the  first stage.   A detailed analysis of information systems of the  state authorities was drafted within the second  stage.   Within the third stage, a questionnaire was sent  to the private sector, on the basis of which the  analysis of their information systems was acqui- red, thereby analyses of information systems of  all critical sectors have been completed.   On the basis of the said analysis, and the analysis  of criticality, a proposal list of critical information  systems was adopted, after which the Govern- ment of Montenegro tasked the Ministry of Pu- blic Administration to adopt a final list of CII, and  subsequently the define protection measures.  The European Union identifies two main met- hods for protecting CII: The first one, where the  overall process is governed by the state, applied  by Montenegro, and the second one, where the  main function belongs to operators/owners of  CII.   Eight critical sectors have been identified in  Montenegro which include one or more CIIs: Se- curity control of CII within a sector belongs to line  ministries or other state authorities that have the  legal basis and obligation for securing and regu- lating these sectors. National CIRT is a central   point for coordination of activities, development  of cooperation and other activities related to this  field.   Case study  In February 2017, a number of services belonging  to the state authorities were under intensive and  continuous DDoS attack, lasting for two weeks.   The analysis showed that the attack originated  from a wide range of IP addresses spread all over  the world, and represented a network of so-called  zombies - compromised computers characteristic  of this kind of attacks, and during this period of  time, several state services were under a conti- nuous cyber attack.   The said incident influenced on raising awarene- ss of the consequences that can be caused by an  attack in cyberspace. Simultaneously, the state  authorities dealing with the defence had an oppor- tunity to test their capacities and to develop faster  and more efficient cooperation with partners from  private sector with the aim of more efficient defen- ce from this type of attacks.  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  The Government of Montenegro will continue  to strengthen the CII defence capabilities, and  since the National CIRT has a key role in this  field - it must have adequate resources and  tools to effectively understand, analyse and  respond to the wide spectrum of threats in this  field.   The resources of state authorities in charge of  safety control of CII must be adequate to the  task, i.e. the state authorities must have staff  members who understand threats and risks  for specific CII belonging to their sector. Hu- man and technical resources must be strengt- hened with the aim of efficient performance of  this function.     28  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  With the aim of efficient defence, it is necessary  to identify and essentially understand risks rela- ted to CII, namely related to the fields of action,  different information platforms, systems, functi- ons and technologies that CII is made up from,  which is a complex task and a challenge. Bea- ring in mind that a large part of CII belongs to a  private sector, the Government of Montenegro  will provide support in identifying risks for critical  systems, and, when necessary, establish addi- tional protection measures aimed at protecting  national resources.   The Government of Montenegro will also conti- nue to improve the legislative framework, stan- dards and obligations that the owners of CII must  comply with, due to harmonisation with the EU  Network Information Security Directive of Eu- ropean Parliament and of the Council.   PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) Owners of identified CII are required to condu- ct annual risk analysis. National CIRT, in coope- ration with other responsible CIRTs, is in charge  of reviewing the analyses, and providing assi- stance in making analyses where CII owners do  not have sufficient capacities.   Indicator of success: the number of condu- cted analyses compared to the number of  CIIs, as well as their quality.  b) Adoption of secondary legislation for prote- cting CII. This regulation should define the proce- dures for communication between owners of CII  and responsible institutions, as well as basic te- chnical and organisational measures that owners  of CII have to implement.   Indicator of success: an adopted Decree on  measures for protecting CII.   c) National CIRT, in cooperation with other CIRTs,  should establish and formalise strategic partner- ships with owners of CII, where, among other   things, exchange of information should be speci- fied, as well as the manners of exchanging infor- mation and expertise.   Indicator of success: the number of formali- sed partnerships with holders of CII.  4.Inter-institutional cooperation  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  The need for strengthening inter-institutional  cooperation has been identified, whereby a  special accent will be placed on efficient and  timely exchange of information and best pra- ctices. In this context, the responsible instituti- ons will work on strengthening communication  methods through, among other things, orga- nisation of exercises for crisis communication  in the case of cyber incidents and large scale  attacks. The exercises will be aimed at defi- ning clear communication procedures in crisis  situations as well as their timely revision.    PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) In order to further facilitate cooperation and  communication among institutions, there is a  need for appointing contact persons for cyber  security on behalf of all actors involved.   Indicator of success: the number of appoin- ted contact persons compared to the number  of institutions.  b) Establishment of a publicly available registry  of cyber experts which would be managed by  the ministry responsible for this field.   Indicator of success: the functioning of regi- stries of cyber experts.  c) Development of a platform for dialogue and  exchange of information which would connect     29  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  cyber security experts from public and private  sectors, both at local and national level.   Indicator of success: an operational platform.  d) Setting up of an inter-ministerial working gro- up at technical level which would gather cyber  security experts and create capacity to defend  against cyber attacks.   Indicator of success: the formed inter-mini- sterial working group.  e) Inter-ministerial working group will organise  simulations and exercises aimed at efficiency,  coordination and communication.  Indicator of success: the number of orga- nised exercises at annual level, duration of  exercises as well as the number of covered  situations.   f) Drafting of a rulebook and procedures for ex- change of information on cyber incidents, the  manner of communication in the event of cyber  attacks, and the manner of assistance and co- operation among state authorities.   Indikcator of success: a defined rulebook  and procedures on the exchange of informa- tion on cyber incidents and communication  among bodies.   5. Data protection  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:   For the purpose of providing an adequate pro- tection of the important part of information in- frastructure, the Government of Montenegro  will strengthen the national capacities nece- ssary for security accreditation of communi- cation and information systems and the pro- cesses where classified information is used,  as well as the capacities in the field of crypto  protection.   12 Law on Data Confidentiality (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 14/13 of 15 March 2013) and the Decree on detailed conditions and manner of implementing  measures of classified information protection (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No 57/10 of 1 October 2010)  The Law on Data Confidentiality acknowledges  the principle of marking information with a cer- tain level of classification and the way of dealing  with these data, from those marked with the  lowest level of classification whose disclosure  would make harmful consequences for functio- ning of the body, to those with the highest level  of classification whose disclosure would endan- ger or cause irreparable harmful consequences  for security and interests of Montenegro. As a  result of computerisation of business proces- ses, these data are created, processed and kept  electronically, and due to the need for efficient  exchange of information, they are all the more  transferred through cyberspace. With a view to  providing adequate protection and raising the  level of culture of handling classified and sensi- tive information electronically, it is necessary to  strengthen the national capacities needed for the  implementation of the legally prescribed security  accreditation of communication and information  systems and processes where classified data  are marked as CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET,  and also provide a proper management system  for security of information in the systems where  data marked as INTERNAL are used12, as well as  in the systems where unclassified sensitive data  are handled. Also, it is necessary to plan national  capacities in the long run with the aim of develo- ping domestic cryptographic solutions.      PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) In March 2017, a set of legal regulations was  adopted necessary for implementing certificati- on of communication and information systems  and processes where secret data of higher cla- ssification are used. It has been recognised that  there is a room for improvement of this set of  regulations, particularly in the part of certification  of “standalone” machines and inter-connection     30  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  of communication and information systems.   Indicator of success: the drafting of relevant  legal acts and supporting documents by the  inter-ministerial working group.  b) Strengthening of information capacities of the  state authority in charge of security accreditation  of communication and information systems and  processes where classified information is used  (Security Accreditation Authority - SAA), and the  state authority responsible for handling materials  for cryptographic protection of secret data (Nati- onal Distribution Authority - NDA).   Indicator of success: the number of newly  employed IT specialists in the Directorate for  Protection of Confidential Data which will deal  with accreditation of communication and in- formation systems and with management of  crypto materials.  c) Strengthening of the institutional capacities  necessary for carrying out certification of com- munication and information systems and their  inter-connections through the introduction of a  systematised function that includes a job des- cription for information security of classified in- formation in state institutions where classified  information is mostly handled electronically (for  higher levels of classification a separate working  position is provided, while for the lowest level of  classification it is possible to add a job description  to the existing working position).   Indicator of success: the number of systemi- sed working positions with a job description  related to information security of classified  data.  d) Certification of communication and informati- on systems where information marked with hig- her level of classification is used, the introduction  of security information management system and  risk management in communication and infor- mation systems where classified data marked as  INTERNAL are used (ISO/IEC 27000 certification  with additional security measures) and unclassi-  fied sensitive information (ISO/IEC 27001).   Indicator of success: the number of certified  communication and information systems and  the number of conducted internal reviews  aimed at controlling the implementation of  standards.  e) Establishing cooperation with educational and  scientific institutions with the aim of long-term  education and training of personnel, for the needs  of creating national cryptographic solutions.   Indicator of success: the degree of establis- hed cooperation and the number of educati- onal or scientific projects resulting from that.  6. Cyber security education  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  In order to achieve the best cyber security pra- ctice, the responsible bodies will learn about  the newest cyber threats and undertake acti- vities on educating citizens and organisations  about protection mechanisms in cyberspa- ce. Sustainable, continuous and coordinated  efforts are necessary to achieve wider chan- ges in behaviour and secure that all target  groups, public and private sectors, as well as  individual citizens, understand risks and thre- ats in cyberspace.  Raising awareness of threats in cyberspace and  their influence on the overall society is of vital im- portance. Through raising awareness, individual  and corporative users may learn how to behave  and feel secure and ready to do business online.  Education of employees and citizens through pu- blishing of various security tips, instructions and  warnings is based on current trends in techno- logy and distribution of relevant knowledge of  regional and international experts. An important     31  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  segment in spreading awareness is also impro- ving contents on the portal with materials, whi- ch are continuously updated in accordance with  new technologies related to information security  (guidelines, rulebook, presentations, webinars,  lectures).  Focus on different target groups is a result of  successful and efficient campaigns of raising  awareness of security challenges. Continuous  following and evaluation of campaigns serve for  identifying new emerging needs and for adapting  the campaign processes. Sustainable human  and financial resources and continuous monito- ring can contribute to increasing flexibility and  adaptability of the campaigns.  PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) In order to promote and spread the cyber se- curity culture, it is necessary to progressively  continue with participation in and organisation  of conferences, workshops, trainings, as well as  with production of publications, drafting of pa- pers and articles, and participation in educational  programmes.   Indicator of success: the number of held con- ferences/workshops/trainings and the num- ber of appearing in educational programmes.   b. Given that constant education, following of  trends and awareness raising are of major im- portance for cyber security, it is necessary to  constantly improve the contents on the portal  CIRT.ME, with materials related to security, whi- ch are continuously updated in accordance with  the new technologies (tips, warnings, announce- ments, guidelines, rulebooks, presentations, we- binars, lectures).   Indicator of success: an amount of published  contents on the portal CIRT.ME and an amo- unt of updated materials.    c) It is necessary to educate teaching staff in or-  der to raise their awareness of cyber security  because they spend the most of the time dire- ctly working with children, so they are able to in- fluence on raising awareness of this topic among  children.   Indicator of success: the number of teachers  trained according to the previously establis- hed training programme.  d) A special target group that has been recogni- sed are school pedagogues and psychologists.  The majority of problems in school are resolved  in pedagogical and psychological service, there- fore their knowledge and understanding of this  topic is of great importance for helping children.  Previously, it is necessary to determine whether  all school pedagogues are digitally literate, and if  not, it is necessary to teach them basic computer  skills, and afterwards, carry out trainings related  to cyber security.   Indicator of success: the number of trained  pedagogues and psychologists according to  the previously established training agenda.  e) Regular subject Informatics with Technique  which is learnt from the fifth grade of primary  school, comprising a certain number of lessons,  is not sufficient when it comes to the topic of cy- ber security, therefore it is necessary to organise  extra-curriculum activities for school-age chil- dren on these topics, especially for children of  very young age.  Indicator of success: the number of held  workshops, competitions, debates, and so on,  as well as the number of children included in  these activities.  f) It is necessary to develop a set of materials  on various topics of cyber security which will be  adjusted to various ages of children. Materials  should be published on the school portal (www. skolskiportal.edu.me) in the category Online Se- curity of Children.   Indicator of success: the number of created     32  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  materials (photos, videos, rulebooks, guideli- nes, recommendations, games, etc.).  7. Partnership of public and private  sectors  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:   In the upcoming period, the Government of  Montenegro will continue its dedicated work  aimed at supporting the both - response to  incidents and sharing of information and joint  initiatives in partnership with private sector.  Therefore, only high level of communication,  cooperation and integration can be an efficient  way to understand and properly respond to  the needs and challenges of private compa- nies, with the aim of undertaking the nece- ssary measures and achieving a sufficient de- gree of security.  Improving of cyber security demands a combi- ned, multi-user, comprehensive approach focu- sed on cooperation with private companies. The  cooperation provides, through joint research and  exchange of experiences and practice, that no  part of the critical infrastructure, whether in pu- blic or private hands, become a weak link and  vulnerability.   Partnership of public and private sectors is an  efficient tool in protecting national interests. Sha- ring of information, expertise and knowledge is  a form of strategic partnership between share- holders from public and private sectors. In ac- cordance with the Law on Amendments to the  Law on Information Security, the Information Se- curity Council has been formed, representing a  framework for constant exchange of information  among public administration, representatives of   the economy, science and research. The Infor- mation Security Council should provide proce- dures for exchanging information between state  authorities and key private sector institutions,  particularly the Internet provider, the banking  sector and the Electric Power Industry of Mon- tenegro (EPCG). Building of a successful public  and private sectors partnership takes into con- sideration different elements as well as challen- ges and barriers that such structures can face.  Establishing of efficient cooperation among sta- keholders is one of the main challenges due to  different interests, trust, competition and lack of  clear managerial structure.   Companies reluctantly report security incidents  due to potential loss of reputation, so building  of trust is a process that requires an extensive  dialogue, time and effort. Partnerships demand  a clear framework which determines roles of pu- blic and private sectors, their relations and areas  of cooperation.  PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) With the aim of developing efficient respon- se to cyber security, it is necessary to work on  improving and institutionalisation of cooperation  among public and private sectors.   Indicator of success: the number of establis- hed public and private partnerships.  b) Drafting of procedures for exchange of infor- mation on cyber incidents, the ways of commu- nicating in the case of cyber attacks, the ways of  assistance and cooperation between public and  private sectors.   Indicator of success: a defined rulebook on  procedure for exchange of information on  cyber incidents and communication between   public and private sectors.     33  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  8. Regional and international cooperati- on  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  The Government of Montenegro will continue  with its regional and international activities  and exercise its influence by investing in par- tnerships which shape global evolution of cy- berspace in the manner which improves and  spreads economic and security interests and  strengthens collective security.  Considering the global nature of the Internet and,  consequently, the problems of cyber security, re- gional and international cooperation is necessary  for securing the cyberspace of Montenegro.   Due to an increasing number of security inci- dents, the existing capabilities of Computer In- cident Response Team (CIRT) are no longer  sufficient. In order to provide a proper response  and protect national interests, cooperation and  activities with regional and international partners  should continue.   It is necessary to further strengthen relations  with bilateral and multilateral partners, including  the EU, NATO, OSCE and UN, particularly throu- gh collective defence and collective security.   Such cooperation facilitates positive exchange of   experiences, knowledge and best practices, all of  which contribute to the strengthening of national  security. Therefore, Montenegro will continue to  promote the participation of its representatives  in international organisations, as well as in pro- fessional exercises and associations in this field.   PLAN OF ACTION AND INDICATORS:  a) As the exchange of regional and internatio- nal experiences and best practices contributes  to the strengthening and development of cyber  security, the active participation should continue  through joint exercises, trainings, meetings, fora,  conferences, seminars.  Indicator of success: the number of held  trainings, conferences, seminars, exercises,  meetings, and it will be of qualitative chara- cter.  b) With a view to strengthening cooperation with  key international institutions in the field of cyber  security, it is necessary to continue cooperating  with organisations that we belong to (FIRST, ITU,  NATO), and work on establishing and promoting  new partnerships.   Indicator of success: the number of establi- shed partnerships, signed agreements and  memoranda.      06 Monitoring  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021    35  For the purpose of providing an adequate im- plementation of the Cyber Security Strategy for  Montenegro 2018-2021 and accompanying acti- on plans, pursuant to Art. 13 para.1 of the Law  on Information Security (Official Gazette of MNE,  No 14/10 and 40/16), the Government of Mon- tenegro adopted a Decision on forming the In- formation Security Council with the task, among  others, to monitor the implementation of the  Strategy and the action plans.   The bodies identified as accountable for activities  defined by the Strategy and accompanying acti- on plans are obliged to submit quarterly reports  on the implementation thereof to the Information  Security Council.  On the basis of the delivered reports, the Council  will analyse the achieved results and, in accor- dance with its powers, give opinions and recom- mendations if the degree of the implementation  does not follow the established dynamics.   The Council will submit annual performance re- ports to the Government, which will address the  degree of fulfilment of strategic goals defined by  the Strategy and activities from the Action Plan,  and it will also contain proposal measures for  further improvement of Montenegro’s cyber se- curity.      07 Concluding review  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021    37  Functioning of every individual in the modern era  cannot be imagined without the use of informa- tion and communication technologies. Develop- ment of technologies stimulates the economic  and social development of a state, ensuring its  competiveness and positioning in the region  and Europe. Therefore, Montenegro cannot and  must not be an exception.   Taking into consideration the previously said,  and the fact that a number of threats in cybers- pace is constantly growing, simultaneously with  further development of information society, it is  necessary to constantly work on improving cy- ber security.  The Government of Montenegro is devoted to  growth and prosperity through strong cyber se- curity.   In the past period, on the basis of Art. 13a of the  Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of  MNE, No 14/10 and 40/16), the Government of  Montenegro adopted the Decision on forming  the Council on Information Security. The Council  will, inter alia, monitor the implementation of the  Cyber Security Strategy, by delivering quarterly  reports submitted by the bodies identified as the  main holders of activities defined by the Strategy  the accompanying action plans. In this manner,  analyses will be conducted, and opinions and re- commendations will be provided, in accordance  with respective responsibilities of bodies, while   annually a performance report will be delivered  to the Government of Montenegro.   When it comes to critical information structure  of Montenegro, on the basis of the Cyber Se- curity Strategy 2013-2017, amendments to the  Law on Information Security (Official Gazette of  MNE, No 40/16) were adopted, where critical in- formation structure has been defined, and on the  basis of that - eight critical sectors identified. The  process of protecting CII is governed by the state  of Montenegro, and this model of governance is  one of the two management models in the Eu- ropean Union. National CIRT is a central point  for coordination of activities, development of co- operation and other activities related to this field.   In the period to come, the Government of Monte- negro will continue to strengthen cyber defence  of CII, by providing adequate resources and tools  for understanding, analysing and responding to  threats by national CIRT and other state autho- rities in charge of controlling the security of CII.  This Strategy identifies a total of eight objectives  for improving the National Cyber Strategy for  Montenegro 2018-2021, namely:  1. reliance on European and Euro-Atlantic con- cepts,  2. strengthening the cyber defence capacities,  3. centralisation of cyber expertise and resour- ces,  Security of Montenegrin cyberspace is of major importance for the overall security  of the state and its citizens. Greater engagement of the representatives from the  public, private, academic and civil sector in the upcoming period will contribute to  providing cyber security.    38  CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  4. strengthening of inter-institutional cooperati- on, 5. data protection, 6. cyber security education,  7. strengthening partnership between public and  private sectors,  8. strengthening regional and international co- operation.  Through clearly defined strategic aims, Mon- tenegro will develop fully compatible concept  with concepts of the most developed EU and  NATO member states. Such concept will crea- te a pre-condition for a more secure information  society and provide successful implementation  of the Cyber Security Strategy and existing legal  regulations dealing with this field.   With the aim of strengthening cyber security  capacities, the Government of Montenegro will  continue to pay a great attention to providing ad- ditional human and financial resources and other  needs of institutions which work actively on se- curity of Montenegro’s cyberspace.   Activities aimed at attracting a wider pool of cy- ber expertise and resources will ensure stren- gthening of capacities for responding to threats  against critical information infrastructure and ot- her systems of state importance, understanding  of risks for Montenegro’s cyberspace, provision  of adequate recommendations and encourage- ment of cooperation between public and private  sectors.   Also, Montenegro will strengthen national ca- pacities necessary for security accreditation of  communications and information systems and  processes where classified information is used,  as well as the capacities in the field of crypto- graphic protection of data.   The responsible institutions will actively work  on strengthening inter-institutional cooperation,  through efficient and timely exchange of infor- mation and best practices, organisation of exer-  cises and simulation of large scale attacks. In this  way, clear procedures for communication in cri- sis situations will be defined and the shortcomin- gs identified, to be eliminated in a timely manner.  Regional and international cooperation is an im- portant segment in providing national cyber se- curity, so Montenegro will continue with regional  and international activities and invest in partner- ships, with the aim of improving and spreading  economic and security interests, as well as im- proving collective security.   The Government of Montenegro will undertake  further steps with the aim of raising awareness  of the problem of cyber security of both - insti- tutions and organisations, and citizens as well.  Raising awareness through providing informati- on on what should be done to protect oneself on  the Internet will result in the overall change of  behaviour and ensure that everybody is aware  of protection at home, in school and at work.   In the period to come, the work on strengthening  public and private partnerships will be continued  with the intention of information sharing, launc- hing of joint initiatives and response to incidents.  Public-private partnership is the efficient way to  understand and properly respond to the needs  and challenges of private companies, with the  aim of undertaking the necessary measures and  achieving a sufficient degree of security.   Finally, safe cyberspace encourages favourable  environment for further development and pro- gress, to the satisfaction of all citizens.        CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF MONTENEGRO 2018-2021  Annex Definitions and terms    41  Active Cyber Defence  The principle of implementing security measures  to strengthen the security of a network or sys- tem to make it more robust against attack.

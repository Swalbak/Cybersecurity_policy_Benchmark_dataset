It is needless to point out the many twists and turns the Czech Republic and the whole world went through that year. Yet I would still like to mention what the global pandemic has meant for cyber security. Last year showed us all that the limits of what can be moved to cyberspace are far beyond what we previously imagined. Moreover, the transition has revealed how much we depend on information and communication technologies. IT and cyber security experts have been drawing atten­ tion to this dependency for many years. It was not until last year, though, as the Internet became the only place where many people could work, close deals, hold talks, and keep in touch with loved ones, that we realised how overwhelming this reliance truly was. Let us see this situation as an opportunity. The virus has helped us do what we had not been able to do ourselves: it persuaded the majority of society that cyber security, and the principles of proper conduct in cyberspace per se, are of concern to all of us. The following texts and statistics indicate that cyberspace is not a safe place. No one can be unaware of the ran­ somware attacks that paralysed, among others, the Uni­ versity Hospital Brno during the onset of the pandemic, causing hundreds of millions of crowns of damage. Our statistics also show that the number of attacks has been growing, and more and more institutions – take local authorities as an example – have been falling victim to such attacks. The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (hereinafter the ‘NÚKIB’) worked to give all possible assistance to the affected entities and protect others the attacks could also impact. Let me mention, inter alia, a reactive measure for selected healthcare entities fol­ lowed by a warning issued for the same group of recipi­ ents. We also prepared many supporting materials that anyone may use free of charge to secure their systems. We drafted changes in legislation, effective since Jan­ uary this year, especially for the healthcare sector. As a consequence, significantly more hospitals must meet considerably stricter security requirements. At the same time, they have the opportunity to use broader services ranging from vulnerability scanning to penetration testing and other activities we offer regulated entities free of charge. Furthermore, we have introduced several training courses for both the public and employees of essen­ tial institutions. People are the weakest link in cyber security, and they need to be aware of the risks looming in cyberspace. Other unequivocal successes include the approval of two documents critical for developing the cyber security of the Czech Republic and the NÚKIB itself. Had it not been for them and the related collaboration, this 2020 Report on Cyber Security would not have seen the light of day. Nor, most importantly, could cyber security in the Czech Republic have been assured. The first document is the National Cyber Security Strat­ egy, which establishes the direction of activities for the agency and all subjects involved in cyber security assur­ ance in the Czech Republic for the following five years. The other crucial document is the NÚKIB Development Concept, which sets out how the institution will de­ velop going forward, the capacities we would like to have in the future and, last but not least, how much it will all cost. I am very pleased that the work on this document has been completed. The NÚKIB is still a new institution, and so a clear definition of its future development is vital. Regarding the international scene, I would like to em­ phasise the 2nd Prague 5G Security Conference held under the auspices of the Czech Prime Minister and attended by many important foreign guests. The developments last year showed us how dangerous cyberspace can be yet how important it is to all of us. I would like to thank all the 222 entities in various fields that filled in our questionnaires and thereby partici­ pated in preparing this 2020 Report on Cyber Security. I firmly believe that the Report will raise cyber security awareness and improve safety for everybody. Ing. Karel Řehka FOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NÚKIB 3Summary of the 2020 Report on Cyber Security The year 2020 was marked by an increase in cyber- attacks against Czech institutions, organisations, and companies across all sectors. Compared to 217 inci­ dents in 2019, a total of 468 incidents were reported to the NÚKIB in 2020. Nearly one­third of the incidents handled were reported by non­regulated entities. This increase was very likely caused by both a higher number of cyberattacks and greater awareness of the existence and activities of the NÚKIB. The severity of the incidents has also increased, which is evident from the attacks against the University Hospital Brno and the Psychiatric Hospital in Kosmonosy. The most frequent types of at­ tack in 2020 included spam, phishing, and scanning. The most serious cyber threats in the Czech Republic  have long included cybercrime. In 2020, this was most visible with ransomware attacks affecting the Czech  healthcare sector. The increase in attacks against hos­ pitals can largely be attributed to the ongoing pandemic as well as cybercrime groups concentrating on specific institutions where they see a higher chance that the ransom will be paid. Yet three­quarters of healthcare facilities consider the funds allocated to ensuring cyber security insufficient. In 2020, the NÚKIB, in cooperation with the Office of  the Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  organised the second two-day Prague 5G Security  Conference, the world’s premier forum for discussion of the risks associated with the building of 5G infra­ structure. As last year, the conference was held under the auspices of Andrej Babiš, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. Despite the fact that the conference was virtual for the first time due to the COVID­19 situ­ ation, more than 50 speakers from Europe, the USA, South Korea, Israel, Australia, India, and other countries spoke at it. The main outcome of this second confer­ ence was the presentation and launching of the so­ called Prague 5G Security Repository, a virtual library intended for sharing legislative, strategic, and other 5G network security tools the countries adopted over the past year. In 2020, the NÚKIB continued the training of public  administration staff and trained more than 18‚209  civil servants, 214 employees of the Armed Forces of  the Czech Republic, and 2‚000 employees of Bulovka  Hospital  in the ‘Dávej kyber!’ [Get Cyber Skilled!] e­learning course. Another 1,690 prevention officers were trained in the professional ‘Bezpečně v kyber’ [Stay Safe in Cyberspace] course, which presents school envi­ ronment situations to staff. Many organisations questioned through the survey  said they faced a  lack of experts and  insufficient  cyber security budgets  in 2020. The situation was more pronounced in the public sector than in private undertakings. Almost none of the respondents had all cyber security posts occupied. More than half the organisations considered insufficient salaries to be the main factor. In response to events during the pandemic, the NÚKIB  issued several recommendations, warnings, and re- active measures. These included, for example, warn­ ings about the risks associated with online conference services, Safe Remote Working recommendations, the Secure Videoconferencing manual, and the Minimum  Safety Standard document for securing smaller organ­ isations prepared in cooperation with NAKIT. Despite the pandemic measures, Cyber Coalition – the  international cyber defence exercise organised by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation – took place  in 2020, for the first time in virtual form. The Czech Republic thus again contributed as much as possible to one of the largest international cyber defence exercises.

The questions covered a broad range of topics such as cyber attacks, cyber security costs, cyber security staff, users, technolo gies, and implemented processes. The questionnaire was filled in by 222 entities, including 63 public sector institutions, 24 financial institutions, 77 healthcare facilities, 14 organisations providing digital services, 12 energy sector entities, 12 industrial enti­ ties, and 20 educational institutions. The NÚKIB drew information from these materials for the 2020 Report on Cyber Security in the Czech Republic (hereinafter the ‘2020 RCS’). All data obtained from the questionnaires were anonymised. EVALUATION PROCESS The assessment of cyber security in the Czech Republic is based on an analytical process consisting of the eval­ uation of the data from the filled questionnaires, the findings of the NÚKIB, information provided by partners, and other available information from verified sources. The NÚKIB did not have the opportunity to check the data provided by the respondents or to verify the claims. The analytical conclusions contained in the report are based on the premise that the answers in the question­ naires were not distorted. The analytical assessment is described using probability expressions (see below). The 2020 Report on Cyber Security in the Czech Republic does not provide an exhaustive list of cyber security activities. The goal of the document is to describe and assess the threats in cyberspace the Czech Republic faced in 2020, as well as actions taken to mitigate them.

On the other hand, in only a few cases did the respondents face sniffing (internal net­ work scann ing) or illegal cryptocurrency mining. The most serious attacks according to the respondents were ransomware, DoS/DDoS attacks, spear­phishing e­mails, and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities (Chart 2). Although more than half the respondents claimed they had detected at least one cyberattack attempt, such at­ tempts did not lead to cyber security incidents in almost three­quarters of the cases, meaning the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or services was not breached (Chart 3).3 The largest number of inci­ dents were detected by public sphere institutions and healthcare facilities. Chart 1: Most frequent types of cyberattacks in 2020 (% of respondents) However, the fact that such a significant number of institutions did not detect a cyber security incident or an attack attempt does not mean that no cyber incidents occurred in their networks. The ability to detect attacks targeted at data integrity and confidentiality particu­ larly require capacities based on advanced detection technologies and sufficiently trained staff. On the other hand, detecting attacks such as spam, phishing or scam e­mails is significantly easier.

By contrast, the proportion of the budget spent on cyber security was comparable to 2019 and ranged between 0% and 5% of the organisation’s total budget for most respondents (Chart 5). More than half the organisations considered the amount insufficient (Chart 6).

(%) people – experts: experienced workers stay but  newcomers are discouraged by the financial  conditions 68% of the organisations participating in the question­ naire survey stated that low salaries discouraged new workers from cyber security jobs during the hiring pro­ cess, particularly in the public sphere and healthcare. The lack of cyber security experts is a global issue. The increased demand for them means that private sector organisations are better equipped to pay higher salaries for these experts (Chart 7). In more than half the organ­ isations, cyber security is ensured by workers with rele­ vant work experience of 5 to 15 years or more (Chart 8). According to the respondents, cyber security architect and SIEM4 surveillance roles or services are the most difficult to fill in the cyber security sphere. One positive thing is that once a post is filled, the turnover of cyber security workers the organisations have to face is low. Only 10% of the respondents reported the departure of one or two employees, the main reason being other than the amount of remuneration in 74% of the cases.

PRIVATE SECTOR 46% PUBLIC SECTOR 77% 11Cyber Security in 2020 from the Perspective of Czech Institutions, Organisations, and Companies As many as 38% of the respondents claimed that they had sufficient legal expertise in cyber security. Most often, the companies try to compensate for workforce shortages by outsourcing and by offering benefits in the form of further training or participation in interesting projects to attract new people (Chart 9).

(%) people – users: improving employee cyber  resilience but poor social network security 86% of the organisations sought to prevent cyberattacks by training their users. Although half the respondents do not specifically allocate funds to training, training took place once a year or more often in more than 50% of the companies (Chart 10). Three­quarters of such training took the form of e­learning or internal training using the company’s own staff. Half the organisations also focused on other ways to improve their staff’s resilience against cyberattacks. Nearly a quarter of them tested their users through simulated phishing campaigns or penetration testing (Chart 11 ).

The questionnaire survey showed that 68% of the respondents do not use multi­ factor verification despite the fact that it significantly improves digital platform security and that the misuse of a stolen account can result in reputational damages to the attacked institution. As many as 86% of the respondents have not established procedures to deal with the potential theft of accounts on social networks (Chart 12). Chart 12: If your organisation uses social networks  for communication, has it established procedures  to deal with the potential theft of accounts on such  social networks? (%) NO 86% YES 14% 13Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB CYBER INCIDENTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NÚKIB In 2020, the NÚKIB received 468 notifications of cyber  security  incidents, 99 of which it directly handled (Chart 13). The remaining incidents either did not re­ quire any intervention from the NÚKIB, or another relevant institution handled them. Nearly one­third of the handled incidents were reported by non­ regulated entities, which represents nearly a tenfold increase compared to 2019. This increase is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) caused by the higher number of cyberattacks as well as improved awareness of the existence and activities of the NÚKIB. Chart 13: Trend in the number of cyber security inci- dents handled by the NÚKIB in 2017–2020: In 2020,  the NÚKIB handled more incidents than in any of  the past four years; we anticipate a further increase  in 2021 During 2020, the majority of the cyber incidents handled by the NÚKIB were in public administration (Chart 14). The second most frequently addressed sector was healthcare, where the number grew by 267% year on year. The number of handled incidents reported by municipalities also increased significantly in comparison with 2019. These increases are in line with global trends.ii Chart 14: Trend in the number of cyber incidents in  2019 and 2020 by sector 0 20 40 60 80 50 54 78 99 2020201920182017 0 20 40 2 0 5 0 7 0 7 5 3 3 11 1 5 2 6 2 6 16 51 43 4 1 CIVIL ENGINEERING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EDUCATION DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY SECTOR TRANSPORT HEALTHCARE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION 20202019 MUNICIPALITIES REGION 267 % a year-on-year increase in cyber security  incidents in healthcare 14Cyber Security in 2020 from the Perspective of Czech Institutions, Organisations, and Companies The most serious major incident handled by the NÚKIB was the encrypting of the University Hospital Brno systems using ransomware in March 2020.iii The incident led to significant limitations on the hospital’s operation at three localities and caused damage in the millions of crowns.iv The Psychiatric Hospital in Kosmonosy became a ransomware victim in the same month.v In that case, mainly the administrative infrastructure of the hospital was paralyzed but its ability to provide healthcare was not compromised, nor were any systems on which human lives depend affected.vi The third major incident5 of 2020 was the compromising of several dozen e­mail accounts of a strategic gov­ ernment institution, which occurred as a result of a successful spear­phishing campaign. Besides a breach of confidentiality of the content of the mailboxes, the compromise also caused the e­mail services to be un­ available for a day or two. More than one­third of the incidents handled by the NÚKIB were caused by malicious code, nearly half of which through ransomware. Another almost one­third of incidents resulted in limited availability of services, systems or web portals, half of which were caused by DDoS attacks. 5 The incident severity assessment is based on Decree No 82/2018 CYBER INCIDENTS IN 2020 BY INCIDENT TYPE The descriptions of the categories are based on the  options in the incident reporting forms: MALICIOUS CODE (e.g. viruses, worms,  Trojan horses, dialers, or spyware) AVAILABILITY (e.g. disruption of  availability caused by a DoS/DDoS attack  or sabotage) PENETRATION (e.g. successful  compromising of an application or a  user account) FRAUD/PHISHING (e.g. e-mail with a  malicious attachment or link) PENETRATION ATTEMPT (e.g. attempt  to exploit a vulnerability, compromised  asset, zero day attack) INFORMATION GATHERING  (e.g. scanning, sniffing, or social  engineering) ABUSIVE CONTENT (e.g. spam,  cyberbullying, inappropriate content) ADMINISTRATIVE/TECHNICAL  (a security incident caused by  administrative or technical fault) Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB 37 26 16 7 7 3 1 2 5 The incident severity assessment is based on Decree No 82/2018 15Threat Actors in Cyberspace The activities of state-sponsored actors in cyberspace  and cybercrime have long been the most serious  threats to the cyber security of the Czech Republic.  The trend in recent years has indicated that the activ- ities of state actors and advanced cyber threat actors  have begun to overlap.vii The evolution of cybercrime activities is best demon­ strated by the development of ransomware attacks. In 2020, the healthcare sector was the most affected.viii The activities of cybercrime groups in the Czech Republic were mainly visible during the ransomware attacks at the University Hospital Brno and the Psychiatric Hospital in Kosmonosy. Whereas previously extortion attacks were a non­targeted low­cost activity aimed at quick profits, the trend in ransomware activities in recent years has been characterised by a targeting of specific  institutions rather than a random mass of individual users.ix Ransomware operators preselect the institutions they consider most likely to pay a ransom. If they suc­ ceed in penetrating their systems, they do not encrypt the files immediately. Instead, they investigate the at­ tacked system and specific data are only encrypted once their potential value for the victim has been assessed.x Some cybercrime groups, similarly to state actors,  thus have a long-term unnoticed presence (persis- tence). The expansion of Ransomware as a Service6 is partly responsible for this development. The activities of state actors are extensive: from ob­ taining large quantities of personal data to industrial and strategic espionage, which also takes place in the Czech Republic. In 2020, the NÚKIB cooperated in the handling of an incident that involved a breach of data confidentiality in the networks of a strategic govern- ment institution. The NÚKIB analysis of compromising indicators discovered that the attacker was almost cer­ tainly a state actor (90% – 100% probability). The trends  in espionage indicate that some states are highly likely  (75% – 85% probability) to employ cybercrime groups  for espionage purposes and other state-required activ- ities more and more often in exchange for toleration  of their criminal activities. The statistics of the Police of the Czech Republic (Chart 15) show that, contrary to their previous increas­ ing trend, cybercrime and crimes committed on the Internet have remained at a constant level over the last two years. The number of cases investigated dropped by 4.1% between 2019 and 2020. The reason is an amendment to the Criminal Code,7 which increased the amount of damage that has to be caused for clas­ sification as a crime. Considering the long­term trend, a further increase in cybercrime in the Czech Republic in the coming years is likely (55% – 70% probability).

The state enterprise Povodí Vltavy and the Prague 3 district town hall were attacked a month later. Although they occurred on the very same day, no link has been identified between the two attacks. During the attack on Povodí Vltavy, which falls under the Ministry of Agriculture, critical information infra­ structure elements were not compromised so the operation of dams and drinking water supplies was not interrupted.xi The attack on the Prague 3 town hall temporarily put the operation of the CzechPoint system in its territory out of service and caused its website and several other systems to fail.xii Apart from those incidents, the NÚKIB most frequently participated in dealing with the impacts of ransomware attacks in the public sector, particularly at the local and regional authorities, healthcare, industry, digital services, and education levels. Both the number of extortion attacks  handled by the NÚKIB and other verified sources  indicate that the Czech Republic was also affected  by the globally rising trend in ransomware attacks  in 2020. 28% of the respondents faced a ransomware attack or an attack attempt in 2020. Just under one­fifth of the organisations which encountered a ransomware attack or an attack attempt classified it as the most serious, serious or moderate type of attack (Chart 16). This is a relatively low number of respondents, which might be caused by the fact that two­thirds of the or­ ganisations did not detect any ransomware attacks but more frequently faced other types of attacks, which they subsequently considered more serious. Compared to the global boom of extortion attacks, the lower de­ tection frequency in the Czech Republic might be due to the focus of ransomware operators on Western Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The chances of getting the ransom paid are higher in those areas, inter alia because organisations can benefit from insurance against extortion attacks in most countries, while on the contrary, in the Czech Republic many insurance companies exclude compensation for damage caused by ransomware attacks in their terms and conditions and also reject ransom payments for ethical reasons. Chart 16: Percentage of respondents who classified  ransomware  attacks  as  most  serious  in  2019  and  2020 (%) Nevertheless, institutions important for the smooth  functioning of the State, such as state institutions,  hospitals and energy, industrial and telecommuni- cation companies, are also the targets of attackers.  Attackers are highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to  continue to concentrate on them because of the high- er chances of getting the ransom paid. Besides more targeted ransomware attacks, the global trend of sensitive data theft and then repeated extortion 2020 6% 2019 10% CYBER THREATS 28% of the respondents said they had detected a  ransomware attack or attack attempt in 2020 17Cyber Threats by threatening to make them public (so­called double extortion) continued in 2020. According to information available to the NÚKIB, no Czech institution fell victim to such an attack in 2020. However, considering the global trend, there is a realistic possibility (25% – 50% probability) that the Czech Republic will be affected by this trend in the future. Although a ransomware attack can have a serious  impact on the operation of an institution, the NÚKIB  recommends that attacked entities do not pay for the  decryption of their data. There is no guarantee that the  attacker will really do what they promise. Moreover,  obtaining the money is just motivation for the attacker  to attack the same institution again. In order for at­ tacked organisations to avoid the need to consider this option, it is highly desirable to keep networks segmented, keep the operating system and applications updated, and create offline backups of at least the critical systems nec­ essary for the operation of the institution. The answers from the respondents indicate that 56% of them create such offline backups and have implemented testing pro­ cedures, 33% of them have offline backups but do not test their recoverability, and 7% of the respondents do not create offline backups at all. With respect to the severity and topicality of the  ransomware issue, the NÚKIB issued an analysis  in 2020 summarising the basic information about  this type of attack, describing the fundamental  vulnerabilities, and providing recommendations  on how to defend against similar attacks. The analysis is available on the NÚKIB’s website:    The supporting material Recommendations for  mitigation, prevention and response, on which the  NÚKIB cooperated with AFCEA and NAKIT, is available  on the website at  publikace/podpurne_materialy RANSOMWARE, DDOS ATTACKS AND  SPEAR-PHISHING: THE THREE MOST SERIOUS  THREATS OF 2020 According to organisations, the most severe threats of 2020 included ransomware and DDoS attacks (Chart 17). Almost one­third of the respondents from the health­ care sector and 25% of the respondents from the financial and public sectors considered ransomware to be the most serious form of attack. The third most serious threat was spear­phishing. In the past, potential phishing attacks were relatively easy to detect thanks to the poor command of the Czech language and different domains in the e­mails. In recent years, however, there has been a trend towards higher sophistication of such attacks: they use better e­mail formats and an extensive portfolio of justifications, ranging from calls for invoice payments to the recovery of account access data. In 2020, the NÚKIB participated in dealing with the  impacts of phishing campaigns as well as more tar- geted spear-phishing campaigns, most often against  obliged entities in the public sector and, less often,  the healthcare sector. Attackers most often succeeded in persuading their victims to open a file attached to an e­mail with a notification to pay an invoice. By opening the file, the user enabled macros that then caused infec­ tion with different malware. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NÚKIB  FOR DEFEND AGAINST SPEAR-PHISHING  ATTACKS INCLUDES: Do not allow macros in MS Office documents. Do not automatically open attachments and links in e-mails. Check e-mail addresses in the case of urgent or unusual requirements. In the event of doubt or suspicion, contact the sender via another channel, then contact your IT department. Limit sharing information about job on social networks.

This is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) caused by the low occurrence of this type of attack in the Czech Republic or the difficultly for the organisations to detect it. More than half the respondents perceive  the threat of cyberattacks through the supply chain as  low; moreover, there has been a year on year decrease  in the seriousness of this threat as perceived by the  respondents (Chart 18). Chart 18: How high was the threat of cyberattacks  from a provider of services, software, or hardware  in 2019 and 2020 according to the organisations?  (% of respondents) In contrast to the increasingly weak perception of  the threat of cyberattacks on the supply chain in the  Czech Republic, a massive attack on SolarWinds, an  American software company, was detected at the end  of 2020. Although the total damage is not known yet, the estimates are that there are tens of thousands of compromised8 clients throughout the world.xiii Supply chains enable attackers to extend their attack surface in cyberspace and thus gain access to many times more sensitive data of both organisations and individuals. The SolarWinds supply chain attack was carried out by infecting the Orion platform provided by the company with the Sunburst backdoor,9 which allowed the attack­ ers to penetrate the systems of the target companies. Those included, for example, the cyber security com­ pany FireEye, the United States Departments of Treasury, Defense, and State, as well as Microsoft, Fujitsu, and Lukoil.xiv In light of the seriousness of the situation,  the NÚKIB issued a reactive measure, although no  case of compromise has been reported from bodies  regulated under the ACS so far. REACTIVE MEASURE IN RELATION TO SOLARWINDS  ORION PLATFORM APPLICATIONS  The last reactive measure of 2020 was focused on  the risks associated with software from the American  company SolarWinds. System administrators of critical  information infrastructures, important information  systems, and essential service systems immediately  had to perform security updates, check whether  their system had been compromised, and perform  security audits. The whole wording of the reactive measure is  available on the NÚKIB’s website at As many as 72% of the respondents most often manage the risks associated with suppliers at contractual rela­ tionship level, which is just one of the basic measures.10 Almost three­quarters of them only grant their suppliers unrestricted remote access following the consent of the organisation’s responsible person, whereas 8% of them do not grant any remote access at all (Chart 19).

At the same time, users only have authorised access to services that are explicitly assigned to them, and everything else is blocked. The Zero Trust Security concept can be used to mitigate supplier­associated risks as well as to secure connections and networks for remote working. 19Cyber Threats the most frequent findings of the NÚKIB’s control activi­ ties, which include insufficient management of supplier­ associated risks. Apart from risk management, there is an obvious trend in authorities awarding public con­ tracts using not only quantitative criteria, such as price, but also qualitative criteria. In 2020, the latter were used in public procurement by 61% of the respondents, mainly from the energy and public sectors (Chart 20).

Attacks on CII that were handled with the participation of the NÚKIB mainly occurred through DDoS attacks or attempts, while the second most frequent type of attack was phishing or spear­phishing e­mails (Chart 21). Again, the fact that no sophisticated attacks were detected by CII entities does not confirm that they are not occurring as their detection strongly depends on the technical, procedural and personal capacities of the responsible entities. Similarly to last year, nearly half the detected cyber security incidents resulted in limitations in service availability which, with CII entities, is one of the essential criteria for ensuring the smooth operation of the State and society. Mainly state administration institutions faced security incidents in relation to CII. As in 2019, one­third of the respondents categorised under CII managed to deal with the most serious attack of 2020 within several hours. In 5% of cases, the respondents were still dealing with the consequences a year later. Up to 96% of critical infrastructure organisations believe that their cyber security has improved compared to previous years (Chart 22). The NÚKIB cannot confirm this trend from information available to it. Furthermore, there is a realistic possibility (25% – 50% probability) that the answers to the question were significantly affected by the positive perception of some sub­measures adopted by many of those organisations even though these do not necessarily mean that the cyber security of the CII entities has objectively improved. Pursuant to the ACS, critical information  infrastructure (CII) consists of communication and  information systems of critical infrastructure (CI)  elements. Pursuant to Act No 240/2004, on crisis  management and on amendments to certain other  laws (the Crisis Act), CI is defined as an element or  system of elements whose compromise would have  a serious impact on national security, the provision  of the basic living needs of the population, and  ensuring the health of people or the economy  of the State. Typical CI elements include power plants, dams,  airports, and telecommunication networks, as  well as strategic financial institutions and State  authorities. The elimination of any of these  elements can paralyze the provision of critical  services (energy, heat, water supplies or pension  payments) or, in extreme cases (such as cyber  sabotage), cause physical damage.

The respondents’ answers show that the increase in the number of attacks targeted at state administration and local and regional authorities corre­ sponds with the data available to the NÚKIB (for details, see the chapter Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB). Whereas in 2019 public sector employees most frequently encountered spam, phishing, and scam e­mails, in 2020 the institutions recorded an increase in attacks taking the form of scanning of their external networks (Chart 23). As for the severity, one­third of the respondents from the public sector and another four sectors ranked DoS/DDoS attacks highest (Chart 24). This is likely (55% – 70% probability) due to the more frequent detection of this type of attack in comparison with other cyber threats. Ransomware placed second in the assessment of the severity of threats in the public sector, with one­third of the healthcare respondents considering it the most serious threat of 2020. Chart 23: Most frequent attacks or attempts against re- spondents from the public sector in 2019 and 2020 (%) Chart 24: Most serious attacks or attempts against re- spondents from the public sector in 2019 and 2020 (%) Similarly to last year, organisations again reported a trend of increasingly sophisticated attacks through  phishing, spear-phishing, and scam e-mails using the pandemic or fraudulent information about parcel deliv­ eries or overdue invoices as bait. Attackers continue to demonstrate better knowledge of both the environment and the Czech language, making it more difficult to detect them. With public sector institutions, the noticeable problem  with hiring and paying cyber security experts persisted in 2020. Besides this, cyber security budgets decreased in almost half the respondents from the public sector. Nearly 80% of them claimed that salaries are the main reason for the unoccupied cyber security positions (Chart 25). Despite the situation, more than half the respondents are not planning any budget increases for the coming year. The combination of these two factors could have a very negative effect on cyber security in the years to come. 2020 2019 0 20 0 20 33% 25% 17% 17% 14% 13% 11% 5% MALICIOUS CODE PHISHING SPEAR- -PHISHING RANSOM- WARE DOS/DDOS ATTACKS RANSOM- WARE ATTEMPT AT EXPLOITING VULNERABILITY SPEAR- PHISHING CERTAINLY YES 63% RATHER YES 33% RATHER NO 4% 0 20 40 60 52% 60% 14% 17% 23% 5% 11% 5% 13% 0% PHISHING SCAM E-MAIL OTHERSCANNINGSPAM 2019 2020 22Targets of Cyberattacks Chart 25: Were salaries the crucial factor discouraging  cyber security job applicants in the public sector in  2020? (%) REGULATION OF THE USE OF CLOUD  COMPUTING The amendment to the Act on Public  Administration Information Systems effective  from August 2020 introducing new rules for the  authentication of cloud computing providers and  services used by public authorities represents an  important advance in cyber security in the public  sector. During 2021, the amendment will be further  amended and completed with security rules  through implementing legislation the NÚKIB is  preparing in the form of decrees. FINANCIAL SECTOR: THE HIGHEST BUDGETS AND  THE ABSENCE OF SERIOUS ATTACKS Three­quarters of the respondents from the financial sector faced cyberattack attempts in 2020. The attacks resulted in cyber incidents in only less than one­third of the cases. Although financial institutions identified targeted phishing, DDoS attacks and ransomware as the most serious cyber incidents, similarly to the year before there was an absence of more severe incidents so the Czech financial sector can be described as rela- tively well secured. Banks and insurance companies try not to underestimate cyber security as any compromis­ ing of their information systems could have far­reaching financial and reputational consequences. Financial institutions invest the highest percentage of  their budgets in cyber security of all sectors (Chart 26) and were the only ones to state that salaries were not a fundamental factor discouraging cyber security job applicants. More than half the respondents from the financial sector did not decrease their budgets on cyber security in comparison with 2019. On the contrary, more than a quarter of them increased their budgets. Apart from cyber security experts, all financial institu­ tions also invest in employee training. Some organisa­ tions stated that, besides using standard methods of testing, they also planned to implement an internal Red Team.11 Clients of financial institutions faced vishing  (a portmanteau of voice and phishing) attacks  in 2020 by which attackers tried to steal money  from them. Some of the affected banks issued  warnings about these vishing campaigns in which  they described how such attacks are carried out.xv Most often, the attackers called clients by phone,  saying that their account had been attacked and  recommending transferring their funds to another  specific account to secure them. In some cases,  they directly requested access details, including  the login codes received via SMS. Vishing campaigns are also increasing in number  abroad. In 2020, American security services issued  a warning about the higher frequency of this  method in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.xvi Chart 26: What percentage of the total budgets of  financial sector organisations was allocated to cyber  security in 2020? (%) 0 20 40 60 32% 21% 79% 68% NO YES Public sector Average of all sectors 11 A Red Team is a team of ethical hackers who simulate attacks using the same sophisticated means as real attackers.

As last year, financial institutions had the highest investments in cyber secu­ rity of all the organisations questioned. INDUSTRY & ENERGY: MORE ATTACKS BUT  LOW IMPACTS During 2020, the industry and energy sectors encoun- tered more attacks and attempts than the average in  other sectors (Chart 27). Only 4% of these resulted in cyber incidents, the impacts of which the institutions handled immediately (in almost half the cases) or with­ in several hours. As many as 90% of the respondents consider the cyber security of their organisations fully or rather sufficient, compared to the average of 70% for all sectors. As many as 92% of organisations in the energy sector and 58% of institutions in industry have cyber incidents incorporated in their crisis communication directive, compared to only half of organisations on average in the other monitored sectors. Although a quarter of the organisations classified supply chain attacks as serious, half the respondents stated that they were the least frequent. Even so, two­thirds of them perceive the threat of supply chain attacks on their institutions as moderate or high. Chart 27: How many cyberattack attempts did organ- isations from industry and the energy sector detect  in 2020? (%) More than half the organisations plan to increase their  cyber security budgets in the coming year, despite  the fact that 54% of the respondents consider their  organisation’s cyber security investments to be suf- ficient. At the same time, 67% of the respondents from the energy sector stated that they had sufficient legal expertise in cyber security, which is considerably above the all­sector average. As for setting up processes, 92% of organisations in both sectors create offline backups of their critical systems and test them, and nearly half the respondents from both sectors have implemented BCM processes, com­ pared to the all­sector average of 23%. HEALTHCARE: A TEMPTING RANSOMWARE  ATTACK TARGET Czech  hospitals  and  other  healthcare  facilities  were a very attractive ransomware attack target in  2020. The focusing on such institutions can largely be attributed to the ongoing COVID­19 pandemic, which is putting high pressure on healthcare provision. Consequently, the chances of the attackers being paid the required ransom are higher. In 2020, the NÚKIB participated in dealing with nearly 20 security incidents in the healthcare sector, most often associated with phishing, ransomware attacks, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in systems. The most significant cases  handled were those of the University Hospital Brno  and the Psychiatric Hospital Kosmonosy (for more details, see the chapter Cyber Security Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB). THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EXPRESSED  CONCERN ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON THE CZECH  HEALTHCARE SECTOR In the first half of the year, Czech hospitals were  exposed to a high cyberattack threat. Among  others, Michael Pompeo, the then United States  Secretary of State, expressed his support for the  Czech Republic in combating the pandemic as well  as ensuring cyber security, stating that the USA was  concerned about the situation and that anybody  participating in such activity had to be ready  to bear the consequences of their actions. He also  called upon ‘the actors in question to refrain from  carrying out disruptive malicious cyber activity  against the Czech Republic’s healthcare system  or similar infrastructure elsewhere’.xvii Industry & Energy Average of all sectors 0 20 40 31% 25% 48% 39% 13% 8% 4% 8% 4% 20% 0 1–10 11–20 21–30 OTHER 24Targets of Cyberattacks Nearly 90% of the respondents from the healthcare  sector believe that the level of cyber security in their  organisations has improved. Nevertheless, the NÚKIB’s activities in several healthcare facilities in 2020 indicate that the overall level of cyber security is still insuffi­ cient. Similarly to previous years, three-quarters of  the respondents consider the funding allocated to  cyber security to be deficient. In 2019, almost half the healthcare organisations questioned would increase their cyber security budgets by more than 100%, com­ pared to only one­third speaking in favour of an increase of 50% in 2020. As in previous years, salaries have remained the crucial factor discouraging cyber security job applicants for almost three­quarters of the respondents. Compared to  last year, there has been some positive development  as the percentage of unoccupied posts has decreased  in almost all categories (Chart 28). It can be concluded from the respondents’ answers that cyber security has come to the forefront of the budget priorities, but in most cases the respondents could only increase their budgets thanks to the 10th Call of the EU’s Integrated Regional Operational Programme for Cyber Security. Chart 28: Unoccupied cyber security jobs in hospitals  in 2019 and 2020 (% of respondents) THE AMENDMENT TO THE DECREE ON  PROVIDERS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN  HEALTHCARE In reaction to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and  the cyberattacks on the Czech hospitals, the Decree  on Providers of Essential Services was amended last  year in relation to the healthcare sector. The goal  of the amendment was to include a greater  number of hospitals among the essential service  operators and to ensure their better regional  distribution in order to ensure nationwide coverage.  The amendment takes account of the specifics  of some health services as well as of the capacity  of health service providers whose substitutability in  the case of outage due to a cyber incident would be  difficult, and ensures connection to the integrated  rescue and emergency system. The amendment  took effect from 1 January 2021 and supposes that,  based on the new criteria, about 30 additional  hospitals should be regulated in 2021 on top of the  original number of 16 most important hospitals. The complete wording of the amended Decree is  available at aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu EDUCATION: INCREASING CYBERATTACKS Czech academic institutions have become the tar- gets of ransomware attacks more and more often. Throughout 2020, universities and colleges repeatedly warned against harmful practices in cyberspace targeted at their institutions. Prague University of Economics and Business faced a ransomware attack,xviii Masaryk University in Brno detected new malware aimed at its users via a targeted phishing campaignxix, and Palacký University Olomouc detected a previously unknown form of ransomware that encrypted all data upon a computer restart.xx The increase in attacks against  Czech educational institutions mimics the global trend. As in the previous year, the most serious cyberat­ tacks in absolute figures according to the educational institutions were phishing campaigns – from simple, widespread ransom e­mails to sophisticated and spe­ cifically targeted scam e­mails, in which the attackers pre tended to be employees of the university. One­fifth of the respondents ranked ransomware second of the most serious threats. One way in which the institutions can diminish the threat of a successful phishing attack is by training their employees in cyber security. Although three­quarters of 2019 2020 0 20 40 27% 57% 0–10% 13% 3% 10–20% 13% 7% 20–30% 33% 3% 30–40% 7% 6% 40–50% 24% 7% JINÉ 25Targets of Cyberattacks organisations do not specifically allocate funds to em­ ployee training, exactly half the respondents perform it. The education sector was the most affected by budget  decreases of all sectors, although 65% of respondents  saw decreases (Chart 29). More than one­fifth of ed­ ucational institutions were in favour of increasing their budgets by at least 50%. Chart 29: How did the organisation’s cyber security  budget change in 2020 in comparison with 2019? (%) In order to minimize the threat of successful  cyberattacks on educational institutions, it is  primarily desirable to identify the information  systems used. On 1 January 2021, the amended  Decree No 317/2014, on important information  systems and their determination criteria entered  into force, under which information systems  of colleges and universities may also fall. More details are available in the NÚKIB  supporting materials, such as the Guidebook to IIS  identification on the NÚKIB website: dokumenty-a-publikace/podpurne-materialy DIGITAL SERVICES: SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND  LEGAL EXPERTISE The crisis management processes of the majority of Czech institutions that provide digital services (tele­ communications, digital infrastructure, internet ser­ vices, etc.) include cyber incident response scenarios. In 2020, almost half the respondents dealt with one to five cyber incidents (Chart 30), of which DoS/DDoS at­ tacks were perceived as the most serious by one­fifth of the organisations. Exactly half the respondents do not grant their sup­ plier any remote access into their networks, whereas the other half grant them restricted access following the user’s consent. This is presumably why 57% of the respondents perceived the threat of supply chain cyber­ attacks as low or very low. In 2020, one-third of the institutions from the digital  services sector spent from 5% to more than 15% of  their total budget on cyber security, which is only comparable to the financial sector. Less than three­ quarters of the respondents consider the amount sufficient, whereas one­third plan to increase the cyber security budget next year, which corresponds to the average of respondents’ answers across the sectors. Digital service institutions, as well as industry and the energy sector, have legal expertise at a level higher than the average of all respondents.

In the context of the re­ active measure, a recommendation was issued and sent by the NÚKIB to the backbone hospitals appointed by the Ministry of Health. JULY issuing of the document minimum  safety standards for securing  small-scale organisations In cooperation with NAKIT and the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, the NÚKIB prepared a document whose goal was to assist organisations that do not fall under the ACS – typically local authorities, healthcare facilities, schools, and private companies – with their cyber security. secure video conferencing handbook  This handbook issued in cooperation with NAKIT contains essential safety recommendations and tips for secure video conferencing. OCTOBER notification about scam e-mails disguised  as the results of covid-1 tests The NÚKIB highlighted the threat of scam e­mails, in which unknown attackers sent false test results with a link to download malicious code. The code would then enable the attackers to access the e­mail recip­ ient’s device. MAY recommendations regarding safe  remote working Tips and recommendations for safe remote working for both companies and employees in the form of a short leaflet published by the NÚKIB in cooperation with other partners. APRIL warning against threats of cyberattacks  on hospitals and other significant targets  in the czech republic A month after the issuing of the reactive measure, the NÚKIB issued a warning against a cyber threat consisting of the implementation of an extensive campaign of severe cyberattacks on information and communication systems in the Czech Republic, and on systems in healthcare facilities in particular. The NÚKIB completed the warning with a recommenda­ tion focusing on technical and organisational issues and specified the procedures defined in the warning. notification about the risks of online  conference services Taking into account the increased need for on­ line communication, the NÚKIB pointed out the risks associated with the use of audio and video communication services, and drew particular attention to vulnerabilities in the Zoom service, which became a frequent target of attacks. MEASURES TIMELINE OF THE NÚKIB’S ACTIVITIES IN  COMBATING THE COVID−19 PANDEMIC 27Measures NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY:  AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE IN 2020 In November 2020, the Government of the Czech Republic approved the National Cyber Security Strategy for the following 5 years, which was prepared by the NÚKIB. The document describes the main principles of cyber security in the Czech Republic, defines its strategic direction in cyber security, and describes the fundamen­ tal visions in this increasingly important area. The document is divided into three main pillars, each to be fulfilled through strategic goals. IN CYBERSPACE WITH CONFIDENCE: Since the risk to the Czech Republic from cyberspace has been increasing over recent years, the Czech Republic must react to a whole range of new challenges. The Czech Republic should strengthen its prosperity through a confident and responsible approach to cyber security at national level. It will thus also remain a strong ally for its partners at international level. STRONG AND RELIABLE ALLIANCES: The flag­ ship vision for the Czech Republic as a modern European country is an active role in creat­ ing international dialogue, and in the Euro­ Atlantic area in particular. The Czech Republic will proceed from coherent national positions and clearly defined strategic interests. On this basis, it will continue to create and deepen strong alliances with its partners in cyber secu­ rity and defence. RESILIENT SOCIETY 4.0: The Czech Republic is among European leaders in spreading and using modern technologies. As a result, Czech society is successfully transforming into an in­ formation society. This trend, however, is bring­ ing with it not only an increase in the number of end­users in Czech society but also threats to which those users are exposed. The problems associated with this include insufficient digital hygiene, insufficient media literacy, and critical thinking across society. Therefore, the Czech Republic must concentrate on successfully transforming Czech society into the so­called Society 4.0. This is the state where the entire society is able to fully exploit the benefits of modern technologies and, at the same time, in­ tegrate them into their everyday lives in such a way that the security risks are minimized. Cyber security must thus become an integral part of the everyday lives of citizens. The National Cyber Security Strategy of the Czech Republic is detailed in specific tasks within the Action Plan. Both documents were prepared in cooperation with the relevant entities responsible for the essential areas of cyber security for the accomplishment of the individual tasks. The NÚKIB will continually monitor, discuss, assess and coordinate the fulfilment of the individual goals. The National Cyber Security Strategy is available  on the NÚKIB’s website: kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/ The NÚKIB Development Concept was also  approved in 2020. It describes the complete range  of activities that the NÚKIB currently ensures,  evaluates the current situation, and describes  and justifies the need for the future development  of the agency within the context of the security  environment, particularly as regards cyber threats. The complete document on the NÚKIB  Development Concept is available on the website at  strategie-akcni-plan LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK: SETTING BASIC  RULES FOR IMPORTANT ENTITIES12 amendment of the decree on important  information systems During the last year, the NÚKIB worked on an amend­ ment to the Decree on Important Information Systems, the aim of which was to simplify and clarify the process of identification of such systems and reinforce the legal certainty of its addressees through its increased effectivity. The amendment entered into force in Sep tember 2020 and gradually came into effect from 1 January 2021. Due to the costs which will be required to secure the newly identified systems, the effectiveness of the list of systems was spread over three years. 12 Pursuant to Act No 181/2014, on cyber security and on amendments to related laws, as amended, it includes entities whose information systems are important for the functioning of the State. 1. 2. 3. 28Measures ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  IMPORTANT INFORMATION SYSTEMS DUE  TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE DECREE ON  IMPORTANT INFORMATION SYSTEMS corrections and amendments to legal  provisions At the beginning of 2020, the ACS was amended with respect to the provisions related to offences and fines resulting from them. The amendment corrected a condition that had persisted since 2017 when some offences overlapped and some lacked any possibility of imposition of a fine. NUMBER OF OBLIGED ENTITIES BY THE END  OF 2020: entities: administrators and operators  of critical information infrastructure  information and communication  systems critical information infrastructure  information and communication  systems entities: administrators and operators  of important information systems important information systems entities: administrators and operators  of essential services information   systems essential services information systems THE NÚKIB’S SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES IN 2020 Regarding control and audit activities, 2020 was negatively affected by the pandemic, which resulted in a lower number of controls and audits performed. In 2019, the NÚKIB performed 15 controls under the ACS, whereas in 2020 it only performed 8 controls and audits under the ACS, or Decree No 82/2018, on cyber security (hereinafter the ‘DCS’). Controls and audits at obliged entities under the ACS verify that the obligations resulting from the ACS and DCS have been fulfilled. There are about 150 check points within each control or audit. The NÚKIB’s priority  in the area of controls and audits was the healthcare  sector, particularly in the second half of 2020. AREAS OF INSUFFICIENCIES MOST FREQUENTLY  IDENTIFIED DURING THE CONTROL AND  AUDITING ACTIVITIES: The set cyber security system does not cover all parties involved Subjects manage the assets and risks associated with cyber security inadequately The security policy and documentation are often not applied in practice or are not updated Subjects manage the supplier-associated risks inadequately Use of obsolete hardware and software no longer supported by the manufacturer Lack of cyber security experts Inappropriate network segmentation Insufficient internal network monitoring Too short log storage period Dysfunctional system ensuring the continuity of activities 52 120 85 56 61 177 period 2021 2022 2023 Total number of newly implemented systems 360 260  80 700 29Measures COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NÚKIB AND  OTHER SUPERVISION BODIES ON CONTROLS  IN 2020 Last year, the NÚKIB continued in its cooperation  in control activities with other regulatory  bodies, with the aim of minimising the burden  on the obliged entities. For example, the NÚKIB  established cooperation with the State Office  for Nuclear Safety via a memorandum, whereby  these institutions confirmed mutual support and  cooperation beyond the scope of control activities. CYBER SECURITY EXERCISES: GREAT INTEREST,  LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES As in previous years, in 2020 the NÚKIB noticed an in­ creased demand for exercises by Czech organisations and entities. This demand could not be completely met, however, because of the measures associated with the  global COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of organ­ ised exercises, which are a proven tool for increasing the cyber security level, was negatively affected by the impossibility of meeting in person to discuss questions posed by a realistic scenario customized for the specif­ ic audience. Such restrictions on meetings were both on the side of the NÚKIB and the requesting subjects, which on the one hand emphasised the safety of their  employ ees for logical reasons, and on the other prior­ itized other critical activities of their own. Despite the above, the NÚKIB organised or coordinated eight national and international exercises in 2020. Apart from the representatives of the NÚKIB, about  100 participants from various organisations activ ely  participated in the exercises in the Czech Republic. The exercise as part of the General Staff Course and the exercise for the Prague Castle Administration are par­ ticularly worth highlighting. THE ADDED VALUE OF THE CYBER SECURITY  EXERCISES Exercises are an invaluable source of new  knowledge, experience, and technical skills.  They give the NÚKIB an opportunity to identify  weaknesses in cyber security, point them out  and provide an excellent tool for the verification  and revision of strategies and procedures.  As a tool for identification, definition and  confirmation of trends, they also provide inputs  for the preparation of other awareness-raising  and educational activities. Furthermore, the  exercises help strengthen relations between  the participants as well as with the partners  cooperating with the NÚKIB on their preparation. cyber coalition  international cyber  security exercise This annual international exercise held by NATO, with the NÚKIB coordinating the civilian part and the Cyber and Information Warfare Command the military part at national level, saw a dramatic change compared to previous years because of the COVID­19 pandemic. The participation of the coordinating organisations and their partners was significantly limited, and the planning process and the actual exercises took place virtually. Despite the necessary adjustments to the current sit­ uation, NÚKIB representatives also managed to actively participate in the Core Planning Team responsible for the preparation and organisation of the exercises at the highest level, for the third consecutive year. Thereby,  the Czech Republic again contributed to one of the  largest international cyber security exercises to the  maximum extent. CYBER COALITION 2020 IN FIGURES IN WHICH AREAS DO THE PARTICIPANTS TRAIN  THROUGH THE CYBER COALITION? Processes Technical tasks Communication Legal aspects comm czech  communication exercise The goal of the third communication exercise held by the NÚKIB was to test the availability and 13th iteration globally  10th iteration in Czechia 1 000 participants 29 countries 30Measures up­to­datedness of the contact details provided by the obliged entities under the ACS, which are particularly important for the NÚKIB with respect to the need for immediate crisis communication in the case of a cyber security incident. The metrics were the avail­ ability of the contact details related to the specific systems categorised as CII, IIS or OES. Any potential unavailability or impossibility of timely communication in a real situation could result in serious damage, not only to the entity in question but in the worst­ case scenario also to the whole Czech Republic. The results of the exercise were evaluated very positively as most of the contact details, and subsequently the systems, were available. The exer cise also verified and confirmed that the subjects already intensively  communicate with the NÚKIB even when there is  no emergency. IMPORTANT FINDINGS FROM EXERCISES  IN PREVIOUS YEARS: To react to serious cyber incidents in a timely,  effective and adequate manner, organisations need  to have cybersecurity contingency plans prepared  in advance, and their employees need to know  the plans. One of the biggest cyber security challenges  is the sharing of information between partners  (both domestic and foreign), without which it is  difficult to understand cyberattacks in a broader  context and uncover all an attacker’s activities,  their motivation and goals, and to subsequently  adopt appropriate measures. AWARENESS-RAISING AND EDUCATION IN THE  CZECH REPUBLIC: THE ONLINE YEAR 2020 The year 2020 proved that continuous and quality training in cyber security is more than important, and it has to be given maximum space. The epidemiologi­ cal circumstances forced many daily activities into the online environment, and things such as home offices and distance learning became part of our vocabulary. This created not only many opportunities but also many threats, for which various target user groups had to be prepared. The training of public administration users was per­ formed via the online course Dávej kyber! [Get Cyber  Skilled!] organised by the NÚKIB, which presents cyber security basics. THE DÁVEJ KYBER! COURSE TOOK: The awareness­raising and educational activities also included the following projects for children in kinder­ gartens to students at universities and university staff: The expert online course Bezpečně v kyber [Stay Safe in Cyberspace] was taken by 1‚690 prevention officers within the scope of their professional training with a prevention extension. The course was prepared by the NÚKIB in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and Zvolsi.info, and introduces topics in online security and situations that prevention officers may encounter in the education environment. In  cooperation with the Union of Librarians and Information Workers of the Czech Republic, the NÚKIB managed to distribute the educational board game Městečko kybernetov for kindergartens, which pre­ sents the issue of cyberbullying and other topics to children in a soft manner. The audio stories Vanda a Eda v Onl@jn světě were prepared under the auspices of the Secure Internet Festival and in cooperation with Rádio Junior and Czech Radio’s (Český rozhlas) channel for children; they pre­ pare pupils from the 1st grade of primary school for their first experience of the Internet. The online interactive comic Digitální stopa: Příběh  Svůďáka was seen by 650 pupils. It was prepared by the NÚKIB and mainly concentrates on cybergrooming for pupils of the 4th and 5th grades of primary school. The Cyber Security Competition for Secondary School  Students was held once again in the 2019/2020 school year by the Czech branch of AFCEA. Nearly 4,500 stu- dents participated in it, 1,500 of whom qualified for the second­round runoff. During the 2nd Secure Internet Festival, the NÚKIB distributed videos, games, and podcasts to schools via 18 209 214 2 000 public sector employees Czech Armed Forces  personnel Bulovka Hospital staff 31Measures the Bakaláři and Škola Online information systems. This meant they were offered to 280‚000 users directly on their homepages. The NÚKIB also held the Effectiveness of  Cyber Prevention online panel discussion at the Festival, which was seen on various platforms by 4,500 viewers. The programme presented trends and effective forms of awareness­raising in cyber security, for example. Masaryk  University  opened a new bachelor  pro- gramme in cyber security. Students will be able to study courses such as Cybercrime and cyber security or Cyber security in organisations. Furthermore, significant awareness­raising and educa­ tional audio­visual materials such as films, documen­ taries and series dealing with various online security topics were produced in the Czech Republic last year. The following should be highlighted in particular: #martyisdead: a thriller series on cyberbullying and ma­ nipulation prepared by Mall web­TV in cooperation with CZ.NIC and its project ‘Bezpečně na netu’. The series was successful both in the Czech Republic and abroad, where it won an Emmy in the short series category. Datová Lhota: an educational cartoon series produced by Czech Television, which presents the technical back­ ground of the Internet to children in the first stage of primary school and helps create safe behaviour habits. V síti: a documentary that opened the issue of internet predators and stirred up a great deal of public interest. V digitálním světě: educational videos with a similar focus for the same target group were also prepared by Jeden svět na školách, a project by the non­profit organisation Člověk v tísni. O2 Smart School: a project by the O2 Foundation, which mainly helps pedagogues and parents to better under­ stand the opportunities and pitfalls of the digital world. In the area of research and development, the  NÚKIB published the National Cyber and  Information Security Research and Development  Plan with the objective of identifying key research  topics for the development of the security system  of the Czech Republic. The NÚKIB also participated  in the implementation of research projects dealing  with the analysis of security risks associated with  optical fibre networks and strategic research and  development of systems for securing modern  communication networks using quantum key  distribution and post-quantum cryptography. A Junior Centrum Excelence centre for information security at the Secondary School of Informatics, Postal Services and Finance Brno was opened at the begin­ ning of 2020. The objective of the Junior Centrum Excelence centres is to ensure the creation of a future expert foundation that will enable better responses to the latest cyber threats. The centres are exceptional and progressive in their approach to teaching and edu­ cation in information security, the implementation of safety measures and, last but not least, in their technical equipment. With their help, other secondary schools can also teach information security. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION: GROWTH OF  THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBER SECURITY  AT EUROPEAN LEVEL The development of regulatory tools in the Czech Republic largely depends on the situation abroad as well as on the decisions adopted at European and international level. The NÚKIB represents the Czech Republic’s interests in cyber secu rity in international organisations and integration groups, namely in the EU, the UN and NATO, but also in the OECD, the OSCE and the ITU, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (hereinafter the ‘MFA’), the Ministry of Defence and 1 690 workers in prevention took the  ‘Bezpečně v kyber’ course 650 pupils read the ‘Digital Footprint’ comicstudents 4 500  students participated in the Cyber Security  Competition for Secondary School Students 13 Ministry of Industry and Trade, Czech Telecommunication Office and others. 32Measures other partners.13 In 2020, Czech Republic representatives concentrated at EU level mainly on negotiations in the areas of the regulation on competence centres, the agenda of cyber security certification, the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox application,14 the launching of the CyCLONe network,15 sounding talks on revising the NIS Directive16 and concluding discussions about the 5G EU Toolbox17 and its subsequent implementation. The Open Working Group within the UN continued with its activities, in which both the NÚKIB and the MFA actively participate. prague g security conference  and presentation of the prague g security repository In September 2020, the NÚKIB, the Office of the Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organ­ ised the 2nd two­day Prague 5G Security Conference, a leading international forum for discussion of the risks associated with the building of 5G infrastructure. Similarly to last year, the conference was held under the auspices of Andrej Babiš, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. Although the conference was virtual for the first time due to the COVID­19 situation, more than 50 speakers from Europe, the USA, South Korea, Israel, Australia, India, and other countries spoke at it. The main outcome of the 2nd conference was the presentation and launching of the Prague 5G Security  Repository, a virtual library intended for sharing legislative, strategic, and other tools which the countries adopted in the area of 5G network security over the past year. Hence this year’s conference followed on from the release of the Prague Proposals (a set of recommendations and principles countries should take into consideration when building their 5G infrastructure) of the year before. The 3rd Prague 5G Security Conference is scheduled for autumn 2021. A key theme of the conference will be 5G infrastructure security in the context of future and emerging technologies, including the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. The Prague Proposals adopted in 2019 became the ba- sis for concluding of bilateral agreements in the 5G net- works security field for many countries. Consequently,  they are explicitly stated in the bilateral declarations  on the 5G infrastructure security which were conclud- ed, for example, between the USA and Estonia, Poland,  Romania, Kosovo, Slovenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, North  Macedonia, and Slovakia. the new eu cyber security strategyxxiii and proposal for a directive to replace  the nis directivexxiv The end of 2020 brought a new cyber ‘package’ pre­ pared by the European Union with the assistance of the Czech Republic, among others. Apart from the release and gradual implementation of the 5G EU Toolboxxxv and the conclusion of the discussions about the Regulation on the Cyber Security Competence Centre,18 the prepara­ tion of such fundamental documents with actual impact illustrates the importance of the close cooperation estab­ lished by the Czech Republic within the European Union. The new EU Cyber Security Strategy puts great emphasis on the protection of critical infrastructure, draws atten­ tion to international security and stability risks resulting from geopolitical competition between countries and hybrid threats, and highlights the importance of cyber security as the crucial aspect in people’s confidence in innovations and automation. Greater harmonisation of legal regulations and the approach of Member States to cyber security are the subject matter of the proposal of the European  Commission to replace the NIS Directive. The new directive should adapt the coordinated detection of vulnerabilities, expand the sectors of obliged entities, unify methods for the identification of obliged entities, and establish new obligations in incident reporting. 14 In July 2020, the European Union first implemented the sanction mechanism which is a part of the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox. Sanctions were imposed on two citizens of the PRC, four citizens of the Russian Federation, and three organisations from the PRC, Russia and the DPRK.xxi This was a punishment by the EU for the Cloud Hopper cyberespionage campaign performed by the Chinese APT10 group detected in April 2017, the attacks on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2018), the NotPetya cyberattack (2017) ascribed to Russia, and finally for the WannaCry ransomware attack ascribed to the DPRK. In October 2020, sanctions were imposed on another two citizens and one organisation from the Russian Federation.xxii Identifying individuals and organisations from the respective countries does not imply any official attribution of the attacks by the EU, even though the two Russian entities were organisational units of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation GRU (also GU). The identified physical and legal persons are prohibited from entering the EU, and their funds have been frozen. 15 CyCLONe is a network of liaison organisations for dealing with cyber crises. 16 The official name is the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems. 17 The official name is the EU Toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity. 18 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. 33Measures As unnecessarily strong as this harmonisation is in some respects in the Czech Republic’s view, it represents good groundwork for negotiations on the final form of this important EU legislation. Both documents can qualify as critical for the political and legislative anchoring of cyber security in the EU for many years to come. Their ambitiousness reflects the increasing importance of cyber security at both European and international level. At the beginning of 2020, the Czech Republic joined  a pan-European project aimed at creating  a Europe-wide quantum communication  infrastructure. The prepared network will enable highly secured  information transfer within the individual countries  as well as between various EU countries. The  envisaged communication channels are primarily  intended for securing the critical information  infrastructure. It is estimated that the actual  quantum networks should be built and launched  throughout the EU within a 10-year horizon. 34Trends and Outlook for Cyber security in the Czech Republic for 2021 and 2022 RANSOMWARE: The use of extortion malware by which attackers encrypt the data of the attacked institutions with consequent demands for ransom will almost certainly (90% – 100% probability) remain one of the most significant cyber threats in the next two years. At the same time, the trend for increasing sophistication of campaigns and targeting specific victims is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to continue. Considering the persisting pressure on healthcare facilities in 2021 and 2022, it is almost certain (90% – 100% probability) that they will remain the targets of ransomware. Large­scale undertakings, public sector insti­ tutions, and educational establishments are also highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to become targets. PHISHING, SPEAR-PHISHING, AND SCAM  E-MAILS: The Czech Republic will continue to face the most severe threats from 2020 in the coming years, mainly because of the per­ sisting possibility of exploitation of the topic of the pandemic and the development of social engineering methods, such as more sophisti­ cated spear­phishing with the use of deepfakes. It is also likely (55% –70% probability) that the spread of deepfakes will be used for vishing (a blend of voice and phishing) more often, focusing on users as well as public institutions and, above all, financial institutions. LACK OF CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS: The long­term shortage of experts is a factor affect­ ing a number of cyber security areas and trends. We can therefore assume that the outsourc­ ing of many services associated with IT infra­ structure and its securing (Security as a Service, among others) is highly likely (75% – 85% prob­ ability) to grow over the coming years. CLOUD: The growing popularity of cloud envi­ ronments is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to cause a further increase in number of cyber­ attacks targeted at this infrastructure. Clouds will face attacks more and more frequently since both State actors and cybercrime groups will try to gain access to sensitive data or trade secrets. Insufficiencies in security (such as in­ appropriate configuration) are likely (55% – 70% probability) to remain the most exploited vec­ tor of attacks on cloud services. There is a realis­ tic possibility (25% – 50% probability) that Czech organisations or companies will be among the affected clients of those services. CYBERATTACKS  AGAINST  STRATEGIC  STATE INSTITUTIONS: Central government authorities of the Czech Republic are highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to face serious cyberattacks from sophisticated actors in 2021 and 2022. The public sector, including its strategic institutions (the central government authorities in particular), is a frequent target of both cyber criminals and State actors because of its visibility and access to sensitive information. Foreign cases (such as the SolarWinds case) demonstrate that attackers are using more and more sophisticated methods to enter their victim’s system and the attacks are consequently more difficult to detect. Based on the above­mentioned facts, its own data, and information from its partners, the NÚKIB estimates that the trend of serious cyberattacks against strategic government authorities will materialise in the Czech Republic in the next two years, and one or more of them are highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to face a serious cyberattack from sophisticated actors. TRENDS AND OUTLOOK FOR CYBER SECURITY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR 2021 AND 2022 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 35Summary of Annexes ANNEX 1: REPORT ON THE FULFILMENT OF  THE ACTION PLAN FOR THE NATIONAL CYBER  SECURITY STRATEGY FOR 2015 TO 2020 The year 2020 was the closing year for the fulfilment of the Action Plan for the National Cyber Security Strategy of the Czech Republic for 2015 to 2020 (hereinafter the ‘Action Plan’). A substantial part of the tasks were eval­ uated as accomplished or being fulfilled. The number of ongoing tasks has grown compared to the previous year due to the COVID­19 pandemic. These tasks were only partially accomplished because of the epidemio­ logical measures, which significantly affected activities requiring cooperation. For example, the ongoing tasks in the area of cyber exercises whose performance was either cancelled or postponed were assessed as partially accomplished. The situation was similar in the area of educational activities, some of which were directly cancelled, postponed, or transformed into online form. The fulfilment of tasks that were wholly or partially accom plished in the past was also evaluated. One of these was the creation of an automated platform for sharing information about cyber threats under the competence of the NÚKIB. The platform was being developed during 2020 as part of the Non­public Web project, beta testing of which has been in progress since the beginning of 2021. Since mid­February 2021, enti­ ties regulated under the ACS as well as partners of the Government CERT have been gradually connected to it. Only one of the assigned tasks had a fixed deadline in the given year, namely the Full Provision of Cyber Defence of the Czech Republic through the cooperation by the NCOC,19 the NCSC, the national CERT, and other CERT/CSIRT­type workplaces. This task, managed by Military Intelligence, was evaluated as partially accom­ plished because of the postponing of the approval of necessary legislative changes required for the full­ fledged cyber defence of the Czech Republic, and its complete accomplishment has been postponed to 2022. Chart 31: Evaluation of the tasks from the Action Plan  for 2020 ANNEX 2: EVALUATION OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF  THE OBJECTIVES FROM THE NATIONAL RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR 2020 In the area of research and development, the NÚKIB released the National Research and Development Plan, aiming at identifying the key research topics for the develop ment of the security system of the Czech Republic. It includes the following topics: Priority research topics shall be incorporated  in  public  tenders  and  national  and  inter- national  research,  development  and  in- novation support programme calls. At the end of 2020, the NÚKIB started collecting information to draw up a list of research needs in order to submit them under the Programme for Security Research for State Purposes for 2022 – 2027. Under this objective, the NÚKIB supported the efforts of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic to strengthen research and development cooperation in cyber security and defence. EVALUATION: Considering the short­term hori­ zon, it cannot yet be evaluated whether the SUMMARY OF ANNEXES 0 20 40 60 76 8 1 ACCOMPLISHED/ BEING FULFILLED NOT ACCOMPLISHEDPARTIALLY ACCOMPLISHED/ BEING FULFILLED 19 The NCOC is the successor to the National Centre of Cyberspace Operations (NCCO). 1. 36Measures number of implemented projects has increased compared to 2019. Greater involvement of the user community  in the system of support for research, devel- opment and innovation (also referred to as  R&D&I) in cyber security, including enhanc- ing the capacity to deploy results in practice.  In 2020, the NÚKIB participated in two re­ search projects focused on security risk analy­ sis for fibre optic networks and strategic R&D for systems to secure modern communication networks using quantum key distribution and post­quantum cryptography. The NÚKIB has applied for membership in the TACR – BETA2 programme board. EVALUATION: Compared to 2012, the NÚKIB increased its involvement in R&D&I projects funded from national programmes, but it is not possible to assess the extent to which the NÚKIB contributes to putting the results of R&D into practice due to the short period of time. The NÚKIB as an information and analytical  foundation in R&D&I in cyber security. The ‘Research and New Technologies in Cyber and Information Security’ and ‘News in Cyber Security R&D’ newsletters on the NÚKIB web­ site are regularly updated. At the end of 2020, the NÚKIB prepared the summary report ‘Trends in Cyber and Information Security in the Czech Republic for 2020 – 2023’, which was sub­ mitted to partners in the security community. EVALUATION: The NÚKIB succeeded in starting a process for regularly updating its partners on the possibilities of financing research projects, news in R&D&I, and opportunities to partici­ pate in research consortia. Developed international cooperation. In 2020, the NÚKIB continued to support project con­ sortia under the Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programmes. The sup­ port included six projects in total. Furthermore, the NÚKIB encouraged the Czech Republic’s joining of the pan­European EuroQCI project aiming at building Europe­wide quantum communication infrastructure. EVALUATION: The accomplishment of this objective was significantly affected by the COVID­19 pandemic and hence was only partially accomplished. The low level of the NÚKIB’s involvement in international research projects is largely influenced by the lack of in­ house capacity. The Czech Republic actively participated in  joint R&D in cyber security at EU level. The NÚKIB participated the comments procedures for the new Horizon Europe and Digital Europe European agendas. Concerning the creation of the National Coordination Centre in the Czech Republic, the NÚKIB prepared national posi­ tions on the Proposal for a Regulation estab­ lishing the European Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. The NÚKIB actively participated in setting the parameters for the 2021 – 2027 programme period, namely for the IROP – the Cyber Security Call, Recovery Fund and ReactEU. The NÚKIB has taken the necessary steps in the area of the EU cyber security certifications to ensure the implementation of the Act on Cyber Security in the Czech legal system. EVALUATION: With respect to all activities, the NÚKIB considers the goal accomplished. 2. 3. 4. 5. Summary of Annexes 37Sources i FireEye. 2020. M­TRENDS. rpt -m-trends−2020 ii GCN. 2020.

It is needless to point out the many twists and  turns the Czech Republic and the whole world went  through that year. Yet I would still like to mention what  the global pandemic has meant for cyber security.  Last year showed us all that the limits of what can  be moved to cyberspace are far beyond what we  previously imagined. Moreover, the transition has  revealed how much we depend on information and  communication technologies.  IT and cyber security experts have been drawing atten­ tion to this dependency for many years. It was not until  last year, though, as the Internet became the only place  where many people could work, close deals, hold talks,  and keep in touch with loved ones, that we realised how  overwhelming this reliance truly was.  Let us see this situation as an opportunity. The virus  has helped us do what we had not been able to do  ourselves: it persuaded the majority of society that  cyber security, and the principles of proper conduct in  cyberspace per se, are of concern to all of us.  The following texts and statistics indicate that cyberspace  is not a safe place. No one can be unaware of the ran­ somware attacks that paralysed, among others, the Uni­ versity Hospital Brno during the onset of the pandemic,  causing hundreds of millions of crowns of damage. Our  statistics also show that the number of attacks has been  growing, and more and more institutions – take local  authorities as an example – have been falling victim to  such attacks.   The National Cyber and Information Security Agency  (hereinafter the ‘NÚKIB’) worked to give all possible  assistance to the affected entities and protect others  the attacks could also impact. Let me mention, inter alia,  a reactive measure for selected healthcare entities fol­ lowed by a warning issued for the same group of recipi­ ents. We also prepared many supporting materials that  anyone may use free of charge to secure their systems.  We drafted changes in legislation, effective since Jan­ uary this year, especially for the healthcare sector. As a  consequence, significantly more hospitals must meet   considerably stricter security requirements. At the same  time, they have the opportunity to use broader services  ranging from vulnerability scanning to penetration  testing and other activities we offer regulated entities  free of charge.  Furthermore, we have introduced several training  courses for both the public and employees of essen­ tial institutions. People are the weakest link in cyber  security, and they need to be aware of the risks looming  in cyberspace.  Other unequivocal successes include the approval of  two documents critical for developing the cyber security  of the Czech Republic and the NÚKIB itself. Had it not  been for them and the related collaboration, this 2020  Report on Cyber Security would not have seen the light  of day. Nor, most importantly, could cyber security in  the Czech Republic have been assured.  The first document is the National Cyber Security Strat­ egy, which establishes the direction of activities for the  agency and all subjects involved in cyber security assur­ ance in the Czech Republic for the following five years.  The other crucial document is the NÚKIB Development  Concept, which sets out how the institution will de­ velop going forward, the capacities we would like to  have in the future and, last but not least, how much  it will all cost. I am very pleased that the work on this  document has been completed. The NÚKIB is still a  new institution, and so a clear definition of its future  development is vital.   Regarding the international scene, I would like to em­ phasise the 2nd Prague 5G Security Conference held  under the auspices of the Czech Prime Minister and  attended by many important foreign guests.  The developments last year showed us how dangerous  cyberspace can be yet how important it is to all of us.  I would like to thank all the 222 entities in various fields  that filled in our questionnaires and thereby partici­ pated in preparing this 2020 Report on Cyber Security.  I firmly believe that the Report will raise cyber security  awareness and improve safety for everybody.  Ing. Karel Řehka  FOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NÚKIB    3Summary of the 2020 Report on Cyber Security  The year 2020 was marked by an increase in cyber- attacks against Czech institutions, organisations, and  companies across all sectors. Compared to 217 inci­ dents in 2019, a total of 468 incidents were reported  to the NÚKIB in 2020. Nearly one­third of the incidents  handled were reported by non­regulated entities. This  increase was very likely caused by both a higher number  of cyberattacks and greater awareness of the existence  and activities of the NÚKIB. The severity of the incidents  has also increased, which is evident from the attacks  against the University Hospital Brno and the Psychiatric  Hospital in Kosmonosy. The most frequent types of at­ tack in 2020 included spam, phishing, and scanning.  The most serious cyber threats in the Czech Republic  have long included cybercrime. In 2020, this was most  visible with ransomware attacks affecting the Czech  healthcare sector. The increase in attacks against hos­ pitals can largely be attributed to the ongoing pandemic  as well as cybercrime groups concentrating on specific  institutions where they see a higher chance that the  ransom will be paid. Yet three­quarters of healthcare  facilities consider the funds allocated to ensuring cyber  security insufficient.  In 2020, the NÚKIB, in cooperation with the Office of  the Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  organised the second two-day Prague 5G Security  Conference, the world’s premier forum for discussion  of the risks associated with the building of 5G infra­ structure. As last year, the conference was held under  the auspices of Andrej Babiš, the Prime Minister of the  Czech Republic. Despite the fact that the conference  was virtual for the first time due to the COVID­19 situ­ ation, more than 50 speakers from Europe, the USA,  South Korea, Israel, Australia, India, and other countries  spoke at it. The main outcome of this second confer­ ence was the presentation and launching of the so­ called Prague 5G Security Repository, a virtual library   intended for sharing legislative, strategic, and other  5G network security tools the countries adopted over  the past year.  In 2020, the NÚKIB continued the training of public  administration staff and trained more than 18‚209  civil servants, 214 employees of the Armed Forces of  the Czech Republic, and 2‚000 employees of Bulovka  Hospital  in the ‘Dávej kyber!’ [Get Cyber Skilled!]  e­learning course. Another 1,690 prevention officers  were trained in the professional ‘Bezpečně v kyber’ [Stay  Safe in Cyberspace] course, which presents school envi­ ronment situations to staff.  Many organisations questioned through the survey  said they faced a  lack of experts and  insufficient  cyber security budgets  in 2020. The situation was  more pronounced in the public sector than in private  undertakings. Almost none of the respondents had  all cyber security posts occupied. More than half the  organisations considered insufficient salaries to be the  main factor.  In response to events during the pandemic, the NÚKIB  issued several recommendations, warnings, and re- active measures. These included, for example, warn­ ings about the risks associated with online conference  services, Safe Remote Working recommendations, the  Secure Videoconferencing manual, and the Minimum  Safety Standard document for securing smaller organ­ isations prepared in cooperation with NAKIT.  Despite the pandemic measures, Cyber Coalition – the  international cyber defence exercise organised by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation – took place  in 2020, for the first time in virtual form. The Czech  Republic thus again contributed as much as possible to  one of the largest international cyber defence exercises.

The questions covered a broad range of topics such  as cyber attacks, cyber security costs, cyber security  staff, users, technolo gies, and implemented processes.  The questionnaire was filled in by 222 entities, including  63 public sector institutions, 24 financial institutions,  77 healthcare facilities, 14 organisations providing digital  services, 12 energy sector entities, 12 industrial enti­ ties, and 20 educational institutions. The NÚKIB drew  information from these materials for the 2020 Report  on Cyber Security in the Czech Republic (hereinafter the  ‘2020 RCS’). All data obtained from the questionnaires  were anonymised.  EVALUATION PROCESS  The assessment of cyber security in the Czech Republic  is based on an analytical process consisting of the eval­ uation of the data from the filled questionnaires, the  findings of the NÚKIB, information provided by partners,  and other available information from verified sources.  The NÚKIB did not have the opportunity to check the  data provided by the respondents or to verify the claims.  The analytical conclusions contained in the report are  based on the premise that the answers in the question­ naires were not distorted. The analytical assessment is  described using probability expressions (see below).  The 2020 Report on Cyber Security in the Czech Republic  does not provide an exhaustive list of cyber security  activities. The goal of the document is to describe and  assess the threats in cyberspace the Czech Republic  faced in 2020, as well as actions taken to mitigate them.

On the other hand, in only a few  cases did the respondents face sniffing (internal net­ work scann ing) or illegal cryptocurrency mining. The  most serious attacks according to the respondents  were ransomware, DoS/DDoS attacks, spear­phishing  e­mails, and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities (Chart 2).  Although more than half the respondents claimed they  had detected at least one cyberattack attempt, such at­ tempts did not lead to cyber security incidents in almost  three­quarters of the cases, meaning the confidentiality,  integrity or availability of information or services was  not breached (Chart 3).3 The largest number of inci­ dents were detected by public sphere institutions and  healthcare facilities.  Chart 1: Most frequent types of cyberattacks in 2020  (% of respondents)  However, the fact that such a significant number of  institutions did not detect a cyber security incident or   an attack attempt does not mean that no cyber incidents  occurred in their networks. The ability to detect attacks  targeted at data integrity and confidentiality particu­ larly require capacities based on advanced detection  technologies and sufficiently trained staff. On the other  hand, detecting attacks such as spam, phishing or scam  e­mails is significantly easier.

By contrast, the proportion of the  budget spent on cyber security was comparable to 2019  and ranged between 0% and 5% of the organisation’s  total budget for most respondents (Chart 5). More  than half the organisations considered the amount  insufficient (Chart 6).

(%)  people – experts: experienced workers stay but  newcomers are discouraged by the financial  conditions  68% of the organisations participating in the question­ naire survey stated that low salaries discouraged new  workers from cyber security jobs during the hiring pro­ cess, particularly in the public sphere and healthcare.  The lack of cyber security experts is a global issue. The  increased demand for them means that private sector  organisations are better equipped to pay higher salaries  for these experts (Chart 7). In more than half the organ­ isations, cyber security is ensured by workers with rele­ vant work experience of 5 to 15 years or more (Chart 8).  According to the respondents, cyber security architect  and SIEM4 surveillance roles or services are the most  difficult to fill in the cyber security sphere. One positive  thing is that once a post is filled, the turnover of cyber  security workers the organisations have to face is low.  Only 10% of the respondents reported the departure  of one or two employees, the main reason being other  than the amount of remuneration in 74% of the cases.

Most  often, the companies try to compensate for workforce  shortages by outsourcing and by offering benefits in the  form of further training or participation in interesting  projects to attract new people (Chart 9).

Although half the respondents do  not specifically allocate funds to training, training took  place once a year or more often in more than 50% of the  companies (Chart 10). Three­quarters of such training  took the form of e­learning or internal training using  the company’s own staff. Half the organisations also  focused on other ways to improve their staff’s resilience  against cyberattacks. Nearly a quarter of them tested  their users through simulated phishing campaigns or  penetration testing (Chart 11 ).

The questionnaire survey  showed that 68% of the respondents do not use multi­  factor verification despite the fact that it significantly  improves digital platform security and that the misuse  of a stolen account can result in reputational damages  to the attacked institution. As many as 86% of the  respondents have not established procedures to deal  with the potential theft of accounts on social networks  (Chart 12).

(%)  NO 86%  YES 14%    13Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB  CYBER INCIDENTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NÚKIB  In 2020, the NÚKIB received 468 notifications of cyber  security  incidents, 99 of which it directly handled  (Chart 13). The remaining incidents either did not re­ quire any intervention from the NÚKIB, or another  relevant institution handled them. Nearly one­third  of the handled incidents were reported by non­ regulated entities, which represents nearly a tenfold  increase compared to 2019. This increase is highly likely  (75% – 85% probability) caused by the higher number  of cyberattacks as well as improved awareness of the  existence and activities of the NÚKIB.  Chart 13: Trend in the number of cyber security inci- dents handled by the NÚKIB in 2017–2020: In 2020,  the NÚKIB handled more incidents than in any of  the past four years; we anticipate a further increase  in 2021  During 2020, the majority of the cyber incidents  handled by the NÚKIB were in public administration  (Chart 14). The second most frequently addressed  sector was healthcare, where the number grew by  267% year on year. The number of handled incidents  reported by municipalities also increased significantly  in comparison with 2019. These increases are in line  with global trends.ii  Chart 14: Trend in the number of cyber incidents in  2019 and 2020 by sector  0  20  40  60  80  50 54  78  99   2020201920182017  0 20 40  2  0   5  0   7  0   7  5   3  3   11  1   5  2   6  2   6  16   51  43   4  1   CIVIL ENGINEERING  OTHER  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  EDUCATION  DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  ENERGY SECTOR  TRANSPORT  HEALTHCARE  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  20202019  MUNICIPALITIES  REGION  267 % a year-on-year increase in cyber security   incidents in healthcare    14Cyber Security in 2020 from the Perspective of Czech Institutions, Organisations, and Companies  The most serious major incident handled by the NÚKIB  was the encrypting of the University Hospital Brno  systems using ransomware in March 2020.iii The incident  led to significant limitations on the hospital’s operation  at three localities and caused damage in the millions of  crowns.iv The Psychiatric Hospital in Kosmonosy became  a ransomware victim in the same month.v In that case,  mainly the administrative infrastructure of the hospital  was paralyzed but its ability to provide healthcare was  not compromised, nor were any systems on which  human lives depend affected.vi  The third major incident5 of 2020 was the compromising  of several dozen e­mail accounts of a strategic gov­ ernment institution, which occurred as a result of a  successful spear­phishing campaign. Besides a breach  of confidentiality of the content of the mailboxes, the  compromise also caused the e­mail services to be un­ available for a day or two.  More than one­third of the incidents handled by the  NÚKIB were caused by malicious code, nearly half of  which through ransomware. Another almost one­third  of incidents resulted in limited availability of services,  systems or web portals, half of which were caused by  DDoS attacks.  5  The incident severity  assessment is based on Decree No  82/2018  CYBER INCIDENTS IN 2020 BY INCIDENT TYPE  The descriptions of the categories are based on the  options in the incident reporting forms:  MALICIOUS CODE (e.g. viruses, worms,  Trojan horses, dialers, or spyware)  AVAILABILITY (e.g. disruption of  availability caused by a DoS/DDoS attack  or sabotage)  PENETRATION (e.g. successful  compromising of an application or a  user account)  FRAUD/PHISHING (e.g. e-mail with a  malicious attachment or link)  PENETRATION ATTEMPT (e.g. attempt  to exploit a vulnerability, compromised  asset, zero day attack)  INFORMATION GATHERING   (e.g. scanning, sniffing, or social  engineering)  ABUSIVE CONTENT (e.g. spam,  cyberbullying, inappropriate content)  ADMINISTRATIVE/TECHNICAL  (a security incident caused by  administrative or technical fault)  Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB  37  26  16  7  7  3  1  2  5 The incident severity assessment is based on Decree No 82/2018    15Threat Actors in Cyberspace  The activities of state-sponsored actors in cyberspace  and cybercrime have long been the most serious  threats to the cyber security of the Czech Republic.  The trend in recent years has indicated that the activ- ities of state actors and advanced cyber threat actors  have begun to overlap.vii  The evolution of cybercrime activities is best demon­ strated by the development of ransomware attacks.  In 2020, the healthcare sector was the most affected.viii  The activities of cybercrime groups in the Czech Republic  were mainly visible during the ransomware attacks at  the University Hospital Brno and the Psychiatric Hospital  in Kosmonosy. Whereas previously extortion attacks  were a non­targeted low­cost activity aimed at quick  profits, the trend in ransomware activities in recent  years has been characterised by a targeting of specific  institutions rather than a random mass of individual  users.ix Ransomware operators preselect the institutions  they consider most likely to pay a ransom. If they suc­ ceed in penetrating their systems, they do not encrypt  the files immediately. Instead, they investigate the at­ tacked system and specific data are only encrypted once  their potential value for the victim has been assessed.x   Some cybercrime groups, similarly to state actors,  thus have a long-term unnoticed presence (persis- tence). The expansion of Ransomware as a Service6 is  partly responsible for this development.  The activities of state actors are extensive: from ob­ taining large quantities of personal data to industrial  and strategic espionage, which also takes place in the  Czech Republic. In 2020, the NÚKIB cooperated in the  handling of an incident that involved a breach of data  confidentiality in the networks of a strategic govern- ment institution. The NÚKIB analysis of compromising  indicators discovered that the attacker was almost cer­ tainly a state actor (90% – 100% probability). The trends   in espionage indicate that some states are highly likely    (75% – 85% probability) to employ cybercrime groups  for espionage purposes and other state-required activ- ities more and more often in exchange for toleration  of their criminal activities.  The statistics of the Police of the Czech Republic  (Chart 15) show that, contrary to their previous increas­ ing trend, cybercrime and crimes committed on the  Internet have remained at a constant level over the last  two years. The number of cases investigated dropped  by 4.1% between 2019 and 2020. The reason is an  amendment to the Criminal Code,7 which increased  the amount of damage that has to be caused for clas­ sification as a crime. Considering the long­term trend,  a further increase in cybercrime in the Czech Republic  in the coming years is likely (55% – 70% probability).  Chart 15: Cybercrime cases investigated in the Czech  Republic between 2011 and 2020  (source: Police of  the Czech Republic)  THREAT ACTORS IN CYBERSPACE  6 Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) denotes a service provided by ransomware developers to other hackers, usually for a share of the ransom; the ransomware  developers do not take part in the actual penetration of organisations’ systems. 7 Act No 333/2020, amending Act No 40/2009, the Criminal Code, as amended, Act No 141/1961, on criminal procedure (the Criminal Procedure Code),   as amended, and some other laws.  2 000  4 000  6 000  8 000  0  1 502  2 195  3 108  4 348  5 023 5 344  6 815  8 4178 073  5 654  2020201920182017201620152014201320122011    16Cyber Threats  RANSOMWARE: A CONTINUING INCREASING  TREND IN SOPHISTICATED EXTORTION ATTACKS  In a global perspective, the number of targeted extor- tion attacks grew significantly in 2020 to the detriment  of large­scale ransomware campaigns. Extortion  malware received maximum attention in the Czech  Republic in March 2020, when the networks of the  University Hospital Brno and the Psychiatric Hospital in  Kosmonosy were encrypted (for details, see the chapter  Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of the NÚKIB).  The state enterprise Povodí Vltavy and the Prague 3  district town hall were attacked a month later. Although  they occurred on the very same day, no link has been  identified between the two attacks.  During the attack on Povodí Vltavy, which falls under  the Ministry of Agriculture, critical information infra­ structure elements were not compromised so the  operation of dams and drinking water supplies was  not interrupted.xi The attack on the Prague 3 town hall  temporarily put the operation of the CzechPoint system  in its territory out of service and caused its website  and several other systems to fail.xii Apart from those  incidents, the NÚKIB most frequently participated in  dealing with the impacts of ransomware attacks in the  public sector, particularly at the local and regional  authorities, healthcare, industry, digital services, and  education levels. Both the number of extortion attacks  handled by the NÚKIB and other verified sources  indicate that the Czech Republic was also affected  by the globally rising trend in ransomware attacks  in 2020.  28% of the respondents faced a ransomware attack  or an attack attempt in 2020. Just under one­fifth of  the organisations which encountered a ransomware  attack or an attack attempt classified it as the most  serious, serious or moderate type of attack (Chart 16).  This is a relatively low number of respondents, which  might be caused by the fact that two­thirds of the or­ ganisations did not detect any ransomware attacks but  more frequently faced other types of attacks, which   they subsequently considered more serious. Compared  to the global boom of extortion attacks, the lower de­ tection frequency in the Czech Republic might be due  to the focus of ransomware operators on Western  Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The chances of  getting the ransom paid are higher in those areas, inter  alia because organisations can benefit from insurance  against extortion attacks in most countries, while on  the contrary, in the Czech Republic many insurance  companies exclude compensation for damage caused  by ransomware attacks in their terms and conditions  and also reject ransom payments for ethical reasons.  Chart 16: Percentage of respondents who classified  ransomware  attacks  as  most  serious  in  2019  and  2020 (%)  Nevertheless, institutions important for the smooth  functioning of the State, such as state institutions,  hospitals and energy, industrial and telecommuni- cation companies, are also the targets of attackers.  Attackers are highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to  continue to concentrate on them because of the high- er chances of getting the ransom paid.  Besides more targeted ransomware attacks, the global  trend of sensitive data theft and then repeated extortion   2020 6%  2019 10%  CYBER THREATS  28% of the respondents said they had detected a  ransomware attack or attack attempt in 2020    17Cyber Threats  by threatening to make them public (so­called double  extortion) continued in 2020. According to information  available to the NÚKIB, no Czech institution fell victim  to such an attack in 2020. However, considering the  global trend, there is a realistic possibility (25% – 50%  probability) that the Czech Republic will be affected by  this trend in the future.  Although a ransomware attack can have a serious  impact on the operation of an institution, the NÚKIB  recommends that attacked entities do not pay for the  decryption of their data. There is no guarantee that the  attacker will really do what they promise. Moreover,  obtaining the money is just motivation for the attacker  to attack the same institution again. In order for at­ tacked organisations to avoid the need to consider this  option, it is highly desirable to keep networks segmented,  keep the operating system and applications updated, and  create offline backups of at least the critical systems nec­ essary for the operation of the institution. The answers  from the respondents indicate that 56% of them create  such offline backups and have implemented testing pro­ cedures, 33% of them have offline backups but do not  test their recoverability, and 7% of the respondents do  not create offline backups at all.  With respect to the severity and topicality of the  ransomware issue, the NÚKIB issued an analysis  in 2020 summarising the basic information about  this type of attack, describing the fundamental  vulnerabilities, and providing recommendations  on how to defend against similar attacks.  The analysis is available on the NÚKIB’s website:   www.nukib.cz/cs/infoservis/aktuality   The supporting material Recommendations for  mitigation, prevention and response, on which the  NÚKIB cooperated with AFCEA and NAKIT, is available  on the website at www.nukib.cz/download/ publikace/podpurne_materialy  RANSOMWARE, DDOS ATTACKS AND   SPEAR-PHISHING: THE THREE MOST SERIOUS  THREATS OF 2020  According to organisations, the most severe threats of  2020 included ransomware and DDoS attacks (Chart 17).  Almost one­third of the respondents from the health­ care sector and 25% of the respondents from the  financial and public sectors considered ransomware  to be the most serious form of attack. The third most  serious threat was spear­phishing. In the past, potential   phishing attacks were relatively easy to detect thanks to  the poor command of the Czech language and different  domains in the e­mails. In recent years, however, there  has been a trend towards higher sophistication of such  attacks: they use better e­mail formats and an extensive  portfolio of justifications, ranging from calls for invoice  payments to the recovery of account access data.  In 2020, the NÚKIB participated in dealing with the  impacts of phishing campaigns as well as more tar- geted spear-phishing campaigns, most often against  obliged entities in the public sector and, less often,  the healthcare sector. Attackers most often succeeded  in persuading their victims to open a file attached to an  e­mail with a notification to pay an invoice. By opening  the file, the user enabled macros that then caused infec­ tion with different malware.  THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NÚKIB  FOR DEFEND AGAINST SPEAR-PHISHING  ATTACKS INCLUDES:  Do not allow macros in MS Office documents.  Do not automatically open attachments and  links in e-mails.  Check e-mail addresses in the case of urgent or  unusual requirements.  In the event of doubt or suspicion, contact the  sender via another channel, then contact your  IT department.  Limit sharing information about job on social  networks.

This is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) caused by  the low occurrence of this type of attack in the Czech  Republic or the difficultly for the organisations to  detect it. More than half the respondents perceive  the threat of cyberattacks through the supply chain as  low; moreover, there has been a year on year decrease  in the seriousness of this threat as perceived by the  respondents (Chart 18).  Chart 18: How high was the threat of cyberattacks  from a provider of services, software, or hardware  in 2019 and 2020 according to the organisations?  (% of respondents)  In contrast to the increasingly weak perception of  the threat of cyberattacks on the supply chain in the  Czech Republic, a massive attack on SolarWinds, an  American software company, was detected at the end  of 2020. Although the total damage is not known yet,  the estimates are that there are tens of thousands of  compromised8 clients throughout the world.xiii Supply  chains enable attackers to extend their attack surface  in cyberspace and thus gain access to many times more  sensitive data of both organisations and individuals.  The SolarWinds supply chain attack was carried out by  infecting the Orion platform provided by the company  with the Sunburst backdoor,9 which allowed the attack­ ers to penetrate the systems of the target companies.  Those included, for example, the cyber security com­ pany FireEye, the United States Departments of Treasury,  Defense, and State, as well as Microsoft, Fujitsu, and  Lukoil.xiv In light of the seriousness of the situation,  the NÚKIB issued a reactive measure, although no  case of compromise has been reported from bodies  regulated under the ACS so far.  REACTIVE MEASURE IN RELATION TO SOLARWINDS  ORION PLATFORM APPLICATIONS   The last reactive measure of 2020 was focused on  the risks associated with software from the American  company SolarWinds. System administrators of critical  information infrastructures, important information  systems, and essential service systems immediately  had to perform security updates, check whether  their system had been compromised, and perform  security audits.  The whole wording of the reactive measure is  available on the NÚKIB’s website at  www.nukib.cz/cs/uredni-deska  As many as 72% of the respondents most often manage  the risks associated with suppliers at contractual rela­ tionship level, which is just one of the basic measures.10  Almost three­quarters of them only grant their suppliers  unrestricted remote access following the consent of  the organisation’s responsible person, whereas 8% of  them do not grant any remote access at all (Chart 19).

At the same time,  users only have authorised access to services that are explicitly assigned to them, and everything else is blocked. The Zero Trust Security concept can be used to  mitigate supplier­associated risks as well as to secure connections and networks for remote working.  https://www.nukib.cz/cs/uredni-deska/   19Cyber Threats  the most frequent findings of the NÚKIB’s control activi­ ties, which include insufficient management of supplier­  associated risks. Apart from risk management, there is  an obvious trend in authorities awarding public con­ tracts using not only quantitative criteria, such as price,  but also qualitative criteria. In 2020, the latter were  used in public procurement by 61% of the respondents,  mainly from the energy and public sectors (Chart 20).

Attacks on CII that  were handled with the participation of the NÚKIB mainly  occurred through DDoS attacks or attempts, while the  second most frequent type of attack was phishing  or spear­phishing e­mails (Chart 21). Again, the fact  that no sophisticated attacks were detected by CII  entities does not confirm that they are not occurring  as their detection strongly depends on the technical,  procedural and personal capacities of the responsible  entities. Similarly to last year, nearly half the detected  cyber security incidents resulted in limitations in service  availability which, with CII entities, is one of the essential  criteria for ensuring the smooth operation of the State  and society. Mainly state administration institutions  faced security incidents in relation to CII.  As in 2019, one­third of the respondents categorised  under CII managed to deal with the most serious  attack of 2020 within several hours. In 5% of cases, the  respondents were still dealing with the consequences  a year later. Up to 96% of critical infrastructure  organisations believe that their cyber security has  improved compared to previous years (Chart 22). The  NÚKIB cannot confirm this trend from information  available to it. Furthermore, there is a realistic possibility  (25% – 50% probability) that the answers to the question  were significantly affected by the positive perception  of some sub­measures adopted by many of those   organisations even though these do not necessarily  mean that the cyber security of the CII entities has  objectively improved.  Pursuant to the ACS, critical information  infrastructure (CII) consists of communication and  information systems of critical infrastructure (CI)  elements. Pursuant to Act No 240/2004, on crisis  management and on amendments to certain other  laws (the Crisis Act), CI is defined as an element or  system of elements whose compromise would have  a serious impact on national security, the provision  of the basic living needs of the population, and  ensuring the health of people or the economy  of the State.  Typical CI elements include power plants, dams,  airports, and telecommunication networks, as  well as strategic financial institutions and State  authorities. The elimination of any of these  elements can paralyze the provision of critical  services (energy, heat, water supplies or pension  payments) or, in extreme cases (such as cyber  sabotage), cause physical damage.

The respondents’ answers show that  the increase in the number of attacks targeted at state  administration and local and regional authorities corre­ sponds with the data available to the NÚKIB (for details,  see the chapter Cyber Incidents from the Perspective of  the NÚKIB). Whereas in 2019 public sector employees  most frequently encountered spam, phishing, and scam  e­mails, in 2020 the institutions recorded an increase  in attacks taking the form of scanning of their external  networks (Chart 23). As for the severity, one­third of the  respondents from the public sector and another four  sectors ranked DoS/DDoS attacks highest (Chart 24).  This is likely (55% – 70% probability) due to the more  frequent detection of this type of attack in comparison  with other cyber threats. Ransomware placed second in  the assessment of the severity of threats in the public  sector, with one­third of the healthcare respondents  considering it the most serious threat of 2020.  Chart 23: Most frequent attacks or attempts against re- spondents from the public sector in 2019 and 2020 (%)  Chart 24: Most serious attacks or attempts against re- spondents from the public sector in 2019 and 2020 (%)  Similarly to last year, organisations again reported a  trend of increasingly sophisticated attacks through  phishing, spear-phishing, and scam e-mails using the  pandemic or fraudulent information about parcel deliv­ eries or overdue invoices as bait. Attackers continue to  demonstrate better knowledge of both the environment  and the Czech language, making it more difficult to  detect them.  With public sector institutions, the noticeable problem  with hiring and paying cyber security experts persisted  in 2020. Besides this, cyber security budgets decreased  in almost half the respondents from the public sector.  Nearly 80% of them claimed that salaries are the main  reason for the unoccupied cyber security positions  (Chart 25). Despite the situation, more than half the  respondents are not planning any budget increases for  the coming year. The combination of these two factors  could have a very negative effect on cyber security in  the years to come.  2020  2019  0  20  0  20  33%  25%  17% 17%  14% 13% 11%  5%  MALICIOUS CODE PHISHING SPEAR- -PHISHING  RANSOM- WARE  DOS/DDOS  ATTACKS  RANSOM- WARE  ATTEMPT AT  EXPLOITING   VULNERABILITY  SPEAR- PHISHING  CERTAINLY YES 63%  RATHER YES 33%  RATHER NO 4%  0  20  40  60 52%  60%  14% 17%  23%  5% 11%  5%  13%  0%  PHISHING SCAM E-MAIL OTHERSCANNINGSPAM  2019 2020    22Targets of Cyberattacks  Chart 25: Were salaries the crucial factor discouraging  cyber security job applicants in the public sector in  2020? (%)  REGULATION OF THE USE OF CLOUD  COMPUTING  The amendment to the Act on Public  Administration Information Systems effective  from August 2020 introducing new rules for the  authentication of cloud computing providers and  services used by public authorities represents an  important advance in cyber security in the public  sector. During 2021, the amendment will be further  amended and completed with security rules  through implementing legislation the NÚKIB is  preparing in the form of decrees.  FINANCIAL SECTOR: THE HIGHEST BUDGETS AND  THE ABSENCE OF SERIOUS ATTACKS  Three­quarters of the respondents from the financial  sector faced cyberattack attempts in 2020. The attacks  resulted in cyber incidents in only less than one­third  of the cases. Although financial institutions identified  targeted phishing, DDoS attacks and ransomware as  the most serious cyber incidents, similarly to the year  before there was an absence of more severe incidents  so the Czech financial sector can be described as rela- tively well secured. Banks and insurance companies try  not to underestimate cyber security as any compromis­ ing of their information systems could have far­reaching  financial and reputational consequences.  Financial institutions invest the highest percentage of  their budgets in cyber security of all sectors (Chart 26)  and were the only ones to state that salaries were  not a fundamental factor discouraging cyber security  job applicants. More than half the respondents from   the financial sector did not decrease their budgets on  cyber security in comparison with 2019. On the contrary,  more than a quarter of them increased their budgets.  Apart from cyber security experts, all financial institu­ tions also invest in employee training. Some organisa­ tions stated that, besides using standard methods of  testing, they also planned to implement an internal  Red Team.11  Clients of financial institutions faced vishing  (a portmanteau of voice and phishing) attacks  in 2020 by which attackers tried to steal money  from them. Some of the affected banks issued  warnings about these vishing campaigns in which  they described how such attacks are carried out.xv  Most often, the attackers called clients by phone,  saying that their account had been attacked and  recommending transferring their funds to another  specific account to secure them. In some cases,  they directly requested access details, including  the login codes received via SMS.  Vishing campaigns are also increasing in number  abroad. In 2020, American security services issued  a warning about the higher frequency of this  method in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.xvi  Chart 26: What percentage of the total budgets of  financial sector organisations was allocated to cyber  security in 2020? (%)  0 20 40 60  32% 21%  79% 68%  NO  YES  Public sector Average of all sectors  11 A Red Team is a team of ethical hackers who simulate attacks using the same sophisticated means as real attackers.

As last year, financial  institutions had the highest investments in cyber secu­ rity of all the organisations questioned.  INDUSTRY & ENERGY: MORE ATTACKS BUT  LOW IMPACTS  During 2020, the industry and energy sectors encoun- tered more attacks and attempts than the average in  other sectors (Chart 27). Only 4% of these resulted in  cyber incidents, the impacts of which the institutions  handled immediately (in almost half the cases) or with­ in several hours. As many as 90% of the respondents  consider the cyber security of their organisations fully  or rather sufficient, compared to the average of 70%  for all sectors.  As many as 92% of organisations in the energy sector  and 58% of institutions in industry have cyber incidents  incorporated in their crisis communication directive,  compared to only half of organisations on average in  the other monitored sectors. Although a quarter of the  organisations classified supply chain attacks as serious,  half the respondents stated that they were the least  frequent. Even so, two­thirds of them perceive the  threat of supply chain attacks on their institutions as  moderate or high.  Chart 27: How many cyberattack attempts did organ- isations from industry and the energy sector detect  in 2020? (%)   More than half the organisations plan to increase their  cyber security budgets in the coming year, despite  the fact that 54% of the respondents consider their  organisation’s cyber security investments to be suf- ficient. At the same time, 67% of the respondents from  the energy sector stated that they had sufficient legal  expertise in cyber security, which is considerably above  the all­sector average.  As for setting up processes, 92% of organisations in both  sectors create offline backups of their critical systems  and test them, and nearly half the respondents from  both sectors have implemented BCM processes, com­ pared to the all­sector average of 23%.  HEALTHCARE: A TEMPTING RANSOMWARE  ATTACK TARGET  Czech  hospitals  and  other  healthcare  facilities  were a very attractive ransomware attack target in  2020. The focusing on such institutions can largely  be attributed to the ongoing COVID­19 pandemic,  which is putting high pressure on healthcare provision.  Consequently, the chances of the attackers being paid  the required ransom are higher. In 2020, the NÚKIB  participated in dealing with nearly 20 security incidents  in the healthcare sector, most often associated with  phishing, ransomware attacks, and the exploitation of  vulnerabilities in systems. The most significant cases  handled were those of the University Hospital Brno  and the Psychiatric Hospital Kosmonosy (for more  details, see the chapter Cyber Security Incidents from  the Perspective of the NÚKIB).  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EXPRESSED  CONCERN ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON THE CZECH  HEALTHCARE SECTOR  In the first half of the year, Czech hospitals were  exposed to a high cyberattack threat. Among  others, Michael Pompeo, the then United States  Secretary of State, expressed his support for the  Czech Republic in combating the pandemic as well  as ensuring cyber security, stating that the USA was  concerned about the situation and that anybody  participating in such activity had to be ready  to bear the consequences of their actions. He also  called upon ‘the actors in question to refrain from  carrying out disruptive malicious cyber activity  against the Czech Republic’s healthcare system  or similar infrastructure elsewhere’.xvii  Industry & Energy Average of all sectors  0  20  40  31%  25%  48%  39%  13%  8% 4%  8% 4%  20%  0 1–10 11–20 21–30 OTHER    24Targets of Cyberattacks  Nearly 90% of the respondents from the healthcare  sector believe that the level of cyber security in their  organisations has improved. Nevertheless, the NÚKIB’s  activities in several healthcare facilities in 2020 indicate  that the overall level of cyber security is still insuffi­ cient. Similarly to previous years, three-quarters of  the respondents consider the funding allocated to  cyber security to be deficient. In 2019, almost half the  healthcare organisations questioned would increase  their cyber security budgets by more than 100%, com­ pared to only one­third speaking in favour of an increase  of 50% in 2020.  As in previous years, salaries have remained the crucial  factor discouraging cyber security job applicants for  almost three­quarters of the respondents. Compared to  last year, there has been some positive development  as the percentage of unoccupied posts has decreased  in almost all categories (Chart 28). It can be concluded  from the respondents’ answers that cyber security has  come to the forefront of the budget priorities, but in  most cases the respondents could only increase their  budgets thanks to the 10th Call of the EU’s Integrated  Regional Operational Programme for Cyber Security.  Chart 28: Unoccupied cyber security jobs in hospitals  in 2019 and 2020 (% of respondents)  THE AMENDMENT TO THE DECREE ON  PROVIDERS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN  HEALTHCARE  In reaction to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and  the cyberattacks on the Czech hospitals, the Decree  on Providers of Essential Services was amended last  year in relation to the healthcare sector. The goal  of the amendment was to include a greater  number of hospitals among the essential service  operators and to ensure their better regional  distribution in order to ensure nationwide coverage.  The amendment takes account of the specifics  of some health services as well as of the capacity  of health service providers whose substitutability in  the case of outage due to a cyber incident would be  difficult, and ensures connection to the integrated  rescue and emergency system. The amendment  took effect from 1 January 2021 and supposes that,  based on the new criteria, about 30 additional  hospitals should be regulated in 2021 on top of the  original number of 16 most important hospitals.  The complete wording of the amended Decree is  available at aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu  EDUCATION: INCREASING CYBERATTACKS  Czech academic institutions have become the tar- gets of ransomware attacks more and more often.  Throughout 2020, universities and colleges repeatedly  warned against harmful practices in cyberspace targeted  at their institutions. Prague University of Economics  and Business faced a ransomware attack,xviii Masaryk  University in Brno detected new malware aimed at its  users via a targeted phishing campaignxix, and Palacký  University Olomouc detected a previously unknown  form of ransomware that encrypted all data upon a  computer restart.xx The increase in attacks against  Czech educational institutions mimics the global trend.  As in the previous year, the most serious cyberat­ tacks in absolute figures according to the educational  institutions were phishing campaigns – from simple,  widespread ransom e­mails to sophisticated and spe­ cifically targeted scam e­mails, in which the attackers  pre tended to be employees of the university. One­fifth  of the respondents ranked ransomware second of the  most serious threats.  One way in which the institutions can diminish the  threat of a successful phishing attack is by training their  employees in cyber security.

More details are available in the NÚKIB  supporting materials, such as the Guidebook to IIS  identification on the NÚKIB website: www.nukib.cz/cs/infoservis/ dokumenty-a-publikace/podpurne-materialy  DIGITAL SERVICES: SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND  LEGAL EXPERTISE  The crisis management processes of the majority of  Czech institutions that provide digital services (tele­ communications, digital infrastructure, internet ser­ vices, etc.) include cyber incident response scenarios.  In 2020, almost half the respondents dealt with one to  five cyber incidents (Chart 30), of which DoS/DDoS at­ tacks were perceived as the most serious by one­fifth  of the organisations.  Exactly half the respondents do not grant their sup­ plier any remote access into their networks, whereas  the other half grant them restricted access following  the user’s consent. This is presumably why 57% of the  respondents perceived the threat of supply chain cyber­ attacks as low or very low.  In 2020, one-third of the institutions from the digital  services sector spent from 5% to more than 15% of  their total budget on cyber security, which is only  comparable to the financial sector. Less than three­ quarters of the respondents consider the amount  sufficient, whereas one­third plan to increase the cyber  security budget next year, which corresponds to the  average of respondents’ answers across the sectors.  Digital service institutions, as well as industry and the  energy sector, have legal expertise at a level higher than  the average of all respondents.

In the context of the re­ active measure, a recommendation was issued  and sent by the NÚKIB to the backbone hospitals  appointed by the Ministry of Health.  JULY issuing of the document minimum  safety standards for securing  small-scale organisations  In cooperation with NAKIT and the Ministry of the  Interior of the Czech Republic, the NÚKIB prepared  a document whose goal was to assist organisations  that do not fall under the ACS – typically local  authorities, healthcare facilities, schools, and private  companies – with their cyber security.  secure video conferencing handbook   This handbook issued in cooperation with NAKIT  contains essential safety recommendations and tips  for secure video conferencing.  OCTOBER notification about scam e-mails disguised  as the results of covid-1� tests  The NÚKIB highlighted the threat of scam e­mails, in  which unknown attackers sent false test results with  a link to download malicious code. The code would  then enable the attackers to access the e­mail recip­ ient’s device.  MAY recommendations regarding safe  remote working  Tips and recommendations for safe remote working  for both companies and employees in the form of a  short leaflet published by the NÚKIB in cooperation  with other partners.  APRIL warning against threats of cyberattacks  on hospitals and other significant targets  in the czech republic  A month after the issuing of the reactive measure,  the NÚKIB issued a warning against a cyber threat  consisting of the implementation of an extensive  campaign of severe cyberattacks on information and  communication systems in the Czech Republic, and  on systems in healthcare facilities in particular. The  NÚKIB completed the warning with a recommenda­ tion focusing on technical and organisational issues  and specified the procedures defined in the warning.  notification about the risks of online  conference services  Taking into account the increased need for on­ line communication, the NÚKIB pointed out the  risks associated with the use of audio and video  communication services, and drew particular  attention to vulnerabilities in the Zoom service,  which became a frequent target of attacks.

The document describes the main principles of  cyber security in the Czech Republic, defines its strategic  direction in cyber security, and describes the fundamen­ tal visions in this increasingly important area.  The document is divided into three main pillars, each  to be fulfilled through strategic goals.  IN CYBERSPACE WITH CONFIDENCE: Since the  risk to the Czech Republic from cyberspace  has been increasing over recent years, the  Czech Republic must react to a whole range  of new challenges. The Czech Republic should  strengthen its prosperity through a confident  and responsible approach to cyber security at  national level. It will thus also remain a strong  ally for its partners at international level.  STRONG AND RELIABLE ALLIANCES: The flag­ ship vision for the Czech Republic as a modern  European country is an active role in creat­ ing international dialogue, and in the Euro­ Atlantic area in particular. The Czech Republic  will proceed from coherent national positions  and clearly defined strategic interests. On this  basis, it will continue to create and deepen  strong alliances with its partners in cyber secu­ rity and defence.  RESILIENT SOCIETY 4.0: The Czech Republic  is among European leaders in spreading and  using modern technologies. As a result, Czech  society is successfully transforming into an in­ formation society. This trend, however, is bring­ ing with it not only an increase in the number of  end­users in Czech society but also threats to  which those users are exposed. The problems  associated with this include insufficient digital  hygiene, insufficient media literacy, and critical  thinking across society. Therefore, the Czech  Republic must concentrate on successfully  transforming Czech society into the so­called  Society 4.0. This is the state where the entire   society is able to fully exploit the benefits of  modern technologies and, at the same time, in­ tegrate them into their everyday lives in such a  way that the security risks are minimized. Cyber  security must thus become an integral part of  the everyday lives of citizens.  The National Cyber Security Strategy of the Czech  Republic is detailed in specific tasks within the Action  Plan. Both documents were prepared in cooperation  with the relevant entities responsible for the essential  areas of cyber security for the accomplishment of the  individual tasks. The NÚKIB will continually monitor,  discuss, assess and coordinate the fulfilment of the  individual goals.  The National Cyber Security Strategy is available  on the NÚKIB’s website: https://www.nukib.cz/cs/ kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/  The NÚKIB Development Concept was also  approved in 2020. It describes the complete range  of activities that the NÚKIB currently ensures,  evaluates the current situation, and describes  and justifies the need for the future development  of the agency within the context of the security  environment, particularly as regards cyber threats.  The complete document on the NÚKIB  Development Concept is available on the website at  www.nukib.cz/cs/kyberneticka-bezpecnost/ strategie-akcni-plan  LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK: SETTING BASIC  RULES FOR IMPORTANT ENTITIES12  amendment of the decree on important  information systems  During the last year, the NÚKIB worked on an amend­ ment to the Decree on Important Information Systems,  the aim of which was to simplify and clarify the process  of identification of such systems and reinforce the legal  certainty of its addressees through its increased effectivity.  The amendment entered into force in Sep tember 2020  and gradually came into effect from 1 January 2021. Due  to the costs which will be required to secure the newly  identified systems, the effectiveness of the list of systems  was spread over three years.  12 Pursuant to Act No 181/2014, on cyber security and on amendments to related laws, as amended, it includes entities whose information systems are  important for the functioning of the State.  1.  2.  3.  https://www.nukib.cz/cs/kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/ https://www.nukib.cz/cs/kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/ https://www.nukib.cz/cs/kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/ https://www.nukib.cz/cs/kyberneticka-bezpecnost/strategie-akcni-plan/   28Measures  ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  IMPORTANT INFORMATION SYSTEMS DUE  TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE DECREE ON  IMPORTANT INFORMATION SYSTEMS  corrections and amendments to legal  provisions  At the beginning of 2020, the ACS was amended with  respect to the provisions related to offences and fines  resulting from them. The amendment corrected a  condition that had persisted since 2017 when some  offences overlapped and some lacked any possibility  of imposition of a fine.  NUMBER OF OBLIGED ENTITIES BY THE END  OF 2020:  entities: administrators and operators  of critical information infrastructure  information and communication  systems  critical information infrastructure  information and communication  systems  entities: administrators and operators  of important information systems  important information systems  entities: administrators and operators  of essential services information   systems  essential services information systems  THE NÚKIB’S SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES IN 2020  Regarding control and audit activities, 2020 was  negatively affected by the pandemic, which resulted in  a lower number of controls and audits performed. In 2019,  the NÚKIB performed 15 controls under the ACS, whereas  in 2020 it only performed 8 controls and audits under the  ACS, or Decree No 82/2018, on cyber security (hereinafter  the ‘DCS’). Controls and audits at obliged entities under  the ACS verify that the obligations resulting from the ACS  and DCS have been fulfilled. There are about 150 check  points within each control or audit. The NÚKIB’s priority  in the area of controls and audits was the healthcare  sector, particularly in the second half of 2020.  AREAS OF INSUFFICIENCIES MOST FREQUENTLY  IDENTIFIED DURING THE CONTROL AND  AUDITING ACTIVITIES:  The set cyber security system does not cover  all parties involved  Subjects manage the assets and risks  associated with cyber security inadequately  The security policy and documentation are  often not applied in practice or are not updated  Subjects manage the supplier-associated  risks inadequately  Use of obsolete hardware and software  no longer supported by the manufacturer  Lack of cyber security experts  Inappropriate network segmentation  Insufficient internal network monitoring  Too short log storage period  Dysfunctional system ensuring the continuity  of activities  52  120  85  56  61  177  period  2021  2022  2023  Total  number of newly implemented systems  360  260   80  700    29Measures  COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NÚKIB AND  OTHER SUPERVISION BODIES ON CONTROLS  IN 2020  Last year, the NÚKIB continued in its cooperation  in control activities with other regulatory  bodies, with the aim of minimising the burden  on the obliged entities. For example, the NÚKIB  established cooperation with the State Office  for Nuclear Safety via a memorandum, whereby  these institutions confirmed mutual support and  cooperation beyond the scope of control activities.  CYBER SECURITY EXERCISES: GREAT INTEREST,  LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES  As in previous years, in 2020 the NÚKIB noticed an in­ creased demand for exercises by Czech organisations  and entities. This demand could not be completely met,  however, because of the measures associated with the  global COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of organ­ ised exercises, which are a proven tool for increasing  the cyber security level, was negatively affected by the  impossibility of meeting in person to discuss questions  posed by a realistic scenario customized for the specif­ ic audience. Such restrictions on meetings were both  on the side of the NÚKIB and the requesting subjects,  which on the one hand emphasised the safety of their  employ ees for logical reasons, and on the other prior­ itized other critical activities of their own.  Despite the above, the NÚKIB organised or coordinated  eight national and international exercises in 2020.  Apart from the representatives of the NÚKIB, about  100 participants from various organisations activ ely  participated in the exercises in the Czech Republic. The  exercise as part of the General Staff Course and the  exercise for the Prague Castle Administration are par­ ticularly worth highlighting.  THE ADDED VALUE OF THE CYBER SECURITY  EXERCISES  Exercises are an invaluable source of new  knowledge, experience, and technical skills.  They give the NÚKIB an opportunity to identify  weaknesses in cyber security, point them out  and provide an excellent tool for the verification  and revision of strategies and procedures.  As a tool for identification, definition and  confirmation of trends, they also provide inputs  for the preparation of other awareness-raising  and educational activities. Furthermore, the   exercises help strengthen relations between  the participants as well as with the partners  cooperating with the NÚKIB on their preparation.  cyber coalition ���� international cyber  security exercise  This annual international exercise held by NATO, with  the NÚKIB coordinating the civilian part and the Cyber  and Information Warfare Command the military part  at national level, saw a dramatic change compared to  previous years because of the COVID­19 pandemic.  The participation of the coordinating organisations and  their partners was significantly limited, and the planning  process and the actual exercises took place virtually.  Despite the necessary adjustments to the current sit­ uation, NÚKIB representatives also managed to actively  participate in the Core Planning Team responsible for  the preparation and organisation of the exercises at the  highest level, for the third consecutive year. Thereby,  the Czech Republic again contributed to one of the  largest international cyber security exercises to the  maximum extent.  CYBER COALITION 2020 IN FIGURES  IN WHICH AREAS DO THE PARTICIPANTS TRAIN  THROUGH THE CYBER COALITION?  Processes  Technical tasks  Communication  Legal aspects  comm czech ���� communication exercise  The goal of the third communication exercise  held by the NÚKIB was to test the availability and   13th iteration globally   10th iteration in Czechia  1 000 participants  29 countries    30Measures  up­to­datedness of the contact details provided by the  obliged entities under the ACS, which are particularly  important for the NÚKIB with respect to the need  for immediate crisis communication in the case of  a cyber security incident. The metrics were the avail­ ability of the contact details related to the specific  systems categorised as CII, IIS or OES. Any potential  unavailability or impossibility of timely communication  in a real situation could result in serious damage,  not only to the entity in question but in the worst­ case scenario also to the whole Czech Republic. The  results of the exercise were evaluated very positively  as most of the contact details, and subsequently the  systems, were available. The exer cise also verified  and confirmed that the subjects already intensively  communicate with the NÚKIB even when there is  no emergency.  IMPORTANT FINDINGS FROM EXERCISES  IN PREVIOUS YEARS:  To react to serious cyber incidents in a timely,  effective and adequate manner, organisations need  to have cybersecurity contingency plans prepared  in advance, and their employees need to know  the plans.  One of the biggest cyber security challenges   is the sharing of information between partners  (both domestic and foreign), without which it is  difficult to understand cyberattacks in a broader  context and uncover all an attacker’s activities,  their motivation and goals, and to subsequently  adopt appropriate measures.  AWARENESS-RAISING AND EDUCATION IN THE  CZECH REPUBLIC: THE ONLINE YEAR 2020  The year 2020 proved that continuous and quality  training in cyber security is more than important, and  it has to be given maximum space. The epidemiologi­ cal circumstances forced many daily activities into the  online environment, and things such as home offices  and distance learning became part of our vocabulary.  This created not only many opportunities but also  many threats, for which various target user groups  had to be prepared.  The training of public administration users was per­ formed via the online course Dávej kyber! [Get Cyber  Skilled!] organised by the NÚKIB, which presents  cyber security basics.  THE DÁVEJ KYBER! COURSE TOOK:  The awareness­raising and educational activities also  included the following projects for children in kinder­ gartens to students at universities and university staff:  The expert online course Bezpečně v kyber [Stay Safe  in Cyberspace] was taken by 1‚690 prevention officers  within the scope of their professional training with a  prevention extension. The course was prepared by the  NÚKIB in cooperation with the Ministry of Education,  Youth, and Sports and Zvolsi.info, and introduces topics  in online security and situations that prevention officers  may encounter in the education environment.  In  cooperation with the Union of Librarians and  Information Workers of the Czech Republic, the NÚKIB  managed to distribute the educational board game  Městečko kybernetov for kindergartens, which pre­ sents the issue of cyberbullying and other topics to  children in a soft manner.  The audio stories Vanda a Eda v Onl@jn světě were  prepared under the auspices of the Secure Internet  Festival and in cooperation with Rádio Junior and Czech  Radio’s (Český rozhlas) channel for children; they pre­ pare pupils from the 1st grade of primary school for  their first experience of the Internet.  The online interactive comic Digitální stopa: Příběh  Svůďáka was seen by 650 pupils. It was prepared by  the NÚKIB and mainly concentrates on cybergrooming  for pupils of the 4th and 5th grades of primary school.  The Cyber Security Competition for Secondary School  Students was held once again in the 2019/2020 school  year by the Czech branch of AFCEA. Nearly 4,500 stu- dents participated in it, 1,500 of whom qualified for the  second­round runoff.  During the 2nd Secure Internet Festival, the NÚKIB  distributed videos, games, and podcasts to schools via   18 209  214  2 000  public sector employees  Czech Armed Forces  personnel  Bulovka Hospital staff  https://slovnik.seznam.cz/preklad/anglicky_cesky/up?strict=true https://slovnik.seznam.cz/preklad/anglicky_cesky/to?strict=true   31Measures  the Bakaláři and Škola Online information systems. This  meant they were offered to 280‚000 users directly on their  homepages. The NÚKIB also held the Effectiveness of  Cyber Prevention online panel discussion at the Festival,  which was seen on various platforms by 4,500 viewers.  The programme presented trends and effective forms of  awareness­raising in cyber security, for example.  Masaryk  University  opened a new bachelor  pro- gramme in cyber security. Students will be able to study  courses such as Cybercrime and cyber security or Cyber  security in organisations.   Furthermore, significant awareness­raising and educa­ tional audio­visual materials such as films, documen­ taries and series dealing with various online security  topics were produced in the Czech Republic last year.  The following should be highlighted in particular:  #martyisdead: a thriller series on cyberbullying and ma­ nipulation prepared by Mall web­TV in cooperation with  CZ.NIC and its project ‘Bezpečně na netu’. The series  was successful both in the Czech Republic and abroad,  where it won an Emmy in the short series category.  Datová Lhota: an educational cartoon series produced  by Czech Television, which presents the technical back­ ground of the Internet to children in the first stage of  primary school and helps create safe behaviour habits.  V síti: a documentary that opened the issue of internet  predators and stirred up a great deal of public interest.  V digitálním světě: educational videos with a similar  focus for the same target group were also prepared  by Jeden svět na školách, a project by the non­profit  organisation Člověk v tísni.  O2 Smart School: a project by the O2 Foundation, which  mainly helps pedagogues and parents to better under­ stand the opportunities and pitfalls of the digital world.  In the area of research and development, the  NÚKIB published the National Cyber and  Information Security Research and Development  Plan with the objective of identifying key research  topics for the development of the security system  of the Czech Republic. The NÚKIB also participated  in the implementation of research projects dealing  with the analysis of security risks associated with  optical fibre networks and strategic research and  development of systems for securing modern  communication networks using quantum key  distribution and post-quantum cryptography.  A Junior Centrum Excelence centre for information  security at the Secondary School of Informatics, Postal  Services and Finance Brno was opened at the begin­ ning of 2020. The objective of the Junior Centrum  Excelence centres is to ensure the creation of a future  expert foundation that will enable better responses to  the latest cyber threats. The centres are exceptional  and progressive in their approach to teaching and edu­ cation in information security, the implementation of  safety measures and, last but not least, in their technical  equipment. With their help, other secondary schools  can also teach information security.  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION: GROWTH OF  THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBER SECURITY  AT EUROPEAN LEVEL  The development of regulatory tools in the Czech  Republic largely depends on the situation abroad as  well as on the decisions adopted at European and  international level. The NÚKIB represents the Czech  Republic’s interests in cyber secu rity in international  organisations and integration groups, namely in the EU,  the UN and NATO, but also in the OECD, the OSCE and  the ITU, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (hereinafter the ‘MFA’), the Ministry of Defence and   1 690 workers in prevention took the    ‘Bezpečně v kyber’ course  650 pupils read the ‘Digital Footprint’ comicstudents  4 500  students participated in the Cyber Security  Competition for Secondary School Students  13 Ministry of Industry and Trade, Czech Telecommunication Office and others.    32Measures  other partners.13 In 2020, Czech Republic representatives  concentrated at EU level mainly on negotiations in  the areas of the regulation on competence centres,  the agenda of cyber security certification, the Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox application,14 the launching of the  CyCLONe network,15 sounding talks on revising the  NIS Directive16 and concluding discussions about the  5G EU Toolbox17 and its subsequent implementation.  The Open Working Group within the UN continued with  its activities, in which both the NÚKIB and the MFA  actively participate.  prague �g security conference ����  and presentation of the  prague �g security repository  In September 2020, the NÚKIB, the Office of the  Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organ­ ised the 2nd two­day Prague 5G Security Conference,  a leading international forum for discussion of the  risks associated with the building of 5G infrastructure.  Similarly to last year, the conference was held under  the auspices of Andrej Babiš, the Prime Minister of the  Czech Republic. Although the conference was virtual  for the first time due to the COVID­19 situation, more  than 50 speakers from Europe, the USA, South Korea,  Israel, Australia, India, and other countries spoke at it.  The main outcome of the 2nd conference was the  presentation and launching of the Prague 5G Security  Repository, a virtual library intended for sharing  legislative, strategic, and other tools which the countries  adopted in the area of 5G network security over the  past year. Hence this year’s conference followed on  from the release of the Prague Proposals (a set of  recommendations and principles countries should take  into consideration when building their 5G infrastructure)  of the year before.  The 3rd Prague 5G Security Conference is scheduled for  autumn 2021. A key theme of the conference will be  5G infrastructure security in the context of future and    emerging technologies, including the Internet of Things and  artificial intelligence.  The Prague Proposals adopted in 2019 became the ba- sis for concluding of bilateral agreements in the 5G net- works security field for many countries. Consequently,  they are explicitly stated in the bilateral declarations  on the 5G infrastructure security which were conclud- ed, for example, between the USA and Estonia, Poland,  Romania, Kosovo, Slovenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, North  Macedonia, and Slovakia.  the new eu cyber security strategyxxiii  and proposal for a directive to replace  the nis directivexxiv  The end of 2020 brought a new cyber ‘package’ pre­ pared by the European Union with the assistance of the  Czech Republic, among others. Apart from the release  and gradual implementation of the 5G EU Toolboxxxv and  the conclusion of the discussions about the Regulation  on the Cyber Security Competence Centre,18 the prepara­ tion of such fundamental documents with actual impact  illustrates the importance of the close cooperation estab­ lished by the Czech Republic within the European Union.  The new EU Cyber Security Strategy puts great emphasis  on the protection of critical infrastructure, draws atten­ tion to international security and stability risks resulting  from geopolitical competition between countries and  hybrid threats, and highlights the importance of cyber  security as the crucial aspect in people’s confidence in  innovations and automation.   Greater harmonisation of legal regulations and the  approach of Member States to cyber security are  the subject matter of the proposal of the European  Commission to replace the NIS Directive. The new  directive should adapt the coordinated detection of  vulnerabilities, expand the sectors of obliged entities,  unify methods for the identification of obliged entities,  and establish new obligations in incident reporting.    14 In July 2020, the European Union first implemented the sanction mechanism which is a part of the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox. Sanctions were imposed  on two citizens of the PRC, four citizens of the Russian Federation, and three organisations from the PRC, Russia and the DPRK.xxi This was a punishment  by the EU for the Cloud Hopper cyberespionage campaign performed by the Chinese APT10 group detected in April 2017, the attacks on the Organisation  for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2018), the NotPetya cyberattack (2017) ascribed to Russia, and finally for the WannaCry ransomware attack  ascribed to the DPRK. In October 2020, sanctions were imposed on another two citizens and one organisation from the Russian Federation.xxii Identifying  individuals and organisations from the respective countries does not imply any official attribution of the attacks by the EU, even though the two Russian  entities were organisational units of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation GRU (also GU). The identified  physical and legal persons are prohibited from entering the EU, and their funds have been frozen. 15 CyCLONe is a network of liaison organisations for dealing with cyber crises. 16 The official name is the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems. 17 The official name is the EU Toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity. 18 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research  Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres.    33Measures  As unnecessarily strong as this harmonisation is in some  respects in the Czech Republic’s view, it represents good  groundwork for negotiations on the final form of this  important EU legislation.  Both documents can qualify as critical for the political  and legislative anchoring of cyber security in the EU  for many years to come. Their ambitiousness reflects  the increasing importance of cyber security at both  European and international level.  At the beginning of 2020, the Czech Republic joined  a pan-European project aimed at creating   a Europe-wide quantum communication  infrastructure.  The prepared network will enable highly secured  information transfer within the individual countries  as well as between various EU countries. The  envisaged communication channels are primarily  intended for securing the critical information  infrastructure. It is estimated that the actual  quantum networks should be built and launched  throughout the EU within a 10-year horizon.    34Trends and Outlook for Cyber security in the Czech Republic for 2021 and 2022  RANSOMWARE: The use of extortion malware  by which attackers encrypt the data of the  attacked institutions with consequent demands  for ransom will almost certainly (90% – 100%  probability) remain one of the most significant  cyber threats in the next two years. At the same  time, the trend for increasing sophistication  of campaigns and targeting specific victims  is highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to  continue. Considering the persisting pressure  on healthcare facilities in 2021 and 2022, it is  almost certain (90% – 100% probability) that  they will remain the targets of ransomware.  Large­scale undertakings, public sector insti­ tutions, and educational establishments are  also highly likely (75% – 85% probability) to  become targets.  PHISHING, SPEAR-PHISHING, AND SCAM  E-MAILS: The Czech Republic will continue  to face the most severe threats from 2020 in  the coming years, mainly because of the per­ sisting possibility of exploitation of the topic of  the pandemic and the development of social  engineering methods, such as more sophisti­ cated spear­phishing with the use of deepfakes.  It is also likely (55% –70% probability) that the  spread of deepfakes will be used for vishing  (a blend of voice and phishing) more often,  focusing on users as well as public institutions  and, above all, financial institutions.  LACK OF CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS: The  long­term shortage of experts is a factor affect­ ing a number of cyber security areas and trends.  We can therefore assume that the outsourc­ ing of many services associated with IT infra­ structure and its securing (Security as a Service,  among others) is highly likely (75% – 85% prob­ ability) to grow over the coming years.  CLOUD: The growing popularity of cloud envi­ ronments is highly likely (75% – 85% probability)  to cause a further increase in number of cyber­ attacks targeted at this infrastructure. Clouds  will face attacks more and more frequently  since both State actors and cybercrime groups  will try to gain access to sensitive data or trade  secrets. Insufficiencies in security (such as in­ appropriate configuration) are likely (55% – 70%  probability) to remain the most exploited vec­ tor of attacks on cloud services. There is a realis­ tic possibility (25% – 50% probability) that Czech  organisations or companies will be among the  affected clients of those services.  CYBERATTACKS  AGAINST  STRATEGIC  STATE INSTITUTIONS: Central government  authorities of the Czech Republic are highly  likely (75% – 85% probability) to face serious  cyberattacks from sophisticated actors in  2021 and 2022. The public sector, including its  strategic institutions (the central government  authorities in particular), is a frequent target of  both cyber criminals and State actors because of  its visibility and access to sensitive information.  Foreign cases (such as the SolarWinds case)  demonstrate that attackers are using more  and more sophisticated methods to enter  their victim’s system and the attacks are  consequently more difficult to detect. Based  on the above­mentioned facts, its own data,  and information from its partners, the NÚKIB  estimates that the trend of serious cyberattacks  against strategic government authorities will  materialise in the Czech Republic in the next  two years, and one or more of them are highly  likely (75% – 85% probability) to face a serious  cyberattack from sophisticated actors.  TRENDS AND OUTLOOK FOR CYBER SECURITY IN THE  CZECH REPUBLIC FOR 2021 AND 2022  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.    35Summary of Annexes  ANNEX 1: REPORT ON THE FULFILMENT OF  THE ACTION PLAN FOR THE NATIONAL CYBER  SECURITY STRATEGY FOR 2015 TO 2020  The year 2020 was the closing year for the fulfilment of  the Action Plan for the National Cyber Security Strategy  of the Czech Republic for 2015 to 2020 (hereinafter the  ‘Action Plan’). A substantial part of the tasks were eval­ uated as accomplished or being fulfilled. The number  of ongoing tasks has grown compared to the previous  year due to the COVID­19 pandemic. These tasks were  only partially accomplished because of the epidemio­ logical measures, which significantly affected activities  requiring cooperation. For example, the ongoing tasks  in the area of cyber exercises whose performance was  either cancelled or postponed were assessed as partially  accomplished. The situation was similar in the area  of educational activities, some of which were directly  cancelled, postponed, or transformed into online form.   The fulfilment of tasks that were wholly or partially  accom plished in the past was also evaluated. One of  these was the creation of an automated platform for  sharing information about cyber threats under the  competence of the NÚKIB. The platform was being  developed during 2020 as part of the Non­public Web  project, beta testing of which has been in progress since  the beginning of 2021. Since mid­February 2021, enti­ ties regulated under the ACS as well as partners of the  Government CERT have been gradually connected to it.  Only one of the assigned tasks had a fixed deadline  in the given year, namely the Full Provision of Cyber  Defence of the Czech Republic through the cooperation  by the NCOC,19 the NCSC, the national CERT, and other  CERT/CSIRT­type workplaces. This task, managed by  Military Intelligence, was evaluated as partially accom­ plished because of the postponing of the approval of  necessary legislative changes required for the full­ fledged cyber defence of the Czech Republic, and its  complete accomplishment has been postponed to 2022.  Chart 31: Evaluation of the tasks from the Action Plan  for 2020  ANNEX 2: EVALUATION OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF  THE OBJECTIVES FROM THE NATIONAL RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR 2020  In the area of research and development, the NÚKIB  released the National Research and Development  Plan, aiming at identifying the key research topics for  the develop ment of the security system of the Czech  Republic. It includes the following topics:  Priority research topics shall be incorporated  in  public  tenders  and  national  and  inter- national  research,  development  and  in- novation support programme calls. At the  end of 2020, the NÚKIB started collecting  information to draw up a list of research needs  in order to submit them under the Programme  for Security Research for State Purposes for  2022 – 2027. Under this objective, the NÚKIB  supported the efforts of the Ministry of  Defence of the Czech Republic to strengthen  research and development cooperation in  cyber security and defence.  EVALUATION: Considering the short­term hori­ zon, it cannot yet be evaluated whether the    SUMMARY OF ANNEXES  0  20  40  60  76  8 1  ACCOMPLISHED/ BEING FULFILLED  NOT ACCOMPLISHEDPARTIALLY  ACCOMPLISHED/ BEING FULFILLED  19  The NCOC is the successor to the National Centre of Cyberspace Operations (NCCO).  1.    36Measures  number of implemented projects has increased  compared to 2019.  Greater involvement of the user community  in the system of support for research, devel- opment and innovation (also referred to as  R&D&I) in cyber security, including enhanc- ing the capacity to deploy results in practice.  In 2020, the NÚKIB participated in two re­ search projects focused on security risk analy­ sis for fibre optic networks and strategic R&D  for systems to secure modern communication  networks using quantum key distribution and  post­quantum cryptography. The NÚKIB has  applied for membership in the TACR – BETA2  programme board.  EVALUATION: Compared to 2012, the NÚKIB  increased its involvement in R&D&I projects  funded from national programmes, but it is  not possible to assess the extent to which the  NÚKIB contributes to putting the results of R&D  into practice due to the short period of time.  The NÚKIB as an information and analytical  foundation in R&D&I in cyber security. The  ‘Research and New Technologies in Cyber  and Information Security’ and ‘News in Cyber  Security R&D’ newsletters on the NÚKIB web­ site are regularly updated. At the end of 2020,  the NÚKIB prepared the summary report  ‘Trends in Cyber and Information Security in the  Czech Republic for 2020 – 2023’, which was sub­ mitted to partners in the security community.  EVALUATION: The NÚKIB succeeded in starting  a process for regularly updating its partners on  the possibilities of financing research projects,  news in R&D&I, and opportunities to partici­ pate in research consortia.  Developed international cooperation. In 2020,  the NÚKIB continued to support project con­ sortia under the Horizon 2020 and Connecting  Europe Facility (CEF) programmes. The sup­ port included six projects in total. Furthermore,  the NÚKIB encouraged the Czech Republic’s  joining of the pan­European EuroQCI project  aiming at building Europe­wide quantum  communication infrastructure.  EVALUATION: The accomplishment of this  objective was significantly affected by the  COVID­19 pandemic and hence was only  partially accomplished. The low level of the  NÚKIB’s involvement in international research  projects is largely influenced by the lack of in­ house capacity.  The Czech Republic actively participated in  joint R&D in cyber security at EU level. The  NÚKIB participated the comments procedures  for the new Horizon Europe and Digital Europe  European agendas. Concerning the creation of  the National Coordination Centre in the Czech  Republic, the NÚKIB prepared national posi­ tions on the Proposal for a Regulation estab­ lishing the European Cyber Security Industrial,  Technology and Research Competence Centre  and the Network of National Coordination  Centres. The NÚKIB actively participated  in setting the parameters for the 2021 – 2027  programme period, namely for the IROP – the  Cyber Security Call, Recovery Fund and ReactEU.  The NÚKIB has taken the necessary steps in the  area of the EU cyber security certifications to  ensure the implementation of the Act on Cyber  Security in the Czech legal system.  EVALUATION: With respect to all activities, the  NÚKIB considers the goal accomplished.  2.  3.  4.  5.  Summary of Annexes    37Sources  i FireEye. 2020.

The new Intelligence Service Act has been in force since 1 September 2017. It gives the Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) new instruments for countering the threats to Switzerland's internal and external security. The situation radar shows that these new tools are needed now more than ever. For example, the radar indicates that Switzerland's security policy has to remain focussed on the ongoing heightened terrorist threat and the threat in cyberspace (especially from espionage). The latter poses an enormous challenge for Switzerland, as elsewhere. Espionage using information and communications technology, in particular, is now taking place on a large scale in our country. In 2017, we have seen yet another state, North Korea, acquire the means to threaten Switzerland with nuclear weapons from within its territory. This fact, together with the use of chemical weapons in Syria and of chemical agents against a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK, underlines how important it is that efforts to counter proliferation activities should not be relaxed. Relations between Russia and the transatlantic West are steadily deteriorating: In all likelihood, this develop- ment, which is relevant to Switzerland's security policy, has not yet reached its lowest point. The in- clusion of influence operations in the situation radar demonstrates that Switzerland – be it the coun- try's decision-makers or the population at large – has not remained untouched by this phenomenon. Switzerland is still a relatively safe country, not least due to the continuing efforts of our security authorities at federal and cantonal level. In order for our country to be able to maintain its security, it is essential that we continue to make consistent and targeted use of the range of preventive and puni- tive measures available to us. As explained in an appendix to this situation report, since 1 September 2017 the FIS has been actively employing the intelligence-gathering measures requir- ing authorisation which are provided for, subject to strict conditions, in the Intel- ligence Service Act. For example, by the end of 2017 the FIS had opened four operations (cases), as part of which, following authorisation from the relevant political and judicial authorities, it had successfully used a total of 40 such measures. The fact that two of these operations related to terrorism and two to counterespionage shows that use of the new tools is being focussed on the most serious threats. The publication of these figures demonstrates the increasing transparency of the FIS. While core aspects of intelligence work will always remain secret, the publication of certain key figures relating to the service's work – as is also planned for the 2019 annual report – can only strengthen public confidence in this vital security instrument.

The FIS's situation radar tool is one of the instruments that offer guidance for Switzerland's security policy and provides Switzerland's inhabitants with an outline of the key issues from an intelligence viewpoint. ▪ Europe remains under exceptional strain due to internal and external crises. Recent- ly, questions have also been raised about the capability of NATO to act effectively as the foundation of the security order in Europe. The USA has intensified the debate about burden sharing. Alliance member Turkey has ambitions to shape its strategic environ- ment between the EU/NATO, Russia and the Middle East independently of Western ideas of order. Fundamental uncertainty and thus reduced predictability will shape Switzer- land's strategic environment for a long time to come. ▪ Russia is currently more politically stable, economically robust and militarily capable of action than it has ever been since the fall of the Soviet Union, even though long-term challenges remain. The Russian leadership controls both state and society. Russia, a revanchist power, is seeking to restore the historically and ideologically deeply-rooted Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Eu- rope. Ukraine will continue to be the focus of its ambitions. The steady deterioration of the relationship between Russia and the transatlantic West has in all likelihood not yet reached its lowest point and will also have repercussions for Switzerland. ▪ The Middle East and North Africa, including the Sahel region, are the scene of numerous armed conflicts. For years, the impact of these conflicts has also been felt in Europe, in the form of migration movements and ji- hadist terrorism. While ‘Islamic State’ has lost its state-like structure, as well as the bulk of its territories and its openly operating mili- tary units, the terrorist threat in Europe from the jihadist movement will continue to be shaped by ‘Islamic State’ and individuals and small groups controlled or inspired by it. The threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. ‘Islamic State’ and former jihadist fighters continue to use migration flows to Europa and Switzer- land for their purposes. The terrorist threat in Switzerland remains at a heightened level. ▪ Migration numbers have fallen since the peak levels of refugees and migrants which presented a major challenge for Europe in 2015, but migration potential and the pres- sure on Europe remain high. At the moment, this issue is not motivating right-wing or left-wing extremists in Switzerland to en- gage in any significant action. While right- wing extremists are keeping a lower profile than they have done for decades, the threat from left-wing extremists has become more acute over the last twelve months. A cam- STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S8 paign against ‘repression’ carried out by the latter in the form of a series of arson attacks led to a significant increase in acts of vio- lence. The high level of aggression against security forces, which has been apparent for some years now, has been manifesting itself with increasing frequency. ▪ Where proliferation is concerned, terrorist groups are showing interest in obtaining expertise on weapons of mass destruction, especially chemical weapons. The threat is moving closer to Switzerland, as North Korea became the latest state to acquire the means to threaten Switzerland with nucle- ar weapons in 2017. The nuclear agreement with Iran still stands, although it is under se- vere pressure from the USA. ▪ Information of political, economic and mili- tary relevance continues to be gathered by means of illegal intelligence. In addition, intelligence services are conducting active operations against their countries' own na- tionals abroad. Traditional methods go hand in hand with activities in cyberspace – the various forms of illegal intelligence do not compete in any way, rather they comple- ment each other. Access which has been sought and found for the purpose of infor- mation gathering can also be used to inflict damage on a state. Acts of sabotage against industrial control systems, which are cur- rently still rare, illustrate this potential. In- telligence service activity and information gained through this play a role in influence operations, with Russia as a prominent actor.

A simplified version of the situation radar, without any confidential data, has also been incorporated into this report. The public version lists the threats that fall within the FIS’s remit, together with those classified un- der the categories of ’migration risks’ and ’organ- ised crime’, which are also relevant from the point of view of security policy. This report does not go into detail about these two categories, for more information on which readers are referred to the reports of the relevant federal authorities.

In the last few years, these crisis sit- uations have been regularly described by the FIS in its situation reports. The Brexit decision has shaken the EU vision to its core and will continue to absorb the EU's energies for years to come. Questions have also repeatedly been raised about the stability of the eurozone and thus also the common currency, and recently, with increasing frequency, about the capability of NATO to act effectively as the foundation of the security order in Europe. At the same time, the periphery of the EU and NATO is under the greatest external pressure it has faced for a generation: in the east from a strengthened and revanchist Russia and in the south from the Middle East and North Africa, where the state order is threatening to disintegrate in some places – with impacts on Europe in the form of migration movements and an increased terror threat, both of which are unsettling populations and placing an extraordinary strain on national and European institutions. The European order is showing clear cracks Following the surprising votes for Brexit in the UK and for Donald Trump in the USA, elections in many places in Europe in 2017 confirmed the loss of confidence in the parties of the centre, which have traditionally sup- ported the state and formed the government. In France, the Front National has never been so close to election victory. In Germany, the parties of the grand coalition accounted for not much more than half the seats in the Bundestag. Political forces which are turning their backs on progressive integration as a fundamental idea of the European order now bear govern- mental responsibility not only in the United Kingdom but also in Greece, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria. These popu- lar votes highlight the extent to which Western political orders have lost the predictability and stability which had characterised them for so long. Long-held political certainties are being questioned and challenged and are beginning to change or are even unravelling. We are only just beginning to get an idea of what will ulti- mately replace the old certainties. In the wake of a rise in nationalist tendencies, elements of the future might include a return to more na- tional solutions and a narrower definition of European solidarity. As a consequence, Swit- zerland has entered a prolonged period of fun- damental uncertainty and thus reduced predict- ability in our strategic environment. The picture painted by election and poll decisions is one which shows the major Eu- ropean institutions in crisis. Although the EU has endured through the challenges of recent years, initiated the search for solutions and the debate about the further evolution of the Union with various proposals, its capability to act effectively is hampered by numerous in- ternal and external crisis situations. Following Strategic environment STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S14 the UK's Brexit vote, the EU is now in the middle of the difficult process of redefining its relations with the UK. This process is as complex as was feared, will take more time than both sides would like, and will prolong the uncertainties at the heart of the European order well into the next decade. The Brexit debate will pose fundamental questions for the EU for years to come: if not questions about the continued existence of the institu- tion itself, then about its ability to function as an effective force for order on the European continent and to exert influence at the global level. In any case, there is as yet no sign of the ‘salutary shock’ anticipated by some, which would provide the political basis to lend fresh impetus to the renewal of the EU. Initial de- cisions on new joint efforts in the field of Eu- ropean defence still have to pass the test of implementation or will once again prove to be an unfulfilled ambition. The prospect of a multi-speed EU may seem politically desira- ble as a new vision in some places, but would accentuate the fault lines between a dominant core and a periphery in economic and social difficulties. The movement toward integration between the old member states in the west and the new ones in the east is threatening to come to a halt or even to go into reverse, a develop- ment that will be an impediment both to the EU and to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as organizations rele- vant for security in Europe. Fault lines in our immediate environment – between north and south, between east and west, between core and periphery – will be thrown into sharper relief. The eurozone, and with it the common cur- rency, are also in crisis, even if the public is less aware of this. The level of government debt, which has increased sharply since the international financial crisis of 2007/2008, and a fragile banking system, are still leading to concerns about financial stability and even about the survival of the euro. The eurozone as an institution has survived the years of severe crisis surrounding painful economic reforms in countries on the periphery. However, even under the favourable conditions of an expan- sionary mone tary policy, large European econ- omies such as those of France and Italy have not yet been sufficiently reformed and consol- idated. These are still of crucial importance to the economic and political future of the conti- nent. The inability to formulate a convincing common way forward in order to overcome the debt crisis across the entire eurozone is one of the reasons for the political crisis. It is under- mining not only the European institutions, but also those of the nation states that make up the EU: There is a diminishing political will in the national decision-making bodies to find pan-European solutions, and even national problem-solving mechanisms are coming un- der pressure from autonomist, separatist and populist movements. Western European states generally have constitutional systems based on stable institutional foundations that can with- stand this pressure better and for longer than others. In Central European countries, by con- trast, these may fail. Even NATO, the security cornerstone of the European order, is showing distinct symptoms of crisis. The alliance is having to deal simulta- S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 15 Europe and also with the USA is under con- siderable strain in key areas such as internal security and counter-terrorism (prosecution of actual and alleged government opponents in Europe and the USA), regional policy (Kurdish question) and armaments policy (procurement projects in collaboration with Russia). NATO, confronted with these internal challenges, thus finds itself in the midst of a fundamental debate about its ability to withstand crisis, its politi- cal will and capability to meet mutual defense commitments on the European continent and its capability to deter external challenges, all of which have been ascribed to it for decades by its rivals and on which the current security order in Europe largely depends. Growing pressure from the east At the same time, external pressure on Eu- rope is increasing. To the east, the Russian state has been reinvigorated under President Putin's leadership. It is currently more politically sta- ble, economically robust and militarily capable than it has ever been since the fall of the So viet neously with a burden-sharing debate that has been intensified by the USA and with recur- ring tensions in its relations with its member state Turkey. Following Presidential candidate Trump's repeated and trenchant expression of doubts about the benefits of NATO, the US administration has nonetheless reaffirmed its commitment and expressly acknowledged its obligation to provide assistance in the event of an attack (Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty). However, it has not succeeded in dispelling fundamental doubts about President Trump's transatlantic commitment. In addition, NATO's cohesion and capacity to act is increasingly being put to the test by Turkey. The gradual repression of democratic and constitutional norms is only one aspect of broader develop- ments in that country. Across the board, Tur- key is adopting an assertive stance in distinct contrast to the Western-dominated European order. In terms of security and military policy, it is also asserting itself decisively as a flexible regional power between the EU/NATO, Rus- sia and the Middle East.

In all probability, rela- tions with Russia have not yet reached their lowest point. American-Russian relations re- main at a dangerously low level. Based on the trend in recent years, further polarisation and militarisation as well as the establishment of new demarcation lines across Europe must be reckoned with, a process that – before it can possibly have a stabilising effect – carries a considerable risk of conflicts arising in areas where Western and Russian interests have not been demarcated. After the end of the Cold War, the armed forces of European states greatly reduced their national and alliance defence capabilities. In parallel, the US also cut its military presence in Europe significantly. While Russia's military resurgence is now already well advanced, cor- responding measures by the West have so far failed to keep pace with this development. In an escalating crisis, Russia could therefore use military means to create facts on the ground along the Eastern border of NATO without the West currently being in a position to prevent it. The establishment of the status quo ante would then only be possible by further escalating the conflict. Although the FIS does not currently consider it likely that the situation will evolve along these lines, the risk that interstate con- flicts will again be resolved by military means has increased in Europe, too. The conflict with Russia is not a temporary phenomenon, but a change with lasting effects in Switzerland's strategic environment. A crisis in this area between East and West – whether above or below the threshold of war – could, without much advance warning, become a ma- Union, even if long-term challenges remain, especially about the future viability of the Russian model. For the first time since 2013, the FIS situation report is therefore once again focussing on developments in Russia. The Russian leadership controls the state via a vast apparatus of government agencies vested with extensive powers to control the domestic situa- tion, the economy and society. This apparatus is mostly led by close associates of the president with a proven personal loyalty to Putin. With this power apparatus consolidated internally and with a robust economy, which has contin- ued to ensure the state’s financing despite the international financial crisis, the collapse of oil prices and the imposition of sanctions, the Rus- sian leadership is now working to restore the historically and ideologically deeply-rooted Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Growing Russian pressure in this area has already led to military escalation twice in recent years: in 2008 in Georgia and in 2014 in Ukraine, wars that have extended a chain of de facto Russian military outposts in parts of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. Russia's leverage in Europe is not limited to military instruments. it also includes economic influence by legal and criminal means and professionalised propaganda cam- paigns as well as attacks in cyberspace. This exertion of Russian influence extends far be- yond Eastern Europe. Europe, preoccupied with its many and varied problems and once again thinking in increasingly national or even subnation- al categories, is struggling to deal with this pressure and to find common European and S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 17 underground. In Syria, Russian military inter- vention has saved President Bashar al-Assad's regime from collapse. Years of fierce battles for the commercial and population centres have not only left a the country devastated by war, but also a regime with greatly reduced capa- bilities to act as a force for order. In the next phase of the conflict, it is likely that negotia- tions about a political solution will gradually take on increasing importance, and for many actors the aim here will be to convert military gains into political influence. The country's old political order has been severely damaged, and the state's ability to ever again establish lasting control over the entire country has been called into question. In Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Mali, too, the loss of state control across large are- as will continue to cause serious problems for years to come. This challenge to the ruling or- der and the resulting power-political shifts are also fuelling the old rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And there is no sign of a politi- jor challenge to Europe's security institutions, in which the goodwill between member states has been eroded by a series of overlapping in- ternal crises, but whose stability since the Sec- ond World War has been one of the foundations of Swiss security and defence policy. Growing pressure from the Mediterranean region Pressure on Europe has also been increas- ing for a number of years in the eastern and southern Mediterranean regions. The Middle East and North Africa and the adjacent Sahel region continue to be the scene of complex and prolonged hostilities that are devastating for the governmental structures and the popula- tions. Following the losses of its strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa in 2017, ‘Islamic State’ has lost the proto-state structure of its caliphate in Iraq and Syria and is turning back into a ter- rorist organisation that aims to continue its fight through clandestine structures operating AUSTRIA AUSTRIA ITALY ITALY SPAIN PORTUGAL MOROCCO ALGERIA TUNISIA LIBYA TURKEY GREECE BULGARIA ROMANIA CYPRUS SYRIA IRAQ EGYPT UKRAINE POLAND CZECH REP.

Overall, the ongoing conflicts are creating a complex series of frac- tures right across the whole region, which is in a state of great turmoil and has not yet seen the end of the upheavals. Europe finally started feeling the effects of these crises in 2015 in the form of jihad- ist terrorism and the arrival of huge flows of refugees and migrants. The fierce battles for cities in Iraq and Syria are provoking acute hu- manitarian emergencies, but also highlight the long-term effects of the destruction of social and state structures in the countries affected. It is not clear at present whether there is any chance that the partially collapsed state order in the region can be restored. For the time be- ing, the factors driving jihadist terrorism and migration movements to Europe thus continue to exert their effect. In 2017, the jihadist threat to Europe manifested itself in a series of at- tacks, in Istanbul, St. Petersburg, Paris, Man- chester, London and Barcelona, and this threat will continue after ‘Islamic State’'s military defeats in Syria and Iraq. Overall migration movements to Europe are below the level of the record year of 2015 but remain high and could once again increase strongly at any time. The EU's agreement with Turkey, under which Turkey takes back migrants who have illegal- ly entered Greece via its territory, is still in force but remains fragile. New measures in the seas between Libya and Italy have also led to reduced migration movements on the central Mediterranean route since mid-2017, but the prospects for the future are uncertain. In the light of this pressure from the eastern and southern Mediterranean region, Europe's relations with Turkey – a NATO member and a key partner in managing migration flows and curbing the terrorist threat – remain vital. In April 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won the referendum he had long sought on transforming Turkey's political system into a presidential one. He has thus succeeded in strengthening his control over Turkey's insti- tutions since the coup attempt of summer 2016, and in paving the way for autocratic, socially conservative rule and for the accelerated de- 200 km TURKEY LEBANON ISRAEL JORDAN SYRIA IRAQ IRAN AZERBAIJAN GEORGIA RUSSIA ARMENIA Black Sea Caspian Sea Mediterranean Sea Istanbul Izmir Antalya Ankara Adana Diyarbakir Mosul Kirkuk Baghdad Damascus Tabriz KURDISH AREA Rojava Kayseri CYPRUS GaziantepAfrin S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 19 velopment of Turkey into an assertive regional power. Turkey perceives the turmoil in Syria and Iraq as a threat to its core national security interests, particularly in the light of the proc- lamation of Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, backed by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey is responding to Europe in an increasingly assertive and decisive way and by using all available resources of state power. The gradual repression of democratic and con- stitutional norms is one aspect of a broader de- velopment. Turkey has ambitions to shape its strategic environment between Europe, Russia and the Middle East independently of West- ern ideas of order, but is acting circumspectly, aware that it cannot sacrifice strategic relations with the West. While negotiations with the EU on the future shape of strategic relations have not been formally terminated, tensions with Europe are increasing. The reasons for this include the exploitation of widely entrenched Turkish nationalism and action against real and alleged opponents of the government, not only in Turkey but also in Europe. After dec- ades of prospects of a partnership developing between Turkey and Europe, relations have reached a critical point where cooperation on migration and counter-terrorism issues as well as NATO's cohesion and operational capability on its south-eastern borders are at stake. Switzerland can not remain immune to the risks caused by the difficult and protracted transformation processes taking place in the Middle East and North Africa. Migration from the crisis areas, especially migration to Europe via Libya, has become one of the two greatest and most pressing challenges, due to its potential consequences for security policy. Europe is working to contain and manage the consequences of the crisis situation, as with- out any imminent prospect of stabilisation in the region, where the disintegration of systems of government does not yet appear to have reached its lowest point, migration pressure on Europe is set to continue at a high level for years to come, which will provide a further boost for nationalist parties. The other major challenge is to tackle the increased threat of terrorism from the region. The phenomenon of jihad-motivated travel, above all the issue of returnees, remains a serious security problem for Western states. Switzerland is among those affected by this. However, the authorities will also need to continue to pay close attention to numerous other problem areas: the threat to the security of diplomatic missions, terrorist threats and kidnappings in the region, the dis- ruption of trade and of energy supplies, coping with sanctions regimes and managing the as- sets of politically exposed persons. Focus: Russia The Russian leadership controls the state via a vast apparatus of government agencies vested with extensive powers to control the domestic situation, the economy and society. This apparatus is mostly led by close associ- ates of the president with a proven personal loyalty to Putin. With this power apparatus consolidated internally, the Russian leadership is now working to restore the historically and ideologically deeply-rooted Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The three Baltic states STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S20 of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, members of NATO and the EU since 2004, are already under considerable pressure from Russia, and this will probably increase still further in the years to come. Jihadist and ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent extremism The terrorist threat in Europe and Switzerland comes primarily from the jihadist movement and its two main actors, ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qae- da. ‘Islamic State’ and the individuals and small groups controlled or inspired by it continue to be the dominant threat. The threat posed by al-Qae- da persists. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened level. Swiss nationals could also fall victim to kidnappings or attacks by terrorists in many places abroad. Ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent ex- tremism remain relevant to the threat situation in Switzerland. The PKK, in particular, has the capacity to mobilise its supporters in Western Europe to take part in coordinated rallies and campaigns at short notice. This could lead to violence, particularly if Kurdish and Turkish nationalist groups were to come into contact with one another. Right-wing and left-wing extremism The potential for violence in right-wing ex- tremist circles remains unchanged, while in left- wing extremist circles it has increased; as far as left-wing extremism is concerned, the situation has become more acute. Violence motivated by left-wing extremism is directed not only against property, but also against those perceived as right-wing extremists and, especially during police operations, against the security forces. When using violence, left-wing extremists often display extreme aggression. They are prepared to run the risk of injuring or killing the persons they attack, and in some cases this is even their aim. Even leaving such confrontations out of the equation, an increased number of acts of vio- lence motivated by left-wing extremism were observed in the year under review. At the same time, there was also an increase in the inten- sity of the forms of violence resorted to. Left- wing extremists maintain and exploit their links with violent left-wing extremist groups abroad. Right-wing extremists are continuing to keep a low profile. Developments regarding asylum and migration have also contributed to the calm situation in this area – but the potential for vio- lence in right-wing extremist circles, especially relating to asylum and migration, remains. Arson attack on the Police and Justice Centre construction site in Zurich; July 2017 S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 21 Proliferation The proliferation of weapons of mass destruc- tion, their delivery systems and the goods nec- essary for their production continues to pose a threat to security in many regions of the world. Switzerland, as a major exporter of dual-use goods, has a particular responsibility here to work to prevent proliferation. The implemen- tation of the framework agreement with Iran continued in 2017, but progress toward the normalisation of economic relations is still hes- itant. Developments in North Korea's weapons of mass destruction programmes have main- tained their momentum. The country's prolifer- ation activities are moving beyond the regional context and becoming a global threat. This has changed the rules of the game for dealing with an illegitimate nuclear weapons programme outside the recognised nuclear-weapon states. Chemical weapons were used in Syria again in 2017. Terrorist groups are showing a clear interest in obtaining expertise on weapons of mass destruction; terrorist groups have in- creased their capabilities to use chemical weap- ons, in particular. The threat posed by prolifer- ation is also drawing closer to Switzerland. Illegal intelligence Illegal intelligence serves the interests of states and in some cases also the private interests of influential persons in these states. Conventional illegal intelligence is a set of long-established practices, which for years now have been sup- plemented by cyber espionage tools. It can be assumed that there is a constant need to procure and update information, occasionally accentu- ated by circumstances in which more specific or more detailed information is required. In- formation is needed in the political, economic and military spheres. Espionage does not just violate the sovereignty of the states in which or against which it is conducted: the data outflow causes direct or indirect damage, members of diaspora communities under surveillance and their relatives in the country of origin may be threatened with serious harm or death, and access acquired by means of espionage may possibly also be used for manipulation or even sabotage. 22 S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 23 Focus: Russia Internal consolidation Under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, Russia has been steadily growing in strength and confidence, in domestic as well as foreign affairs, for nearly two decades. Pu- tin's re-election as president creates the condi- tions for this trend to continue over the next few years. Putin and his regime need domestic stability and continuity in order to be able to pursue an accelerated foreign policy strate- gy aimed at restoring Russia's role as a major power on the international stage. In order to stay in power, Putin and his cronies from St. Petersburg control Russia's domestic political processes and its economy. Key to this control are the so-called power ministries, the most im- portant state agencies for protecting the regime from internal challenges, in particular, but also from external ones. A selection of these agen- cies is described below. Presidential Administration One of the most important management and control instruments is the Presidential Admin- istration under the direction of Anton Waino. It consists of a large number of advisers and offi- cials who influence Russia's domestic, foreign and economic policy. For example, important laws are drafted in the Presidential Administra- tion before they are subsequently submitted to Parliament to be debated and voted on. This is often only a matter of form. The Presidential Administration also oversees the state media and gives them regular and detailed instruc- tions on which topics to report on and what guidelines to follow. The key person in the Presidential Admin- istration is its deputy head Sergei Kiriyenko, who was in charge of Putin's recent election campaign. Kiriyenko was Prime Minister for a short time in 1998 under Boris Yeltsin and then for many years Director General of the State Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom, of which he remains Chairman of the Board of Directors. Kiriyenko enjoys the support of influential bankers from St. Petersburg and has close links to Putin's immediate circle. National Guard In 2016, Putin created a National Guard, which today has more than 300,000 employ- ees, to secure internal control and his personal power. It reports directly to him. The National Guard was, among other things, responsible for security during the presidential elections and, together with other bodies, will also ensure se- curity during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The National Guard's main tasks are to safeguard public order in Russia and to protect state insti- tutions and communication facilities, as well as combating terrorism and extremism. The National Guard has a country-wide presence through its seven regional commands, with a particular focus on the North Caucasus. In addition, it has numerous mobile special units in Moscow that can be dispatched to the regions rapidly if required. Its formation was planned far in advance, with the preparatory FOCUS: RUSSIA S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S24 work being carried out in Putin's innermost circle. The Director of the National Guard is Gener- al Viktor Zolotov, one of the President's closest confidants. From 1999 to 2013, Zolotov was head of the Presidential Security Service, Pu- tin's bodyguard. There is considerable over- lap between the competencies of the National Guard and those of the Federal Security Ser- vice (FSB) and other power ministries. Among the central security agencies, the National Guard also acts as a counterweight to the FSB. Federal Security Service Like the National Guard, the FSB is primar- ily responsible for Russia's internal security. It employs more than 300,000 people and has regional departments spread across the entire country. Its current leadership is made up of individuals belonging to various factions in Putin's entourage. The FSB is thus not run by a homogeneous leadership, which makes Putin's control over the organisation more difficult. One of its most important departments is that responsible for economic security. This is used by the Kremlin e.g. to control the oligarchs and critical financial flows in Russia. Like most other power ministries, the FSB has its own academy, which is one of the country's most prestigious universities. The FSB can therefore now draw on a younger generation of officers who are also familiar with the latest technolo- gies. One of the areas it covers is surveillance of the Internet and offensive cyber campaigns against domestic and foreign organisations. Military Intelligence Service Another large institution in the Russian state apparatus that can carry out cyber operations is the Military Intelligence Service (GU, until 2011 known as the GRU). It reports to the Min- istry of Defence and the General Staff. Besides the GU, there are other organisations in the Ministry of Defence that are active in the cyber arena and have been expanded considerably in recent years. The GU has a large number of National Guard FSB Investigative CommitteeFSO SVRPresidential Administration Petersburg Group (selection) GU Ministry of Foreign Aairs Control of domestic political processes Y.

It also has numerous armed special units reporting to it. These are stationed primarily in the European part of Russia, but are also de- ployed abroad. Estimates of the numbers of personnel in these special units vary widely. Since Putin took office in 2000, the Military Intelligence Service's influence vis-à-vis the FSB has steadily declined. However, it tradi- tionally enjoys the support of the military es- tablishment, and in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis and the deployment of the armed forces in Syria it has regained influence vis-à-vis the other power ministries. Foreign Intelligence Service When conducting activities abroad, both the FSB and the Military Intelligence Service work together with the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Like most other power minis- tries, it reports directly to the President. Since 2016, its Director has been Putin's trusted ad- viser Sergei Naryshkin, who previously held a leading position in the Presidential Adminis- tration and was Speaker of Parliament. Nary- shkin is a political heavyweight who, along with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, is seen as a potential successor to Putin as President. Putin still maintains close links not just with Nary- shkin but with the other members of the SVR leadership. Historically, the SVR evolved out of the former foreign intelligence arm of the Soviet intelligence service KGB. The present SVR Academy is the successor to the former Red Banner (or Andropov) Institute, whose graduates include both Putin and Naryshkin. The number of SVR employees is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000. It is mainly ac- tive in the former Soviet republics, the rest of Europe and the USA. One of its strengths is industrial espionage. Since 2015, it has also had an increasing presence in Syria. Ministry of Foreign Affairs As with most of the other power ministries, Putin has a strong personal influence on the Foreign Ministry. This is exerted primarily through his advisers in the Presidential Ad- ministration. The leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, consists mainly of graduates of the Moscow State Institute of International Re- lations (MGIMO), the training ground for the diplomatic elite. Like the FSB Academy, this is one of the most prestigious universities in Rus- sia. Formally under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Institute is now an in- tegral part of the regime. The Institute's Board of Directors has several dozen members, who are currently among the most influential deci- sion-makers in Russia. Federal Protective Service Like the FSB and the SVR, the Federal Protective Service (FSO) evolved from the structures of the Soviet KGB. Its predecessor organisations in the KGB were responsible for protecting the Communist Party elite. In addi- tion to providing personal protection, it is now primarily responsible for protecting govern- ment buildings, nuclear power plants and insti- tutions which form part of the military-indus- FOCUS: RUSSIA S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S26 trial complex. It has around 40,000 employees. At its core is the Presidential Security Service, formerly headed by the influential commander of the National Guard, General Zolotov. The Presidential Security Service's functions in- clude organising all of the President's foreign travel. The Special Communications and Infor- mation Service is responsible for the operation and security of all information and communi- cation equipment in state institutions. The FSO likewise runs an academy, which also serves as a training ground for other power ministries. Investigative Committee One of Putin's most important domestic po- litical instruments of power is the Investigative Committee, which was detached from the Pros- ecutor General's Office in 2011. Putin uses it primarily to crack down on domestic political opponents, and it is one of the main instruments used by the Kremlin to eliminate extraparlia- mentary opposition. For ten years it has been headed by Alexander Bastrykin, who studied law with Putin at Leningrad University. He has an authoritarian leadership style, keeping a very close eye on politically sensitive cases, in particular. In addition to its headquarters in Moscow, the Investigative Committee has de- partments in many Russian cities, including St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk in Russia's far east. Power ministries and the economy The relationship between the power min- istries is not without friction. Essentially, however, they are instructed by the Kremlin to cooperate. The chief mediator here is Pu- tin, who personally intervenes when rivalries between the power ministries threaten to es- calate. In addition to monitoring political and social processes, the power ministries are also responsible for overseeing the economy. The Russian economy is dominated by large cor- porations, such as Gazprom and Rosneft, and the state banks associated with them. The FSB, in particular, exerts a great deal of influence on the business conglomerates. The corporations' security departments are usually staffed by in- telligence service officers. The most important economic sectors that have close links with the power ministries are the energy industry, the financial sector, the arms industry and the telecommunications and information sector. In return, it is the business conglomerates who finance much of the state budget, and thus also the power ministries, through their tax pay- ments. A symbiotic relationship between the power ministries and the large corporations is thus inherent in the system. The internal consolidation of the Putin sys- tem suggests that the opposition in Russia has a tough job and that the regime's dominance has become virtually unassailable. Apart from its dependency on the key figure of Putin, the only apparent potential weakness of the sys- tem at present is its dependence on oil price movements. The energy corporations tradi- tionally finance about half the Russian state budget. The Russian oil industry is profitable down to a price of around 30 dollars per bar- rel. If the price falls below this threshold for an extended period of time, the Russian econ- omy and thus the Putin system may be desta- S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S FOCUS: RUSSIA 27 bilised. Since its low in 2015, however, the oil price has now risen again to over 60 dollars per barrel. Increasing pressure on Eastern Europe In terms of security policy, one of Putin's most important projects is the re-establishment of a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Eu- rope, a sphere of influence in the sense of a cor- don sanitaire, a buffer zone on Russia's western flank. From Russia's point of view, this sphere of influence covers large areas between the Bal- tic Sea and the Black Sea. Putin considers it his personal historic mission to establish this zone of influence in order to protect Russia from the expansion of the NATO transatlantic alliance under the leadership of the United States. He sees himself in the tradition of Russian tsars of the 17th and 18th centuries, of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, under whose leader- ship the territories which today form the Baltic states, Belarus and Ukraine were conquered. The geostrategic struggle for the area between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea is deeply root- ed in Russian and European history and will determine the relationship between Russia and the transatlantic West well into the 2020s. The Russian armed forces will also play a central role here. Under Putin, these have grad- ually been developed into an instrument that can be deployed in concrete situations. The on- going operations in Ukraine and Syria demon- strate that there is the political will and suffi- cient military potential to deploy the armed forces. Russia has modern weapon systems and can thus demonstrate capabilities on a par with those of Western armed forces. It has success- fully pushed ahead with the consolidation pro- cess in recent years. Under the current arma- ments program running from 2011 to 2020, it will continue to implement its aims of modern- izing its assets according to plan. This is likely to continue at a similar pace in the overlapping follow-on programme from 2018 to 2027. The increased injection of contract staff into the armed forces has led to a significant rise in the levels of training, preparedness and deploy- ability. Several major exercises have demon- strated impressive mobilisation and command and control skills. The nuclear weapon systems of the so-called ‘strategic triad’ continue to be accorded high priority, and Russia invests heavily in their maintenance and renewal. The employment of nuclear weapons is also regu- larly practised, including in basically conven- tional scenarios. The ideological nature of the Russian lead- ership and the historical development of this region provide an indication of the extent of Russia's ambitions in Eastern Europe. Ukraine, where a war with periodic fragile ceasefires has been ongoing since 2014, will remain in the spotlight. Long-term control of Ukraine is key to the establishment of a Russian zone of in- fluence. As events in connection with Ukraine since 2014 demonstrate, Russia is not afraid of using military force. To the north, Belarus has already been very much reintegrated into Russia's sphere of control in recent years. Its economy is largely dependent on the Russian economy. Since the Ukrainian crisis, President Alexander Lukashenko has been trying to pre- vent a ‘Ukraine’ scenario, i.e. war on Belarus soil, and therefore favours developing Belarus FOCUS: RUSSIA S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S28 500 km Volga Vistula Danube Dnieper Ob B l a c k S e a B a l t i c S e a B a re n t s S e a C a s p i a n S e a POLANDPOLAND LITHUANIALITHUANIA LATVIALATVIA BELARUSBELARUS UKRAINEUKRAINE KrimKrim GEORGIAGEORGIA KAZAKSTANKAZAKSTAN AZERBAIJANAZERBAIJAN TURKEYTURKEY ARMENIAARMENIA ESTONIAESTONIA NORWAY SWEDENSWEDEN FINLANDFINLAND GREECEGREECE MAC.MAC.

The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have been members of NATO and the EU since 2004, which is why Russia is avoiding open confrontation with these coun- tries. However, they are already under consid- erable pressure from Russia, which is likely to increase further in the years to come. In addi- tion to the application of political, economic and propagandistic leverage, cyber attacks with far more serious consequences than hith- erto are also a possibility. Russia and Switzerland Internal political and economic consolida- tion has created the essential preconditions for Russia to keep the pressure on Eastern Europe high during what is likely to be Putin's last term in office. The last ten years have been marked by a steady deterioration in relations between Russia and the transatlantic West. The 2008 war in Georgia and the Ukrainian crisis of 2014, as well as the Western sanctions which were imposed in response to them and have been intensified over the past four years, are visible evidence of this. There is currently no sign that Russia's relationship with the West has yet reached its lowest point. On the con- trary, this relationship could deteriorate fur- ther, in line with the trend over the last several years. The tensions between Russia and NATO and between Russia and the EU will continue to have an impact on Switzerland. In the wake of the Ukrainian crisis, measures have been taken in Switzerland to prevent the country being used to circumvent sanctions. In addi- tion, as a non-aligned country, Switzerland is also of particular importance to Russia as an international trading and financial centre. This gives rise to special requirements, particularly when it comes to handling the Russian elite's assets. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 31 Jihadist and ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent extremism The terrorist threat in Europe and Switzerland comes primarily from the jihadist movement and its two main actors, ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda. ‘Islamic State’ and the individuals and small groups controlled or inspired by it continue to be the dominant threat. The threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened level. Swiss nationals could also fall victim to kidnappings or attacks by terrorists in many places abroad. Ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent extremism remain relevant to the threat situation in Switzerland. The PKK, in particular, has the capacity to mobilise its supporters in Western Europe to take part in coordinated rallies and campaigns at short notice. This could lead to violence, particularly if Kurdish and Turkish nationalist groups were to come into contact with one another.

The threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. The regional affiliates of both terrorist organisations pose a threat to Western and thus also Swiss interests primarily in their respective main areas of op- eration. The caliphate loses its territory In 2014 and 2015, ‘Islamic State’ trans- formed itself from a local Sunni jihadist group established in Syria and Iraq under the ideolog- ical umbrella of core al-Qaeda into the domi- nant jihadist terrorist organisation and move- ment worldwide. During the course of 2017, however, it came under increasing military pressure and suffered numerous defeats in its core territory in Syria and Iraq. Having lost its two major centres, Mosul in summer 2017 and Raqqa in autumn 2017, it also lost the bulk of its remaining territories within the space of a few months. Since the end of 2017, its state- like structures, including its openly operating military units, have been annihilated. A large proportion of its leaders and fighters have been killed in battle. Thousands of local fighters have deserted. Some of these have surrendered. However, some of the leaders and fighters have gone underground in their lost territories or have retreated to neighbouring countries, from where they continue to operate in clandestine cells and networks. A few fighters have joined other jihadist groups in the Levant. In Syria and Iraq, a large proportion of the jihad trav- ellers have been killed or been picked up by S I T U AT I O N 200 km TURKEY ISRAEL JORDAN IRAN SYRIA LEBANON IRAQ ‘Islamic State’ February 2018 Territory Lost from February 2017 to February 2018 Tigris DAMASCUS BAGHDAD Aleppo Idlib Homs Dara PalmyraQaryatayn Hamah Al Bab Manbij Tartus Latakia Abu Kamal Al Qaim Al Qamishli Tall Afar Sinjar Arbil Mosul Dahuk Kirkuk As Sulaymaniyah Hawijah Al Hadithah Samarra Hit Ar Rutbah Ar Ramadi Tikrit Bayji Baqubah Karbala Al Kut An Najaf Al Fallujah Azaz KobaneJarablus Tabqah Ar Raqqah Al Hasakah Deir az-Zor Tall al Abyad Mediterr.

Others have travelled on to third countries such as Turkey, gone under- ground or returned to their countries of origin. However, no large-scale movements to other conflict zones where jihadist groups are oper- ating have been observed. ‘Islamic State’ has jihadist competition in Syria ‘Islamic State’ made early preparations for continuing its fight from underground and on a number of fronts, particularly in the second half of 2017, it also pulled out leaders, fight- ers and their families in good time. Many of the structures and networks established in the region therefore still exist. Consequently, even after the loss of its core territories, ‘Is- lamic State’ will be able to continue to make its presence felt in both Syria and Iraq and to undermine its opponents' stabilisation and re- construction efforts by means of intimidating and violent actions. In Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, Or- ganisation for the Liberation of the Levant), in particular, plays an important role in the ji- hadist scene alongside ‘Islamic State’. HTS is an alliance of various jihadist groups and mi- litias; it was founded in January 2017 through the merger of these groups and Jabhat Fath al-Sham (previously Jabhat al-Nusra), which had close links with core al-Qaeda. HTS wants to position itself as the leading coalition in the armed opposition against the Assad re- gime, particularly in the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, and to this end is also tak- ing action against other opposition groups. The leaders of the major subgroups of HTS are all represented on its executive committee. How- ever, in 2017 it became clear that the alliance's internal cohesion is under threat because of ideological differences and personal tensions. JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S34 For a better understanding of ‘Islamic State’, the FIS continues to view it as an integral phenomenon whose trans- national jihadist-Salafist ideology grows on a breeding ground of resentment and which in today's information environment is branching out in six different directions with varying degrees of success. ‘Islamic State’ S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION 35 State ‘Islamic State’ wants to be a state in the literal sense of the word. This ultimate strategic objective still exists, even though its first attempt to establish a state was crushed after about three and a half years, at the end of 2017. Armed group In organisational terms, ‘Islamic State’ should also be viewed as an armed group. The open armed struggle has long contributed to its sense of identity and co- hesion. With the break-up of its state-like structures, the military units which previously operated openly have been destroyed or driven underground. Terrorist actor ‘Islamic State’ has never abandoned its policy of systematically spreading fear and terror: terrorism remains its primary method. With the destruction of the caliphate, the relative importance of this aspect is growing, as in the early days of the organisation. The terrorist activities of ‘Islamic State’ and of the supporters and sympathisers inspired by it take place almost all around the globe. ‘Islamic State’ now also claims responsibility for attacks which it did not carry out itself. Regional power ‘Islamic State’ consists essentially of a strategic lead- ership comprising a small number of men, together with various provinces and affiliated terrorist groups and cells in Syria and Iraq, Africa and Asia. The de- struction of the caliphate in the Levant, where its provinces in Syria and Iraq had temporarily formed a contiguous structure, has done nothing to change this fundamental arrangement. However, ‘Islamic State’'s influence as a regional power declined sig- nificantly in the second half of 2017. Nonetheless, its affiliates outside its core territory continue to operate independently of developments in Syria and Iraq. As a result, ‘Islamic State’ still exerts influence in numer- ous conflict areas worldwide. Inspiration Through its clever use of the information sphere, ‘Is- lamic State’, together with its local supporters and sympathisers, manages to inspire people all over the world to take action. This includes carrying out terror- ist attacks, disseminating propaganda or providing support through donations. However, toward the end of 2017 there was a significant decline in the quality and quantity of its multilingual propaganda products. ‘Islamic State’ has lost much of its former appeal. Utopia The placeless and timeless utopia of an Islamic world state, the caliphate, in which Muslims can live accord- ing to Islamic law, is not a new idea. However, ‘Islamic State’ succeeded in giving this utopia a new form. Despite major international opposition, it was able to attract mass support and to establish and finance a rudimentary state structure, which it also managed to defend and administer for a certain period of time. Furthermore, outside Syria and Iraq, numerous jihad- ist organisations pledged allegiance to ‘Islamic State’, thereby extending its influence and power. Unlike al-Qaeda, ‘Islamic State’ went at least some way to- ward making the utopia reality. JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S36 Core al-Qaeda wants to regain its appeal The most recent attack on European soil for which al-Qaeda claimed responsibility dates back to January 2015; it was targeted at the editorial offices of ‘Charlie Hebdo’ in Paris (France). The fact that al-Qaeda has largely failed to carry out any successful high-profile actions against Western interests has weakened its position vis-à-vis competing jihadist groups. Core al-Qaeda's image was further weakened when Jabhat al-Nusra distanced itself from it in summer 2016. While ‘Islamic State’ has lost its caliphate, core al-Qaeda is working to recover the considerable appeal it once had in the glo- bal jihadist movement. To this end, it is trying to establish Hamza Bin Laden, the son of its killed former leader Osama Bin Laden, as a fu- ture leadership figure. Provinces and affiliates of ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda The degree of cooperation between the core structures of ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda and their respective regional affiliates varies. The affiliates essentially have a high degree of au- tonomy and for the most part pursue a local agenda. A few affiliates, however, have both the ambition and the necessary capabilities and resources to pursue international jihadist goals. The local affiliates of ‘Islamic State’ in Egypt, for example, not only carry out regu- lar attacks on Egyptian security forces, Copts and other Muslims, but also occasionally at- tack international targets, an example being the bombing of a Russian passenger plane in October 2015. North and West Africa In Egypt, the Maghreb and West Africa, sev- eral jihadist groups have pledged allegiance ei- ther to ‘Islamic State’ or to al-Qaeda / al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Libya contin- ues to play an important role for ‘Islamic State’, despite the complete loss of territories which had been temporarily under the latter's control. Whereas ‘Islamic State’ has lost all the territo- ries it controlled in Libya, AQIM has succeed- ed in maintaining its influence in parts of Libya. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION 37 It uses the south of the country, in particular, as a safe haven and supply zone for actions in Mali and other neighbouring states. The security situation in Mali has deteriorated sharply since 2015, partly because of AQIM's terrorist activities. Since then, increasing num- bers of attacks have also been carried out in major centres in West Africa outside AQIM's core area, on targets frequented primarily by foreigners, such as hotels and restaurants; two Swiss nationals were among the victims of an attack in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in Janu- ary 2016. Kidnappings of foreigners in order to finance terrorist activities have also increased since 2015. A Swiss woman abducted in Mali in January 2016 was still being held hostage at the time of going to press. Since March 2017, when AQIM and other jihadist groups merged to form a coalition called ‘Group for the Sup- port of Islam and Muslims’, the terrorist threat situation in Mali has escalated further. This merger has led to an expansion of their area of operations and to more frequent attacks. The jihadist threat is less pronounced in Tu- nisia, Morocco and Algeria, chiefly on account of the effectiveness of the security authorities and comparatively stable political conditions in those countries. Although Tunisia has ex- panded its capacity to combat terrorism over the last two years, attacks by local cells of ‘Is- lamic State’ and AQIM pose a threat to foreign, including Swiss interests, even in urban coastal areas. Central and East Africa The security situation in the states border- ing Lake Chad (Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad) remains precarious due to the terrorist activities of Boko Haram. Since 2009, attacks on the civilian population and security forces have resulted in around 20,000 deaths and dis- placed more than two million people. In August 2016, Boko Haram split into two factions, with one affiliating itself to ‘Islamic State’ under the name ‘West Africa Province’. The split in Boko Haram has done nothing to improve the security situation. The security forces in the re- gion have not succeeded in weakening the two Boko Haram factions significantly, despite in- tensified and better-coordinated countermeas- ures. In East Africa, al-Shabaab still controls substantial parts of Somalia and also continues to pose a threat in Kenya. Arabian Peninsula As a result of the conflict between Houthi militia and the current Yemeni government, which is supported militarily by Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has been able to consolidate its presence in Yemen. AQAP is willing to attack Western targets and has the capabilities to do so. However, its ter- rorist activities are currently focussed primarily on local targets. AQAP and ‘Islamic State’ reg- ularly carry out attacks in Yemen. Compared with AQAP, however, the local affiliate of ‘Is- lamic State’ plays a far less significant role. Afghanistan, Pakistan and South-East Asia Numerous militant Islamist and jihadist groups have a presence in Afghanistan and on the Indian subcontinent. Alongside elements of core al-Qaeda and its local affiliate al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), ‘Islamic State’ JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S38 has also established a presence in the shape of its Khorasan Province (ISKP). Despite major losses, among them several leaders, ISKP has so far managed to survive – in part through col- laboration with other Islamist and jihadist or- ganisations in the region – and to stage frequent major attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In South-East Asia, a number of jihadist groups have been active for a long time. In May 2017, a Philippine affiliate of ‘Islamic State’ recorded a major success when it took over the city of Marawi (population 200,000) on the island of Mindanao. Only after a sev- eral-month-long siege and battles involving heavy losses, as well as the deaths of both the local ‘Islamic State’ leaders in October 2017, was the city declared liberated by the Philip- pine security forces. ‘Islamic State’'s propa- ganda made much capital out of the prolonged resistance, and the battle for Marawi was mar- keted as a new focal point for jihad travellers from across the region. Attacks in Europe The threat of attacks carried out by jihad-mo- tivated lone perpetrators or small groups is present throughout Europe. Analysis of the ma- jor attacks in Europe between 2015 and 2017 shows that the number of attacks has increased steadily over the last three years. Since Febru- ary 2017, there have been just under two dozen attacks and attempted attacks in Europe. Four of these claimed numerous lives and left many injured. A common factor in all the attacks was that the targets were either uniformed police- men and soldiers or passers-by in the centres Copenhagen 14.02.2015 Turku 18.08.2017 Stockholm 07.04.2017 Hamburg 28.07.2017 Ansbach 24.07.2016 Essen 16.04.2016 Berlin 19.12.2016 Spandau 17.09.2015 Würzburg 18.07.2016 Charleroi 06.08.2016 London 05.12.2015 22.03.2017 03.06.2017 25.08.2017 15.09.2017 Manchester 22.05.2017 Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray 26.07.2016 Saint-Quentin 26.06.2015 Magnanville 13.06.2016 Joué-lès-Tours 20.12.2014 Nantes 22.12.2014 Marseille 18.11.2015 11.01.2016 18.04.2017 01.10.2017 Barcelona 17.08.2017 Cambrils 17.08.2017 Nice 03.02.2015 14.07.2016 Brussels 24.05.2014 21.08.2015* 22.03.2016 05.10.2016 21.06.2017 25.08.2017 * Thalys Amsterdam - Paris Paris 07.-09.01.2015 13.11.2015 07.01.2016 03.02.2017 18.03.2017 20.04.2017 06.06.2017 19.06.2017 09.08.2017 15.09.2017 UNITED KINGDOM DENMARK GERMANY BELGIUM FRANCE SPAIN SWEDEN FINLAND S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION 39 of major cities. The bulk of these attacks were carried out by lone perpetrators operating with minimal logistical resources. Knives or vehi- cles were used in around three-quarters of the attacks, with the others involving explosives and (only rarely) firearms. Almost all the per- petrators had been inspired by ‘Islamic State’. However, no evidence was found of a direct link between ‘Islamic State’ and any of the perpe- trators, even where they acted in line with its aims and in some cases verifiably in its name or where ‘Islamic State’ subsequently claimed responsibility for the act. The perpetrators were all male, Muslim and between 17 and 53 years of age (average age just under 30). Most of the perpetrators lived in the state concerned or even near the crime scene. Most came from a migrant background, but had been born in the state in which they carried out the attack and/or had ac- quired citizenship of that state. Approximately half the perpetrators had a North African back- ground. Many of the perpetrators were previ- ously unknown to the security authorities or had attracted their attention only due to involvement in petty crime. Radicalisation in Switzerland The phenomenon of radicalisation in relation to jihadist terrorism continues to be an issue for Switzerland. Despite ‘Islamic State’'s territori- al losses and a discernible decline in the qual- ity and quantity of the terrorist organisation's propaganda activities, individuals from a wide range of backgrounds continue to be drawn to the ideas of jihadist terrorism. The FIS has established through its monitoring of jihadist websites that the majority of the users in Swit- zerland who have come to its attention are still more likely to be ‘Islamic State’ sympathisers, though the proportion supporting al-Qaeda has once again increased. Alongside the consumption of jihadist con- tent on the Internet, personal contacts still play a key role when it comes to radicalisation. Such contacts are also more and more often de- liberately being arranged outside the confines of institutions such as mosques, for example. As elsewhere, there are a few radicalised in- dividuals in Switzerland who devote them- selves to recruitment. They try to win people they know over to Salafism and ultimately to jihad. Particularly in population centres close to borders, there are cross-border links which are also used for recruitment. To counter the recruitement activities of salafist networks, a number of measures have been evaluated and initiated. Measures on the communal and cantonal level to stop ‘Read’ distribution activities, such as the denial of le- gal permits, have been shown to be the most effective means. Since the authorities began to implement these measures in a more consistent way in the early summer of 2017, a significant reduction of ‘Read!’ Quran distribution activi- ties has been observed. Sporadic attempts of ‘Read!’ activists to continue with related activi- ties such as ‘Free Quran’ or ‘We love Moham- med’, have also been stopped. Security authorities are also increasingly fo- cussing their attention on recruitement activi- ties in prisons. Outside Switzerland, a number of attacks have recently been carried out by individuals who had either been radicalised whilst in prison or had radicalised other pris- JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S40 oners. Security authorities in Switzerland have also identified occurrences of radicalisation in penal institutions. Since July 2016, Swiss se- curity authorities also have to face the problem of radicalised individuals, who are released at the end of their prison term, but still represent a threat to Switzerland’s security due to their radical views. This problem is accentuated by the fact that some of the radicalised individuals without Swiss nationality cannot be deported. Information on planned attacks The federal security authorities frequently receive and process information which points directly or indirectly to ideas, intentions or pre- paratory actions in connection with a possible attack with links to Switzerland. In this context, a rise in the number of direct links between ‘Is- lamic State’ and Switzerland has been detected. Based on these findings, a number of individu- als have been arrested, and some of these have already been convicted. Travel movements almost at an end Since summer 2015, the number of persons travelling from Switzerland to conflict areas for jihadist reasons has fallen significantly; since August 2016, the FIS has not recorded any per- sons leaving Switzerland in order to travel to a jihad area. This development is consistent with ‘Islamic State’ propaganda. In 2017, ‘Islamic State’ made several appeals to people not to travel to the caliphate, but to carry out attacks in the name of ‘Islamic State’ where they live. The collapse of the caliphate in the Levant has not so far resulted in a significant rise in the number of persons returning from jihad areas to Europe. And in Switzerland, too, no further returnees have been recorded since the start of 2016. Possible alternative destinations may be third states like Turkey or the countries of origin of the parents or grandparents. Various European states face a situation whereby fami- lies have been started in the caliphate and as a result there are increasing numbers of spouses and minors among the returnees. To date, the FIS is aware of around a dozen women and two dozen children among jihad tourists with direct links to Switzerland. The law enforce- ment agencies are responsible for dealing with such cases. PKK has high potential to mobilise support In Turkey, terrorist activities suspected of being linked to the PKK are down compared to 2016. However, fighting between the armed wing of the PKK and Turkish security forces in the region has continued unabated and is claiming losses on both sides.

In the Kurdish region of northern Syria, the PKK's sister party, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), is using its YPG (People's Protection Units) militia to defend the areas it controls, known as Rojava or the Democratic Feder- ation of Northern Syria. Besides demanding freedom for its symbolic figurehead, Abdul- lah Öcalan, the PKK is focusing its efforts on ensuring the continued survival of Rojava and obtaining international recognition for it. After the referendum on independence for the Kurd- ish area of northern Iraq in autumn 2017, the invasion by Iraq's central government and the economic sanctions by Iran and Turkey did not trigger any countermeasures by the PKK. National Action Plan to prevent and counter radicalisation and violent extremism In December 2017, the Swiss Security Network SSN (Confederation, cantons, cities, municipalities) pre- sented its National Action Plan to prevent and coun- ter radicalisation and violent extremism. The Federal Council took note of the Action Plan and announced its intention to support the implementation of the Ac- tion Plan by funding a five-year stimulus programme. The Action Plan focusses on prevention, one of the four action areas laid down in Switzerland's coun- ter-terrorism strategy. This strategy was ratified by the Federal Council in September 2015. Proposals include the use of tools for early detection, the introduction of a threat management system and the development of measures to promote disengagement and rein- tegration. In addition, the Action Plan recommends various training measures for a wide range of officials and emphasises the foreign policy commitment to preventing violent extremism. It is particularly impor- tant to support and empower children, young people and women as important actors in prevention. These measures are to be implemented by the authorities in collaboration with civil society, and where possible are designed to build on and integrate existing meas- ures and programmes. The report lists the specialist units and contact points which anyone with questions relating to suspected radicalisation can and should contact. Some of these units are run by the police. Anyone who has information on radicalisation or vi- olent extremist or terrorist activities can and should contact them. Anything believed to be suspicious can be reported to any police station and, in urgent cases, by calling the 117 police hotline. This ensures that no time is lost before the police can intervene. In this way, spontaneous communications from the public can be processed efficiently by the cantonal and communal police forces and if necessary forwarded to the spe- cialist units responsible or to other security authorities. Online at: JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S42 In October 2017, rumours about the state of Öcalan's health led to – mainly peaceful – demonstrations across Europe. The partici- pants in the rallies were protesting in particu- lar against the ban on visits imposed by the Turkish government. In Switzerland, most of the protest actions passed off without violence. The PKK leadership ensured this by closely monitoring young activists, in particular, but also its left-wing extremist supporters. The amount of money raised to support the Kurdish cause was up compared with previous years. At present, the mood among PKK supporters is one of frustration because they feel that Eu- rope's stance toward the conflict in the Kurdish regions is too passive. Terrorism-related financial transactions In Switzerland, there is currently little finan- cial activity suspected of funding terrorism. Nonetheless, in 2017 a slight increase was re- corded in transactions out of and into Switzer- land that were suspected of serving Islamist or jihadist purposes. These mainly involved small amounts, which are hard to trace. The most re- liable indicator is provided by the suspicious activity reports (SARs) sent by Swiss financial intermediaries to the Money Laundering Re- porting Office Switzerland (MROS), on which MROS issues a public report annually. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT 43 A S S E S S M E N T ‘Islamic State’ continues to lead the way Despite the loss of most of its territory in Iraq and Syria, ‘Islamic State’ continues to pose a significant terrorist threat to Europe. It retains the capability to launch actions there, albeit in a greatly limited way. As yet, no other jihad- ist organisation in the Levant has been able to take over ‘Islamic State’'s leadership role, and there is no sign of any successor organisation to replace it. For the time being, ‘Islamic State’ therefore remains the leading jihadist terrorist organisation worldwide, but it has lost much of its former potency and appeal. Going back underground The retreat underground and the continuation of the jihadist struggle in the form of a decen- tralised resistance movement employing gue- rilla tactics and terrorist methods should not be viewed as a change in its strategic objectives. Rather, it is a change in the way in which it plans to use violence in order to achieve the strategic objectives. Its withdrawal under- ground takes ‘Islamic State’ back to the place where it enjoyed its initial successes. Today, however, it is able to draw on a wide network that extends beyond the borders of Syria and Iraq and also on the expertise that it has built up over a period of years. The terrorist organ- isation today is more firmly rooted and has a better network of transnational connections beyond its Sunni region of origin than was the case when the caliphate was proclaimed in summer 2014. Some of ‘Islamic State’'s decen- trally organised media structures and logistics cells are probably still in place. After all, dis- semination of ideology over the Internet is not geographically restricted. Another factor is that an important breeding ground on which the ji- hadist ideology has been able to develop has, in the FIS's view, become even more fertile. After the destruction of the caliphate, Arab Sunnis remain the overall losers in the Levant. Loss of the main sources of revenue With the loss of the territories it controlled previously, ‘Islamic State’ has lost its main sources of revenue (taxes, sale of oil and gas, seized cultural objects, fines). The remaining networks and cells therefore finance them- selves primarily through activities familiar from organised crime (extortion, protection money, ransom money, theft, etc.). However, the loss of the territory it controlled, its mili- tary units and the administrative bodies it es- tablished means that its expenses are also de- creasing. Furthermore, promoting its ideology and putting out propaganda on the Internet are inexpensive and can continue even in financial- ly and militarily precarious situations. Al-Qaeda still in the shadow of ‘Islamic State’ The threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. Core al-Qaeda has lost the bulk of its operational capabilities and resources, but it still harbours the intention of carrying out attacks on West- ern targets. Some of its regional affiliates still have considerable influence in their respective JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S44 main areas of operation – e.g. al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), al-Qaeda in the In- dian Subcontinent (AQIS) or al-Shabaab in So- malia. They continue to push for global jihad and attacks on Western targets. Threat in several regions of Africa remains high The activities of jihadist groups and of affil- iates of ‘Islamic State’, AQIM, Boko Haram and al-Shabaab are resulting in a high terrorist threat level in many parts of Africa. In Libya, ‘Islamic State’'s remaining cells are attempting to reorganise themselves. They probably still have the capability to carry out occasional at- tacks in Libya. However, the FIS considers it unlikely that in the short to medium term they will regain the influence and associated territo- rial control they had up until 2016. Jihadist groups in West and North Africa continue to see Western interests as legitimate targets. In West Africa and in the Lake Chad region, the main threat comes from AQIM and its allies and from Boko Haram. In the light of the international jihadist agenda, members of international troop contingents or Western ci- vilians are still likely to be the prime targets in Mali. Similarly, in Somalia, al-Shabaab views all allies of the government, whether domestic or international, as legitimate targets. Jihadist threat in Europe persists Even though the potency, appeal and cred- ibility of ‘Islamic State’ have been severely damaged since summer 2017 and the caliphate was destroyed at the end of 2017, ‘Islamic State’ and its jihadist ideology continue to pose a significant terrorist threat to Europe, includ- ing Switzerland. Its remaining cells and net- works, which are promoting terrorist activities outside Syria and Iraq, are weakened, but they are still active both physically and virtually. In the light of the terrorist attacks in Europe since 2015 and the developments described above, the terrorist threat in many European countries remains heightened or even high. Attacks are still to be expected. These may range from simple attacks by individuals and small groups to complex operations. Attacks involving little logistical effort, executed by jihadist-inspired lone perpetrators or small groups, can be car- ried out irrespective of the strength of ‘Islamic State’ or of al-Qaeda as organisations. Lone perpetrators and small groups inspired by them generally act spontaneously, without any in- structions or financial support from outside. Even larger-scale and more complex attacks S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT 45 involving explosives or simple chemicals such as toxic gases (for example chlorine gas) re- quire relatively few resources and little effort on the part of the perpetrators. The perpetra- tors do, however, need to have the appropriate expertise. Jihadists will therefore continue to be not only willing but also able to carry out both simple and more complex attacks. The FIS considers that, for the time being, the only threat likely to have been diminished by the destruction of ‘Islamic State’'s caliphate is that of complex attacks controlled and carried out directly by ‘Islamic State’. Switzerland as a possible target Switzerland is part of the Western world, classified by jihadists as Islamophobic, and thus from their point of view constitutes a legitimate target for terrorist attacks. Howev- er, in the FIS's assessment– based on jihadist propaganda and on attacks that have taken place and those that have been thwarted – the focus is more on other countries. In the event of attacks on Swiss territory, therefore, the in- terests of other states that are perceived by ji- hadists as being Islamophobic or which play a prominent role in the international fight against jihadism may also be targeted. Jewish interests may also be affected. The FIS assesses that attacks involving min- imal logistical effort, carried out by individual perpetrators or small groups, are currently the most likely threat in Switzerland. In the FIS's view, the risk of copycat attacks in Switzerland will rise temporarily after each attack abroad. Such attacks will not necessarily be jihad-mo- tivated, but may also have a different motive. The perpetrators are most likely to be individ- uals radicalised in Switzerland who have been inspired by jihadist propaganda and personal contacts, but who are not in direct contact with a jihadist group or organisation. These include attacks by mentally ill perpetrators whose radi- calisation is more the result of their illness than of ideological conviction. Switzerland can also be used by jihadists as a logistics base for the preparation of attacks abroad or as a transit country. The most recent example of this is the itinerary followed by two people who were involved in the attacks in Barcelona and Cam- brils in August 2017. In the areas outside Europe in which jihadist groups operate, there is still a risk that Swiss citizens might fall victim to opportunist abduc- tions or acts of violence. Fewer jihad travellers with links to Switzerland ‘Homegrown’ jihadists radicalised in Swit- zerland have become more significant to the threat assessment than jihad-motivated travel- lers. The decline in travel to conflict zones by jihadists with links to Switzerland can be attrib- uted to a number of factors. Reports about the harsh living conditions and ultimately the col- lapse of the caliphate have reduced the appeal of Syria and Iraq to jihad-motivated fighters. In addition, the enhanced countermeasures on the travel routes to Syria and Iraq have made it sig- nificantly more difficult to access the conflict area. Lastly, ‘Islamic State’'s appeals to jihad- ists to carry out attacks in their own country of origin or residence rather than travelling to its territory have probably also had an effect.

Salafist and jihadist groups are exploit- ing this polarisation accordingly. Turkish-Kurdish conflict carries risks The PKK has the capacity to stage demonstra- tions and other actions – including violent ones – at short notice in response to events connect- ed with the conflict in Kurdish areas. Violent clashes between PKK supporters and Turkish nationalists and/or supporters of Turkish Presi- dent Erdogan currently pose the main threat in Switzerland. Confrontations are generally the result of direct provocation. Turkish institutions and agencies (such as clubhouses, Turkish Air- lines (THY) travel agencies and government of- fices), as well as centres and mosques attended by nationalist or Islamist Turks, are all potential PKK targets. The present state of emergency in Turkey means that travellers, wherever they come from, risk being turned away or arrested on arrival if there is even a slight suspicion of their being PKK members or supporting terrorism. This also applies to Gülen supporters. In addition, there is still a heightened risk of attacks in Tur- key, particularly in the major cities. Limited significance of terrorist financing Switzerland as a financial centre does not play a key role in terrorist financing. Whilst there has been an increase in the number of transactions out of Switzerland and within Switzerland which are suspected of being used Travel out of the conflict area in Syria and Iraq is not easy. In addition, most surviving jihad travellers are aware that they will be confronted by the law enforcement agencies, which is why they attempt to go underground or to travel on to third countries. The FIS is therefore not expecting a big influx of returning jihad travellers with links to Swit- zerland, but only isolated individuals. Some jihad travellers from Switzerland have married and have had children in the conflict area. It is therefore to be expected that possible returnees might bring previously unknown persons with them, possibly including minors. This will present new challenges to the authorities at all levels (legal issues, problems of long-term in- tegration and security issues). It will probably take one or two more years until the extent of the threat posed by returnees can be assessed in a more precise way. The targeted exploitation of migration flows to Europe and Switzerland by ‘Islamic State’ or by former jihadist fighters will also remain a real issue. Polarisation can foster radicalisation Jihad-motivated attacks and migration move- ments, particularly in 2015, have contributed to a rise in tensions and to increased politi- cal polarisation in European societies. This is also true in Switzerland, but to a lesser extent. Such polarisation may exacerbate the nega- User with links to Switzerland shares a propaganda image from ‘Islamic State’.

Once funds are outside the country, they become almost untraceable. The impor- tance of informal funds transfer systems is dif- ficult to gauge owing to the lack of possibilities for monitoring them. JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S48 The Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland The function of the Money Laundering Reporting Of- fice Switzerland (MROS) at the Federal Office of Police (fedpol) is to relay and filter information between fi- nancial intermediaries and law enforcement agencies. It is the national central office which, in accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Money-Laundering Act, receives suspicious activity reports relating to terrorist financing etc. from financial intermediaries, analyses them and, where necessary, forwards them to the law enforcement agencies. At the same time, MROS is a specialist authority which annually publishes anonymised statistics on developments in combating terrorist financing etc. in Switzerland and identifies typologies, which are passed on to financial inter- mediaries for training purposes. MROS is not a police agency. It is a member of the Egmont Group, an inter- national association of financial intelligence units. Its goal is to create the conditions required for the secure, fast and legally admissible exchange of information, in order to combat terrorist financing etc. MROS's annual report can be found at: S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK 49 O U T LO O K ‘Islamic State’ will continue its activities For the time being, ‘Islamic State’ remains the dominant terrorist organisation worldwide. In the short term, it will be able to carry out attacks itself, both inside and outside its core territory in the Levant, and to inspire others to do the same, including in Europe. Individual media offices and affiliates of ‘Is- lamic State’ will continue to engage actively in online propaganda. However, their links with their parent organisation will be more blurred and no longer easy to trace. Supporters and sympathisers will play their part in spreading these jihadist messages as widely as possible. Even if in future such messages appear less fre- quently and seem less coordinated and profes- sional, a new set of people will be inspired and radicalised. Together with its supporters and sympathisers, ‘Islamic State’ will continue to shape the terrorist threat situation in the short to medium term. Competition between ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda is intensifying Al-Qaeda is among those profiting from ‘Is- lamic State’'s military defeats in its core territo- ry in the Levant. The competition for the lead- ership role in the jihadist movement has once again become more open, as, despite its rapid rise to power, ‘Islamic State’ never succeeded in superseding core al-Qaeda and its affiliates completely. The outcome of this competition remains uncertain. The key factors are whether ‘Islamic State’ will be able to maintain a min- imum level of organisation, how propaganda from ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda will evolve, and how the various provinces and affiliates and other jihadist groups worldwide will po- sition themselves – particularly if the death or capture of Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi or Ayman al-Zawahiri were to be confirmed. If ‘Islamic State’ were to continue to lose influence or if the organisation in its familiar form were even to vanish and core al-Qaeda to regain its former leadership role in the global jihadist movement, al-Qaeda (and some of its affiliates) might – given its unchanged aspira- tions and the resources available to it – again carry out terrorist actions outside its area of in- fluence. In spite of the collapse of the caliphate, jihadist messages will continue to fall on fertile ground. Ongoing threat in parts of Africa In various regions in Africa, jihadist groups are profiting from a combination of destabilis- ing factors. These include political and ethnic tensions, security vulnerabilities and precari- ous economic and social conditions. The FIS considers it unlikely that there will be a sub- stantial improvement in these underlying con- ditions in the short to medium term. It must therefore be assumed that the jihadist threat in the African regions listed above will remain high. It is also likely that rival jihadist groups will continue to vie with one another for su- premacy in their respective areas of operation. In order to strengthen their position against ri- JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S50 val groups, these groups will seek to carry out spectacular attacks that will attract wide media coverage or to take Westerners hostage. Threat to Switzerland persists In Europe and Switzerland, the primary terrorist threat comes from jihadist terrorism. Future terrorist events will range from simple attacks by lone perpetrators and small groups to more complex operations involving firearms, explosives or simple chemicals such as toxic gases. For Switzerland, however, attacks in- volving minimal logistical effort, executed by lone perpetrators or small groups, are the most likely type of threat. Swiss interests abroad may also continue to be the target of attacks; the risk of abduction persists. It is anticipated that there will be isolated cases of jihad return- ees to Switzerland. The arrival of persons pre- viously unknown to the authorities must also be expected. Preventing radicalised individuals or small groups from carrying out attacks remains a ma- jor challenge. The fact that they prepare clan- destinely and often commit crimes using tools such as knives or motor vehicles, which are readily available and do not arouse suspicion, make early detection more difficult. While it can be assumed that certain targets are more or less likely to be chosen, ultimately it is almost impossible to predict in advance which targets terrorists actually have in their sights – except where specific and credible evidence is avail- able. Radicalisation as a social problem The problem of the radicalisation of – mainly young – individuals is one which will persist in Switzerland, as elsewhere, and will possibly become even more acute. Salafist and jihadist groups and organisations will continue delib- erately exploiting tensions in society for prop- aganda purposes in order to exacerbate nega- tive feelings in the Muslim community and to win individuals over to their cause. The debate about a general ban on face coverings will be a test of this prediction. Turkish-Kurdish conflict continues The PKK will probably continue to hold pro- test rallies and cultural events, the majority of which will be peaceful. However, occasional riots and violent actions must also be expected in Switzerland, particularly during emotionally charged rallies. Recruitment efforts are likely to intensify. The PKK is constantly searching for suitable young people to fight on the front line or to join the ranks of the organisation in Europe. Both fighters who have fallen in Turkey or Syria and returnees are idolised as heroes and provide the motivation for young Kurds to carry out revenge or copycat attacks.

As a financial centre, Switzerland could be used for transferring such funds. Even in the future, however, the scale of terror- ist financing in Switzerland is likely to remain small. If terrorist networks were to make more systematic use of alternative funds transfer sys- tems in Switzerland, then it could increase in volume. New technologies such as the use of social media for crowdfunding or virtual cur- rencies like Bitcoin have as yet played only a minor role. However, crowdfunding, in par- ticular, is likely to become more important in future.

His friends there had recommended that he should not go out alone at night. He himself did not share this view. He thought himself safe where others felt threatened. Coming from a Swiss background, he found it difficult to assess the situation at his holiday location correctly. Travel advice The FDFA's travel advice can provide guid- ance here. It focusses on the political situation and crime levels and highlights the risks abroad for travellers. In addition, it provides not only country-specific information but also many uni- versally valid, non-country-specific tips and in- formation relating to all aspects of travel. The other side of the coin The Swiss national holidaying in Central America objected that the travel advice, just like the advice from his friends, seemed to him too dramatic. He had not been robbed, nor had he felt threatened. It is true that the travel advice focusses on risks. That is its job. Whereas tourism advertis- ing extols the virtues of tourist attractions and beaches, the travel advice tends to show the other side of the coin. What is in the travel advice is based on veri- fied information and long-term observations. If you know the risks and take precautions, you may never see the other side of the coin yourself. Sources of information for the travel advice Swiss embassies abroad are the main source of the information which goes into the travel advice. These draw on a large network of con- tacts: the authorities of the country concerned, Swiss companies and private individuals who are based in the country, local and indigenous non-governmental organisations, other embas- sies and personal contacts. When evaluating the terrorist threat, for example, information from the intelligence services is added. This broadly-based, long-term observation distin- guishes the travel advice from the individual snapshots provided by travel blogs. Attacks and abductions Another aspect of the other side of the coin are attacks and abductions, which provoke a range of emotions and responses. If for a certain length of time no further at- tacks have been carried out or no further abduc- tions have taken place at a particular location, interested parties and travellers sometimes re- quest the travel advice service to stop mention- ing these risks. However, the key point is not how long it has been since an attack or an ab- duction took place, but whether the threat still exists. For example, it is easy to forget that at the time this report went to press, several West- erners, including a Swiss woman, were still be- ing held hostage in the Sahel region.

If an attack is carried out, however, anxious travellers frequently expect the FDFA to act quickly to advise against travel to the destina- tion concerned. Particularly if they have been informed by their insurance company or their travel agency that the cancellation costs of the planned travel will be covered only if the FDFA is advising against travel to the country con- cerned. In view of the impossibility of predicting attacks, the FDFA does not generally advise against travel to cities and countries which could be or already have been affected by such attacks. The risk is present in virtually every country and especially in places where large numbers of people gather. On the other hand, the FDFA does advise against travel to countries or parts of countries in which there is a high risk of abductions by terrorist groups. This is because terrorists often deliberately seek out foreign nationals as victims in order to make political demands. Abductions can drag on for years and be accompanied by enormous physical and mental stresses on the abduction victims and their relatives. Personal responsibility Use of a wide range of sources, long-term situation monitoring and consultation with var- ious offices within the FDFA ensure that the travel advice provides as objective as possible an assessment of the situation. Travel operators and travel insurance compa- nies decide independently whether travel will go ahead or cancellation costs will be covered. In the same way, you take responsibility for de- ciding whether or not to undertake a journey. You must also decide yourself whether and where you go out for a walk at night. Howev- er, you would certainly be well advised to heed the travel advice – and the recommendations of your local contact person. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 55 Right-wing and left-wing extremism The potential for violence in right-wing extremist circles remains unchanged, while in left- wing extremist circles it has increased; as far as left-wing extremism is concerned, the sit- uation has become more acute. Violence motivated by left-wing extremism is directed not only against property, but also against those perceived as right-wing extremists and, espe- cially during police operations, against the security forces. When using violence, left-wing extremists often display extreme aggression. They are prepared to run the risk of injuring or killing the persons they attack, and in some cases this is even their aim. Even leaving such confrontations out of the equation, an increased number of acts of violence motivated by left- wing extremism were observed in the year under review. At the same time, there was also an increase in the intensity of the forms of violence resorted to. Left-wing extremists maintain and exploit their links with violent left-wing extremist groups abroad. Right-wing extremists are continuing to keep a low profile. Developments regarding asylum and migration have also contributed to the calm situation in this area – but the potential for violence in right-wing extremist circles, especially relating to asylum and migration, remains. Extremism Violent right-wing extremism Violent left-wing extremism RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S56 Left-wing extremism: the situation has deteriorated In 2017, there were 16 incidents connected with violent right-wing extremism and 200 incidents connected with violent left-wing ex- tremism of which the FIS is aware; incidents merely involving graffiti have not been not recorded. In the case of right-wing extremism, this represents a decrease of around 30 per cent, while in the case of left-wing extremism it rep- resents a decrease of around 6 per cent. Due to the low nominal values, however, no trends can be derived from the annual fluctuations. A look back at the figures over several years nonethe- less initially confirms a general trend which has been observed for some time: recorded events involving right-wing extremism are rare, while those involving left-wing extremism are com- paratively frequent – in the latter case, barely two days pass without an incident, rather than over three weeks in the former case. Of greater importance to the situation as- sessment are the figures for events involving violence. In the case of right-wing extremism, just one violent incident was observed – con- firming the long-term trend. By contrast, acts of violence involving left-wing extremism have increased by over 30 per cent in absolute terms, and their share of the total number of events motivated by left-wing extremism has risen from 28 to 50 per cent. The same picture of a deteriorating situation emerges when the intensity of violence motivated by left-wing extremism is included: disregarding serious physical violence against the security forces during rallies, the left-wing extremist scene had for years employed more moderate forms of violence. Instead of fire, paint was used, and bomb attacks were rarely carried out – even in 2017, only two attempted attacks using an im- provised explosive and incendiary device were identified. Since the spring of 2017, however, arson attacks have become more frequent; as regards acts of sabotage, the element of sym- bolic protest has become less important – the actions are intended not only to attract atten- tion, but also to achieve an impact, i.e. to pre- vent a deportation or to paralyse public trans- port, for example.

The FIS rarely has occasion to record an incident, though there probably are some unreported cases; in public, right- wing extremism is barely noticeable. This re- straint has been noted for years. The only act of violence committed by right-wing extremists was a knife attack in Ticino in December 2017, carried out under the influence of alcohol on an individual with different political views. In 2017, the extreme right-wing scene held three concerts of which the FIS is aware. These concerts were monitored by the author- ities more closely than prior to the concert in October 2016 in Unterwasser SG: one was prevented altogether, in the case of the sec- ond, entry bans were imposed on two of the three bands, and the FIS only found out about the third – a ‘Liederabend’ (evening of song performances) – after the event. Even though no right-wing-extremist-motivated attacks on institutions connected with the asylum system were observed in 2017, these remain possible. The motive for throwing a magnesium torch at the transit centre in Enggistein near Worb BE at the beginning of January 2018 and the identity of the perpetrator/s were still unclear at the time of going to press. There is one exception to the general tone of restraint: the Résistance Helvétique, which is mainly active in French-speaking Switzer- land, continues to attract public attention from time to time. On the other hand, there has been no sign of the usual celebration by right-wing extremist groups of anniversaries marking oc- casions in Swiss history. When right-wing ex- tremism has been discussed in the media, this has been a call to arms for left-wing extrem- ists, who have sometimes used physical vio- lence against people who, for example, were involved in an event. Arson attack on a construction vehicle; Zurich, June 2017 RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S58 than a quarter of all recorded events revolved around ‘repression’, most of them specifically targeting the Bässlergut; only occasionally did actions not involve violence. The arson attacks on construction company vehicles went be- yond the usual levels of damage done to prop- erty (see graphic). The series of attacks has continued. In addition to the arson attacks, vehicles were damaged, and prior to the campaign a list of companies involved in the construction work was published on a relevant online plat- form. Admissions of responsibility by individ- uals suggest that anarchists were behind the at- tacks. The list of possible targets underlines the campaign-like nature of the attacks and is rem- iniscent of last year's mobilisation against the ‘machinery of deportation’. Finally, it should be noted that campaigns against ‘repression’ are also taking place in other European countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany. These also employ arson attacks and are thought by the authorities to have been carried out by an- archists. It is possible not only that these cam- Left-wing extremism Just a few years ago, the left-wing extremist scene was very much turned in on itself and was unable to find either an inspiring cause or a platform for its actions. In 2014, it seemed that the use and development of urban spaces and the free spaces movement was becoming a focal point of left-wing-motivated activities, and in 2017 it was the campaign against the ‘machinery of deportation’, but because of the current easing of tensions over asylum and mi- gration, this campaign has largely run out of steam, except in Basel-City. There, the use of the Bässlergut prison as a ‘deportation prison’ provides a reference point for attacks on the asylum system. The main emphasis of the campaign against the Bässlergut, however, is on ‘repression’, which in turn is something that has been on the scene's agenda for years. Besides the Bässler- gut, it has also focussed on the Police and Jus- tice Centre (PJZ) in Zurich, with companies involved in the construction projects being attacked as part of a targeted campaign.

Independently of the campaign, the issue of ‘repression / police presence’ was the justifica- tion for left-wing extremists' use of violence. Violence is directed primarily against securi- ty forces, but also against employees of the emergency services in general. They are pre- pared to run the risk of injuring or killing peo- ple, and in some cases this is even their aim. Whereas in the past demonstrations offered the main opportunity for brutality against the police, now police officers are also being at- tacked when they come across a group of left- wing extremists whilst on duty. For example, on 22 December 2017, on-duty police were attacked with stones and bottles by around two dozen people on the forecourt of the Rid- ing School in Bern. Four days later in Zurich, 200 people attacked police officers with stones, bottles and iron bars. By contrast, in a similar situation on 23 December 2017 in Basel-City around a hundred left-wing extremists were persuaded to withdraw peacefully. On New Year's Eve in Geneva, on the other hand, bot- tles and stones were thrown at the police, who had been compelled to intervene to deal with a temporary house occupation to hold an unau- thorised party. Serious acts of violence have also been re- corded in relation to issues other than ‘repres- sion’. Mirroring the acts of sabotage on the railway network in the Zurich area and the at- tack on the police radio tower at Waid in Zurich in June and July 2016 respectively, there was an attack on the antenna systems on the Gurten and Ulmizberg mountains in Bern canton in June 2017, which in all probability was left un- finished. There were four further arson attacks in the canton of Zurich: attacks were carried out on a post office ATM and a bank branch in April 2017, while Turkish targets were attacked in January and May of the same year. Other than this, the situation that presents itself is the usual one: the World Economic Fo- rum (WEF) and Labour Day are focal points of left-wing extremist attention, as are events abroad such as G20 summits. In January 2018, left-wing extremists held protests against the WEF on the usual scale, which has declined since the anti-globalisation movement stopped mobilising support. The US President's visit to the WEF did nothing to change this, although his presence meant that greater numbers of peaceful demonstrators were recorded. Free spaces and – depending on the particular per- son imprisoned – prisoner solidarity will con- tinue to be focal issues. Particularly in the free spaces movement, for example in connection with the clearance of squats, there is a will- ingness on the part of left-wing extremists to use violence. The issue of asylum and migra- tion offers mobilisation potential that can be tapped into at any time. In addition, it is cur- rently noticeable that left-wing extremists are violently attacking their right-wing extremist counterparts or associated individuals who at- tract their attention. Time and again, the police are called on to prevent violent confrontations. In addition, the left-wing extremist side tries to expose and pillory its opponents – particularly on the Internet. RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S60 International links Both the right-wing and left-wing extremist scenes in Switzerland have international links. In the right-wing extremist scene, there are international links on two levels. Firstly, there are the two international skinhead organisa- tions, Blood & Honour and Hammerskins, which have been in existence since the 1980s. They have their roots in the UK and the USA, and offshoots have long been established in Switzerland. Personal acquaintances form the second level of international links in the right- wing extremist scene. The concert at Unterwas- ser in October 2016 showed the scale of the ca- pacity for concerted action within an individual skinhead organisation. Swiss right-wing ex- tremists continue to attend concerts and events abroad, sometimes not only as consumers: they also give concerts as members of bands or ap- pear as speakers. The influx of German and French right-wing extremists into Switzerland in recent years has allowed members of these groups and their Swiss counterparts to get to know one another. However, it should be noted that when foreign right-wing extremists have taken up residence it has so far not been for political reasons and has not led to changes in behaviour in the Swiss scene. For left-wing extremists, personal network- ing is more important than institutional struc- tures. One worth mentioning, however, is the long-established Marxist-Leninist Secours Rouge International. This also has links to the anarchist/autonomous scene. Police arrests in connection with violent crimes and court con- victions in Germany and France have shown that Swiss left-wing extremists also engage in violent actions outside the country's borders. International networking was also evident dur- ing the violent protests against the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. There are indications that actions were jointly planned in advance by exponents from different countries and carried out during the summit. The internationalist self-image of left-wing extremism and its search for platforms have repeatedly led it to take up crises and devel- opments abroad as issues. For example, since the battle against ‘Islamic State’ to liberate Kobane, it has taken a stand in support of the Kurds, and is promoting a positive counter-im- age to the so-called neo-liberal societies of the West under the name ‘Rojava’. It continues to support Turkish left-wing extremists and Kurd- ish groups, for example the PKK, at demon- strations. In this context, it should be noted that left-wing extremists comply with the instruc- tions of the respective demonstration organis- ers. This currently means that, for example in the context of a Kurdish demonstration, they do not act violently.

Language barriers may play a role here, but the left-wing extremist scene, in particular, is actively trying to over- come them. The prohibition in Germany of the website ‘linksunten.indymedia’, which is used for calls to violence, was also discussed in Switzerland, although the Swiss scene was not reliant solely on the use of ‘linksunten. indy media’ for its own communications, but also had and still has its own platforms on the Internet. Right-wing extremists continue to keep a low profile, including online: beyond Switzerland's borders, they make intensive use of social media for communication, internal information and maintaining contacts, but they have scarcely any public platforms. RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S62 A S S E S S M E N T Right-wing extremism In last year's assessment of right-wing ex- tremism, it was still unclear how the scene would react to the major event at Unterwass- er SG. It has since become clear that it does not see the fact that the event was able to take place in Switzerland as a sign that it will be able to maintain a higher profile in this country. The response of the public, up to and includ- ing violent actions by left-wing extremists, is too unanimous. The Swiss authorities set clear boundaries for extreme right-wing activities. However, on 15 July 2017 an event with 6,000 visitors was held in Themar (Germany), which was organised by the same group of German nationals as the event in Unterwasser. The organisers had also included speeches in the programme and were thus able to contend in court that this was a political assembly. The next such event took place at the same location just two weeks later. As there are currently no rejection factors in Germany and no attraction factors in Switzerland, there is only a slight probability that a right-wing extremist event of the same magnitude as the Unterwasser concert will be repeated in Switzerland in the foresee- able future. On its own, the Swiss scene would probably not be able to organise an event of this magnitude even if it wanted to. On the other hand, the fact that the scene maintains a low profile and does not make many appearances does not mean that it has lost its potential for violence. In this respect, two circumstances which have not changed should be pointed out. Firstly, some right-wing extremists are armed and carry weapons. Fire- arms are collected and traded, and there are col- lections of functioning weapons in the hands of right-wing extremists. Secondly, they practise the use of firearms and train in martial arts. Left-wing extremism The anarchist/autonomous ideology is becom- ing more important than its communist (primar- ily Marxist-Leninist) rival. This means on the one hand that the targets of campaigns are be- coming more diverse and on the other hand that sabotage is playing a more important role. The attacks on communications equipment mentioned above show that sabotage is becom- ing more important. The arson attacks on con- struction vehicles also fit into this category. The campaign against the Bässlergut and the PJZ is aimed at getting them to drop the construction projects: they are trying to persuade companies Flyer for a right-wing extremist event in Germany featuring a Swiss band; May 2017 S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT 63 to cease their involvement in the projects, with the result that construction cannot go ahead. However, arson attacks and damage to property also delay the work on site and must therefore be classified as acts of sabotage. Whereas the FIS is notified of such major incidents, there are many minor acts of sabotage which escape its notice. At rallies, for example, damage to property, including the insertion of coins cov- ered with glue into public transport ticket vend- ing machines, is frequently reported. Outside the context of demonstrations, such actions go largely unnoticed. It is just as difficult to provide conclusive evi- dence of the proliferation of the targets attacked. The range of left-wing extremist issues is broad; any issue may be taken up as a cause. Despite its ideologically heterogeneous nature, the scene is united in its broad rejection of existing condi- tions. However, over the years it has lacked a central theme around which it could mobilise: it is now trying to give itself one through targeted and realistic campaigns. By doing so, however, it is itself once again limiting the range of pos- sible targets, and this also makes them easier to predict. At the moment it is impossible to make a definitive assessment of how many left-wing ex- tremists were actually behind the intensified use of violence in the campaign against the Bässler- gut and the PJZ. Furthermore, it should be not- ed that left-wing extremists can also achieve a great deal of success with smaller, limited ac- tions. In reaction to calls for such actions, events are frequently cancelled because the organisers have security concerns or because they are un- willing or unable to take the necessary measures. Demonstration by left-wing extremists; Bern, October 2017 RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S64 O U T LO O K Potential triggers of violence As will be explained further in the section be- low, no change in the situation is expected with regard to right-wing extremism. The use of vi- olence is likely to remain rare and episodic in nature, with alcohol likely to be the main disin- hibiting factor. Given the constant potential for violence, however, this remains an uncertain prognosis. What can be indicated more clearly are developments or events that could change the situation, at least temporarily: if numbers of migrants and asylum seekers rise rapidly or if a jihad-motivated attack takes place in Swit- zerland, violent reactions motivated by right- wing extremism might follow. These are likely to be spontaneous actions without a great deal of preparation, rather than complex, coordinat- ed actions. Acts of violence against migrants or Muslims could also be perpetrated by persons outside the right-wing extremist scene, since xenophobia and racist or Islamophobic atti- tudes are not limited to right-wing extremists. The potential for violence in the left-wing extremist scene has increased and is currently manifested in an increased willingness to use greater violence and thus to run the risk of pos- sibly being penalised more severely. It is cur- rently impossible to gauge the role played here by left-wing extremists from countries where the potential for violence is higher. There are three drivers of violence: ▪ Rallies offer the opportunity to commit se- rious violence from under the protection of the crowd. Victims of such violence, which is targeted at people and where injury or death is accepted as a possible outcome or is sometimes even the aim, may include members of the security forces or politically unpopular individuals, but also random pas- sers-by. Even encounters between groups of left-wing extremists and police officers on unrelated duty can lead to violent attacks – the basic potential for aggression toward the security forces is high. ▪ Violence is provoked when left-wing ex- tremists go beyond merely reacting to daily political events and concentrate their ac- tions into targeted and realistic campaigns. This has increasingly been the case since 2016. Perhaps they have also learned from campaigns like Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, which would not be surprising, as animal rights extremists who are prepared to use violence have, after all, been an in- tegral part of the left-wing extremist scene for years. ▪ Anarchism is gaining in importance at the expense of communism, and so therefore is the desire to damage the ‘system’ as such. Right-wing extremism Right-wing extremists lack a strategy and thus the impetus to take action. Their passive attitude is reinforced by public hostility and the predictable personal consequences of being recognised as a right-wing extremist. The most that is therefore likely to happen in the near fu- S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK 65 Left-wing extremism Whilst construction work is still ongoing, both the Bässlergut in Basel-City and the Po- lice and Justice Centre in Zurich will remain a target for actions motivated by left-wing ex- tremism. Extension of the campaign to similar construction projects in French-speaking Swit- zerland has already been broached in left-wing extremist circles and is therefore likely to hap- pen. The intensity of any violence used will also depend on whether and when the perpetrators are arrested and subsequently convicted. So far, the law enforcement agencies' successes have calmed the situation, in part simply by taking the potential perpetrators out of circulation, but they have also had a general deterrent effect. The more the extremists' actions are embedded in a targeted and realistic campaign, the worse the prospects of calming the situation. ture is that there will be attempts to stage small- er events or take impromptu action; other than that, the scene will be preoccupied with estab- lishing new structures. As usual, events will be prepared in secret and, where possible, carried out in such a way that they will not have any personal consequences. Because of the ano- nymity they offer, social media will remain a preferred channel for the communication and dissemination of their views. Right-wing populist discourse and successes in Europe and elsewhere in the world will con- tinue to present both an opportunity and a risk for right-wing extremists in Switzerland. On the one hand, the scene might attract an influx of new recruits or at least gain popularity with- out having to do much itself, but on the other hand, adherents who are not fully committed to the ideology might drift away and opportuni- ties for recruitment might diminish. Currently, however, there is no sign of the scene drying up. There is also a possibility that right-wing extremists might once more try to gain a foot- hold in the political system and stand for elec- tion. However, a few years ago such intentions were translated into reality only in isolated cases and were ultimately unsuccessful. Such an attempt would in turn be a boost to those advocating refraining from violence.

In compliance with the FIS’s statutory remit, it asked about right-wing extremist and left-wing extremist actors who had used vio- lence or were prepared to do so. The result is a snap- shot of the potential for violence of the two scenes. This survey is only of limited comparability with the data published in ‘Switzerland's Security 2014’. De- spite this methodological limitation, it is safe to as- sume that the two scenes have decreased in size in recent years. It is also evident that in the left-wing extremist scene, there is a clearer distinction than was previously the case between groups prepared to use violence and moderate sympathisers. The FIS puts the number of right-wing extremists in Switzerland who are prepared to use violence at around 350. Approximately a quarter to a third of these are not only prepared to use violence but have actually engaged in violence. The biggest numbers of right-wing extremists prepared to use violence were identified in the cantons of Aargau, Bern, Geneva, Zurich, Waadt, Wallis, Schwyz and St. Gallen. Right- wing extremism still tends to be a phenomenon more associated with rural areas. The number of left-wing extremists in Switzerland who are prepared to use violence is again an esti- mate; it is put at around 1,000. Approximately a third of these can be seen as having actually engaged in violence. The most notable centres are Zurich, Geneva, Bern, Basel-City and Lucerne, as most left-wing ex- tremists are based in urban environments. However, left-wing extremists may also be active in rural areas, in particular in the anti-fascist movement. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 67 S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 69 Proliferation The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and the goods nec- essary for their production continues to pose a threat to security in many regions of the world. Switzerland, as a major exporter of dual-use goods, has a particular responsibility here to work to prevent proliferation. The implementation of the framework agreement with Iran continued in 2017, but progress toward the normalisation of economic relations is still hes- itant. Developments in North Korea's weapons of mass destruction programmes have main- tained their momentum. The country's proliferation activities are moving beyond the regional context and becoming a global threat. This has changed the rules of the game for dealing with an illegitimate nuclear weapons programme outside the recognised nuclear-weapon states. Chemical weapons were used in Syria again in 2017. Terrorist groups are showing a clear in- terest in obtaining expertise on weapons of mass destruction; terrorist groups have increased their capabilities to use chemical weapons, in particular. The threat posed by proliferation is also drawing closer to Switzerland. Proliferation Nuclear threat North Korea Iran PROLIFERATION | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S70 North Korea North Korea is pressing ahead with the ex- pansion of its missile and nuclear weapons pro- gramme. In September 2017, the country test- ed its largest nuclear explosive device to date. Comparison of the seismic data with previous tests puts the yield of the explosion at around 300 kilotons. Following the failed attempt in 2016, it can be assumed that in this case a two- stage thermonuclear weapon was tested success- fully. The observed yield of the explosion proba- bly also represents approximately the maximum possible for a test on the Punggye-ri site which has so far been used. In 2017, North Korea also tested new types of missiles. In May, an intermediate-range missile known as the Hwasong-12 was launched suc- cessfully for the first time. This type was re-tested in August and in September. It was demonstrated to have a range of over 3,500 kilometres. In July, North Korea twice tested a Hwasong-14 missile, which is the first North Korean weapons system capable of reaching North America. The maiden flight of a Hwasong-15, which potentially has a global range, took place at the end of November. All three missiles probably use different variants of the same newly developed basic engine. Iran The nuclear agreement with Iran remains in force, despite contradictory signals from the USA. Iran has complied with the provisions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and this has been confirmed sever- al times by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. The implementation of the agreement, and in particular the normalisation of economic relations between Iran and West- ern countries, which have been tense for dec- ades, is a process that will require years to be accomplished in depth. In the absence of rapid economic improvements, the Iranian regime faces the challenge of explaining this reality to its population. In its missile programme, Iran is largely demonstrating restraint as regards its test series. The country has also declared a moratorium on the development of missiles with a range of more than 2,000 kilometres. In stark contrast to this, however, Iran employed ballistic mis- siles against targets in Syria in summer 2017. Compared to the well-known Scud family of rockets, the systems used here are character- ised by greater accuracy and are much easier to deploy. Furthermore, a report to the Security Council by the UN Secretary-General suggests that Iran is also involved in the use of ballistic missiles from Yemen against targets in Saudi Arabia. Technical analysis of the debris in the target area following such deployment pro- vides valuable information about the origin of individual components of the missile. These could also have been produced in the West. Syria Chemical weapons were again used in the Syrian civil war in 2017. Despite formal chem- ical disarmament in Syria, chemical weapons S I T U AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S PROLIFERATION | SITUATION 71 and chemicals used for combat purposes are still available. Disarmament cannot prevent that the necessary know-how for the produc- tion of such substances, their handling and ac- tual use remains available in the region of con- flict. As a consequence, the capability to use chemical weapons and substances for terror attacks, including in Europe, will also remain. Pakistan Pakistan is continuing the steady build up of its arsenal of nuclear weapons and the associated delivery systems. In 2017 it continued to test bal- listic missiles and cruise missiles which can be equipped with nuclear warheads. Pakistan shows a great deal of interest in goods from Switzerland and is always prepared to violate the internation- ally agreed export control regulations, including those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Pakistan is massively expanding its production of weap- ons-grade fissile material, namely plutonium and highly-enriched uranium, and continues to be reliant on special equipment, for example in the area of vacuum technology, to do so. As re- gards delivery systems, Pakistan is working on systems with a greater range, of up to just under 3,000 kilometres. At the same time, the country is developing delivery systems for the tactical employment of nuclear weapons and is striving to achieve a second-strike capability using sea- based systems.

Switzerland now falls within the range of another state which can threaten it with nuclear weapons from its own sovereign territory, and moreover a state which regularly violates the norms of international law. What matters here is not just the capability to carry out a direct kinetic attack. A state that has the capability to employ nuclear weapons worldwide is also able to threaten the global information society, for example by detonating a nuclear explosive device outside the Earth's atmosphere in order to generate an electromagnetic pulse. If this were done over the west coast of America, for example, it would have a substantial effect on global data networks and would have a direct impact on everyday life in Switzerland. ~ 6 0 0 k m ~ 1600 km ~3500 km ~7 80 0 k m ~9800 km ~8700 km USA JAPAN Guam (USA) Hawaii (USA) Los Angeles San Francisco SOUTH KOREA SWITZERLAND NORTH KOREA S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S PROLIFERATION | OUTLOOK 73 O U T LO O K Risks will become more specifically identifiable Preventing the supply of controlled goods and technologies to proliferation-relevant states and implementing the applicable em- bargo regulations are important challenges for Switzerland. Switzerland has excellent indus- trial capabilities and offers an attractive and, by international standards, open research location that is benefiting from the trend toward isola- tion in other regions of the world. The Swiss model combines a high degree of openness compared to other research locations with light government regulation. Switzerland thus has to find a balance between freedom and security. The FIS is therefore intensifying its efforts to seek close links with partners in industry, ed- ucation and research with whom it can collab- orate to protect Switzerland from the risks of proliferation activities by foreign states. This mandate is explicitly enshrined in the new In- telligence Service Act. Switzerland is also working closely with its partners abroad. Cross-border procurement at- tempts by proliferating countries are regularly identified and jointly prevented. The employment of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in conflict regions will trigger investigations in the states concerned and will reveal information about the components used. The traces of these flows of goods will in some cases lead to producers in Western industrial- ised countries and will disclose the procure- ment channels used. Similar considerations apply where chemical substances may have been used as a means of terror. In this sense, the risks of proliferation are becoming more visible and are perceptible to a wider public. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 75 Illegal intelligence serves the interests of states and in some cases also the private interests of influential persons in these states. Conventional illegal intelligence is a set of long-estab- lished practices, which for years now have been supplemented by cyber espionage tools. It can be assumed that there is a constant need to procure and update information, occasion- ally accentuated by circumstances in which more specific or more detailed information is required. Information is needed in the political, economic and military spheres. Espionage does not just violate the sovereignty of the states in which or against which it is conducted: the data outflow causes direct or indirect damage, members of diaspora communities under surveillance and their relatives in the country of origin may be threatened with serious harm or death, and access acquired by means of espionage may possibly also be used for manipu- lation or even sabotage. Illegal intelligence Illegal intellig ence Cyber Intelligence Industrial espionage Espionage against foreign citizens in Switzerland Political espionage against Switzerland ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S76 Who is spying? A number of factors lead to illegal intelli- gence activities in Switzerland. Switzerland is either the target or merely the setting in which they take place. Switzerland is a target due to the high technological standard of Swiss indus- try and the quality of its research, as well as its status as a financial centre and a marketplace for energy and commodities trading. Another reason is the presence of parts of the UN and other international bodies based in Switzerland. There are also various diaspora communities in Switzerland, which remain a target of activities by their home countries' intelligence services. This description alone implies that espio- nage is a ubiquitous phenomenon. For example, there are around a dozen states that conduct il- legal intelligence against their own nationals in Switzerland. How far such activities can go is illustrated by the example of the alleged kid- napping of a Vietnamese citizen in Berlin: he is said to have been abducted to his home country in an intelligence operation in order to bring him to trial there. All states pursue political, military and eco- nomic goals. In order to do so, they deploy in- telligence services, which sometimes operate using illegal methods, i.e. methods prohibited in the target country. Swiss interests abroad may also become the target of such measures. There are therefore good reasons why it is not possible to come up with a complete list of the state actors which might at least begin to develop espionage activities in Switzerland or against Swiss interests abroad. However, from the point of view of counterespionage there are around half a dozen states meriting particular attention. One of these states relies heavily on intel- ligence officers who are in Switzerland under diplomatic cover. According to well-founded suspicions or confirmed intelligence, about a quarter to a third of the persons in the diplo- matic service of this state are intelligence ser- vice employees. They can be found in all dip- lomatic ranks, with the exception of the most senior. In addition (and this is also true of other states), intelligence officers are travelling to Switzerland for operational activities. Switzer- land may be the target country of the operation concerned, or merely be the springboard for ac- tivities in another European country. Who is being spied on? Illegal intelligence is carried out using a tried and trusted package of tools and procedures. Cyber espionage supplements this set; it is sup- porting conventional illegal intelligence and vice versa. Information is gradually collected about a person, for example, in order to be able to use that person as a source. The person may be aware of this and may even be remunerated for it, but this will not necessarily be the case. The German Federal Office for the Protec- tion of the Constitution announced in Decem- ber 2017 that more than 10,000 recruitment attempts by Chinese intelligence services had been identified in a nine-month period. And S I T U AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | SITUATION 77 it had not even looked at all the channels, but only one: social networks such as Linkedin. Researchers, civil servants and politicians were contacted via fake profiles and were asked for reports in return for money - some- times amounting to thousands of euros. After- wards, if the Chinese side was still interested, invitations to China followed, for example to a conference. Here too, the costs were paid by the inviting party. The figure published by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Consti- tution shows that this is a mass phenomenon; however, the hard work put in has not led to any further consequences. For one thing, the state actors simply deny the truth of the state- ments, and for another, one cannot arrest or convict a fake LinkedIn profile or expel it from the country. The figures also show the extent of the resources the opposite side is prepared to deploy - countermeasures such as the identifi- cation of individual profiles as fake would only shift the phenomenon elsewhere and would have no effect. The most effective methods here are education and sensitisation. Cyber espionage An advanced persistent threat (APT) is the term used to describe a cyber operation using sophisticated technical tools which are able to survive inside the victim's IT network and inflict serious damage on it. An APT requires substantial resources, which can normally be raised only by states and not by criminals. As a rule, an APT thus points to a state cyber opera- tion. The state may be directly involved in the attack, or be the invisible hand commissioning and financing a private company. It is only in the last few years that APTs have become a subject of public debate. For five or six years now, a number of security companies have been producing analyses describing the tech- nical details of such operations. Analysis of the operations shows that states have been using considerable resources to develop and carry out cyber attacks for at least twenty years. Russian hacker groups State, semi-state and private actors are in- creasingly using cyber tools in order to advance their economic, political and military interests. Recently, groups of perpetrators from Russia Short film ‘Im Visier’ on the subject of ‘industrial espionage in Switzerland’ Available on the internet (in German with French and Italian subtitles): ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | SITUATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S78 have been most prominent. Reports of large- scale cyber attacks which Russia is thought to have been behind are becoming more frequent. For some time, the targets have included Swiss interests; the FIS has identified and prevented several such attacks in recent years. Interna- tional security companies, media organisations and authorities indicate that Russian intelli- gence services are commissioning these hacker groups directly. Russian public officials and po- litical decision-makers, however, have repeat- edly denied these allegations. These activities are generally carried out for information-gath- ering purposes. However, disinformation and sabotage campaigns have also been observed. Data which has been stolen has been published on the Internet or disclosed to the media by the perpetrators. All the hacker groups associated with Russia have the following in common: they use highly complex malware, target their actions and pursue the political and economic interests of the Russian government. Chinese hacker groups The FIS has detected increased activity against Swiss interests by Chinese hacker groups. Chinese hacker groups with alleged links to Chinese security authorities have been acting in an increasingly targeted way for some years now. They focus particularly on ex- port-oriented Swiss companies and on interna- tional organisations based in Switzerland. North Korean hacker groups Hacker groups with links to North Korean security authorities have attracted a lot of at- tention in the last two to three years. Hacker groups from North Korea do not exclusively engage in conventional cyber espionage with the aim of procuring information, but also use cyber tools to try to generate foreign currency for the North Korean state. The FIS has also identified activities by North Korean hacker groups in Switzerland. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | ASSESSMENT 79 A S S E S S M E N T Illegal intelligence Illegal intelligence serves the interests of the states that conduct it, and in some cases also the private interests of influential persons in these states. The decision-makers and authorities of these states have a constant need for informa- tion and to keep any information they have up- dated. Events may additionally give rise to a specific, and possibly only temporary, need for information. Information of political, econom- ic or military importance is sought. This may benefit a state directly or benefit its economy (as a whole or individual companies), or else merely help it to maintain its position in the international arena. It may, however, also serve the purpose of preserving a political leadership, with the espionage activities possibly being di- rected against the state's own nationals abroad. Some states have a lasting interest in illegal intelligence activities in and against Switzer- land. They carry out frequent, high-quality at- tacks on Swiss interests. Besides their political interests, in other cases they either pursue pri- marily economic goals or target the diaspora communities. As these states are aiming to increase their power projection, it can be as- sumed that intelligence activities will continue to increase. Cyber espionage Cyber attacks are efficient and may therefore become even more important in future. As the level of protection for critical infrastructures, companies and private individuals has general- ly risen over the past few years, it is predicted that states will make substantial investments, for example in their intelligence services, in or- der to develop and implement new technologies which can overcome the increased protection. Damage as an aim of intelligence service activity Political, economic and military intelligence can have consequences which no longer have anything to do with illegal intelligence in the narrower sense. The information obtained may in some cases bring direct benefits – for exam- ple where a company can copy production pro- cesses instead of having to go to the expense of developing them itself or where its bid wins out over its competitors because it knew what their offers were. It may, however, also be of indirect benefit by inflicting damage on oppo- nents. For example, attempts to intimidate, po- liticise or even polarise diaspora communities and to incite people against one another can disturb the peace in the host country. From the Swiss point of view, these run counter to the functions of the state, which is responsible for securing the fundamental rights and freedom of its inhabitants and for guaranteeing security and order. In addition, intelligence activities are used for influence operations (particularly by Russia) and provide states with a range of opportunities, up to and including sabotage. The intelligence services play a role in Rus- sia's influence operations aimed at achieving power political goals. They have the necessary ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | ASSESSMENT S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S80 resources and capabilities to act either with- in the framework of a larger campaign or in a mostly autonomous way. In the tradition of the Soviet Union, influence operations con- ducted by intelligence services are referred to as ‘active measures’. The main focus is on the recruitment by the intelligence services of so- called influence agents. These are handled in the same way as sources, but are primarily used for the dissemination rather than the procure- ment of information. This information does not necessarily have to be false. By skilfully blend- ing facts, false information and opinions, the desired narratives can be disseminated in a way that is tailored to requirements. The portfolio of active measures also includes the leaking of information procured using intelligence tools. This can be used, for example, to discredit un- desirable persons or organisations. Allegedly leaked information may also be made up or fal- sified. For the work of influence agents to be effective, it usually requires coordination with other agencies, such as teams that design nar- ratives, plan actions or distribute information themselves over the Internet. The target groups of the active measures often do not realise that they are the focus of an influence operation. Sabotage operations may, for ecample, use targeted attacks on industrial control systems. These are still rare. So far, only five malware complexes that have been specifically aimed at industrial control systems are known. Probably the most famous in this context is Stuxnet, a malware that was discovered in 2010. It was used to destroy centrifuges in uranium enrich- ment plants in Iran. Mention should also be made of the attacks on the power supply in Ukraine in December 2016, using the Crash- override malware. This was the first incident where a malware program designed to attack a power network was actually used. However, such attacks have so far been used very con- servatively. This is probably due to the fact that this type of operation always causes incal- culable damage, which also makes the conse- quences for the attacker unpredictable. For this reason, this type of tool is used for targeted at- tacks on specific system configurations, which makes the attack correspondingly elaborate. The most recent example is the Triton/Trisis malware, which was aimed at the security con- trol system of a target in the Middle East. Increasingly, industrial control systems and their operators are being spied on, possibly in order to gain an overview of ways in which they could be manipulated and to be prepared for all future eventualities. The prime example here is the attacks involving the Dragonfly 2.0 complex. At the end of June 2014, an espio- nage and sabotage preparation campaign called Dragonfly came to light, which was targeted at Western industrial installations and energy sup- pliers. The follow-up campaign, Dragonfly 2.0, was uncovered in 2017. This version also in- volves sending e-mails with malware attached to selected employees in the target company. In addition, the repertoire of this espionage com- plex once again includes targeted infections via websites and trojans. The campaign is primari- ly aimed at targets in the US and Europe.

As already mentioned, the expansion of individual states' endeavours to project power will intensify these activities still further. As- suming that Switzerland maintains its current position, economic, political and military inter- ests will continue to be the target of intelligence activities. In the case of some states, only their democratisation or fundamental pacification will cause them to refrain from exerting pres- sure on their own nationals abroad. However, the description and assessment of the situation also show that, in addition to counterintelligence measures, prevention – and thus the behaviour of individuals and groups – is particularly important. Switzerland will continue to be a prime target of cyber attacks by states or by state-sponsored perpetrators. Swiss interests may be directly affected, e.g. through attacks on the federal administration, on Swiss companies or on in- ternational organisations based in Switzerland. However, IT infrastructures in Switzerland may also be deliberately misused in order to attack targets abroad. Defensive measures Illegal intelligence is conducted mainly on behalf of governments, but criminal law as- signs responsibility to individual persons. If circumstances apply which are of relevance un- der criminal law, then these will be examined using instruments of criminal law. The crimi- nal offences in question require public prose- cution, i.e. no criminal complaint by a victim is necessary, as illegal intelligence infringes upon government interests. However, these are defined as political offences, the criminal investigation and prosecution of which require authorisation by the Federal Council. If the per- petrator is a diplomat accredited in Switzerland, the sending country would also have to lift the diplomat's immunity. If there are not sufficient grounds for suspicion to open criminal prose- cution proceedings, or if the Federal Council does not grant authorisation for criminal pros- ecution, other measures are available. For ex- ample, the withdrawal of the person engaged in intelligence work can be achieved through informal channels. Further options are expul- sion or persona non grata declaration or, in a case where the person is not yet in the country, an entry ban or refusal of the necessary visa or accreditation. These options are supplemented by Federal Council measures – these, too, may consist in expelling a person or prohibiting a person from entering Switzerland. Prevention Despite the range of counterintelligence measures, prevention remains one of the most important tools for countering espionage. Be- sides the work of the authorities entrusted with prevention, it consists mainly in aware- ness-raising and training, firstly regarding the handling of sensitive information and secondly S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK 83 with reference to the practices of intelligence services. This awareness-raising about the practices of foreign intelligence services may, if nothing else, lead to suspicious behaviour being detected quickly or early enough, i.e. before the designated information source be- comes deeply ensnared or at least before they have rendered themselves criminally liable. Over the past few years, the FIS has taken a large number of measures to raise awareness, principally as part of the Prophylax preven- tion and awareness-raising programme, and to assist companies, universities and research. It will continue with these activities and will de- velop them further. In addition, it will draw the attention of the Swiss population as a whole to the problem, help everyone to identify illegal intelligence activities at an early stage, where possible, and demonstrate measures to protect against them. The short film ‘Targeted’, which was produced two years ago, is thus still topi- cal. Like other FIS material, it is publicly avail- able on the Internet. ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S84 The Internet of Things sions based on sensor data. Accordingly, an enormous number of data records will be created, all of which will have to be protected. Staying with the refriger- ator, the data collected not only gives an interesting insight into the household's milk consumption, but also shows the overall usage of the refrigerator. Such data can be used for marketing purposes, for example. In extreme cases, it could also be used to determine whether a household's eating habits are deemed to be healthy or unhealthy, which could be used, for exam- ple, by health insurance companies as an indicator for calculating premiums. The Internet of Things differs substantially from con- ventional information and communication technol- ogy (ICT): in contrast to computers, Internet-capable household devices are often secured against unau- thorised access only to a limited extent, which is why they can be infected with malware by attackers. Firstly, these devices can in many cases be accessed using the default passwords, as these are often not changed af- ter installation or cannot even be changed at all. Sec- ondly, updating the software used is a fundamental problem: the update process is seldom regulated and rarely automated. This gives rise to numerous chal- lenges that will intensify over the next few years: in contrast to conventional ICT devices, which are in ser- vice on average for only a few years, Internet devices may be in use for up to ten years or more. Attackers exploit this by using the Internet of Things for attacks on availability, so-called DDoS attacks. A noteworthy example here is the Mirai botnet, which In the future, anything that can be connected will also be linked to the Internet. This somewhat exaggerated statement gives an idea of how the Internet will de- velop over the next few years, which, besides all the convenience it will bring, will undoubtedly generate much debate about security. More and more every- day objects will in future be connected to the Inter- net. This is why the first manufacturers are already talking about the Internet of Everything, which will integrate people, processes, devices and data into an all-encompassing network. The oft-quoted refrigera- tor which orders the milk itself is a good example of this. In order to be able to perform this task, however, it requires access to personal data – it would be a nui- sance if it did not know that the owners had planned a several-week-long holiday. However, the refrigerator is just one of many examples. There has been a boom in recent years, especially in the area of building man- agement and lighting control. The Internet of Things will in future be much more than it is today. Accord- ing to Gartner analysts, in 2016 more than six billion ‘things’ were already connected to the net. This num- ber is expected to increase to over 20 billion by 2020. And the opportunities are far from exhausted. These will increasingly become part of our everyday life and will also influence it. As the opportunities of the Internet (of Things) grow, we will also be concerned about the risks. Fundamen- tal questions will arise, covering not only maintenance and security standards, but also, in particular, data protection issues.

S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S 87 Intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation To perform its tasks, the FIS is reliant on effective tools for gathering information. The Intelligence Service Act (ISA), which came into force on 1 September 2017, allows the FIS to use new 'intelligence-gathering meas- ures requiring authorisation'. In early 2014, the Federal Council stated in its memorandum on the ISA that, based on the threat situation at that time, such intelligence-gathering measures would apply in around ten cases a year. Howev- er, each case may involve multiple such meas- ures being taken: thus, for example, one person may have multiple telecommunication connec- tions monitored, their vehicle tracked and their hotel room searched. The cases concerned are ones which present a particularly serious threat in the areas of terrorism, illegal intelligence, proliferation, attacks on critical infrastructure or the protection of other important national in- terests as defined under Article 3 ISA. Domestic intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation are (Article 26 ISA): ▪ surveillance of postal and telecommunica- tions traffic in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on the Surveillance of Postal and Telecommunications Traffic; ▪ the use of tracking equipment to determine the location and movements of persons or objects; ▪ the use of surveillance equipment to in- tercept or record private conversations or to observe or record incidents in locations which are not public or not generally acces- sible; ▪ the penetration of computer systems and computer networks in order to gather infor- mation that is present in or transmitted from these or to disrupt, prevent or slow down ac- cess to information in cases where the com- puter systems and computer networks are used for attacks on critical infrastructure; ▪ the searching of premises, vehicles or con- tainers in order to obtain items or informa- tion that are present in them or information transmitted from them. Intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation must in each case be authorised by the Federal Administrative Court and ap- proved by the head of the DDPS following consultation with the head of the FDFA and the head of the FDJP. They are subject to close monitoring by the Independent Supervisory Authority which oversees intelligence activ- ities and by the Control Delegation. The FIS implements the measures in 'operations', which correspond to the cases referred to above. For source protection reasons, neither the types of measures used nor the number of persons af- INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING MEASURES REQUIRING AUTHORISATION S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S88 fected by an operation can be made public. However, the FIS can publish the number of operations/cases in which intelligence-gath- ering measures requiring authorisation have been used – broken down by individual area of activity – as well as the number of individual measures requiring authorisation which have been approved for each operation. Domestic operations involving measures requiring authorisation (1 September to 31 December 2017) Area of activity (Art. 6 ISA) Operations Measures Terrorism 2 13 Illegal intelligence 2 27 NBC proliferation 0 0 Attacks on critical infrastructure 0 0 Total 4 40 Operations: operations as part of which intelligence-gath- ering measures requiring authorisation were carried out. Measures: approved between 1 September 2017 and 31 December 2017. Extensions of previously authorised intelligence-gathering measures are not counted sepa- rately. Thus in 2017, measures requiring authori- sation were used in a total of four operations/ cases. Cable reconnaissance The Intelligence Service Act has also given the FIS the powers to conduct cable reconnais- sance (Article 39 ff. ISA) in order to gather in- formation about incidents abroad that are of rel- evance to security. As cable reconnaissance is for the purpose of gathering information about other countries, it is not in principle designed to be used as a domestic intelligence-gathering measure requiring authorisation. However, ca- ble reconnaissance can be carried out only with the participation of Swiss telecommunication service providers, which must be presented with a legally valid order to forward the rele- vant data flows to the Swiss Army's Centre for Electronic Operations. The ISA therefore pro- vides for a similiar authorisation and approval procedure in Article 40 f. No cable reconnaissance applications were made by the FIS in the first four months fol- lowing the entry into force of the ISA. The technical capabilities for cable reconnaissance were still being developed at the end of 2017. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | F I S INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING MEASURES REQUIRING AUTHORISATION 89 Operation FIS operations are defined in Article 12 of the Fed- eral Intelligence Service Ordinance (FISO): ‘The FIS can, for limited periods, conduct as operations in- terconnected procedures which are for the purposes of information gathering as defined under Article 6 ISA and which exceed normal intelligence-gather- ing activities in terms of importance, scope, cost or secrecy. These must be formally opened and closed and separately documented.’ Measures requiring au- thorisation are always applied for by the FIS within the framework of operations and are implemented if authorisation and approval are granted. Colloquially, an operation corresponds to the terms 'case' or 'case cluster' used prior to the vote on the ISA. Intelligence-gathering measure requiring authorisation For the purposes of these statistics, a measure requir- ing authorisation is a measure as defined under Ar- ticle 26 ISA against a person. In telecommunications surveillance, each addressing resource monitored counts as one measure (if, for example two mobile phone numbers of the same person are monitored, this counts as two measures); the same applies if, for example, a tracking device is used and telecommuni- cations surveillance is carried out on one person (also two measures). Cable reconnaissance order Cable reconnaissance orders are intelligence require- ments for gathering information about significant security-related incidents abroad in relation to a par- ticular reconnaissance area as defined in Article 39 ff. ISA and Article 25 FISO. Only cross-border signals from cable networks may be recorded.

The new Intelligence Service Act has been in force since 1 September 2017. It gives the Federal  Intelligence Service (FIS) new instruments for countering the threats to Switzerland's internal and  external security. The situation radar shows that these new tools are needed now more than ever.   For example, the radar indicates that Switzerland's security policy has to remain focussed on the  ongoing heightened terrorist threat and the threat in cyberspace (especially from espionage). The  latter poses an enormous challenge for Switzerland, as elsewhere. Espionage using information and  communications technology, in particular, is now taking place on a large scale in our country. In  2017, we have seen yet another state, North Korea, acquire the means to threaten Switzerland with  nuclear weapons from within its territory. This fact, together with the use of chemical weapons  in Syria and of chemical agents against a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK, underlines  how important it is that efforts to counter proliferation activities should not be relaxed. Relations  between Russia and the transatlantic West are steadily deteriorating: In all likelihood, this develop- ment, which is relevant to Switzerland's security policy, has not yet reached its lowest point. The in- clusion of influence operations in the situation radar demonstrates that Switzerland – be it the coun- try's decision-makers or the population at large – has not remained untouched by this phenomenon.  Switzerland is still a relatively safe country, not least due to the continuing efforts of our security  authorities at federal and cantonal level. In order for our country to be able to maintain its security, it  is essential that we continue to make consistent and targeted use of the range of preventive and puni- tive measures available to us. As explained in an appendix to this situation report, since 1  September   2017 the FIS has been actively employing the intelligence-gathering measures requir- ing authorisation which are provided for, subject to strict conditions, in the Intel-  ligence Service Act. For example, by the end of 2017 the FIS had opened four  operations (cases), as part of which, following authorisation from the relevant  political and judicial authorities, it had successfully used a total of 40 such  measures. The fact that two of these operations related to terrorism and two to  counterespionage shows that use of the new tools is being focussed on the most   serious threats. The publication of these figures demonstrates the increasing transparency of the   FIS. While core aspects of intelligence work will always remain secret, the  publication of certain key figures relating to the service's work – as is  also planned for the 2019 annual report – can only strengthen public  confidence in this vital security instrument.

The FIS's  situation radar tool is one of the instruments that offer guidance for Switzerland's security policy and  provides Switzerland's inhabitants with an outline of the key issues from an intelligence viewpoint.   ▪ Europe remains under exceptional strain  due to internal and external crises. Recent- ly, questions have also been raised about the  capability of NATO to act effectively as the  foundation of the security order in Europe.  The USA has intensified the debate about  burden sharing. Alliance member Turkey  has ambitions to shape its strategic environ- ment between the EU/NATO, Russia and the  Middle East independently of Western ideas  of order. Fundamental uncertainty and thus  reduced predictability will shape Switzer- land's strategic environment for a long time  to come.   ▪ Russia is currently more politically stable,  economically robust and militarily capable  of action than it has ever been since the fall  of the Soviet Union, even though long-term  challenges remain. The Russian leadership  controls both state and society. Russia, a  revanchist power, is seeking to restore the  historically and ideologically deeply-rooted  Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Eu- rope. Ukraine will continue to be the focus  of its ambitions. The steady deterioration  of the relationship between Russia and the  transatlantic West has in all likelihood not  yet reached its lowest point and will also  have repercussions for Switzerland.   ▪ The Middle East and North Africa, including  the Sahel region, are the scene of numerous  armed conflicts. For years, the impact of  these conflicts has also been felt in Europe,  in the form of migration movements and ji- hadist terrorism. While ‘Islamic State’ has  lost its state-like structure, as well as the bulk  of its territories and its openly operating mili- tary units, the terrorist threat in Europe from  the jihadist movement will continue to be  shaped by ‘Islamic State’ and individuals and  small groups controlled or inspired by it. The  threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. ‘Islamic  State’ and former jihadist fighters continue to  use migration flows to Europa and Switzer- land for their purposes. The terrorist threat in  Switzerland remains at a heightened level.   ▪ Migration numbers have fallen since the  peak levels of refugees and migrants which  presented a major challenge for Europe in  2015, but migration potential and the pres- sure on Europe remain high. At the moment,  this issue is not motivating right-wing or  left-wing extremists in Switzerland to en- gage in any significant action. While right- wing extremists are keeping a lower profile  than they have done for decades, the threat  from left-wing extremists has become more  acute over the last twelve months. A cam-    STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S8  paign against ‘repression’ carried out by the  latter in the form of a series of arson attacks  led to a significant increase in acts of vio- lence. The high level of aggression against  security forces, which has been apparent for  some years now, has been manifesting itself  with increasing frequency.   ▪ Where proliferation is concerned, terrorist  groups are showing interest in obtaining  expertise on weapons of mass destruction,  especially chemical weapons. The threat  is moving closer to Switzerland, as North  Korea became the latest state to acquire the  means to threaten Switzerland with nucle- ar weapons in 2017. The nuclear agreement  with Iran still stands, although it is under se- vere pressure from the USA.   ▪ Information of political, economic and mili- tary relevance continues to be gathered by  means of illegal intelligence. In addition,  intelligence services are conducting active  operations against their countries' own na- tionals abroad. Traditional methods go hand  in hand with activities in cyberspace – the  various forms of illegal intelligence do not  compete in any way, rather they comple- ment each other. Access which has been  sought and found for the purpose of infor- mation gathering can also be used to inflict  damage on a state. Acts of sabotage against  industrial control systems, which are cur- rently still rare, illustrate this potential. In- telligence service activity and information  gained through this play a role in influence  operations, with Russia as a prominent actor.

A simplified version  of the situation radar, without any confidential  data, has also been incorporated into this report.  The public version lists the threats that fall within  the FIS’s remit, together with those classified un- der the categories of ’migration risks’ and ’organ- ised crime’, which are also relevant from the point  of view of security policy. This report does not go  into detail about these two categories, for more  information on which readers are referred to the  reports of the relevant federal authorities.

In the last few years, these crisis sit- uations have been regularly described by the  FIS in its situation reports. The Brexit decision  has shaken the EU vision to its core and will  continue to absorb the EU's energies for years  to come. Questions have also repeatedly been  raised about the stability of the eurozone and  thus also the common currency, and recently,  with increasing frequency, about the capability  of NATO to act effectively as the foundation of  the security order in Europe. At the same time,  the periphery of the EU and NATO is under  the greatest external pressure it has faced for  a generation: in the east from a strengthened  and revanchist Russia and in the south from the  Middle East and North Africa, where the state  order is threatening to disintegrate in some  places – with impacts on Europe in the form of  migration movements and an increased terror  threat, both of which are unsettling populations  and placing an extraordinary strain on national  and European institutions.  The European order is showing clear cracks Following the surprising votes for Brexit   in the UK and for Donald Trump in the USA,  elections in many places in Europe in 2017  confirmed the loss of confidence in the parties  of the centre, which have traditionally sup- ported the state and formed the government.   In France, the Front National has never been  so close to election victory. In Germany, the  parties of the grand coalition accounted for not  much more than half the seats in the Bundestag.  Political forces which are turning their backs  on progressive integration as a fundamental  idea of the European order now bear govern- mental responsibility not only in the United  Kingdom but also in Greece, Hungary, Poland,  the Czech Republic and Austria. These popu- lar votes highlight the extent to which Western  political orders have lost the predictability and  stability which had characterised them for so  long. Long-held political certainties are being  questioned and challenged and are beginning  to change or are even unravelling. We are only  just beginning to get an idea of what will ulti- mately replace the old certainties. In the wake  of a rise in nationalist tendencies, elements of  the future might include a return to more na- tional solutions and a narrower definition of  European solidarity. As a consequence, Swit- zerland has entered a prolonged period of fun- damental uncertainty and thus reduced predict- ability in our strategic environment.  The picture painted by election and poll  decisions is one which shows the major Eu- ropean institutions in crisis. Although the EU  has endured through the challenges of recent  years, initiated the search for solutions and  the debate about the further evolution of the  Union with various proposals, its capability to  act effectively is hampered by numerous in- ternal and external crisis situations. Following   Strategic environment    STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S14  the UK's Brexit vote, the EU is now in the  middle of the difficult process of redefining  its relations with the UK. This process is as  complex as was feared, will take more time  than both sides would like, and will prolong  the uncertainties at the heart of the European  order well into the next decade. The Brexit  debate will pose fundamental questions for  the EU for years to come: if not questions  about the continued existence of the institu- tion itself, then about its ability to function as  an effective force for order on the European  continent and to exert influence at the global  level. In any case, there is as yet no sign of the   ‘salutary shock’ anticipated by some, which  would provide the political basis to lend fresh  impetus to the renewal of the EU. Initial de- cisions on new joint efforts in the field of Eu- ropean defence still have to pass the test of  implementation or will once again prove to  be an unfulfilled ambition. The prospect of a  multi-speed EU may seem politically desira- ble as a new vision in some places, but would  accentuate the fault lines between a dominant  core and a periphery in economic and social  difficulties. The movement toward integration  between the old member states in the west and  the new ones in the east is threatening to come  to a halt or even to go into reverse, a develop- ment that will be an impediment both to the  EU and to the Organisation for Security and  Cooperation in Europe as organizations rele- vant for security in Europe. Fault lines in our  immediate environment – between north and  south, between east and west, between core  and periphery – will be thrown into sharper  relief.   The eurozone, and with it the common cur- rency, are also in crisis, even if the public is  less aware of this. The level of government  debt, which has increased sharply since the  international financial crisis of 2007/2008,  and a fragile banking system, are still leading  to concerns about financial stability and even  about the survival of the euro. The eurozone as  an institution has survived the years of severe  crisis surrounding painful economic reforms  in countries on the periphery. However, even  under the favourable conditions of an expan- sionary mone tary policy, large European econ- omies such as those of France and Italy have  not yet been sufficiently reformed and consol- idated. These are still of crucial importance to  the economic and political future of the conti- nent. The inability to formulate a convincing  common way forward in order to overcome the  debt crisis across the entire eurozone is one of  the reasons for the political crisis. It is under- mining not only the European institutions, but  also those of the nation states that make up  the EU: There is a diminishing political will  in the national decision-making bodies to find  pan-European solutions, and even national  problem-solving mechanisms are coming un- der pressure from autonomist, separatist and  populist movements. Western European states  generally have constitutional systems based on  stable institutional foundations that can with- stand this pressure better and for longer than  others. In Central European countries, by con- trast, these may fail.  Even NATO, the security cornerstone of the  European order, is showing distinct symptoms  of crisis. The alliance is having to deal simulta-    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    15  Europe and also with the USA is under con- siderable strain in key areas such as internal  security and counter-terrorism (prosecution of  actual and alleged government opponents in  Europe and the USA), regional policy (Kurdish  question) and armaments policy (procurement  projects in collaboration with Russia). NATO,  confronted with these internal challenges, thus  finds itself in the midst of a fundamental debate  about its ability to withstand crisis, its politi- cal will and capability to meet mutual defense  commitments on the European continent and  its capability to deter external challenges, all  of which have been ascribed to it for decades  by its rivals and on which the current security  order in Europe largely depends.  Growing pressure from the east At the same time, external pressure on Eu-  rope is increasing. To the east, the Russian state  has been reinvigorated under President Putin's  leadership. It is currently more politically sta- ble, economically robust and militarily capable  than it has ever been since the fall of the So viet   neously with a burden-sharing debate that has  been intensified by the USA and with recur- ring tensions in its relations with its member  state Turkey. Following Presidential candidate  Trump's repeated and trenchant expression of  doubts about the benefits of NATO, the US  administration has nonetheless reaffirmed its  commitment and expressly acknowledged its  obligation to provide assistance in the event of  an attack (Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty).  However, it has not succeeded in dispelling  fundamental doubts about President Trump's  transatlantic commitment. In addition, NATO's  cohesion and capacity to act is increasingly  being put to the test by Turkey. The gradual  repression of democratic and constitutional  norms is only one aspect of broader develop- ments in that country. Across the board, Tur- key is adopting an assertive stance in distinct  contrast to the Western-dominated European  order. In terms of security and military policy,  it is also asserting itself decisively as a flexible  regional power between the EU/NATO, Rus- sia and the Middle East.

In all probability, rela- tions with Russia have not yet reached their  lowest point. American-Russian relations re- main at a dangerously low level. Based on the  trend in recent years, further polarisation and  militarisation as well as the establishment of  new demarcation lines across Europe must be  reckoned with, a process that – before it can  possibly have a stabilising effect – carries a  considerable risk of conflicts arising in areas  where Western and Russian interests have not  been demarcated.   After the end of the Cold War, the armed  forces of European states greatly reduced their  national and alliance defence capabilities. In  parallel, the US also cut its military presence  in Europe significantly. While Russia's military  resurgence is now already well advanced, cor- responding measures by the West have so far  failed to keep pace with this development. In  an escalating crisis, Russia could therefore use  military means to create facts on the ground  along the Eastern border of NATO without the  West currently being in a position to prevent it.  The establishment of the status quo ante would  then only be possible by further escalating the  conflict. Although the FIS does not currently  consider it likely that the situation will evolve  along these lines, the risk that interstate con- flicts will again be resolved by military means  has increased in Europe, too.  The conflict with Russia is not a temporary  phenomenon, but a change with lasting effects  in Switzerland's strategic environment. A crisis  in this area between East and West – whether  above or below the threshold of war – could,  without much advance warning, become a ma-  Union, even if long-term challenges remain,  especially about the future viability of the  Russian model. For the first time since 2013,  the FIS situation report is therefore once again  focussing on developments in Russia. The  Russian leadership controls the state via a vast  apparatus of government agencies vested with  extensive powers to control the domestic situa- tion, the economy and society. This apparatus is  mostly led by close associates of the president  with a proven personal loyalty to Putin. With  this power apparatus consolidated internally  and with a robust economy, which has contin- ued to ensure the state’s financing despite the  international financial crisis, the collapse of oil  prices and the imposition of sanctions, the Rus- sian leadership is now working to restore the  historically and ideologically deeply-rooted  Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe,  from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Growing  Russian pressure in this area has already led  to military escalation twice in recent years: in  2008 in Georgia and in 2014 in Ukraine, wars  that have extended a chain of de facto Russian  military outposts in parts of Ukraine, Moldova  and Georgia. Russia's leverage in Europe is not  limited to military instruments. it also includes  economic influence by legal and criminal  means and professionalised propaganda cam- paigns as well as attacks in cyberspace. This  exertion of Russian influence extends far be- yond Eastern Europe.  Europe, preoccupied with its many and  varied problems and once again thinking  in increasingly national or even subnation- al categories, is struggling to deal with this  pressure and to find common European and     S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    17  underground. In Syria, Russian military inter- vention has saved President Bashar al-Assad's  regime from collapse. Years of fierce battles for  the commercial and population centres have  not only left a the country devastated by war,  but also a regime with greatly reduced capa- bilities to act as a force for order. In the next  phase of the conflict, it is likely that negotia- tions about a political solution will gradually  take on increasing importance, and for many  actors the aim here will be to convert military  gains into political influence. The country's old  political order has been severely damaged, and  the state's ability to ever again establish lasting  control over the entire country has been called  into question. In Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Mali,  too, the loss of state control across large are- as will continue to cause serious problems for  years to come. This challenge to the ruling or- der and the resulting power-political shifts are  also fuelling the old rivalry between Iran and  Saudi Arabia. And there is no sign of a politi-  jor challenge to Europe's security institutions,  in which the goodwill between member states  has been eroded by a series of overlapping in- ternal crises, but whose stability since the Sec- ond World War has been one of the foundations  of Swiss security and defence policy.  Growing pressure from the Mediterranean  region  Pressure on Europe has also been increas- ing for a number of years in the eastern and  southern Mediterranean regions. The Middle  East and North Africa and the adjacent Sahel  region continue to be the scene of complex and  prolonged hostilities that are devastating for  the governmental structures and the popula- tions. Following the losses of its strongholds of  Mosul and Raqqa in 2017, ‘Islamic State’ has  lost the proto-state structure of its caliphate in  Iraq and Syria and is turning back into a ter- rorist organisation that aims to continue its  fight through clandestine structures operating   AUSTRIA  AUSTRIA  ITALY  ITALY  SPAIN  PORTUGAL  MOROCCO ALGERIA  TUNISIA  LIBYA  TURKEY GREECE  BULGARIA  ROMANIA  CYPRUS SYRIA  IRAQ  EGYPT  UKRAINE  POLAND  CZECH REP.

Overall, the ongoing  conflicts are creating a complex series of frac- tures right across the whole region, which is in  a state of great turmoil and has not yet seen the  end of the upheavals.   Europe finally started feeling the effects  of these crises in 2015 in the form of jihad- ist terrorism and the arrival of huge flows of  refugees and migrants. The fierce battles for  cities in Iraq and Syria are provoking acute hu- manitarian emergencies, but also highlight the  long-term effects of the destruction of social  and state structures in the countries affected.  It is not clear at present whether there is any  chance that the partially collapsed state order  in the region can be restored. For the time be- ing, the factors driving jihadist terrorism and  migration movements to Europe thus continue  to exert their effect. In 2017, the jihadist threat  to Europe manifested itself in a series of at- tacks, in Istanbul, St. Petersburg, Paris, Man- chester, London and Barcelona, and this threat  will continue after ‘Islamic State’'s military  defeats in Syria and Iraq. Overall migration   movements to Europe are below the level of  the record year of 2015 but remain high and  could once again increase strongly at any time.  The EU's agreement with Turkey, under which  Turkey takes back migrants who have illegal- ly entered Greece via its territory, is still in  force but remains fragile. New measures in the  seas between Libya and Italy have also led to  reduced migration movements on the central  Mediterranean route since mid-2017, but the  prospects for the future are uncertain.  In the light of this pressure from the eastern  and southern Mediterranean region, Europe's  relations with Turkey – a NATO member and  a key partner in managing migration flows and  curbing the terrorist threat – remain vital. In  April 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  won the referendum he had long sought on  transforming Turkey's political system into  a presidential one. He has thus succeeded in  strengthening his control over Turkey's insti- tutions since the coup attempt of summer 2016,  and in paving the way for autocratic, socially  conservative rule and for the accelerated de-  200 km  TURKEY  LEBANON  ISRAEL  JORDAN  SYRIA IRAQ  IRAN  AZERBAIJAN  GEORGIA  RUSSIA  ARMENIA  Black Sea Caspian Sea  Mediterranean Sea  Istanbul  Izmir  Antalya  Ankara  Adana  Diyarbakir  Mosul  Kirkuk  Baghdad Damascus  Tabriz  KURDISH AREA  Rojava  Kayseri  CYPRUS  GaziantepAfrin    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    19  velopment of Turkey into an assertive regional  power. Turkey perceives the turmoil in Syria  and Iraq as a threat to its core national security  interests, particularly in the light of the proc- lamation of Kurdish autonomy in northern  Syria, backed by the Kurdistan Workers' Party  (PKK). Turkey is responding to Europe in an  increasingly assertive and decisive way and  by using all available resources of state power.  The gradual repression of democratic and con- stitutional norms is one aspect of a broader de- velopment. Turkey has ambitions to shape its  strategic environment between Europe, Russia  and the Middle East independently of West- ern ideas of order, but is acting circumspectly,  aware that it cannot sacrifice strategic relations  with the West. While negotiations with the EU  on the future shape of strategic relations have  not been formally terminated, tensions with  Europe are increasing. The reasons for this  include the exploitation of widely entrenched  Turkish nationalism and action against real  and alleged opponents of the government, not  only in Turkey but also in Europe. After dec- ades of prospects of a partnership developing  between Turkey and Europe, relations have  reached a critical point where cooperation on  migration and counter-terrorism issues as well  as NATO's cohesion and operational capability  on its south-eastern borders are at stake.  Switzerland can not remain immune to the  risks caused by the difficult and protracted  transformation processes taking place in the  Middle East and North Africa. Migration  from the crisis areas, especially migration to  Europe via Libya, has become one of the two  greatest and most pressing challenges, due to   its potential consequences for security policy.  Europe is working to contain and manage the  consequences of the crisis situation, as with- out any imminent prospect of stabilisation in  the region, where the disintegration of systems  of government does not yet appear to have  reached its lowest point, migration pressure  on Europe is set to continue at a high level for  years to come, which will provide a further  boost for nationalist parties. The other major  challenge is to tackle the increased threat of  terrorism from the region. The phenomenon of  jihad-motivated travel, above all the issue of  returnees, remains a serious security problem  for Western states. Switzerland is among those  affected by this. However, the authorities will  also need to continue to pay close attention to  numerous other problem areas: the threat to  the security of diplomatic missions, terrorist  threats and kidnappings in the region, the dis- ruption of trade and of energy supplies, coping  with sanctions regimes and managing the as- sets of politically exposed persons.  Focus: Russia The Russian leadership controls the state   via a vast apparatus of government agencies  vested with extensive powers to control the  domestic situation, the economy and society.  This apparatus is mostly led by close associ- ates of the president with a proven personal  loyalty to Putin. With this power apparatus  consolidated internally, the Russian leadership  is now working to restore the historically and  ideologically deeply-rooted Russian sphere of  influence in Eastern Europe, from the Baltic  Sea to the Black Sea. The three Baltic states     STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S20  of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, members  of NATO and the EU since 2004, are already  under considerable pressure from Russia, and  this will probably increase still further in the  years to come.  Jihadist and ethno-nationalist terrorism  and violent extremism  The terrorist threat in Europe and Switzerland  comes primarily from the jihadist movement and  its two main actors, ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qae- da. ‘Islamic State’ and the individuals and small  groups controlled or inspired by it continue to be  the dominant threat. The threat posed by al-Qae- da persists. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat  remains at a heightened level. Swiss nationals  could also fall victim to kidnappings or attacks  by terrorists in many places abroad.  Ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent ex- tremism remain relevant to the threat situation  in Switzerland. The PKK, in particular, has the  capacity to mobilise its supporters in Western  Europe to take part in coordinated rallies and  campaigns at short notice. This could lead to  violence, particularly if Kurdish and Turkish  nationalist groups were to come into contact  with one another.  Right-wing and left-wing extremism The potential for violence in right-wing ex-  tremist circles remains unchanged, while in left- wing extremist circles it has increased; as far as  left-wing extremism is concerned, the situation  has become more acute. Violence motivated by  left-wing extremism is directed not only against  property, but also against those perceived as  right-wing extremists and, especially during  police operations, against the security forces.  When using violence, left-wing extremists often  display extreme aggression. They are prepared  to run the risk of injuring or killing the persons  they attack, and in some cases this is even their  aim. Even leaving such confrontations out of the  equation, an increased number of acts of vio- lence motivated by left-wing extremism were  observed in the year under review. At the same  time, there was also an increase in the inten- sity of the forms of violence resorted to. Left- wing extremists maintain and exploit their links  with violent left-wing extremist groups abroad.  Right-wing extremists are continuing to keep  a low profile. Developments regarding asylum  and migration have also contributed to the calm  situation in this area – but the potential for vio- lence in right-wing extremist circles, especially  relating to asylum and migration, remains.

Switzerland, as a major exporter of dual-use  goods, has a particular responsibility here to  work to prevent proliferation. The implemen- tation of the framework agreement with Iran  continued in 2017, but progress toward the  normalisation of economic relations is still hes- itant. Developments in North Korea's weapons  of mass destruction programmes have main- tained their momentum. The country's prolifer- ation activities are moving beyond the regional  context and becoming a global threat. This has  changed the rules of the game for dealing with  an illegitimate nuclear weapons programme  outside the recognised nuclear-weapon states.  Chemical weapons were used in Syria again  in 2017. Terrorist groups are showing a clear  interest in obtaining expertise on weapons  of mass destruction; terrorist groups have in- creased their capabilities to use chemical weap- ons, in particular. The threat posed by prolifer- ation is also drawing closer to Switzerland.  Illegal intelligence Illegal intelligence serves the interests of states  and in some cases also the private interests of  influential persons in these states. Conventional  illegal intelligence is a set of long-established  practices, which for years now have been sup- plemented by cyber espionage tools. It can be  assumed that there is a constant need to procure  and update information, occasionally accentu- ated by circumstances in which more specific   or more detailed information is required. In- formation is needed in the political, economic  and military spheres. Espionage does not just  violate the sovereignty of the states in which or  against which it is conducted: the data outflow  causes direct or indirect damage, members of  diaspora communities under surveillance and  their relatives in the country of origin may be  threatened with serious harm or death, and  access acquired by means of espionage may  possibly also be used for manipulation or even  sabotage.    22 S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S 23  Focus: Russia  Internal consolidation Under the leadership of President Vladimir   Putin, Russia has been steadily growing in  strength and confidence, in domestic as well  as foreign affairs, for nearly two decades. Pu- tin's re-election as president creates the condi- tions for this trend to continue over the next  few years. Putin and his regime need domestic  stability and continuity in order to be able to  pursue an accelerated foreign policy strate- gy aimed at restoring Russia's role as a major  power on the international stage. In order to  stay in power, Putin and his cronies from St.  Petersburg control Russia's domestic political  processes and its economy. Key to this control  are the so-called power ministries, the most im- portant state agencies for protecting the regime  from internal challenges, in particular, but also  from external ones. A selection of these agen- cies is described below.  Presidential Administration One of the most important management and   control instruments is the Presidential Admin- istration under the direction of Anton Waino. It  consists of a large number of advisers and offi- cials who influence Russia's domestic, foreign  and economic policy. For example, important  laws are drafted in the Presidential Administra- tion before they are subsequently submitted to  Parliament to be debated and voted on. This is  often only a matter of form. The Presidential  Administration also oversees the state media  and gives them regular and detailed instruc-  tions on which topics to report on and what  guidelines to follow.  The key person in the Presidential Admin- istration is its deputy head Sergei Kiriyenko,  who was in charge of Putin's recent election  campaign. Kiriyenko was Prime Minister for  a short time in 1998 under Boris Yeltsin and  then for many years Director General of the  State Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom,  of which he remains Chairman of the Board  of Directors. Kiriyenko enjoys the support of  influential bankers from St. Petersburg and has  close links to Putin's immediate circle.  National Guard In 2016, Putin created a National Guard,   which today has more than 300,000 employ- ees, to secure internal control and his personal  power. It reports directly to him. The National  Guard was, among other things, responsible for  security during the presidential elections and,  together with other bodies, will also ensure se- curity during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The  National Guard's main tasks are to safeguard  public order in Russia and to protect state insti- tutions and communication facilities, as well as  combating terrorism and extremism.  The National Guard has a country-wide  presence through its seven regional commands,  with a particular focus on the North Caucasus.  In addition, it has numerous mobile special  units in Moscow that can be dispatched to the  regions rapidly if required. Its formation was  planned far in advance, with the preparatory     FOCUS: RUSSIA    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S24  work being carried out in Putin's innermost  circle.  The Director of the National Guard is Gener- al Viktor Zolotov, one of the President's closest  confidants. From 1999 to 2013, Zolotov was  head of the Presidential Security Service, Pu- tin's bodyguard. There is considerable over- lap between the competencies of the National  Guard and those of the Federal Security Ser- vice (FSB) and other power ministries. Among  the central security agencies, the National  Guard also acts as a counterweight to the FSB.  Federal Security Service Like the National Guard, the FSB is primar-  ily responsible for Russia's internal security. It  employs more than 300,000 people and has  regional departments spread across the entire  country. Its current leadership is made up of  individuals belonging to various factions in  Putin's entourage. The FSB is thus not run by a  homogeneous leadership, which makes Putin's  control over the organisation more difficult.   One of its most important departments is that  responsible for economic security. This is used  by the Kremlin e.g. to control the oligarchs and  critical financial flows in Russia. Like most  other power ministries, the FSB has its own  academy, which is one of the country's most  prestigious universities. The FSB can therefore  now draw on a younger generation of officers  who are also familiar with the latest technolo- gies. One of the areas it covers is surveillance  of the Internet and offensive cyber campaigns  against domestic and foreign organisations.  Military Intelligence Service Another large institution in the Russian state   apparatus that can carry out cyber operations  is the Military Intelligence Service (GU, until  2011 known as the GRU). It reports to the Min- istry of Defence and the General Staff. Besides  the GU, there are other organisations in the  Ministry of Defence that are active in the cyber  arena and have been expanded considerably in  recent years. The GU has a large number of   National Guard FSB Investigative  CommitteeFSO SVRPresidential Administration  Petersburg Group (selection)  GU Ministry of Foreign A�airs  Control of domestic political  processes  Y.

It also has numerous armed special units  reporting to it. These are stationed primarily in  the European part of Russia, but are also de- ployed abroad. Estimates of the numbers of  personnel in these special units vary widely.  Since Putin took office in 2000, the Military  Intelligence Service's influence vis-à-vis the  FSB has steadily declined. However, it tradi- tionally enjoys the support of the military es- tablishment, and in the wake of the Ukrainian  crisis and the deployment of the armed forces  in Syria it has regained influence vis-à-vis the  other power ministries.  Foreign Intelligence Service When conducting activities abroad, both   the FSB and the Military Intelligence Service  work together with the Foreign Intelligence  Service (SVR). Like most other power minis- tries, it reports directly to the President. Since  2016, its Director has been Putin's trusted ad- viser Sergei Naryshkin, who previously held a  leading position in the Presidential Adminis- tration and was Speaker of Parliament. Nary- shkin is a political heavyweight who, along  with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and  Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, is seen as a  potential successor to Putin as President. Putin  still maintains close links not just with Nary- shkin but with the other members of the SVR  leadership. Historically, the SVR evolved out  of the former foreign intelligence arm of the  Soviet intelligence service KGB. The present  SVR Academy is the successor to the former  Red Banner (or Andropov) Institute, whose   graduates include both Putin and Naryshkin.  The number of SVR employees is estimated  at between 10,000 and 20,000. It is mainly ac- tive in the former Soviet republics, the rest of  Europe and the USA. One of its strengths is  industrial espionage. Since 2015, it has also  had an increasing presence in Syria.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  As with most of the other power ministries,   Putin has a strong personal influence on the  Foreign Ministry. This is exerted primarily  through his advisers in the Presidential Ad- ministration. The leadership of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, including Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov, consists mainly of graduates of  the Moscow State Institute of International Re- lations (MGIMO), the training ground for the  diplomatic elite. Like the FSB Academy, this is  one of the most prestigious universities in Rus- sia. Formally under the control of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, the Institute is now an in- tegral part of the regime. The Institute's Board  of Directors has several dozen members, who  are currently among the most influential deci- sion-makers in Russia.  Federal Protective Service Like the FSB and the SVR, the Federal   Protective Service (FSO) evolved from the  structures of the Soviet KGB. Its predecessor  organisations in the KGB were responsible for  protecting the Communist Party elite. In addi- tion to providing personal protection, it is now  primarily responsible for protecting govern- ment buildings, nuclear power plants and insti- tutions which form part of the military-indus-    FOCUS: RUSSIA    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S26  trial complex. It has around 40,000 employees.  At its core is the Presidential Security Service,  formerly headed by the influential commander  of the National Guard, General Zolotov. The  Presidential Security Service's functions in- clude organising all of the President's foreign  travel. The Special Communications and Infor- mation Service is responsible for the operation  and security of all information and communi- cation equipment in state institutions. The FSO  likewise runs an academy, which also serves as  a training ground for other power ministries.  Investigative Committee One of Putin's most important domestic po-  litical instruments of power is the Investigative  Committee, which was detached from the Pros- ecutor General's Office in 2011. Putin uses it  primarily to crack down on domestic political  opponents, and it is one of the main instruments  used by the Kremlin to eliminate extraparlia- mentary opposition. For ten years it has been  headed by Alexander Bastrykin, who studied  law with Putin at Leningrad University. He  has an authoritarian leadership style, keeping  a very close eye on politically sensitive cases,  in particular. In addition to its headquarters in  Moscow, the Investigative Committee has de- partments in many Russian cities, including St.  Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg,  Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk  in Russia's far east.  Power ministries and the economy The relationship between the power min-  istries is not without friction. Essentially,  however, they are instructed by the Kremlin   to cooperate. The chief mediator here is Pu- tin, who personally intervenes when rivalries  between the power ministries threaten to es- calate. In addition to monitoring political and  social processes, the power ministries are also  responsible for overseeing the economy. The  Russian economy is dominated by large cor- porations, such as Gazprom and Rosneft, and  the state banks associated with them. The FSB,  in particular, exerts a great deal of influence on  the business conglomerates. The corporations'  security departments are usually staffed by in- telligence service officers. The most important  economic sectors that have close links with  the power ministries are the energy industry,  the financial sector, the arms industry and the  telecommunications and information sector. In  return, it is the business conglomerates who  finance much of the state budget, and thus also  the power ministries, through their tax pay- ments. A symbiotic relationship between the  power ministries and the large corporations is  thus inherent in the system.  The internal consolidation of the Putin sys- tem suggests that the opposition in Russia has  a tough job and that the regime's dominance  has become virtually unassailable. Apart from  its dependency on the key figure of Putin, the  only apparent potential weakness of the sys- tem at present is its dependence on oil price  movements. The energy corporations tradi- tionally finance about half the Russian state  budget. The Russian oil industry is profitable  down to a price of around 30 dollars per bar- rel. If the price falls below this threshold for  an extended period of time, the Russian econ- omy and thus the Putin system may be desta-    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  FOCUS: RUSSIA    27  bilised. Since its low in 2015, however, the oil  price has now risen again to over 60 dollars  per barrel.  Increasing pressure on Eastern Europe In terms of security policy, one of Putin's   most important projects is the re-establishment  of a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Eu- rope, a sphere of influence in the sense of a cor- don sanitaire, a buffer zone on Russia's western  flank. From Russia's point of view, this sphere  of influence covers large areas between the Bal- tic Sea and the Black Sea. Putin considers it his  personal historic mission to establish this zone  of influence in order to protect Russia from the  expansion of the NATO transatlantic alliance  under the leadership of the United States. He  sees himself in the tradition of Russian tsars of  the 17th and 18th centuries, of Peter the Great  and Catherine the Great, under whose leader- ship the territories which today form the Baltic  states, Belarus and Ukraine were conquered.  The geostrategic struggle for the area between  the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea is deeply root- ed in Russian and European history and will  determine the relationship between Russia and  the transatlantic West well into the 2020s.  The Russian armed forces will also play a  central role here. Under Putin, these have grad- ually been developed into an instrument that  can be deployed in concrete situations. The on- going operations in Ukraine and Syria demon- strate that there is the political will and suffi- cient military potential to deploy the armed  forces. Russia has modern weapon systems and  can thus demonstrate capabilities on a par with  those of Western armed forces. It has success-  fully pushed ahead with the consolidation pro- cess in recent years. Under the current arma- ments program running from 2011 to 2020, it  will continue to implement its aims of modern- izing its assets according to plan. This is likely  to continue at a similar pace in the overlapping  follow-on programme from 2018 to 2027. The  increased injection of contract staff into the  armed forces has led to a significant rise in the  levels of training, preparedness and deploy- ability. Several major exercises have demon- strated impressive mobilisation and command  and control skills. The nuclear weapon systems  of the so-called ‘strategic triad’ continue to  be accorded high priority, and Russia invests  heavily in their maintenance and renewal. The  employment of nuclear weapons is also regu- larly practised, including in basically conven- tional scenarios.   The ideological nature of the Russian lead- ership and the historical development of this  region provide an indication of the extent of  Russia's ambitions in Eastern Europe. Ukraine,  where a war with periodic fragile ceasefires has  been ongoing since 2014, will remain in the  spotlight. Long-term control of Ukraine is key  to the establishment of a Russian zone of in- fluence. As events in connection with Ukraine  since 2014 demonstrate, Russia is not afraid  of using military force. To the north, Belarus  has already been very much reintegrated into  Russia's sphere of control in recent years. Its  economy is largely dependent on the Russian  economy. Since the Ukrainian crisis, President  Alexander Lukashenko has been trying to pre- vent a ‘Ukraine’ scenario, i.e. war on Belarus  soil, and therefore favours developing Belarus     FOCUS: RUSSIA    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S28  500 km  Volga  Vistula  Danube  Dnieper  Ob  B l a c k  S e a    B a l t i c S e a  B a re n t s  S e a  C a s p i a n S e a  POLANDPOLAND  LITHUANIALITHUANIA  LATVIALATVIA  BELARUSBELARUS  UKRAINEUKRAINE  KrimKrim  GEORGIAGEORGIA  KAZAKSTANKAZAKSTAN  AZERBAIJANAZERBAIJAN  TURKEYTURKEY  ARMENIAARMENIA  ESTONIAESTONIA  NORWAY  SWEDENSWEDEN FINLANDFINLAND  GREECEGREECE  MAC.MAC.

The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia  and Lithuania, have been members of NATO  and the EU since 2004, which is why Russia is  avoiding open confrontation with these coun- tries. However, they are already under consid- erable pressure from Russia, which is likely to  increase further in the years to come. In addi- tion to the application of political, economic  and propagandistic leverage, cyber attacks  with far more serious consequences than hith- erto are also a possibility.  Russia and Switzerland Internal political and economic consolida-  tion has created the essential preconditions for  Russia to keep the pressure on Eastern Europe  high during what is likely to be Putin's last  term in office. The last ten years have been  marked by a steady deterioration in relations  between Russia and the transatlantic West.  The 2008 war in Georgia and the Ukrainian  crisis of 2014, as well as the Western sanctions  which were imposed in response to them and  have been intensified over the past four years,  are visible evidence of this. There is currently  no sign that Russia's relationship with the West  has yet reached its lowest point. On the con- trary, this relationship could deteriorate fur- ther, in line with the trend over the last several  years. The tensions between Russia and NATO  and between Russia and the EU will continue  to have an impact on Switzerland. In the wake  of the Ukrainian crisis, measures have been  taken in Switzerland to prevent the country  being used to circumvent sanctions. In addi- tion, as a non-aligned country, Switzerland is   also of particular importance to Russia as an  international trading and financial centre. This  gives rise to special requirements, particularly  when it comes to handling the Russian elite's  assets.       S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S 31  Jihadist and ethno-nationalist terrorism and  violent extremism  The terrorist threat in Europe and Switzerland comes primarily from the jihadist movement  and its two main actors, ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda. ‘Islamic State’ and the individuals and  small groups controlled or inspired by it continue to be the dominant threat. The threat posed  by al-Qaeda persists. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened level. Swiss  nationals could also fall victim to kidnappings or attacks by terrorists in many places abroad. Ethno-nationalist terrorism and violent extremism remain relevant to the threat situation in  Switzerland. The PKK, in particular, has the capacity to mobilise its supporters in Western  Europe to take part in coordinated rallies and campaigns at short notice.

The regional  affiliates of both terrorist organisations pose a  threat to Western and thus also Swiss interests  primarily in their respective main areas of op- eration.  The caliphate loses its territory In 2014 and 2015, ‘Islamic State’ trans-  formed itself from a local Sunni jihadist group  established in Syria and Iraq under the ideolog- ical umbrella of core al-Qaeda into the domi- nant jihadist terrorist organisation and move- ment worldwide. During the course of 2017,   however, it came under increasing military  pressure and suffered numerous defeats in its  core territory in Syria and Iraq. Having lost its  two major centres, Mosul in summer 2017 and  Raqqa in autumn 2017, it also lost the bulk of  its remaining territories within the space of a  few months. Since the end of 2017, its state- like structures, including its openly operating  military units, have been annihilated. A large  proportion of its leaders and fighters have been  killed in battle. Thousands of local fighters  have deserted. Some of these have surrendered.  However, some of the leaders and fighters have  gone underground in their lost territories or  have retreated to neighbouring countries, from  where they continue to operate in clandestine  cells and networks. A few fighters have joined  other jihadist groups in the Levant. In Syria  and Iraq, a large proportion of the jihad trav- ellers have been killed or been picked up by   S I T U AT I O N  200 km  TURKEY  ISRAEL JORDAN  IRAN  SYRIA  LEBANON  IRAQ  ‘Islamic State’  February 2018 Territory Lost from February 2017 to February 2018  Tigris  DAMASCUS BAGHDAD  Aleppo  Idlib  Homs  Dara  PalmyraQaryatayn  Hamah  Al Bab Manbij  Tartus  Latakia  Abu Kamal  Al Qaim  Al Qamishli  Tall Afar Sinjar  Arbil Mosul  Dahuk  Kirkuk  As Sulaymaniyah  Hawijah  Al Hadithah Samarra  Hit  Ar Rutbah Ar Ramadi  Tikrit  Bayji  Baqubah  Karbala Al Kut  An Najaf  Al Fallujah  Azaz  KobaneJarablus  Tabqah Ar Raqqah  Al Hasakah  Deir az-Zor  Tall al Abyad  Mediterr.

Others have travelled on  to third countries such as Turkey, gone under- ground or returned to their countries of origin.  However, no large-scale movements to other  conflict zones where jihadist groups are oper- ating have been observed.  ‘Islamic State’ has jihadist competition in  Syria  ‘Islamic State’ made early preparations for  continuing its fight from underground and on  a number of fronts, particularly in the second  half of 2017, it also pulled out leaders, fight- ers and their families in good time. Many of  the structures and networks established in  the region therefore still exist. Consequently,  even after the loss of its core territories, ‘Is- lamic State’ will be able to continue to make  its presence felt in both Syria and Iraq and to  undermine its opponents' stabilisation and re- construction efforts by means of intimidating  and violent actions.  In Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, Or- ganisation for the Liberation of the Levant),  in particular, plays an important role in the ji- hadist scene alongside ‘Islamic State’. HTS is  an alliance of various jihadist groups and mi- litias; it was founded in January 2017 through  the merger of these groups and Jabhat Fath  al-Sham (previously Jabhat al-Nusra), which  had close links with core al-Qaeda. HTS wants  to position itself as the leading coalition in  the armed opposition against the Assad re- gime, particularly in the north-western Syrian  province of Idlib, and to this end is also tak- ing action against other opposition groups. The  leaders of the major subgroups of HTS are all   represented on its executive committee. How- ever, in 2017 it became clear that the alliance's  internal cohesion is under threat because of  ideological differences and personal tensions.

This ultimate strategic objective still exists,  even though its first attempt to establish a state was  crushed after about three and a half years, at the end  of 2017.  Armed group  In organisational terms, ‘Islamic State’ should also be  viewed as an armed group. The open armed struggle  has long contributed to its sense of identity and co- hesion. With the break-up of its state-like structures,  the military units which previously operated openly  have been destroyed or driven underground.   Terrorist actor  ‘Islamic State’ has never abandoned its policy of  systematically spreading fear and terror: terrorism  remains its primary method. With the destruction of  the caliphate, the relative importance of this aspect  is growing, as in the early days of the organisation.  The terrorist activities of ‘Islamic State’ and of the  supporters and sympathisers inspired by it take place  almost all around the globe. ‘Islamic State’ now also  claims responsibility for attacks which it did not carry  out itself.  Regional power  ‘Islamic State’ consists essentially of a strategic lead- ership comprising a small number of men, together  with various provinces and affiliated terrorist groups  and cells in Syria and Iraq, Africa and Asia. The de- struction of the caliphate in the Levant, where its  provinces in Syria and Iraq had temporarily formed   a contiguous structure, has done nothing to change  this fundamental arrangement. However, ‘Islamic  State’'s influence as a regional power declined sig- nificantly in the second half of 2017. Nonetheless, its  affiliates outside its core territory continue to operate  independently of developments in Syria and Iraq. As  a result, ‘Islamic State’ still exerts influence in numer- ous conflict areas worldwide.  Inspiration  Through its clever use of the information sphere, ‘Is- lamic State’, together with its local supporters and  sympathisers, manages to inspire people all over the  world to take action. This includes carrying out terror- ist attacks, disseminating propaganda or providing  support through donations. However, toward the end  of 2017 there was a significant decline in the quality  and quantity of its multilingual propaganda products.   ‘Islamic State’ has lost much of its former appeal.   Utopia The placeless and timeless utopia of an Islamic world  state, the caliphate, in which Muslims can live accord- ing to Islamic law, is not a new idea. However, ‘Islamic  State’ succeeded in giving this utopia a new form.  Despite major international opposition, it was able to  attract mass support and to establish and finance a  rudimentary state structure, which it also managed  to defend and administer for a certain period of time.  Furthermore, outside Syria and Iraq, numerous jihad- ist organisations pledged allegiance to ‘Islamic State’,  thereby extending its influence and power. Unlike  al-Qaeda, ‘Islamic State’ went at least some way to- ward making the utopia reality.    JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S36  Core al-Qaeda wants to regain its appeal  The most recent attack on European soil for   which al-Qaeda claimed responsibility dates  back to January 2015; it was targeted at the  editorial offices of ‘Charlie Hebdo’ in Paris  (France). The fact that al-Qaeda has largely  failed to carry out any successful high-profile  actions against Western interests has weakened  its position vis-à-vis competing jihadist groups.  Core al-Qaeda's image was further weakened  when Jabhat al-Nusra distanced itself from it in  summer 2016. While ‘Islamic State’ has lost its  caliphate, core al-Qaeda is working to recover  the considerable appeal it once had in the glo- bal jihadist movement. To this end, it is trying  to establish Hamza Bin Laden, the son of its  killed former leader Osama Bin Laden, as a fu- ture leadership figure.   Provinces and affiliates of ‘Islamic State’ and  al-Qaeda  The degree of cooperation between the core  structures of ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda and  their respective regional affiliates varies. The   affiliates essentially have a high degree of au- tonomy and for the most part pursue a local  agenda. A few affiliates, however, have both  the ambition and the necessary capabilities  and resources to pursue international jihadist  goals. The local affiliates of ‘Islamic State’ in  Egypt, for example, not only carry out regu- lar attacks on Egyptian security forces, Copts  and other Muslims, but also occasionally at- tack international targets, an example being  the bombing of a Russian passenger plane in  October 2015.  North and West Africa In Egypt, the Maghreb and West Africa, sev-  eral jihadist groups have pledged allegiance ei- ther to ‘Islamic State’ or to al-Qaeda / al-Qaeda  in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Libya contin- ues to play an important role for ‘Islamic State’,  despite the complete loss of territories which  had been temporarily under the latter's control.  Whereas ‘Islamic State’ has lost all the territo- ries it controlled in Libya, AQIM has succeed- ed in maintaining its influence in parts of Libya.     S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION  37  It uses the south of the country, in particular,  as a safe haven and supply zone for actions in  Mali and other neighbouring states.   The security situation in Mali has deteriorated  sharply since 2015, partly because of AQIM's  terrorist activities. Since then, increasing num- bers of attacks have also been carried out in  major centres in West Africa outside AQIM's  core area, on targets frequented primarily by  foreigners, such as hotels and restaurants; two  Swiss nationals were among the victims of an  attack in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in Janu- ary 2016. Kidnappings of foreigners in order to  finance terrorist activities have also increased  since 2015. A Swiss woman abducted in Mali  in January 2016 was still being held hostage at  the time of going to press. Since March 2017,  when AQIM and other jihadist groups merged  to form a coalition called ‘Group for the Sup- port of Islam and Muslims’, the terrorist threat  situation in Mali has escalated further. This  merger has led to an expansion of their area of  operations and to more frequent attacks.  The jihadist threat is less pronounced in Tu- nisia, Morocco and Algeria, chiefly on account  of the effectiveness of the security authorities  and comparatively stable political conditions  in those countries. Although Tunisia has ex- panded its capacity to combat terrorism over  the last two years, attacks by local cells of ‘Is- lamic State’ and AQIM pose a threat to foreign,  including Swiss interests, even in urban coastal  areas.  Central and East Africa The security situation in the states border-  ing Lake Chad (Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and   Chad) remains precarious due to the terrorist  activities of Boko Haram. Since 2009, attacks  on the civilian population and security forces  have resulted in around 20,000 deaths and dis- placed more than two million people. In August  2016, Boko Haram split into two factions, with  one affiliating itself to ‘Islamic State’ under  the name ‘West Africa Province’. The split in  Boko Haram has done nothing to improve the  security situation. The security forces in the re- gion have not succeeded in weakening the two  Boko Haram factions significantly, despite in- tensified and better-coordinated countermeas- ures. In East Africa, al-Shabaab still controls  substantial parts of Somalia and also continues  to pose a threat in Kenya.  Arabian Peninsula As a result of the conflict between Houthi   militia and the current Yemeni government,  which is supported militarily by Saudi Arabia,  al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has  been able to consolidate its presence in Yemen.  AQAP is willing to attack Western targets and  has the capabilities to do so. However, its ter- rorist activities are currently focussed primarily  on local targets. AQAP and ‘Islamic State’ reg- ularly carry out attacks in Yemen. Compared  with AQAP, however, the local affiliate of ‘Is- lamic State’ plays a far less significant role.  Afghanistan, Pakistan and South-East Asia Numerous militant Islamist and jihadist   groups have a presence in Afghanistan and on  the Indian subcontinent. Alongside elements of  core al-Qaeda and its local affiliate al-Qaeda in  the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), ‘Islamic State’     JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S38  has also established a presence in the shape of  its Khorasan Province (ISKP). Despite major  losses, among them several leaders, ISKP has  so far managed to survive – in part through col- laboration with other Islamist and jihadist or- ganisations in the region – and to stage frequent  major attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   In South-East Asia, a number of jihadist  groups have been active for a long time. In  May 2017, a Philippine affiliate of ‘Islamic  State’ recorded a major success when it took  over the city of Marawi (population 200,000)  on the island of Mindanao. Only after a sev- eral-month-long siege and battles involving  heavy losses, as well as the deaths of both the  local ‘Islamic State’ leaders in October 2017,  was the city declared liberated by the Philip- pine security forces. ‘Islamic State’'s propa-  ganda made much capital out of the prolonged  resistance, and the battle for Marawi was mar- keted as a new focal point for jihad travellers  from across the region.   Attacks in Europe The threat of attacks carried out by jihad-mo-  tivated lone perpetrators or small groups is  present throughout Europe. Analysis of the ma- jor attacks in Europe between 2015 and 2017  shows that the number of attacks has increased  steadily over the last three years. Since Febru- ary 2017, there have been just under two dozen  attacks and attempted attacks in Europe. Four  of these claimed numerous lives and left many  injured. A common factor in all the attacks was  that the targets were either uniformed police- men and soldiers or passers-by in the centres   Copenhagen 14.02.2015  Turku 18.08.2017  Stockholm 07.04.2017  Hamburg 28.07.2017  Ansbach 24.07.2016  Essen 16.04.2016 Berlin  19.12.2016  Spandau 17.09.2015  Würzburg 18.07.2016  Charleroi 06.08.2016  London 05.12.2015 22.03.2017 03.06.2017 25.08.2017 15.09.2017  Manchester 22.05.2017  Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray 26.07.2016  Saint-Quentin 26.06.2015  Magnanville 13.06.2016  Joué-lès-Tours 20.12.2014  Nantes 22.12.2014  Marseille 18.11.2015 11.01.2016 18.04.2017 01.10.2017  Barcelona 17.08.2017  Cambrils 17.08.2017  Nice 03.02.2015 14.07.2016  Brussels 24.05.2014  21.08.2015* 22.03.2016 05.10.2016 21.06.2017 25.08.2017  * Thalys Amsterdam - Paris  Paris 07.-09.01.2015  13.11.2015 07.01.2016 03.02.2017 18.03.2017 20.04.2017 06.06.2017 19.06.2017 09.08.2017 15.09.2017  UNITED KINGDOM  DENMARK  GERMANY  BELGIUM  FRANCE  SPAIN  SWEDEN  FINLAND    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION  39  of major cities. The bulk of these attacks were  carried out by lone perpetrators operating with  minimal logistical resources. Knives or vehi- cles were used in around three-quarters of the  attacks, with the others involving explosives  and (only rarely) firearms. Almost all the per- petrators had been inspired by ‘Islamic State’.  However, no evidence was found of a direct link  between ‘Islamic State’ and any of the perpe- trators, even where they acted in line with its  aims and in some cases verifiably in its name  or where ‘Islamic State’ subsequently claimed  responsibility for the act. The perpetrators were  all male, Muslim and between 17 and 53 years  of age (average age just under 30). Most of the  perpetrators lived in the state concerned or even  near the crime scene. Most came from a migrant  background, but had been born in the state in  which they carried out the attack and/or had ac- quired citizenship of that state. Approximately  half the perpetrators had a North African back- ground. Many of the perpetrators were previ- ously unknown to the security authorities or had  attracted their attention only due to involvement  in petty crime.  Radicalisation in Switzerland The phenomenon of radicalisation in relation   to jihadist terrorism continues to be an issue for  Switzerland. Despite ‘Islamic State’'s territori- al losses and a discernible decline in the qual- ity and quantity of the terrorist organisation's  propaganda activities, individuals from a wide  range of backgrounds continue to be drawn  to the ideas of jihadist terrorism. The FIS has  established through its monitoring of jihadist  websites that the majority of the users in Swit-  zerland who have come to its attention are still  more likely to be ‘Islamic State’ sympathisers,  though the proportion supporting al-Qaeda has  once again increased.   Alongside the consumption of jihadist con- tent on the Internet, personal contacts still  play a key role when it comes to radicalisation.  Such contacts are also more and more often de- liberately being arranged outside the confines  of institutions such as mosques, for example.  As elsewhere, there are a few radicalised in- dividuals in Switzerland who devote them- selves to recruitment. They try to win people  they know over to Salafism and ultimately to  jihad. Particularly in population centres close  to borders, there are cross-border links which  are also used for recruitment.   To counter the recruitement activities of  salafist networks, a number of measures have  been evaluated and initiated. Measures on the  communal and cantonal level to stop ‘Read’  distribution activities, such as the denial of le- gal permits, have been shown to be the most  effective means. Since the authorities began to  implement these measures in a more consistent  way in the early summer of 2017, a significant  reduction of ‘Read!’ Quran distribution activi- ties has been observed. Sporadic attempts of   ‘Read!’ activists to continue with related activi- ties such as ‘Free Quran’ or ‘We love Moham- med’, have also been stopped.  Security authorities are also increasingly fo- cussing their attention on recruitement activi- ties in prisons. Outside Switzerland, a number  of attacks have recently been carried out by  individuals who had either been radicalised  whilst in prison or had radicalised other pris-    JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S40  oners. Security authorities in Switzerland have  also identified occurrences of radicalisation in  penal institutions. Since July 2016, Swiss se- curity authorities also have to face the problem  of radicalised individuals, who are released at  the end of their prison term, but still represent  a threat to Switzerland’s security due to their  radical views. This problem is accentuated by  the fact that some of the radicalised individuals  without Swiss nationality cannot be deported.  Information on planned attacks The federal security authorities frequently   receive and process information which points  directly or indirectly to ideas, intentions or pre- paratory actions in connection with a possible  attack with links to Switzerland. In this context,  a rise in the number of direct links between ‘Is- lamic State’ and Switzerland has been detected.  Based on these findings, a number of individu- als have been arrested, and some of these have  already been convicted.  Travel movements almost at an end Since summer 2015, the number of persons   travelling from Switzerland to conflict areas for  jihadist reasons has fallen significantly; since  August 2016, the FIS has not recorded any per- sons leaving Switzerland in order to travel to a  jihad area. This development is consistent with   ‘Islamic State’ propaganda. In 2017, ‘Islamic  State’ made several appeals to people not to  travel to the caliphate, but to carry out attacks  in the name of ‘Islamic State’ where they live.  The collapse of the caliphate in the Levant  has not so far resulted in a significant rise in the  number of persons returning from jihad areas  to Europe. And in Switzerland, too, no further  returnees have been recorded since the start  of 2016. Possible alternative destinations may  be third states like Turkey or the countries of  origin of the parents or grandparents. Various  European states face a situation whereby fami- lies have been started in the caliphate and as a  result there are increasing numbers of spouses  and minors among the returnees. To date, the  FIS is aware of around a dozen women and  two dozen children among jihad tourists with  direct links to Switzerland. The law enforce- ment agencies are responsible for dealing with  such cases.  PKK has high potential to mobilise support  In Turkey, terrorist activities suspected of   being linked to the PKK are down compared  to 2016. However, fighting between the armed  wing of the PKK and Turkish security forces  in the region has continued unabated and is  claiming losses on both sides.

In the Kurdish region of northern Syria, the  PKK's sister party, the Democratic Union Party  (PYD), is using its YPG (People's Protection  Units) militia to defend the areas it controls,  known as Rojava or the Democratic Feder- ation of Northern Syria. Besides demanding   freedom for its symbolic figurehead, Abdul- lah Öcalan, the PKK is focusing its efforts on  ensuring the continued survival of Rojava and  obtaining international recognition for it. After  the referendum on independence for the Kurd- ish area of northern Iraq in autumn 2017, the  invasion by Iraq's central government and the  economic sanctions by Iran and Turkey did not  trigger any countermeasures by the PKK.  National Action Plan to prevent and counter radicalisation and violent extremism  In December 2017, the Swiss Security Network SSN  (Confederation, cantons, cities, municipalities) pre- sented its National Action Plan to prevent and coun- ter radicalisation and violent extremism. The Federal  Council took note of the Action Plan and announced  its intention to support the implementation of the Ac- tion Plan by funding a five-year stimulus programme.  The Action Plan focusses on prevention, one of the  four action areas laid down in Switzerland's coun- ter-terrorism strategy. This strategy was ratified by the  Federal Council in September 2015. Proposals include  the use of tools for early detection, the introduction  of a threat management system and the development  of measures to promote disengagement and rein- tegration. In addition, the Action Plan recommends  various training measures for a wide range of officials  and emphasises the foreign policy commitment to  preventing violent extremism. It is particularly impor- tant to support and empower children, young people   and women as important actors in prevention. These  measures are to be implemented by the authorities in  collaboration with civil society, and where possible  are designed to build on and integrate existing meas- ures and programmes. The report lists the specialist  units and contact points which anyone with questions  relating to suspected radicalisation can and should  contact. Some of these units are run by the police.  Anyone who has information on radicalisation or vi- olent extremist or terrorist activities can and should  contact them. Anything believed to be suspicious can  be reported to any police station and, in urgent cases,  by calling the 117 police hotline. This ensures that no  time is lost before the police can intervene. In this way,  spontaneous communications from the public can be  processed efficiently by the cantonal and communal  police forces and if necessary forwarded to the spe- cialist units responsible or to other security authorities.

The partici- pants in the rallies were protesting in particu- lar against the ban on visits imposed by the  Turkish government. In Switzerland, most of  the protest actions passed off without violence.  The PKK leadership ensured this by closely  monitoring young activists, in particular, but  also its left-wing extremist supporters. The  amount of money raised to support the Kurdish  cause was up compared with previous years.  At present, the mood among PKK supporters  is one of frustration because they feel that Eu- rope's stance toward the conflict in the Kurdish  regions is too passive.  Terrorism-related financial transactions In Switzerland, there is currently little finan-  cial activity suspected of funding terrorism.  Nonetheless, in 2017 a slight increase was re- corded in transactions out of and into Switzer- land that were suspected of serving Islamist or  jihadist purposes. These mainly involved small  amounts, which are hard to trace. The most re- liable indicator is provided by the suspicious  activity reports (SARs) sent by Swiss financial  intermediaries to the Money Laundering Re- porting Office Switzerland (MROS), on which  MROS issues a public report annually.    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT  43  A S S E S S M E N T  ‘Islamic State’ continues to lead the way Despite the loss of most of its territory in Iraq   and Syria, ‘Islamic State’ continues to pose a  significant terrorist threat to Europe. It retains  the capability to launch actions there, albeit in  a greatly limited way. As yet, no other jihad- ist organisation in the Levant has been able to  take over ‘Islamic State’'s leadership role, and  there is no sign of any successor organisation  to replace it. For the time being, ‘Islamic State’  therefore remains the leading jihadist terrorist  organisation worldwide, but it has lost much of  its former potency and appeal.  Going back underground The retreat underground and the continuation   of the jihadist struggle in the form of a decen- tralised resistance movement employing gue- rilla tactics and terrorist methods should not be  viewed as a change in its strategic objectives.  Rather, it is a change in the way in which it  plans to use violence in order to achieve the  strategic objectives. Its withdrawal under- ground takes ‘Islamic State’ back to the place  where it enjoyed its initial successes. Today,  however, it is able to draw on a wide network  that extends beyond the borders of Syria and  Iraq and also on the expertise that it has built  up over a period of years. The terrorist organ- isation today is more firmly rooted and has a  better network of transnational connections  beyond its Sunni region of origin than was  the case when the caliphate was proclaimed in  summer 2014. Some of ‘Islamic State’'s decen-  trally organised media structures and logistics  cells are probably still in place. After all, dis- semination of ideology over the Internet is not  geographically restricted. Another factor is that  an important breeding ground on which the ji- hadist ideology has been able to develop has, in  the FIS's view, become even more fertile. After  the destruction of the caliphate, Arab Sunnis  remain the overall losers in the Levant.   Loss of the main sources of revenue With the loss of the territories it controlled   previously, ‘Islamic State’ has lost its main  sources of revenue (taxes, sale of oil and gas,  seized cultural objects, fines). The remaining  networks and cells therefore finance them- selves primarily through activities familiar  from organised crime (extortion, protection  money, ransom money, theft, etc.). However,  the loss of the territory it controlled, its mili- tary units and the administrative bodies it es- tablished means that its expenses are also de- creasing. Furthermore, promoting its ideology  and putting out propaganda on the Internet are  inexpensive and can continue even in financial- ly and militarily precarious situations.  Al-Qaeda still in the shadow of ‘Islamic State’ The threat posed by al-Qaeda persists. Core   al-Qaeda has lost the bulk of its operational  capabilities and resources, but it still harbours  the intention of carrying out attacks on West- ern targets. Some of its regional affiliates still  have considerable influence in their respective     JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S44  main areas of operation – e.g. al-Qaeda in the  Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaeda in the  Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), al-Qaeda in the In- dian Subcontinent (AQIS) or al-Shabaab in So- malia. They continue to push for global jihad  and attacks on Western targets.  Threat in several regions of Africa remains  high  The activities of jihadist groups and of affil- iates of ‘Islamic State’, AQIM, Boko Haram  and al-Shabaab are resulting in a high terrorist  threat level in many parts of Africa. In Libya,   ‘Islamic State’'s remaining cells are attempting  to reorganise themselves. They probably still  have the capability to carry out occasional at- tacks in Libya. However, the FIS considers it  unlikely that in the short to medium term they  will regain the influence and associated territo- rial control they had up until 2016.  Jihadist groups in West and North Africa  continue to see Western interests as legitimate  targets. In West Africa and in the Lake Chad  region, the main threat comes from AQIM and  its allies and from Boko Haram. In the light of  the international jihadist agenda, members of  international troop contingents or Western ci- vilians are still likely to be the prime targets in  Mali. Similarly, in Somalia, al-Shabaab views   all allies of the government, whether domestic  or international, as legitimate targets.   Jihadist threat in Europe persists Even though the potency, appeal and cred-  ibility of ‘Islamic State’ have been severely  damaged since summer 2017 and the caliphate  was destroyed at the end of 2017, ‘Islamic  State’ and its jihadist ideology continue to pose  a significant terrorist threat to Europe, includ- ing Switzerland. Its remaining cells and net- works, which are promoting terrorist activities  outside Syria and Iraq, are weakened, but they  are still active both physically and virtually. In  the light of the terrorist attacks in Europe since  2015 and the developments described above,  the terrorist threat in many European countries  remains heightened or even high. Attacks are  still to be expected. These may range from  simple attacks by individuals and small groups  to complex operations. Attacks involving little  logistical effort, executed by jihadist-inspired  lone perpetrators or small groups, can be car- ried out irrespective of the strength of ‘Islamic  State’ or of al-Qaeda as organisations. Lone  perpetrators and small groups inspired by them  generally act spontaneously, without any in- structions or financial support from outside.  Even larger-scale and more complex attacks     S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT  45  involving explosives or simple chemicals such  as toxic gases (for example chlorine gas) re- quire relatively few resources and little effort  on the part of the perpetrators. The perpetra- tors do, however, need to have the appropriate  expertise. Jihadists will therefore continue to  be not only willing but also able to carry out  both simple and more complex attacks. The  FIS considers that, for the time being, the only  threat likely to have been diminished by the  destruction of ‘Islamic State’'s caliphate is that  of complex attacks controlled and carried out  directly by ‘Islamic State’.  Switzerland as a possible target Switzerland is part of the Western world,   classified by jihadists as Islamophobic, and  thus from their point of view constitutes a  legitimate target for terrorist attacks. Howev- er, in the FIS's assessment– based on jihadist  propaganda and on attacks that have taken  place and those that have been thwarted – the  focus is more on other countries. In the event  of attacks on Swiss territory, therefore, the in- terests of other states that are perceived by ji- hadists as being Islamophobic or which play a  prominent role in the international fight against  jihadism may also be targeted. Jewish interests  may also be affected.  The FIS assesses that attacks involving min- imal logistical effort, carried out by individual  perpetrators or small groups, are currently the  most likely threat in Switzerland. In the FIS's  view, the risk of copycat attacks in Switzerland  will rise temporarily after each attack abroad.  Such attacks will not necessarily be jihad-mo- tivated, but may also have a different motive.   The perpetrators are most likely to be individ- uals radicalised in Switzerland who have been  inspired by jihadist propaganda and personal  contacts, but who are not in direct contact with  a jihadist group or organisation. These include  attacks by mentally ill perpetrators whose radi- calisation is more the result of their illness than  of ideological conviction. Switzerland can also  be used by jihadists as a logistics base for the  preparation of attacks abroad or as a transit  country. The most recent example of this is  the itinerary followed by two people who were  involved in the attacks in Barcelona and Cam- brils in August 2017.  In the areas outside Europe in which jihadist  groups operate, there is still a risk that Swiss  citizens might fall victim to opportunist abduc- tions or acts of violence.  Fewer jihad travellers with links to   Switzerland   ‘Homegrown’ jihadists radicalised in Swit- zerland have become more significant to the  threat assessment than jihad-motivated travel- lers. The decline in travel to conflict zones by  jihadists with links to Switzerland can be attrib- uted to a number of factors. Reports about the  harsh living conditions and ultimately the col- lapse of the caliphate have reduced the appeal  of Syria and Iraq to jihad-motivated fighters. In  addition, the enhanced countermeasures on the  travel routes to Syria and Iraq have made it sig- nificantly more difficult to access the conflict  area. Lastly, ‘Islamic State’'s appeals to jihad- ists to carry out attacks in their own country of  origin or residence rather than travelling to its  territory have probably also had an effect.

Salafist and jihadist groups are exploit- ing this polarisation accordingly.  Turkish-Kurdish conflict carries risks The PKK has the capacity to stage demonstra-  tions and other actions – including violent ones  – at short notice in response to events connect- ed with the conflict in Kurdish areas. Violent  clashes between PKK supporters and Turkish  nationalists and/or supporters of Turkish Presi- dent Erdogan currently pose the main threat in  Switzerland. Confrontations are generally the  result of direct provocation. Turkish institutions  and agencies (such as clubhouses, Turkish Air- lines (THY) travel agencies and government of- fices), as well as centres and mosques attended  by nationalist or Islamist Turks, are all potential  PKK targets.  The present state of emergency in Turkey  means that travellers, wherever they come from,  risk being turned away or arrested on arrival if  there is even a slight suspicion of their being  PKK members or supporting terrorism. This  also applies to Gülen supporters. In addition,  there is still a heightened risk of attacks in Tur- key, particularly in the major cities.  Limited significance of terrorist financing Switzerland as a financial centre does not   play a key role in terrorist financing. Whilst  there has been an increase in the number of  transactions out of Switzerland and within  Switzerland which are suspected of being used   Travel out of the conflict area in Syria and  Iraq is not easy. In addition, most surviving  jihad travellers are aware that they will be  confronted by the law enforcement agencies,  which is why they attempt to go underground  or to travel on to third countries.  The FIS is therefore not expecting a big influx  of returning jihad travellers with links to Swit- zerland, but only isolated individuals. Some  jihad travellers from Switzerland have married  and have had children in the conflict area. It is  therefore to be expected that possible returnees  might bring previously unknown persons with  them, possibly including minors. This will  present new challenges to the authorities at all  levels (legal issues, problems of long-term in- tegration and security issues). It will probably  take one or two more years until the extent of  the threat posed by returnees can be assessed in  a more precise way. The targeted exploitation  of migration flows to Europe and Switzerland  by ‘Islamic State’ or by former jihadist fighters  will also remain a real issue.  Polarisation can foster radicalisation Jihad-motivated attacks and migration move-  ments, particularly in 2015, have contributed  to a rise in tensions and to increased politi- cal polarisation in European societies. This is  also true in Switzerland, but to a lesser extent.  Such polarisation may exacerbate the nega-  User with links to Switzerland shares   a propaganda image from ‘Islamic State’.

Once funds are outside the country,  they become almost untraceable. The impor- tance of informal funds transfer systems is dif- ficult to gauge owing to the lack of possibilities  for monitoring them.

It is the national central office which, in accordance  with the provisions of the Anti-Money-Laundering Act,  receives suspicious activity reports relating to terrorist  financing etc. from financial intermediaries, analyses  them and, where necessary, forwards them to the  law enforcement agencies. At the same time, MROS   is a specialist authority which annually publishes  anonymised statistics on developments in combating  terrorist financing etc. in Switzerland and identifies  typologies, which are passed on to financial inter- mediaries for training purposes. MROS is not a police  agency. It is a member of the Egmont Group, an inter- national association of financial intelligence units. Its  goal is to create the conditions required for the secure,  fast and legally admissible exchange of information,  in order to combat terrorist financing etc.  MROS's annual report can be found at: https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/kriminalitaet/geldwaescherei/jb.html    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK  49  O U T LO O K  ‘Islamic State’ will continue its activities For the time being, ‘Islamic State’ remains   the dominant terrorist organisation worldwide.  In the short term, it will be able to carry out  attacks itself, both inside and outside its core  territory in the Levant, and to inspire others to  do the same, including in Europe.  Individual media offices and affiliates of ‘Is- lamic State’ will continue to engage actively in  online propaganda. However, their links with  their parent organisation will be more blurred  and no longer easy to trace. Supporters and  sympathisers will play their part in spreading  these jihadist messages as widely as possible.  Even if in future such messages appear less fre- quently and seem less coordinated and profes- sional, a new set of people will be inspired and  radicalised. Together with its supporters and  sympathisers, ‘Islamic State’ will continue to  shape the terrorist threat situation in the short  to medium term.  Competition between ‘Islamic State’ and  al-Qaeda is intensifying  Al-Qaeda is among those profiting from ‘Is- lamic State’'s military defeats in its core territo- ry in the Levant. The competition for the lead- ership role in the jihadist movement has once  again become more open, as, despite its rapid  rise to power, ‘Islamic State’ never succeeded  in superseding core al-Qaeda and its affiliates  completely. The outcome of this competition  remains uncertain. The key factors are whether   ‘Islamic State’ will be able to maintain a min-  imum level of organisation, how propaganda  from ‘Islamic State’ and al-Qaeda will evolve,  and how the various provinces and affiliates  and other jihadist groups worldwide will po- sition themselves – particularly if the death  or capture of Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi or Ayman  al-Zawahiri were to be confirmed.  If ‘Islamic State’ were to continue to lose  influence or if the organisation in its familiar  form were even to vanish and core al-Qaeda to  regain its former leadership role in the global  jihadist movement, al-Qaeda (and some of its  affiliates) might – given its unchanged aspira- tions and the resources available to it – again  carry out terrorist actions outside its area of in- fluence. In spite of the collapse of the caliphate,  jihadist messages will continue to fall on fertile  ground.  Ongoing threat in parts of Africa  In various regions in Africa, jihadist groups   are profiting from a combination of destabilis- ing factors. These include political and ethnic  tensions, security vulnerabilities and precari- ous economic and social conditions. The FIS  considers it unlikely that there will be a sub- stantial improvement in these underlying con- ditions in the short to medium term. It must  therefore be assumed that the jihadist threat in  the African regions listed above will remain  high. It is also likely that rival jihadist groups  will continue to vie with one another for su- premacy in their respective areas of operation.  In order to strengthen their position against ri-    JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S50  val groups, these groups will seek to carry out  spectacular attacks that will attract wide media  coverage or to take Westerners hostage.  Threat to Switzerland persists  In Europe and Switzerland, the primary   terrorist threat comes from jihadist terrorism.  Future terrorist events will range from simple  attacks by lone perpetrators and small groups  to more complex operations involving firearms,  explosives or simple chemicals such as toxic  gases. For Switzerland, however, attacks in- volving minimal logistical effort, executed by  lone perpetrators or small groups, are the most  likely type of threat. Swiss interests abroad  may also continue to be the target of attacks;  the risk of abduction persists. It is anticipated  that there will be isolated cases of jihad return- ees to Switzerland. The arrival of persons pre- viously unknown to the authorities must also  be expected.  Preventing radicalised individuals or small  groups from carrying out attacks remains a ma- jor challenge. The fact that they prepare clan- destinely and often commit crimes using tools  such as knives or motor vehicles, which are  readily available and do not arouse suspicion,  make early detection more difficult. While it   can be assumed that certain targets are more or  less likely to be chosen, ultimately it is almost  impossible to predict in advance which targets  terrorists actually have in their sights – except  where specific and credible evidence is avail- able.  Radicalisation as a social problem The problem of the radicalisation of – mainly   young – individuals is one which will persist  in Switzerland, as elsewhere, and will possibly  become even more acute. Salafist and jihadist  groups and organisations will continue delib- erately exploiting tensions in society for prop- aganda purposes in order to exacerbate nega- tive feelings in the Muslim community and to  win individuals over to their cause. The debate  about a general ban on face coverings will be a  test of this prediction.  Turkish-Kurdish conflict continues  The PKK will probably continue to hold pro-  test rallies and cultural events, the majority of  which will be peaceful. However, occasional  riots and violent actions must also be expected  in Switzerland, particularly during emotionally  charged rallies. Recruitment efforts are likely  to intensify. The PKK is constantly searching  for suitable young people to fight on the front  line or to join the ranks of the organisation  in Europe. Both fighters who have fallen in  Turkey or Syria and returnees are idolised as  heroes and provide the motivation for young  Kurds to carry out revenge or copycat attacks.

As a financial centre, Switzerland  could be used for transferring such funds.  Even in the future, however, the scale of terror- ist financing in Switzerland is likely to remain  small. If terrorist networks were to make more  systematic use of alternative funds transfer sys- tems in Switzerland, then it could increase in  volume. New technologies such as the use of  social media for crowdfunding or virtual cur- rencies like Bitcoin have as yet played only a  minor role. However, crowdfunding, in par- ticular, is likely to become more important in  future.    JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | FDFA travel advice  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S52  F D FA  t r a v e l  a d v i c e  Feeling safe is a subjective matter A Swiss national wrote to the Federal De-  partment of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) by e-mail  from his Central American holiday destination.  His friends there had recommended that he  should not go out alone at night. He himself  did not share this view.   He thought himself safe where others felt  threatened. Coming from a Swiss background,  he found it difficult to assess the situation at his  holiday location correctly.  Travel advice The FDFA's travel advice can provide guid-  ance here. It focusses on the political situation  and crime levels and highlights the risks abroad  for travellers. In addition, it provides not only  country-specific information but also many uni- versally valid, non-country-specific tips and in- formation relating to all aspects of travel.  The other side of the coin The Swiss national holidaying in Central   America objected that the travel advice, just  like the advice from his friends, seemed to him  too dramatic. He had not been robbed, nor had  he felt threatened.   It is true that the travel advice focusses on  risks. That is its job. Whereas tourism advertis- ing extols the virtues of tourist attractions and  beaches, the travel advice tends to show the  other side of the coin.   What is in the travel advice is based on veri- fied information and long-term observations. If   you know the risks and take precautions, you  may never see the other side of the coin yourself.  Sources of information for the travel advice Swiss embassies abroad are the main source   of the information which goes into the travel  advice. These draw on a large network of con- tacts: the authorities of the country concerned,  Swiss companies and private individuals who  are based in the country, local and indigenous  non-governmental organisations, other embas- sies and personal contacts. When evaluating  the terrorist threat, for example, information  from the intelligence services is added. This  broadly-based, long-term observation distin- guishes the travel advice from the individual  snapshots provided by travel blogs.  Attacks and abductions Another aspect of the other side of the coin   are attacks and abductions, which provoke a  range of emotions and responses.   If for a certain length of time no further at- tacks have been carried out or no further abduc- tions have taken place at a particular location,  interested parties and travellers sometimes re- quest the travel advice service to stop mention- ing these risks. However, the key point is not  how long it has been since an attack or an ab- duction took place, but whether the threat still  exists. For example, it is easy to forget that at  the time this report went to press, several West- erners, including a Swiss woman, were still be- ing held hostage in the Sahel region. Here, in     S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  JIHADIST AND ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM | FDFA travel advice  53  Available online at: www.eda.admin.ch/reisehinweise www.dfae.admin.ch/voyages www.dfae.admin.ch/viaggi www.twitter.com/travel_edadfae www.itineris.eda.admin.ch  Smartphone app   for Android and   iPhone: itineris  particular, the assessments of the intelligence  services are of considerable importance to the  FDFA's travel advice.   If an attack is carried out, however, anxious  travellers frequently expect the FDFA to act  quickly to advise against travel to the destina- tion concerned. Particularly if they have been  informed by their insurance company or their  travel agency that the cancellation costs of the  planned travel will be covered only if the FDFA  is advising against travel to the country con- cerned.   In view of the impossibility of predicting  attacks, the FDFA does not generally advise  against travel to cities and countries which  could be or already have been affected by  such attacks. The risk is present in virtually  every country and especially in places where  large numbers of people gather. On the other  hand, the FDFA does advise against travel to  countries or parts of countries in which there  is a high risk of abductions by terrorist groups.  This is because terrorists often deliberately  seek out foreign nationals as victims in order to  make political demands. Abductions can drag  on for years and be accompanied by enormous  physical and mental stresses on the abduction  victims and their relatives.  Personal responsibility Use of a wide range of sources, long-term   situation monitoring and consultation with var- ious offices within the FDFA ensure that the  travel advice provides as objective as possible  an assessment of the situation.   Travel operators and travel insurance compa- nies decide independently whether travel will   go ahead or cancellation costs will be covered.  In the same way, you take responsibility for de- ciding whether or not to undertake a journey.  You must also decide yourself whether and  where you go out for a walk at night. Howev- er, you would certainly be well advised to heed  the travel advice – and the recommendations of  your local contact person.       S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S 55  Right-wing and left-wing extremism  The potential for violence in right-wing extremist circles remains unchanged, while in left- wing extremist circles it has increased; as far as left-wing extremism is concerned, the sit- uation has become more acute. Violence motivated by left-wing extremism is directed not  only against property, but also against those perceived as right-wing extremists and, espe- cially during police operations, against the security forces. When using violence, left-wing  extremists often display extreme aggression. They are prepared to run the risk of injuring or  killing the persons they attack, and in some cases this is even their aim. Even leaving such  confrontations out of the equation, an increased number of acts of violence motivated by left- wing extremism were observed in the year under review. At the same time, there was also an  increase in the intensity of the forms of violence resorted to. Left-wing extremists maintain  and exploit their links with violent left-wing extremist groups abroad. Right-wing extremists  are continuing to keep a low profile. Developments regarding asylum and migration have  also contributed to the calm situation in this area – but the potential for violence in right-wing  extremist circles, especially relating to asylum and migration, remains.  Extremism  Violent right-wing extremism  Violent left-wing extremism    RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S56  Left-wing extremism: the situation has  deteriorated  In 2017, there were 16 incidents connected  with violent right-wing extremism and 200  incidents connected with violent left-wing ex- tremism of which the FIS is aware; incidents  merely involving graffiti have not been not  recorded. In the case of right-wing extremism,  this represents a decrease of around 30 per cent,  while in the case of left-wing extremism it rep- resents a decrease of around 6 per cent. Due to  the low nominal values, however, no trends can  be derived from the annual fluctuations. A look  back at the figures over several years nonethe- less initially confirms a general trend which has  been observed for some time: recorded events  involving right-wing extremism are rare, while  those involving left-wing extremism are com- paratively frequent – in the latter case, barely  two days pass without an incident, rather than  over three weeks in the former case.  Of greater importance to the situation as- sessment are the figures for events involving  violence. In the case of right-wing extremism,  just one violent incident was observed – con- firming the long-term trend. By contrast, acts   of violence involving left-wing extremism  have increased by over 30 per cent in absolute  terms, and their share of the total number of  events motivated by left-wing extremism has  risen from 28 to 50 per cent. The same picture  of a deteriorating situation emerges when the  intensity of violence motivated by left-wing  extremism is included: disregarding serious  physical violence against the security forces  during rallies, the left-wing extremist scene  had for years employed more moderate forms  of violence. Instead of fire, paint was used, and  bomb attacks were rarely carried out – even in  2017, only two attempted attacks using an im- provised explosive and incendiary device were  identified. Since the spring of 2017, however,  arson attacks have become more frequent; as  regards acts of sabotage, the element of sym- bolic protest has become less important – the  actions are intended not only to attract atten- tion, but also to achieve an impact, i.e. to pre- vent a deportation or to paralyse public trans- port, for example.

The FIS rarely has occasion  to record an incident, though there probably  are some unreported cases; in public, right- wing extremism is barely noticeable. This re- straint has been noted for years. The only act of  violence committed by right-wing extremists  was a knife attack in Ticino in December 2017,  carried out under the influence of alcohol on  an individual with different political views.  In 2017, the extreme right-wing scene held  three concerts of which the FIS is aware.  These concerts were monitored by the author- ities more closely than prior to the concert in  October 2016 in Unterwasser SG: one was  prevented altogether, in the case of the sec- ond, entry bans were imposed on two of the  three bands, and the FIS only found out about  the third – a ‘Liederabend’ (evening of song  performances) – after the event. Even though  no right-wing-extremist-motivated attacks on  institutions connected with the asylum system  were observed in 2017, these remain possible.  The motive for throwing a magnesium torch  at the transit centre in Enggistein near Worb  BE at the beginning of January 2018 and the  identity of the perpetrator/s were still unclear  at the time of going to press.  There is one exception to the general tone  of restraint: the Résistance Helvétique, which  is mainly active in French-speaking Switzer- land, continues to attract public attention from  time to time. On the other hand, there has been  no sign of the usual celebration by right-wing  extremist groups of anniversaries marking oc- casions in Swiss history. When right-wing ex-  tremism has been discussed in the media, this  has been a call to arms for left-wing extrem- ists, who have sometimes used physical vio- lence against people who, for example, were  involved in an event.  Arson attack on a  construction vehicle;   Zurich, June 2017    RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S58  than a quarter of all recorded events revolved  around ‘repression’, most of them specifically  targeting the Bässlergut; only occasionally did  actions not involve violence. The arson attacks  on construction company vehicles went be- yond the usual levels of damage done to prop- erty (see graphic). The series of attacks has  continued.  In addition to the arson attacks, vehicles  were damaged, and prior to the campaign a  list of companies involved in the construction  work was published on a relevant online plat- form. Admissions of responsibility by individ- uals suggest that anarchists were behind the at- tacks. The list of possible targets underlines the  campaign-like nature of the attacks and is rem- iniscent of last year's mobilisation against the   ‘machinery of deportation’. Finally, it should be  noted that campaigns against ‘repression’ are  also taking place in other European countries,  such as France, Belgium and Germany. These  also employ arson attacks and are thought by  the authorities to have been carried out by an- archists. It is possible not only that these cam-  Left-wing extremism Just a few years ago, the left-wing extremist   scene was very much turned in on itself and  was unable to find either an inspiring cause or  a platform for its actions. In 2014, it seemed  that the use and development of urban spaces  and the free spaces movement was becoming  a focal point of left-wing-motivated activities,  and in 2017 it was the campaign against the   ‘machinery of deportation’, but because of the  current easing of tensions over asylum and mi- gration, this campaign has largely run out of  steam, except in Basel-City. There, the use of  the Bässlergut prison as a ‘deportation prison’  provides a reference point for attacks on the  asylum system.  The main emphasis of the campaign against  the Bässlergut, however, is on ‘repression’,  which in turn is something that has been on the  scene's agenda for years. Besides the Bässler- gut, it has also focussed on the Police and Jus- tice Centre (PJZ) in Zurich, with companies  involved in the construction projects being  attacked as part of a targeted campaign.

Independently of the campaign, the issue of  ‘repression / police presence’ was the justifica- tion for left-wing extremists' use of violence.  Violence is directed primarily against securi- ty forces, but also against employees of the  emergency services in general. They are pre- pared to run the risk of injuring or killing peo- ple, and in some cases this is even their aim.  Whereas in the past demonstrations offered  the main opportunity for brutality against the  police, now police officers are also being at- tacked when they come across a group of left- wing extremists whilst on duty. For example,  on 22 December 2017, on-duty police were  attacked with stones and bottles by around  two dozen people on the forecourt of the Rid- ing School in Bern. Four days later in Zurich,  200 people attacked police officers with stones,  bottles and iron bars. By contrast, in a similar  situation on 23 December 2017 in Basel-City  around a hundred left-wing extremists were  persuaded to withdraw peacefully. On New  Year's Eve in Geneva, on the other hand, bot- tles and stones were thrown at the police, who  had been compelled to intervene to deal with a  temporary house occupation to hold an unau- thorised party.  Serious acts of violence have also been re- corded in relation to issues other than ‘repres- sion’. Mirroring the acts of sabotage on the  railway network in the Zurich area and the at- tack on the police radio tower at Waid in Zurich  in June and July 2016 respectively, there was  an attack on the antenna systems on the Gurten  and Ulmizberg mountains in Bern canton in   June 2017, which in all probability was left un- finished. There were four further arson attacks  in the canton of Zurich: attacks were carried  out on a post office ATM and a bank branch in  April 2017, while Turkish targets were attacked  in January and May of the same year.  Other than this, the situation that presents  itself is the usual one: the World Economic Fo- rum (WEF) and Labour Day are focal points  of left-wing extremist attention, as are events  abroad such as G20 summits. In January 2018,  left-wing extremists held protests against the  WEF on the usual scale, which has declined  since the anti-globalisation movement stopped  mobilising support. The US President's visit to  the WEF did nothing to change this, although  his presence meant that greater numbers of  peaceful demonstrators were recorded. Free  spaces and – depending on the particular per- son imprisoned – prisoner solidarity will con- tinue to be focal issues. Particularly in the free  spaces movement, for example in connection  with the clearance of squats, there is a will- ingness on the part of left-wing extremists to  use violence. The issue of asylum and migra- tion offers mobilisation potential that can be  tapped into at any time. In addition, it is cur- rently noticeable that left-wing extremists are  violently attacking their right-wing extremist  counterparts or associated individuals who at- tract their attention. Time and again, the police  are called on to prevent violent confrontations.  In addition, the left-wing extremist side tries to  expose and pillory its opponents – particularly  on the Internet.    RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S60  International links Both the right-wing and left-wing extremist   scenes in Switzerland have international links. In the right-wing extremist scene, there are   international links on two levels. Firstly, there  are the two international skinhead organisa- tions, Blood & Honour and Hammerskins,  which have been in existence since the 1980s.  They have their roots in the UK and the USA,  and offshoots have long been established in  Switzerland. Personal acquaintances form the  second level of international links in the right- wing extremist scene. The concert at Unterwas- ser in October 2016 showed the scale of the ca- pacity for concerted action within an individual  skinhead organisation. Swiss right-wing ex- tremists continue to attend concerts and events  abroad, sometimes not only as consumers: they  also give concerts as members of bands or ap- pear as speakers. The influx of German and  French right-wing extremists into Switzerland  in recent years has allowed members of these  groups and their Swiss counterparts to get to  know one another. However, it should be noted   that when foreign right-wing extremists have  taken up residence it has so far not been for  political reasons and has not led to changes in  behaviour in the Swiss scene.  For left-wing extremists, personal network- ing is more important than institutional struc- tures. One worth mentioning, however, is the  long-established Marxist-Leninist Secours  Rouge International. This also has links to the  anarchist/autonomous scene. Police arrests in  connection with violent crimes and court con- victions in Germany and France have shown  that Swiss left-wing extremists also engage in  violent actions outside the country's borders.  International networking was also evident dur- ing the violent protests against the G20 summit  in Hamburg in July 2017. There are indications  that actions were jointly planned in advance by  exponents from different countries and carried  out during the summit.   The internationalist self-image of left-wing  extremism and its search for platforms have  repeatedly led it to take up crises and devel- opments abroad as issues. For example, since  the battle against ‘Islamic State’ to liberate  Kobane, it has taken a stand in support of the  Kurds, and is promoting a positive counter-im- age to the so-called neo-liberal societies of the  West under the name ‘Rojava’. It continues to  support Turkish left-wing extremists and Kurd- ish groups, for example the PKK, at demon- strations. In this context, it should be noted that  left-wing extremists comply with the instruc- tions of the respective demonstration organis- ers. This currently means that, for example in  the context of a Kurdish demonstration, they  do not act violently.  Poster for an ‘information event’  relating to the G20 protests;  June 2017    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | SITUATION  61  Of course both scenes also exploit the net- working opportunities provided by the Internet,  including social media. Language barriers may  play a role here, but the left-wing extremist  scene, in particular, is actively trying to over- come them. The prohibition in Germany of  the website ‘linksunten.indymedia’, which is  used for calls to violence, was also discussed  in Switzerland, although the Swiss scene was  not reliant solely on the use of ‘linksunten. indy media’ for its own communications, but  also had and still has its own platforms on the  Internet. Right-wing extremists continue to  keep a low profile, including online: beyond  Switzerland's borders, they make intensive use  of social media for communication, internal  information and maintaining contacts, but they  have scarcely any public platforms.    RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S62  A S S E S S M E N T  Right-wing extremism In last year's assessment of right-wing ex-  tremism, it was still unclear how the scene  would react to the major event at Unterwass- er SG. It has since become clear that it does  not see the fact that the event was able to take  place in Switzerland as a sign that it will be  able to maintain a higher profile in this country.  The response of the public, up to and includ- ing violent actions by left-wing extremists, is  too unanimous. The Swiss authorities set clear  boundaries for extreme right-wing activities.  However, on 15 July 2017 an event with 6,000  visitors was held in Themar (Germany), which  was organised by the same group of German  nationals as the event in Unterwasser. The  organisers had also included speeches in the  programme and were thus able to contend in  court that this was a political assembly. The  next such event took place at the same location  just two weeks later. As there are currently no   rejection factors in Germany and no attraction  factors in Switzerland, there is only a slight  probability that a right-wing extremist event of  the same magnitude as the Unterwasser concert  will be repeated in Switzerland in the foresee- able future. On its own, the Swiss scene would  probably not be able to organise an event of  this magnitude even if it wanted to.  On the other hand, the fact that the scene  maintains a low profile and does not make  many appearances does not mean that it has  lost its potential for violence. In this respect,  two circumstances which have not changed  should be pointed out. Firstly, some right-wing  extremists are armed and carry weapons. Fire- arms are collected and traded, and there are col- lections of functioning weapons in the hands of  right-wing extremists. Secondly, they practise  the use of firearms and train in martial arts.  Left-wing extremism The anarchist/autonomous ideology is becom-  ing more important than its communist (primar- ily Marxist-Leninist) rival. This means on the  one hand that the targets of campaigns are be- coming more diverse and on the other hand that  sabotage is playing a more important role.  The attacks on communications equipment  mentioned above show that sabotage is becom- ing more important. The arson attacks on con- struction vehicles also fit into this category. The  campaign against the Bässlergut and the PJZ is  aimed at getting them to drop the construction  projects: they are trying to persuade companies   Flyer for a right-wing   extremist event in Germany   featuring a Swiss band;   May 2017    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | ASSESSMENT  63  to cease their involvement in the projects, with  the result that construction cannot go ahead.  However, arson attacks and damage to property  also delay the work on site and must therefore  be classified as acts of sabotage. Whereas the  FIS is notified of such major incidents, there  are many minor acts of sabotage which escape  its notice. At rallies, for example, damage to  property, including the insertion of coins cov- ered with glue into public transport ticket vend- ing machines, is frequently reported. Outside  the context of demonstrations, such actions go  largely unnoticed.  It is just as difficult to provide conclusive evi- dence of the proliferation of the targets attacked.  The range of left-wing extremist issues is broad;  any issue may be taken up as a cause. Despite its  ideologically heterogeneous nature, the scene is  united in its broad rejection of existing condi- tions. However, over the years it has lacked a  central theme around which it could mobilise: it  is now trying to give itself one through targeted  and realistic campaigns. By doing so, however,  it is itself once again limiting the range of pos- sible targets, and this also makes them easier to  predict. At the moment it is impossible to make a  definitive assessment of how many left-wing ex- tremists were actually behind the intensified use  of violence in the campaign against the Bässler- gut and the PJZ. Furthermore, it should be not- ed that left-wing extremists can also achieve a  great deal of success with smaller, limited ac- tions. In reaction to calls for such actions, events  are frequently cancelled because the organisers  have security concerns or because they are un- willing or unable to take the necessary measures.

The use of vi- olence is likely to remain rare and episodic in  nature, with alcohol likely to be the main disin- hibiting factor. Given the constant potential for  violence, however, this remains an uncertain  prognosis. What can be indicated more clearly  are developments or events that could change  the situation, at least temporarily: if numbers  of migrants and asylum seekers rise rapidly or  if a jihad-motivated attack takes place in Swit- zerland, violent reactions motivated by right- wing extremism might follow. These are likely  to be spontaneous actions without a great deal  of preparation, rather than complex, coordinat- ed actions. Acts of violence against migrants or  Muslims could also be perpetrated by persons  outside the right-wing extremist scene, since  xenophobia and racist or Islamophobic atti- tudes are not limited to right-wing extremists.  The potential for violence in the left-wing  extremist scene has increased and is currently  manifested in an increased willingness to use  greater violence and thus to run the risk of pos- sibly being penalised more severely. It is cur- rently impossible to gauge the role played here  by left-wing extremists from countries where  the potential for violence is higher. There are  three drivers of violence:   ▪ Rallies offer the opportunity to commit se- rious violence from under the protection of  the crowd. Victims of such violence, which   is targeted at people and where injury or  death is accepted as a possible outcome or  is sometimes even the aim, may include  members of the security forces or politically  unpopular individuals, but also random pas- sers-by. Even encounters between groups of  left-wing extremists and police officers on  unrelated duty can lead to violent attacks –  the basic potential for aggression toward the  security forces is high.   ▪ Violence is provoked when left-wing ex- tremists go beyond merely reacting to daily  political events and concentrate their ac- tions into targeted and realistic campaigns.  This has increasingly been the case since  2016. Perhaps they have also learned from  campaigns like Stop Huntingdon Animal  Cruelty, which would not be surprising, as  animal rights extremists who are prepared  to use violence have, after all, been an in- tegral part of the left-wing extremist scene  for years.   ▪ Anarchism is gaining in importance at the  expense of communism, and so therefore is  the desire to damage the ‘system’ as such.  Right-wing extremism Right-wing extremists lack a strategy and   thus the impetus to take action. Their passive  attitude is reinforced by public hostility and  the predictable personal consequences of being  recognised as a right-wing extremist. The most  that is therefore likely to happen in the near fu-    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM | OUTLOOK  65  Left-wing extremism Whilst construction work is still ongoing,   both the Bässlergut in Basel-City and the Po- lice and Justice Centre in Zurich will remain  a target for actions motivated by left-wing ex- tremism. Extension of the campaign to similar  construction projects in French-speaking Swit- zerland has already been broached in left-wing  extremist circles and is therefore likely to hap- pen. The intensity of any violence used will also  depend on whether and when the perpetrators  are arrested and subsequently convicted. So far,  the law enforcement agencies' successes have  calmed the situation, in part simply by taking  the potential perpetrators out of circulation, but  they have also had a general deterrent effect.  The more the extremists' actions are embedded  in a targeted and realistic campaign, the worse  the prospects of calming the situation.   ture is that there will be attempts to stage small- er events or take impromptu action; other than  that, the scene will be preoccupied with estab- lishing new structures. As usual, events will be  prepared in secret and, where possible, carried  out in such a way that they will not have any  personal consequences. Because of the ano- nymity they offer, social media will remain a  preferred channel for the communication and  dissemination of their views.   Right-wing populist discourse and successes  in Europe and elsewhere in the world will con- tinue to present both an opportunity and a risk  for right-wing extremists in Switzerland. On  the one hand, the scene might attract an influx  of new recruits or at least gain popularity with- out having to do much itself, but on the other  hand, adherents who are not fully committed to  the ideology might drift away and opportuni- ties for recruitment might diminish. Currently,  however, there is no sign of the scene drying  up. There is also a possibility that right-wing  extremists might once more try to gain a foot- hold in the political system and stand for elec- tion. However, a few years ago such intentions  were translated into reality only in isolated  cases and were ultimately unsuccessful. Such  an attempt would in turn be a boost to those  advocating refraining from violence.

In compliance with the FIS’s  statutory remit, it asked about right-wing extremist  and left-wing extremist actors who had used vio- lence or were prepared to do so. The result is a snap- shot of the potential for violence of the two scenes.  This survey is only of limited comparability with the  data published in ‘Switzerland's Security 2014’. De- spite this methodological limitation, it is safe to as- sume that the two scenes have decreased in size in  recent years. It is also evident that in the left-wing  extremist scene, there is a clearer distinction than  was previously the case between groups prepared to  use violence and moderate sympathisers. The FIS puts the number of right-wing extremists  in Switzerland who are prepared to use violence at   around 350. Approximately a quarter to a third of  these are not only prepared to use violence but have  actually engaged in violence. The biggest numbers of  right-wing extremists prepared to use violence were  identified in the cantons of Aargau, Bern, Geneva,  Zurich, Waadt, Wallis, Schwyz and St. Gallen. Right- wing extremism still tends to be a phenomenon more  associated with rural areas. The number of left-wing extremists in Switzerland  who are prepared to use violence is again an esti- mate; it is put at around 1,000. Approximately a third  of these can be seen as having actually engaged in  violence. The most notable centres are Zurich, Geneva,  Bern, Basel-City and Lucerne, as most left-wing ex- tremists are based in urban environments. However,  left-wing extremists may also be active in rural areas,  in particular in the anti-fascist movement.

Switzerland, as a major exporter of dual-use goods, has a particular responsibility here to  work to prevent proliferation. The implementation of the framework agreement with Iran  continued in 2017, but progress toward the normalisation of economic relations is still hes- itant. Developments in North Korea's weapons of mass destruction programmes have main- tained their momentum. The country's proliferation activities are moving beyond the regional  context and becoming a global threat. This has changed the rules of the game for dealing with  an illegitimate nuclear weapons programme outside the recognised nuclear-weapon states.  Chemical weapons were used in Syria again in 2017. Terrorist groups are showing a clear in- terest in obtaining expertise on weapons of mass destruction; terrorist groups have increased  their capabilities to use chemical weapons, in particular. The threat posed by proliferation is  also drawing closer to Switzerland.  Proliferation  Nuclear threat  North Korea Iran    PROLIFERATION | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S70  North Korea North Korea is pressing ahead with the ex-  pansion of its missile and nuclear weapons pro- gramme. In September 2017, the country test- ed its largest nuclear explosive device to date.  Comparison of the seismic data with previous  tests puts the yield of the explosion at around  300 kilotons. Following the failed attempt in  2016, it can be assumed that in this case a two- stage thermonuclear weapon was tested success- fully. The observed yield of the explosion proba- bly also represents approximately the maximum  possible for a test on the Punggye-ri site which  has so far been used.  In 2017, North Korea also tested new types of  missiles. In May, an intermediate-range missile  known as the Hwasong-12 was launched suc- cessfully for the first time. This type was re-tested  in August and in September. It was demonstrated  to have a range of over 3,500 kilometres. In July,  North Korea twice tested a Hwasong-14 missile,  which is the first North Korean weapons system  capable of reaching North America. The maiden  flight of a Hwasong-15, which potentially has a  global range, took place at the end of November.  All three missiles probably use different variants  of the same newly developed basic engine.  Iran The nuclear agreement with Iran remains in   force, despite contradictory signals from the  USA. Iran has complied with the provisions  of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  (JCPOA), and this has been confirmed sever-  al times by the International Atomic Energy  Agency in Vienna. The implementation of the  agreement, and in particular the normalisation  of economic relations between Iran and West- ern countries, which have been tense for dec- ades, is a process that will require years to be  accomplished in depth. In the absence of rapid  economic improvements, the Iranian regime  faces the challenge of explaining this reality to  its population.  In its missile programme, Iran is largely  demonstrating restraint as regards its test series.  The country has also declared a moratorium on  the development of missiles with a range of  more than 2,000 kilometres. In stark contrast  to this, however, Iran employed ballistic mis- siles against targets in Syria in summer 2017.  Compared to the well-known Scud family of  rockets, the systems used here are character- ised by greater accuracy and are much easier  to deploy. Furthermore, a report to the Security  Council by the UN Secretary-General suggests  that Iran is also involved in the use of ballistic  missiles from Yemen against targets in Saudi  Arabia. Technical analysis of the debris in the  target area following such deployment pro- vides valuable information about the origin of  individual components of the missile. These  could also have been produced in the West.  Syria Chemical weapons were again used in the   Syrian civil war in 2017. Despite formal chem- ical disarmament in Syria, chemical weapons   S I T U AT I O N    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  PROLIFERATION | SITUATION  71  and chemicals used for combat purposes are  still available. Disarmament cannot prevent  that the necessary know-how for the produc- tion of such substances, their handling and ac- tual use remains available in the region of con- flict. As a consequence, the capability to use  chemical weapons and substances for terror  attacks, including in Europe, will also remain.  Pakistan Pakistan is continuing the steady build up of   its arsenal of nuclear weapons and the associated  delivery systems. In 2017 it continued to test bal- listic missiles and cruise missiles which can be  equipped with nuclear warheads. Pakistan shows  a great deal of interest in goods from Switzerland  and is always prepared to violate the internation- ally agreed export control regulations, including  those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Pakistan  is massively expanding its production of weap- ons-grade fissile material, namely plutonium  and highly-enriched uranium, and continues to  be reliant on special equipment, for example in  the area of vacuum technology, to do so. As re- gards delivery systems, Pakistan is working on  systems with a greater range, of up to just under  3,000 kilometres. At the same time, the country  is developing delivery systems for the tactical  employment of nuclear weapons and is striving  to achieve a second-strike capability using sea- based systems.

Switzerland now falls within the range of  another state which can threaten it with nuclear  weapons from its own sovereign territory, and  moreover a state which regularly violates the  norms of international law. What matters here  is not just the capability to carry out a direct  kinetic attack. A state that has the capability  to employ nuclear weapons worldwide is also  able to threaten the global information society,  for example by detonating a nuclear explosive  device outside the Earth's atmosphere in order  to generate an electromagnetic pulse. If this  were done over the west coast of America, for   example, it would have a substantial effect on  global data networks and would have a direct  impact on everyday life in Switzerland.  ~ 6 0 0     k m  ~ 1600 km  ~3500  km ~7  80 0 k  m  ~9800 km  ~8700 km  USA  JAPAN  Guam (USA)  Hawaii (USA)  Los Angeles San Francisco  SOUTH KOREA  SWITZERLAND  NORTH KOREA    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  PROLIFERATION | OUTLOOK  73  O U T LO O K  Risks will become more specifically   identifiable  Preventing the supply of controlled goods  and technologies to proliferation-relevant  states and implementing the applicable em- bargo regulations are important challenges for  Switzerland. Switzerland has excellent indus- trial capabilities and offers an attractive and, by  international standards, open research location  that is benefiting from the trend toward isola- tion in other regions of the world. The Swiss  model combines a high degree of openness  compared to other research locations with light  government regulation. Switzerland thus has to  find a balance between freedom and security.  The FIS is therefore intensifying its efforts to  seek close links with partners in industry, ed- ucation and research with whom it can collab- orate to protect Switzerland from the risks of  proliferation activities by foreign states. This  mandate is explicitly enshrined in the new In- telligence Service Act.   Switzerland is also working closely with its  partners abroad. Cross-border procurement at- tempts by proliferating countries are regularly  identified and jointly prevented.  The employment of ballistic missiles and  cruise missiles in conflict regions will trigger  investigations in the states concerned and will  reveal information about the components used.  The traces of these flows of goods will in some  cases lead to producers in Western industrial- ised countries and will disclose the procure- ment channels used. Similar considerations   apply where chemical substances may have  been used as a means of terror. In this sense,  the risks of proliferation are becoming more  visible and are perceptible to a wider public.       S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S 75  Illegal intelligence serves the interests of states and in some cases also the private interests  of influential persons in these states. Conventional illegal intelligence is a set of long-estab- lished practices, which for years now have been supplemented by cyber espionage tools. It  can be assumed that there is a constant need to procure and update information, occasion- ally accentuated by circumstances in which more specific or more detailed information is  required. Information is needed in the political, economic and military spheres. Espionage  does not just violate the sovereignty of the states in which or against which it is conducted:  the data outflow causes direct or indirect damage, members of diaspora communities under  surveillance and their relatives in the country of origin may be threatened with serious harm  or death, and access acquired by means of espionage may possibly also be used for manipu- lation or even sabotage.  Illegal intelligence  Illegal intellig ence  Cyber Intelligence  Industrial espionage  Espionage against foreign citizens in Switzerland  Political espionage against Switzerland    ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | SITUATION  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S76  Who is spying? A number of factors lead to illegal intelli-  gence activities in Switzerland. Switzerland is  either the target or merely the setting in which  they take place. Switzerland is a target due to  the high technological standard of Swiss indus- try and the quality of its research, as well as its  status as a financial centre and a marketplace  for energy and commodities trading. Another  reason is the presence of parts of the UN and  other international bodies based in Switzerland.  There are also various diaspora communities in  Switzerland, which remain a target of activities  by their home countries' intelligence services.  This description alone implies that espio- nage is a ubiquitous phenomenon. For example,  there are around a dozen states that conduct il- legal intelligence against their own nationals in  Switzerland. How far such activities can go is  illustrated by the example of the alleged kid- napping of a Vietnamese citizen in Berlin: he is  said to have been abducted to his home country  in an intelligence operation in order to bring  him to trial there.   All states pursue political, military and eco- nomic goals. In order to do so, they deploy in- telligence services, which sometimes operate  using illegal methods, i.e. methods prohibited  in the target country. Swiss interests abroad  may also become the target of such measures.  There are therefore good reasons why it is not  possible to come up with a complete list of  the state actors which might at least begin to  develop espionage activities in Switzerland or   against Swiss interests abroad. However, from  the point of view of counterespionage there are  around half a dozen states meriting particular  attention.  One of these states relies heavily on intel- ligence officers who are in Switzerland under  diplomatic cover. According to well-founded  suspicions or confirmed intelligence, about a  quarter to a third of the persons in the diplo- matic service of this state are intelligence ser- vice employees. They can be found in all dip- lomatic ranks, with the exception of the most  senior. In addition (and this is also true of other  states), intelligence officers are travelling to  Switzerland for operational activities. Switzer- land may be the target country of the operation  concerned, or merely be the springboard for ac- tivities in another European country.  Who is being spied on? Illegal intelligence is carried out using a tried   and trusted package of tools and procedures.  Cyber espionage supplements this set; it is sup- porting conventional illegal intelligence and  vice versa. Information is gradually collected  about a person, for example, in order to be able  to use that person as a source. The person may  be aware of this and may even be remunerated  for it, but this will not necessarily be the case.  The German Federal Office for the Protec- tion of the Constitution announced in Decem- ber 2017 that more than 10,000 recruitment  attempts by Chinese intelligence services had  been identified in a nine-month period. And   S I T U AT I O N    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | SITUATION  77  it had not even looked at all the channels, but  only one: social networks such as Linkedin.  Researchers, civil servants and politicians  were contacted via fake profiles and were  asked for reports in return for money - some- times amounting to thousands of euros. After- wards, if the Chinese side was still interested,  invitations to China followed, for example to  a conference. Here too, the costs were paid by  the inviting party. The figure published by the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Consti- tution shows that this is a mass phenomenon;  however, the hard work put in has not led to  any further consequences. For one thing, the  state actors simply deny the truth of the state- ments, and for another, one cannot arrest or  convict a fake LinkedIn profile or expel it from  the country. The figures also show the extent of  the resources the opposite side is prepared to  deploy - countermeasures such as the identifi- cation of individual profiles as fake would only  shift the phenomenon elsewhere and would  have no effect. The most effective methods  here are education and sensitisation.  Cyber espionage An advanced persistent threat (APT) is the   term used to describe a cyber operation using  sophisticated technical tools which are able  to survive inside the victim's IT network and  inflict serious damage on it. An APT requires  substantial resources, which can normally be  raised only by states and not by criminals. As a  rule, an APT thus points to a state cyber opera- tion. The state may be directly involved in the  attack, or be the invisible hand commissioning  and financing a private company. It is only in  the last few years that APTs have become a  subject of public debate. For five or six years  now, a number of security companies have  been producing analyses describing the tech- nical details of such operations. Analysis of the  operations shows that states have been using  considerable resources to develop and carry  out cyber attacks for at least twenty years.  Russian hacker groups State, semi-state and private actors are in-  creasingly using cyber tools in order to advance  their economic, political and military interests.

Reports of large- scale cyber attacks which Russia is thought to  have been behind are becoming more frequent.  For some time, the targets have included Swiss  interests; the FIS has identified and prevented  several such attacks in recent years. Interna- tional security companies, media organisations  and authorities indicate that Russian intelli- gence services are commissioning these hacker  groups directly. Russian public officials and po- litical decision-makers, however, have repeat- edly denied these allegations. These activities  are generally carried out for information-gath- ering purposes. However, disinformation and  sabotage campaigns have also been observed.  Data which has been stolen has been published  on the Internet or disclosed to the media by the  perpetrators. All the hacker groups associated  with Russia have the following in common:  they use highly complex malware, target their  actions and pursue the political and economic  interests of the Russian government.  Chinese hacker groups The FIS has detected increased activity   against Swiss interests by Chinese hacker  groups. Chinese hacker groups with alleged  links to Chinese security authorities have been  acting in an increasingly targeted way for  some years now. They focus particularly on ex- port-oriented Swiss companies and on interna- tional organisations based in Switzerland.  North Korean hacker groups Hacker groups with links to North Korean   security authorities have attracted a lot of at- tention in the last two to three years. Hacker   groups from North Korea do not exclusively  engage in conventional cyber espionage with  the aim of procuring information, but also use  cyber tools to try to generate foreign currency  for the North Korean state. The FIS has also  identified activities by North Korean hacker  groups in Switzerland.    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | ASSESSMENT  79  A S S E S S M E N T  Illegal intelligence Illegal intelligence serves the interests of the   states that conduct it, and in some cases also the  private interests of influential persons in these  states. The decision-makers and authorities of  these states have a constant need for informa- tion and to keep any information they have up- dated. Events may additionally give rise to a  specific, and possibly only temporary, need for  information. Information of political, econom- ic or military importance is sought. This may  benefit a state directly or benefit its economy  (as a whole or individual companies), or else  merely help it to maintain its position in the  international arena. It may, however, also serve  the purpose of preserving a political leadership,  with the espionage activities possibly being di- rected against the state's own nationals abroad.  Some states have a lasting interest in illegal  intelligence activities in and against Switzer- land. They carry out frequent, high-quality at- tacks on Swiss interests. Besides their political  interests, in other cases they either pursue pri- marily economic goals or target the diaspora  communities. As these states are aiming to  increase their power projection, it can be as- sumed that intelligence activities will continue  to increase.  Cyber espionage Cyber attacks are efficient and may therefore   become even more important in future. As the  level of protection for critical infrastructures,  companies and private individuals has general-  ly risen over the past few years, it is predicted  that states will make substantial investments,  for example in their intelligence services, in or- der to develop and implement new technologies  which can overcome the increased protection.  Damage as an aim of intelligence service  activity  Political, economic and military intelligence  can have consequences which no longer have  anything to do with illegal intelligence in the  narrower sense. The information obtained may  in some cases bring direct benefits – for exam- ple where a company can copy production pro- cesses instead of having to go to the expense  of developing them itself or where its bid wins  out over its competitors because it knew what  their offers were. It may, however, also be of  indirect benefit by inflicting damage on oppo- nents. For example, attempts to intimidate, po- liticise or even polarise diaspora communities  and to incite people against one another can  disturb the peace in the host country. From the  Swiss point of view, these run counter to the  functions of the state, which is responsible for  securing the fundamental rights and freedom  of its inhabitants and for guaranteeing security  and order. In addition, intelligence activities  are used for influence operations (particularly  by Russia) and provide states with a range of  opportunities, up to and including sabotage.  The intelligence services play a role in Rus- sia's influence operations aimed at achieving  power political goals. They have the necessary     ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | ASSESSMENT  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S80  resources and capabilities to act either with- in the framework of a larger campaign or in  a mostly autonomous way. In the tradition of  the Soviet Union, influence operations con- ducted by intelligence services are referred to  as ‘active measures’. The main focus is on the  recruitment by the intelligence services of so- called influence agents. These are handled in  the same way as sources, but are primarily used  for the dissemination rather than the procure- ment of information. This information does not  necessarily have to be false. By skilfully blend- ing facts, false information and opinions, the  desired narratives can be disseminated in a way  that is tailored to requirements. The portfolio  of active measures also includes the leaking of  information procured using intelligence tools.  This can be used, for example, to discredit un- desirable persons or organisations. Allegedly  leaked information may also be made up or fal- sified. For the work of influence agents to be  effective, it usually requires coordination with  other agencies, such as teams that design nar- ratives, plan actions or distribute information  themselves over the Internet. The target groups  of the active measures often do not realise that  they are the focus of an influence operation.  Sabotage operations may, for ecample, use  targeted attacks on industrial control systems.  These are still rare. So far, only five malware  complexes that have been specifically aimed at  industrial control systems are known. Probably  the most famous in this context is Stuxnet, a  malware that was discovered in 2010. It was  used to destroy centrifuges in uranium enrich- ment plants in Iran. Mention should also be  made of the attacks on the power supply in   Ukraine in December 2016, using the Crash- override malware. This was the first incident  where a malware program designed to attack  a power network was actually used. However,  such attacks have so far been used very con- servatively. This is probably due to the fact  that this type of operation always causes incal- culable damage, which also makes the conse- quences for the attacker unpredictable. For this  reason, this type of tool is used for targeted at- tacks on specific system configurations, which  makes the attack correspondingly elaborate.  The most recent example is the Triton/Trisis  malware, which was aimed at the security con- trol system of a target in the Middle East.   Increasingly, industrial control systems and  their operators are being spied on, possibly in  order to gain an overview of ways in which  they could be manipulated and to be prepared  for all future eventualities. The prime example  here is the attacks involving the Dragonfly 2.0  complex. At the end of June 2014, an espio- nage and sabotage preparation campaign called  Dragonfly came to light, which was targeted at  Western industrial installations and energy sup- pliers. The follow-up campaign, Dragonfly 2.0,  was uncovered in 2017. This version also in- volves sending e-mails with malware attached  to selected employees in the target company. In  addition, the repertoire of this espionage com- plex once again includes targeted infections via  websites and trojans. The campaign is primari- ly aimed at targets in the US and Europe.    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | ASSESSMENT  81  MELANI’s semi annual report   is available on the internet  (www.melani.admin.ch)    ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S82  O U T LO O K  The situation is likely to deteriorate Intelligence activities will continue to be car-  ried out in Switzerland and against Swiss in- terests. As already mentioned, the expansion of  individual states' endeavours to project power  will intensify these activities still further. As- suming that Switzerland maintains its current  position, economic, political and military inter- ests will continue to be the target of intelligence  activities. In the case of some states, only their  democratisation or fundamental pacification  will cause them to refrain from exerting pres- sure on their own nationals abroad.  However, the description and assessment  of the situation also show that, in addition to  counterintelligence measures, prevention – and  thus the behaviour of individuals and groups –  is particularly important.   Switzerland will continue to be a prime target  of cyber attacks by states or by state-sponsored  perpetrators. Swiss interests may be directly  affected, e.g. through attacks on the federal  administration, on Swiss companies or on in- ternational organisations based in Switzerland.  However, IT infrastructures in Switzerland  may also be deliberately misused in order to  attack targets abroad.  Defensive measures Illegal intelligence is conducted mainly on   behalf of governments, but criminal law as- signs responsibility to individual persons. If  circumstances apply which are of relevance un- der criminal law, then these will be examined   using instruments of criminal law. The crimi- nal offences in question require public prose- cution, i.e. no criminal complaint by a victim  is necessary, as illegal intelligence infringes  upon government interests. However, these  are defined as political offences, the criminal  investigation and prosecution of which require  authorisation by the Federal Council. If the per- petrator is a diplomat accredited in Switzerland,  the sending country would also have to lift the  diplomat's immunity. If there are not sufficient  grounds for suspicion to open criminal prose- cution proceedings, or if the Federal Council  does not grant authorisation for criminal pros- ecution, other measures are available. For ex- ample, the withdrawal of the person engaged  in intelligence work can be achieved through  informal channels. Further options are expul- sion or persona non grata declaration or, in a  case where the person is not yet in the country,  an entry ban or refusal of the necessary visa or  accreditation. These options are supplemented  by Federal Council measures – these, too, may  consist in expelling a person or prohibiting a  person from entering Switzerland.  Prevention Despite the range of counterintelligence   measures, prevention remains one of the most  important tools for countering espionage. Be- sides the work of the authorities entrusted  with prevention, it consists mainly in aware- ness-raising and training, firstly regarding the  handling of sensitive information and secondly     S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK  83  with reference to the practices of intelligence  services. This awareness-raising about the  practices of foreign intelligence services may,  if nothing else, lead to suspicious behaviour  being detected quickly or early enough, i.e.  before the designated information source be- comes deeply ensnared or at least before they  have rendered themselves criminally liable.  Over the past few years, the FIS has taken a  large number of measures to raise awareness,  principally as part of the Prophylax preven- tion and awareness-raising programme, and to  assist companies, universities and research. It  will continue with these activities and will de- velop them further. In addition, it will draw the  attention of the Swiss population as a whole to  the problem, help everyone to identify illegal  intelligence activities at an early stage, where  possible, and demonstrate measures to protect  against them. The short film ‘Targeted’, which  was produced two years ago, is thus still topi- cal. Like other FIS material, it is publicly avail- able on the Internet.     ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S84  The Internet of Things  sions based on sensor data. Accordingly, an enormous  number of data records will be created, all of which  will have to be protected. Staying with the refriger- ator, the data collected not only gives an interesting  insight into the household's milk consumption, but  also shows the overall usage of the refrigerator. Such  data can be used for marketing purposes, for example.  In extreme cases, it could also be used to determine  whether a household's eating habits are deemed to be  healthy or unhealthy, which could be used, for exam- ple, by health insurance companies as an indicator for  calculating premiums.  The Internet of Things differs substantially from con- ventional information and communication technol- ogy (ICT): in contrast to computers, Internet-capable  household devices are often secured against unau- thorised access only to a limited extent, which is why  they can be infected with malware by attackers. Firstly,  these devices can in many cases be accessed using the  default passwords, as these are often not changed af- ter installation or cannot even be changed at all. Sec- ondly, updating the software used is a fundamental  problem: the update process is seldom regulated and  rarely automated. This gives rise to numerous chal- lenges that will intensify over the next few years: in  contrast to conventional ICT devices, which are in ser- vice on average for only a few years, Internet devices  may be in use for up to ten years or more.  Attackers exploit this by using the Internet of Things  for attacks on availability, so-called DDoS attacks.  A noteworthy example here is the Mirai botnet, which   In the future, anything that can be connected will also  be linked to the Internet. This somewhat exaggerated  statement gives an idea of how the Internet will de- velop over the next few years, which, besides all the  convenience it will bring, will undoubtedly generate  much debate about security. More and more every- day objects will in future be connected to the Inter- net. This is why the first manufacturers are already  talking about the Internet of Everything, which will  integrate people, processes, devices and data into an  all-encompassing network. The oft-quoted refrigera- tor which orders the milk itself is a good example of  this. In order to be able to perform this task, however,  it requires access to personal data – it would be a nui- sance if it did not know that the owners had planned a  several-week-long holiday. However, the refrigerator  is just one of many examples. There has been a boom  in recent years, especially in the area of building man- agement and lighting control. The Internet of Things  will in future be much more than it is today. Accord- ing to Gartner analysts, in 2016 more than six billion   ‘things’ were already connected to the net. This num- ber is expected to increase to over 20 billion by 2020.  And the opportunities are far from exhausted. These  will increasingly become part of our everyday life and  will also influence it.   As the opportunities of the Internet (of Things) grow,  we will also be concerned about the risks. Fundamen- tal questions will arise, covering not only maintenance  and security standards, but also, in particular, data  protection issues. The main purpose of the Internet  of Things is to make automatically optimised deci-    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE | OUTLOOK  85  infects devices on the Internet of Things and  came to light following the attack on the Internet  service provider Dyn. Mirai is malware targeting  Linux, which is the main operating system used in  devices connected to the Internet of Things.      S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S 87  Intelligence-gathering measures requiring  authorisation  To perform its tasks, the FIS is reliant on  effective tools for gathering information. The  Intelligence Service Act (ISA), which came  into force on 1 September 2017, allows the  FIS to use new 'intelligence-gathering meas- ures requiring authorisation'. In early 2014, the  Federal Council stated in its memorandum on  the ISA that, based on the threat situation at  that time, such intelligence-gathering measures  would apply in around ten cases a year. Howev- er, each case may involve multiple such meas- ures being taken: thus, for example, one person  may have multiple telecommunication connec- tions monitored, their vehicle tracked and their  hotel room searched. The cases concerned are  ones which present a particularly serious threat  in the areas of terrorism, illegal intelligence,  proliferation, attacks on critical infrastructure  or the protection of other important national in- terests as defined under Article 3 ISA.  Domestic intelligence-gathering measures  requiring authorisation are (Article 26 ISA):   ▪ surveillance of postal and telecommunica- tions traffic in accordance with the Swiss  Federal Act on the Surveillance of Postal  and Telecommunications Traffic;   ▪ the use of tracking equipment to determine  the location and movements of persons or  objects;   ▪ the use of surveillance equipment to in- tercept or record private conversations or  to observe or record incidents in locations  which are not public or not generally acces- sible;   ▪ the penetration of computer systems and  computer networks in order to gather infor- mation that is present in or transmitted from  these or to disrupt, prevent or slow down ac- cess to information in cases where the com- puter systems and computer networks are  used for attacks on critical infrastructure;   ▪ the searching of premises, vehicles or con- tainers in order to obtain items or informa- tion that are present in them or information  transmitted from them.  Intelligence-gathering measures requiring  authorisation must in each case be authorised  by the Federal Administrative Court and ap- proved by the head of the DDPS following  consultation with the head of the FDFA and  the head of the FDJP. They are subject to close  monitoring by the Independent Supervisory  Authority which oversees intelligence activ- ities and by the Control Delegation. The FIS  implements the measures in 'operations', which  correspond to the cases referred to above. For  source protection reasons, neither the types of  measures used nor the number of persons af-    INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING MEASURES REQUIRING AUTHORISATION   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S88  fected by an operation can be made public. However, the FIS can publish the number of   operations/cases in which intelligence-gath- ering measures requiring authorisation have  been used – broken down by individual area of  activity – as well as the number of individual  measures requiring authorisation which have  been approved for each operation.   Domestic operations involving measures  requiring authorisation (1 September to 31 December 2017)  Area of activity   (Art. 6 ISA) Operations Measures  Terrorism 2 13  Illegal intelligence 2 27  NBC proliferation 0 0  Attacks on critical  infrastructure 0 0  Total 4 40  Operations: operations as part of which intelligence-gath- ering measures requiring authorisation were carried out.  Measures: approved between 1 September 2017 and  31 December 2017. Extensions of previously authorised  intelligence-gathering measures are not counted sepa- rately.   Thus in 2017, measures requiring authori- sation were used in a total of four operations/ cases.  Cable reconnaissance The Intelligence Service Act has also given   the FIS the powers to conduct cable reconnais- sance (Article 39 ff. ISA) in order to gather in- formation about incidents abroad that are of rel- evance to security. As cable reconnaissance is   for the purpose of gathering information about  other countries, it is not in principle designed  to be used as a domestic intelligence-gathering  measure requiring authorisation. However, ca- ble reconnaissance can be carried out only with  the participation of Swiss telecommunication  service providers, which must be presented  with a legally valid order to forward the rele- vant data flows to the Swiss Army's Centre for  Electronic Operations. The ISA therefore pro- vides for a similiar authorisation and approval  procedure in Article 40 f.   No cable reconnaissance applications were  made by the FIS in the first four months fol- lowing the entry into force of the ISA. The  technical capabilities for cable reconnaissance  were still being developed at the end of 2017.    S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 8  |  F I S  INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING MEASURES REQUIRING AUTHORISATION   89  Operation  FIS operations are defined in Article 12 of the Fed- eral Intelligence Service Ordinance (FISO): ‘The FIS  can, for limited periods, conduct as operations in- terconnected procedures which are for the purposes  of information gathering as defined under Article 6  ISA and which exceed normal intelligence-gather- ing activities in terms of importance, scope, cost or  secrecy. These must be formally opened and closed  and separately documented.’ Measures requiring au- thorisation are always applied for by the FIS within  the framework of operations and are implemented if  authorisation and approval are granted. Colloquially,  an operation corresponds to the terms 'case' or 'case  cluster' used prior to the vote on the ISA.  Intelligence-gathering measure requiring   authorisation  For the purposes of these statistics, a measure requir- ing authorisation is a measure as defined under Ar- ticle 26 ISA against a person. In telecommunications  surveillance, each addressing resource monitored  counts as one measure (if, for example two mobile  phone numbers of the same person are monitored,  this counts as two measures); the same applies if, for  example, a tracking device is used and telecommuni- cations surveillance is carried out on one person (also  two measures).  Cable reconnaissance order  Cable reconnaissance orders are intelligence require- ments for gathering information about significant  security-related incidents abroad in relation to a par- ticular reconnaissance area as defined in Article 39  ff. ISA and Article 25 FISO. Only cross-border signals  from cable networks may be recorded.

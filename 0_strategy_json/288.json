Box 50065 Fairley Road Lusaka April, 2006 Supported by United Nations Development Programme National Information & Communication Technology Policy DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages Administrator Note ii FOREWORD The world has embraced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabler of social and economic development. The industry is growing very fast and making significant contribution to global trade and investment. ICT is receiving focus at various fora as demonstrated by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). Both initiatives have resulted in the promotion of information and knowledge based society as the basis for creating wealth. An opportunity has arisen for Zambia to join the global village by connecting commerce and trade. This policy sets the framework for Zambia s participation in the global economy. At the national level, the importance of ICT in national development is demonstrated by the approval of the ICT Policy and the inclusion of ICT as a priority sector in the Fifth National Development Plan 2006-2010. This Policy is designed on thirteen pillars namely as follows:- * Human Resource Development; * Agriculture; * Tourism, Environment & Natural Resources; * Education; * Health * E-Commerce * E-Government * Youth and Women * Legal & Regulatory Framework * Security in Information Society * Access, Media, Content and Culture * ICT Services A challenge has now arisen for the country to implement this policy and I therefore call upon all stakeholders to rise to this challenge. This Policy shall be Government-led and it is the intention of Government to involve the private sector in its implementation through the Public-Private Partnerships. This partnership is especially important for mobilizing resources for infrastructure development. At the operational level, it is expected that all ministries, institutions and DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages iii organizations shall take the National ICT Policy as a guiding document to assist in developing sector-specific ICT policies and plans that will allow the application of ICTs in their respective programmes and projects. To demonstrate Government commitment in providing leadership, Cabinet approved the creation of the Department of Communications in the Ministry of Communications and Transport which will coordinate and oversee the implementation of this policy. Now that the first milestone of developing the national ICT policy has been achieved, I wish to implore co-operating partners to consider ICT as a priority. Hon. Abel M. Chambeshi, MP. Minister MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT National Information & Communication Technology Policy DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENT My Ministry spearheaded the process of formulating the ICT Policy. To facilitate the process, a National Technical Committee comprising experts with varied experience in research and policy analysis, telecommunications, information technology, media as well as legal and regulatory issues was appointed. The team was assisted by an international Consultant who was hired on short term basis. The policy development process started with the holding of a National ICT Policy Symposium on 25th August 2003 at Intercontinental hotel in Lusaka. The symposium attracted speakers from Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana to share experiences on ICT Policy development. The National Symposium was preceded by syndicate consultations with stakeholders which resulted in the production of the first draft ICT Policy document. The draft was launched on 23rd December 2003 and following the launch the document was subjected to further stakeholder meetings through provincial workshops. This process ended in August 2004. Thereafter a second draft document was produced and subjected to public scrutiny through internet and print media. After this process a second national stakeholders workshop a third and final draft document was developed reflecting the final views of stakeholders. The final draft National ICT Policy document was submitted to the Ministry of Communications and Transport and subsequently to Cabinet Office for approval. I wish to pay special tribute to institutions that accepted to provide experts to the national technical team, namely: Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services; Ministry of Science, Technology & Vocational Training; Communications Authority Copperbelt University; University of Zambia; ZAMPOST; ZAMTEL; Bankers Association of Zambia; Computer Association of Zambia; CELTEL; and COMDEV(X) Ltd for website development hoisting and other specialised services offered to the Secretariat. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of my predecessors for initiating the policy development process and co-operating partners in particular the Japanese Government for the pivotal role they played in financing the policy development process. Last but not least I would like to thank the UNDP or the financial and technical assistance for policy development through operational and project management support to the TICAD Secretariat in the Ministry of Communications and Transport. Tribute should also go to the World Bank and USAID who supported specific studies and capacity building to the Ministry respectively. Finally, I want to thank all the staff in the Ministry who contributed in one way or the other to the successful development of this policy.

One such factor in inequitable access to resources among the citizenry and lack of technology to exploit the vast natural resources available in most countries. One fundamental difference between the developed and the developing countries is that the former are also rich in information and has a well informed citizenry which is able to adapt quickly to changing social and economic environments, hence utilizing opportunities to overcome development challenges such as poverty. In this regard, information is treated as a commodity which has potential to make significant changes in many aspects of our social and economic development. ICTs can be used to bridge the digital divide within the context of globalization. The digital divide presents barriers by denying an opportunity for the people to take best practices and make them applicable in the possible ways. Zambia has the opportunity to make a difference by adopting and using ICT as a tool available to reduce the development divide thereby increasing the chances of improving the quality of life of the citizens. ICT is an enabler to build an information centered society where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge leading to greater productivity, greater competitiveness and sustainable economic growth, a precondition for poverty reduction. ICTs can also be used as an effective tool in enhancing good governance. 1.1 GLOBAL AND REGIONAL TRENDS AND COMMITMENTS The developments in telecommunications and information technologies have improved and increased the connectivity between and within countries thereby removing barrier of time and spatial separation. This in turn has resulted in increased integration of markets, improved commerce and geo-political relations. At global and regional level, a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the development and use of ICTs have been developed. The major drivers include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, the Universal Postal Union, the African Union and its specialized agencies such as the African Telecommunications Union, and the Pan African Postal Union, regional economic groupings such as the New Partnership for Africa s Development, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Southern Africa Development Community. Zambia has participated in a number of global and regional events that are focusing on ICTs as a tool for sustainable growth and development. Among the notable ones being the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action from the World Summit on the Information Society and the NEPAD E-Africa Commission. Further the country is committed to the Millelium Development Goals and it is envisaged that ICTs can be harnessed to the achievement of these goals namely:- i) The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; Ii) Achievement of universal primary education; Iii) Promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 1 Iv) Reduction of child mortality; v) Improvement of maternal health; vi) To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; vii) Ensuring environmental sustainability; and viii) Development of global partnership for the attainment of a more peaceful, just and Prosperous world. At the sub-regional level Zambia has been an active player in ICT initiatives under COMESA and SADC. This policy therefore is influenced by the policy frameworks and principles recommended by the two bodies among them the following:- I) Increasing market size through inte4gration and cross border trade with ICTs playing an integral part of the social and economic development of member states; Ii) Competition among market players in the ICT sector in member states; Iii) Conveying of regulatory authorities in telecommunications and broadcasting; Iv) Implementing independent and technology -neutral legal and regulatory frameworks; v) Independence of market players especially the regulatory functions; vi) Private sector participation in the development of ICT products and services. 1.2 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF ICTs IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT The Zambian economy has experienced decline since the 1980s due to several factors among them the low productivity in the mining, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The net effect has been increased poverty levels now estimated at over 70 percent of the population living with less than US$1 per day. To address the economic quagmire Government liberalized the economy in 1991. This new economic path can be, in part made possible by advances in information and communications technology, which can reduce the cost of and increase the speed of communicating in the country hence abolishing barriers of time and space. ICT has also made possible the integration of national systems of production and finance. Further ICTs are driving significant changes in both micro and national levels by; increasing effectiveness and reach of development interventions, by enhancing good governance and lowering the cost of the delivery of basic social services. In the sphere of education for example, ICTs have the potential to improve quality of education and training through e-learning and online learning. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 2 CHAPTER 2 SITUATION ANALYSIS The ICT sector in Zambia is categorized into four main sub-sectors, namely; Telecommunications, information technology, electronic media and postal communication system. In view of the above the sector needs to be addressed from a holistic point. The Chapter discusses the current status of ICTs in Zambia and the challenges to be addressed by the policy. 2.1 HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT A number of institutions are involved in Education and Training of human resources in ICT programmes ranging from Certificate to Degree courses offering specialised subjects including Computer Science, Telecommunicaztions/Electronics Engineering, Media training/information sciences, Vocational ICT programmes and skills development. Among the Institutions involved in human resource development in ICTs are the University of Zambia, Copperbelt University, ZAMCOM, ZAMTEL Staff Training College and Evelyn Hone College. A number of other public and private sector institutions offer various ICT related courses. Other programmes include Industry Certified (Microsoft, CISCO etc) course and others based on foreign syllabi such as Institute for Management of Information Systems (IMIS) and City & Guilds of the UK. However, the compatibility of such programmes with the Zambian education curriculum and industry is very limited. Therefore, an assessment of the requirements and local institutional capabilities shall form the basis for a comprehensive human resource development programme in the country. Despite the above scenario, Zambia is currently facing a shortfall in critical ICT skills required for developing its information and knowledge economy at managerial, professional and technician levels in order to facilitate the development, deployment and application of ICTs in both the private and the public sector. Some of the challenges to be addressed include:- (a) Law ICT literacy in the country, which is a major obstacle to the development of Zambia s information society; (b) High cost of technology acquisition, thus making ICT technology and skill development programmes inaccessible to most Zambians; (c) The Brain Drain problem, which is resulting in considerable loss of the few skilled personnel from Zambia to other countries in search of better job opportunities; (d) Limited local ICT industry thus offering inadequate services and few job opportunities; (e) Lack of standardisation and certification programmes in the IT field resulting in external courses with little localisation to the Zambian education curriculum; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 3 (f) Inadequate institutional capacity among formal training providers to increase intake and output numbers of ICT graduates. CHAP SITUATION ANALYSIS 2.2 EDUCATION, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT The Zambian education system especiallyinpublic schools is characterised by low ICT adoption rates. There are over 6,000 public schools out of which very few have ICT subjects as part of the curriculum. In 1998, the Ministry of Education started an initiative to introduce camputer studies in selected secondary schools. The results have not been as expected; however, the initiative needs to be encouraged and scales up to all schools. On the other hand, private schools are promoting ICT literacy though only a small percentage of the pupils are ICT literate by the time they leave secondary school. A number of research institutions have acquired human capacity to work with ICT tools such as computers. However, the level of use of ICTs and the outcome of such activities needs to improve. Holistic approaches to R&D with the support of ICTs need to be put in place. Again, R&D focused on developing products and services for the local ICT market need to be encouraged. It is acknowledged that Zambia faces a number of challenges in the educational system. Some of these include:- (a) General financial and technological resource constraints that the Government faces in its Effort to develop and improve the educational system including fforts Directed at integrating ICTs in education; (b) Inadequate awareness on the benefits of integrating ICTs in the administration of the delivery chain in the education sector; (c) Lack of coordinated approach in the adoption and implementation of initiatives targeted at the deployment of ICTs within the educational system; (d) High opportunity cost of deploying ICTs in the educational system - it is difficult to justify spending scarce and limited resources on ICTs when many institutions are still lacking basic amenities and educational supplies; and (e) Shortage of teachers with ICT skills to meet the requirements of the schools, thus limiting ICT penetration within the education system. 2.3 PUBLIC ACCESS, MEDIA & CULTURAL HERITAGE For the majority of Zambians, access to information is mainly by way of physical means such as libraries, postal communications and print media. However, radio and TV are some of the most popular means of access to information; though tv despite being the most attractive media has very limited coverage across the country. Equally important, access to information via networked systems such as the Internet and mobile phones is very limited mainly due to non-availability of telecommunications infrastructure and high access costs for many consumers. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 4 Postal and Courier Services Postal and Courier Services are mainly provided by ZAMPOST. The Corporation covers the country through a network of about 116 Post Offices, 64 Sub-Post Offices and 55 Postal Agencies. A large percentage of the 72 districts have an operational post office. In addition, there are private courier services, which are concentrated along the Livingstone-Copperbelt corridor for delivery of parcels. However, some private courier operators now service provincial centres as well. Telecentres There are cafés and business bureaus offering telephone, Email/Internet access in major urban centres and a few in rural towns. Currently, there are about 300 licensed telecenters across the country by 2004 against 108 in the year 2000. However, a larger percentage is along the line of rail. This is mainly due to the relatively good telecommunication infrastructure, low capital and operation costs coupled with the high number of potential customers. Library Services The Ministry of Education operates the largest number of public libraries through the Zambia Library Service. Currently, there are 6 major public libraries across the country covering at least six of the nine provincial centres. The Copperbelt University, Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation and UNZA have adequate libraries facilities in comparison to other libraries across the country. Various other private libraries also exist in schools and colleges offering opportunities for access to information. Local authorities mainly run community libraries as part of the public service though most of them need urgent attention. In general, public libraries are in a dilapidated state, normally equipped with outdated reading materials and are urban centred in most cases. Most of the materials are imported with little local content and knowledge resources. The process of equipping public libraries managed by the Zambia Library Service with ICT tools including Internet connectivity has started. However, the installed capacity needs to be increased in terms of hardware and Internet bandwidth. The main library at UNZA has reached advanced levels in integrating ICTs as part of the services to the university community and the general public. On the other hand, the national Archives is one source of political, social and economic information, particularly historical perspectives about Zambia which forms good background on the geo-political development agenda of the country. Access to such information by the public is very limited both in physical and electronic forms. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 5 Electronic Media Broadcasting in Zambia dates back to 1941 when the colonial government opened a radio station in Lusaka. Until after the re-introduction of multi-party politics in 1991, radio and TV broadcasting was a preserve of the state, either as a Government department or as a statutory body. However, the enactment of the following laws to facilitate the liberalisation of the media industry has opened new avenues for radio and TV services across the country: (a) Radio Communications Act of 1994 (b) Independent Broadcasting Authority Act of 2002 (c) ZNBC (Amendment) Act of 2002 The above legislation together with the Zambia National Broadcasting (ZNBC) Act of 1987 and the ZNBC Licensing Regulations (1993) provide for the legal and regulatory framework for the broadcasting sub-sector in Zambia. The Independent Broadcasting Act also establishes the Independent Broadcasting Authority as the regulator for the broadcasting sub-sector. However, the regulatory agency is not yet functional. Since 1994, Zambia has made significant advances in liberalising the airwaves thus allowing private sector participation in the sub-sector. This has resulted in the opening of a number of commercial and community radio stations. There is at least one (1) community radio station and ZNBC FM Transmission in each province. Three TV broadcasting stations are operational, namely; ZNBC, Trinity Broadcasting and Muvi TV. On the other hand MultiChoice Zambia, part of the pan- African pay TV Company is providing subscription based Satellite TV services across the country while CASAT also provides pay cable TV services in Lusaka. On the other front, the convergence of technologies and markets has created opportunities such as Internet radio broadcasting, which is becoming popular among local commercial radio stations thus reaching the entire world with very minimum costs. While this situation expands opportunities in the ICT sector, the current regulatory framework in telecommunications and broadcasting sub-sectors are slowly becoming inadequate in addressing new challenges arising from convergence of services. Some of the challenges include: (a) Non-availability of ICT tools and services especially in rural and underserved urban areas; (b) High cost of access to ICT tools and services whenever available; (c) Inadequate local content to support cultural promotion and traditional Knowledge development; (d) Limited coverage of electronic media across the country; (e) The role of ZNBC as the national broadcaster with respect to information delivery to the General public amidst liberalised airwaves needs clarity to ensure, responsibilities and equity; (f) The regulation of Internet Telephony (VoIP) and Broadcasting amidst the DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 6 proliferation of Multimedia technologies and Internet. 2.4 ICT SECTOR The ICT sector is represented by a four-tier system, namely policymaking, legal and regulatory framework, operators and consumers (end users). Policy Making The Policy making machinery in the country is an important component shaping the ICT industry. Given the crosscutting nature of ICT, all line ministries, legislators, traditional leaders, co-operating partners, public sector, private sector, civil society and individuals are key stakeholders to the policy making process. However, with respect to the ICT Portfolio, the Ministry of Communications and Transport is charged with the responsibility of setting the policy direction for the industry and country at large taking into account stakeholder views. Therefore, a clear policy framework is the foundation for the development of ICTs in the country. Legal and Regulatory Framework The responsibility for development of the legal framework for the sector lies in the ministry in charge of the ICT portfolio supported by the ministry responsible for the Justice portfolio and the legislature (Parliament). However, another important component in the process is the regulatory function in the sector. Currently, the Communications Authority of Zambia and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services carry the regulatory functions in Telecommunications and Broadcasting sub-sectors respectively. With the enactment of the IBA Act, on Independent Broadcasting Authority will assume the responsibility of regulating the broadcasting sub-sector. Operators At the operator level, the major players can be classified as follows; (a) Telecommunications Services The telecommunications sub-sector is composed of traditional fixed telephony and mobile communications based on the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication standard. Another category in this area includes Internet Service Providers. Equipment installation and other services is a small component of the sub-sector. (b) Information Technology This category comprises businesses involved in office automation and networking solutions such as supply and installation of computers and networks, system vending, end user training and distributorship. Over the years, the number of projects in this category has increased. However, foreign companies carry much of the substantial works leaving local companies to provide very limited services to clients. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 7 (c) Postal Services ZAMPOST is the major player in this category. However, a number of private sector competitors have entered the market especially in the courier business. Due to the introduction of technologies such as Internet on the market, the letter-based system has registered a downward trend over time. However, given the potential of E-Commerce in the country due to increased Internet use; there is great potential for the postal system to contribute significantly to E-Commerce penetration in the country. Therefore, re- engineering of the sub-sector is required to fit the new business environment. (d) Broadcasting Services Radio and TV form the key components of the sub-sector. The traditional approach to broadcasting has changed significantly over the years. Satellite and Internet technologies have created new opportunities and challenges for policy makers, broadcasters and regulators. This requires a lot of ingenuity given the not-so-clear separation of Radio/TV and Telecommunications services in the current scenario where technology and market convergence are driving diverse industries to merge. Currently, electronic content can be carried irrespective of the technology whether it is radio/TV or telecommunications transmission networks. Therefore, this situation is changing the legal and regulatory framework required to administer the sub-sector. Consumers The consumers of products and services form an important component of the sector. These include end users, dealers in consumer electronics, consumer associations and corporate customers. A number of factors have been identified as inhibiting the growth of the local ICT industry. Among the key factors affecting the growth of a vibrant private sector-driven ICT sector are: (a) Many industry players consider the current investment regime (incentives and taxes) to be unattractive for recapitalisation and new investments in telecommunications, broadcasting and Information Technology subs-sectors; (b) Lack of access to affordable capital among Zambian entrepreneurs in the ICT industry; especially start-up capital for SMEs in the sector; (c) High import tariffs and taxes imposed on ICT products and services are regarded as having a negative impact on the expansion of the ICT sector, this is despite the reduction of duty on computers from 15 to 5% in the 2004 budget; (d) Inadequate supporting infrastructure development such as roads, telecommunications, and electric power to increase the demand for ICT services; (e) Poor coordination of the ICT sector resulting in the inability to attract adequate domestic and foreign direct investment; (f) Lack of a coordinated industry voice on business matters affecting the sector; and (g) Limited regulatory powers amidst convergence of services. Information Technology is not regulated despite forming a key component of the ICT sector. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 8 2.5 TELECOMMUNICATIONS & SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE The major telecommunications infrastructure carrier for the country is ZAMTEL, covering most parts of the country using various technologies. However, over time the infrastructure capacity has deteriorated due to technology changes and system inadequacies. In 1994, Parliament enacted the Telecommunications Act, which resulted in the restructuring of the telecommunications sub-sector by separating the posts and telecommunications functions in the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) into two commercial entities: ZAMTEL and ZAMPOST. In addition, this included the removal of regulatory functions from PTC; thus resulting in the establishment of an autonomous regulatory agency, the Communications Authority of Zambia (CAZ). In addition, the Radio Communications Act of 1994 gives CAZ the responsibility of administering the utilisation of the Radio Frequency Spectrum, an important component in the effective performance of the telecommunications and broadcasting sub-sectors. The liberalisation opened up the market to other competitors in almost all segments of the entire telecommunications industry apart from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the International Gateway. ZAMTEL maintains monopoly in the PSTN market while efforts have been made to liberalise the International Gateway component. Public Switched Telephone Network ZAMTEL, a 100% state-owned company is the only provider allowed to operate a public switched telephone network (PSTN) in Zambia. It provides a wide range of services including local, national, long distance, and international fixed telephone services, domestic satellite telephone (Domsat), mobile telephone, and leased line services. ZAMTEL Internet service was commissioned in May 1997. The transmission network is predominantly analogue and is mainly based on microwave technology. A number of microwave trunk routes carry traffic to major provincial centres. However, a digital microwave network linking Lusaka to Copperbelt province, Eastern province and Siavonga has been commissioned. A digital backbone linking Lusaka and Livingstone is being installed as part of ZAMTEL s network upgrade. Traffic to medium sized towns and rural areas is carried via microwave links that also provide interconnection with neighbouring countries where applicable. The installed capacity of fixed telephone lines is about 90,000 but the demand has over time exceeded the available capacity resulting in one of the lowest teledensity in Southern Africa of only 0.9 per 100 people (9 people per 1000 with telephone service) across the country. Satellite Networks ZAMTEL operates three earth stations forming the International Gateway for links to USA, DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 9 Europe and Asia; Mwembeshi I was installed in 1974, Mwembeshi II in 1987 while Mwembeshi III was completed in 2002. Apart from telephone services, all earth stations transmit and receive international television via INTELSAT satellite. In recent years, ZAMTEL has also commissioned a Domestic Satellite system to provide telephony services to remote rural areas. Unfortunately, this service has not been extended beyond Sesheke, Sinazongwe and Kaputa, which were commissioned in 1995. Wireless Local Loop (WLL) ZAMTEL has installed the WLL system to cater for peri-urban communities that are closer to the exchanges but cannot be serviced by wireline technology. However, deployment and coverage of the WLL system is very limited. ZAMTEL is currently conducting a gradual replacement of the analogue WLL system with digital technology, mainly in urban areas along the line of rail. National Fibre Optic Backbone Unlike neighbouring countries which have made substantial investments in telecommunications infrastructure, Zambia lacks a modern fibre optic backbone for national and regional interconnection, despite the fact that fibre is terminating at Zambia s borders: Zimbabwe at Kariba, Botswana at Kazungula and Namibia at Katima Mulilo. The Copperbelt Energy Company (CEC) has installed a 24-core 520km fibre optic backbone on the Copperbelt, whose excess capacity is available for resale to potential users. On the other hand, ZESCO has already installed a 45km fibre optic cable between Lusaka and Kafue. It is desirable that a national network covering the entire country will be developed taking advantage of existing infrastructure such as electricity powerlines as a means of quick rollout of the network (using powerline technology, about 3,500km of fibre optic cabling is needed to cover the country up to provincial level). In order to leapfrog the existing capacity and technology requirements for overhauling the existing telecommunications infrastructure, thereby laying a solid foundation for delivering current and future services ranging from digital radio, TV, Internet, data and other multimedia services, Fibre based technology provides a comprehensive and reliable network for the country. The possibility of reducing telephone and Internet costs can be achieved by interconnecting the proposed national Fibre Optic network to the under-sea cable running along the African coast (west and east) connecting to Europe and Asia; some of the most active communication destinations for Zambia. However, this requires implementation modalities in terms of network licensing, access conditions, management and operation of the backbone in the most optimal and beneficial manner to the entire country. Mobile Phone Services The CAZ has licensed three mobile cellular service providers by 2004 from one (01) in 1996, namely ZAMTEL operating as CELL , TELECEL (now acquired by MTN group) and CELTEL (formerly ZAMCELL) and is considering the entrance of a fourth mobile DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 10 operator on the market. One of the results of the liberalisation of the telecommunications sub-sector has been the accelerated development of mobile telephony. The most evident market difference between mobile and fixed line services is that, worldwide, mobile communications is growing much more rapidly in rollout and access. In 2002, few years after introduction of mobile communication in Zambia, the number of mobile subscribers surpassed the fixed-line (ZAMTEL) subscribers and is still growing for the following reasons: a) There is unfulfilled demand for service in both urban and rural areas; b) Mobile networks can be installed more rapidly than fixed lines; c) Pre-paid mobile cellular service allows users to obtain services where they may not normally qualify for a fixed or mobile post-paid service because of their low or irregular income and/or lack of fixed-abode; d) Users find the functionality of mobile phones extremely useful; compared to fixed Lines; and e) Mobile technology infrastructure is less susceptible to vandalism The current combined subscriber base on the mobile networks stands at about 450,000 in just 5-8 years surpassing 90,000 fixed line subscribers that have been achieved over many years. However, the majority of the subscribers are along the line of rail. Currently all provincial centres are covered by at least one of the cellular network providers. On the other hand, fixed line growth is expected to slow down in the near future mainly due to the flexibility and convenience of mobile communication. However, the source of future growth for fixed lines will be due to the demand for faster and cheaper Internet access. Organisations and individuals may increasingly opt for mobile phones and retain fixed-line primarily for Internet access and other value-added services. This may only happen when mass-market broadband technologies take root in the country. Internet Service Providers Zambia is the pioneer of Internet in Sub-Sahara Africa outside South Africa in the early 90s. However, this advantage has not been exploited in that the country now lags behind many African countries that started Internet services just a few years ago. However, the Internet sub-sector is fully liberalised and is one of the most competitive in the ICT services industry in Zambia. The CAZ has so far licensed a number of players out of which six (6) are operational by 2004 from two (02) in 1996. The Internet market in Zambia is still developing with approximately 12,000 Internet subscribers and an additional 30,000 Internet users mainly patronising Internet cafes. However, the potential for rapid growth is undermined by inadequate telecommunication infrastructure development across the country, poor telephony accessibility and high access costs. Though there are no market entry restrictions for new ISPs, the licensing fee has proven prohibitive to many Zambians. Secondly, the limit on foreign shareholding for ISPs DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 11 and other similar value- added licenses is inhibiting most Zambians to enter the market due to inadequate access to start-up capital (financing) for such ventures. This has negated the benefits of the shareholding requirement though well intended to ensure that as many Zambians as possible are empowered as entrepreneurs in the sector. Private Data Networks The provision of private data networks has been liberalised and is fully competitive. The financial sector leads the private data network segment. Most banks and other financial institutions involved in tax revenue collection and pension funds have set-up their own VSAT data network solutions linking branches across the country; this includes national and international links in the case of international banks. However, VSAT technology has proved much more expensive in the long term especially with respect to space segment costs paid to foreign operators/service providers. The introduction of these technologies in Zambia has tremendously improved the delivery of financial services, with cash withdrawal facilities including international credit/debit cards such as VISA offered on the market. On the other hand, Internet Banking has just been introduced as some of the innovative services on the market. Such services will require reliable and cost-effective transmission and access technologies thus helping spread banking services to rural areas. On the other hand, Virtual Private Network (VPN) licenses have increased from one (01) in 1996 to fifteen (15) in 2004. Other Supporting Infrastructure Telecommunication infrastructure alone cannot be cost-effective if it is delivered in isolation. Given the high cost of deploying telecommunications infrastructure such as Fibre Optic, there is need to have a holistic approach to social and economic infrastructure development strategy in the country. The development of road networks and rural electrification schemes play a complimentary role in attracting telecommunication rollout. The existence of roads and electric power whether via grid or off-grid (using renewable/non-renewable) technology can increase the uptake of ICT tools such as computers, TV, radio etc. This strategy is imperative for schools and clinics which are major growth points in urban and rural areas. Therefore, the delivery of integrated infrastructure (roads, electricity, telecommunications) should be adopted as a deliberate measure during design and construction of schools, clinics, farming blocks and resettlement schemes etc. This approach tends to lower the overall cost of delivering infrastructure especially in rural areas and in turn lowers the cost of services to the end user. Therefore, some of the challenges in the deployment and delivery of telecommunications infrastructure across the country are; (a) High technology acquisition and deployment costs especially in the development of the national telecommunications backbone infrastructure; (b) Limited coverage and poor quality of existing telecommunications and Internet infrastructure in the country; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 12 (c) High cost and limited access to ICT infrastructure incurred by individuals and businesses; (d) Lack of special incentives for private sector participation in the development, management and operation of ICT and related infrastructure projects; (e) Monopolies in wholesale and retail markets of the telecommunication services sub-sector including infrastructure; (f) Duplication of communications infrastructure, especially in the public sector resulting under-utilisation of scarce resources; (g) Lack of universal access/service goals coupled with lack of a rural telecommunication infrastructure and service development strategy; (h) Inadequate licensing framework given the convergence in telecommunications and Broadcasting and the emergence of new services offered by new technologies; (i) Lack of a structured and streamlined Internet governance system in the country; and (j) Legalising and regulation of outlawed but cost-effective technologies such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 2.6 E-GOVERNMENT Electronic Government (E-Government) is the provision of Government products and services through electronic technologies such as Internet, E-mail, Electronic Document Management Systems, and electronic payment (Financial Management Systems)/service delivery. Currently, a number of initiatives are being undertaken within the public sector. The number of ICT projects has increased over the years resulting in building blocks such as the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) Project, Payroll Management and Establishment Control Project and building of Local Area Networks; these are central to the establishment of E-Government. However, such building blocks are being implemented in the public sector with very little coordination and integration with existing systems at operational level. In addition, over-duplication of telecommunications infrastructure has resulted in inefficient and ineffective projects with very little positive impact on the overall development agenda. Some of the challenges in E-Government development include; (a) Inadequate and fragmented ICT infrastructure and connectivity within the public sector; (b) Lack of supportive institutional framework to coordinate and promote E- Government development; (c) Inadequate manpower in the area of computing and information technology in the public sector; (d) Concerns about security of information as well as inadequate mechanisms for information flow within the public sector. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 13 2.7 E-COMMERCE Electronic payment systems are the cornerstone of E-Commerce development in the country by ensuring convenience and flexibility when undertaking commercial transactions and trade. Therefore, the banking sub-sector plays an important role in the development of E-Commerce solutions. With the adoption of Internet, some of the financial institutions are already offering Internet banking and international cash payment via electronic cards such as VISA to customers. Mobile commerce solutions via GSM phones are increasing on the market mainly due to the convenience, flexibility and increase in the use of mobile phones. However, the growth of E-Commerce depends on good telecommunications infrastructure, effective legal/regulatory framework, widespread use of E-Commerce related services, awareness creation and development of E-commerce solutions etc. Some of the challenges in the development of E-Commerce include: (a) Lack of effective ICT infrastructure to support widespread use of E-Commerce solutions; (b) Inadequate laws and legal system to support E-Commerce; (c) Inadequate innovative solutions from the ICT industry that can promote the spread of E-Commerce; (d) Lack of supportive and integrated investments in ICT, energy and other social infrastructure projects to increase uptake, access and demand for E- Commerce. 2.8 AGRICULTURE The National Agriculture Information Service (NAIS) is the major information and communication framework for farmers and other stakeholders in the agriculture sector. However, this channel is limited to radio programmes especially servicing the rural areas. Programmes on TV are proving to be more effective but the limited coverage of the TV network across the country has resulted in limited exploitation of the technology. Usage of effective voice communication systems among farmers such as radio phones as a community service has not been exploited. However, it is desirable that TV, Phones and Internet should make an impact as information/communication channels among stakeholders in the sector. Some of the challenges in integrating ICTs in Agriculture include: (a) Inadequate channels for information delivery among framers, businesses and policy makers; (b) Poor quality of existing infrastructure and high cost of ICT infrastructure rollout thus limiting access to ICT products and services among stakeholders; (c) Limited coverage of effective media tools like radio and TV among rural farming communities coupled with high cost and limited energy (electric) DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 14 supply to enhance uptake of ICTs; (d) Inadequate ICT literacy skills especially in rural areas; and (e) Lack of integrated approach in rollout of ICTs, energy and other social services infrastructure. 2.9 HEALTH The potential of ICT in contributing to the efficient and effective performance of the health sector is very high especially in remote diagnosis and treatment. Timely collection, management and dissemination of critical information has significant bearing on the performance of the sector in general. To this extent, the health sector has embarked on reforms that include development of Health Management Information Systems at various levels. Equally important is the Telemedicine programme being initiated as a deliberate effort to maximise the services provided by the few but highly experienced medical personnel whose services can only be extended through technologies such as Telemedicine. Therefore, connectivity of medical institutions to services such as telecommunication and Internet is an important milestone in the use of ICTs in the health sector. Telemedicine also can be used to provide both basic and continuous skills transfer to health professionals. This will help mitigate isolation of health professionals in rural areas. The dissemination of medical information through ICTs will facilitate informed decision-making particularly in hard to reach areas. Some of the challenges in integrating ICTs in the health sector include: (a) The need to improve ICT Infrastructure to support basic communication systems and specialised applications such as telemedicine; (b) Inadequate ICT awareness and skills among health professionals to effectively utilise the ICT tools and services; (c) Inadequate support services for installed ICT equipment especially in rural areas; (d) Incorporating and prioritising ICT in the core business of healthcare delivery. 2.10 TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES The Zambian travel and tourism industry largely depends on the availability of efficient and effective infrastructure across the country. This infrastructure includes roads, power supply, lodges and airports. Above all, telecommunication plays a vital role in the development of such infrastructure and the overall performance of the sector at national, regional and international levels. Specific ICT services such as mobile communications, broadcasting networks, electronic facilities and services add immense value to the desired performance of the sector. Zambia s most famous tourist destination, Livingstone, has seen an increase in communication facilities over the years including international roaming service on major DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 15 GSM networks thus increasing the flexibility and convenience especially for international tourists. Special attention is needed to rollout communication facilities in other important destinations especially in national parks as part of a comprehensive programme to upgrade facilities in various upmarket tourist destinations. This is so because Zambia will for a long time to come depend on wildlife based tourism. Therefore, ICTs can trigger enormous investments especially in wildlife based tourist destinations and contribute to general improvement of commerce, travel and tour operations. However, the proliferation of ICT equipment such as computers and other accessories requires special effort to mitigate any negative impacts on the environment and natural resources. Therefore, environmental strategies need to be adopted at an early stage in the acquisition, manufacture and disposal of ICT products. Notwithstanding the above situation, the industry faces a number of challenges that are constraining the development of the sector and limiting its contribution to national development. Some of these include: (a) Limited and inadequate ICT infrastructure, which presents significant barriers to the deployment of value-added ICT services and effective application of ICTs in the sector; (b) Lack of adequate, reliable, timely and relevant information on tourism products and services including lack of information on tourist destinations available in the country; (c) Lack of proper ICT hardware and accessory disposal mechanisms and/or recycling technologies. 2.11 YOUTH AND WOMEN The value of ICTs is largely seen through increased productivity, more efficient operations, improved information access and dissemination; equitable participation in social, political, and economic spheres; access to education and health; and breaking barriers of isolation. Therefore, successful diffusion, application and use of ICTs in the development process will depend on the involvement of women who are marginalized in society and yet constitute over half (51%) of the Zambian population. On the other hand, youths constitute a special group capable of using, deploying and taking ICTs into the future. This is even true given that, youths constitute about 60% of the population and are usually the early adopters of ICTs in any given society. It is widely accepted that any development activity that excludes youths and women will not achieve sustainable results. Information access and dissemination are some of the key empowerment tools for youths DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 16 and women as special groups. Currently, the emergence of GSM (mobile) communications system has increased the level of mobile teleshops most of which are owned and operated by youths. Therefore, by increasing sustainable programmes targeted at youths and women as special groups, greater empowerment opportunities can be created. A rapid survey conducted among the youths along the line of rail revealed the following; i) Using media channels for accessing information, 96% of the youths listen to the radio, 81% read newspapers, 60% read magazines, 51% access the Internet for purposes other than email; daily usage of the Internet stands at 13% with the majority being College/University students; ii) The purpose for which they access information is diverse; however, the survey reveals that 53% is for educational opportunities, 52% for sports and 48% for job opportunities; iii) About 44% of the youths own mobile phones which are used primarily for voice and sms communication; iv) Libraries on the other hand are sources of information for 59% of the youths mainly Associated with school/academic work. Some of the challenges of ICTs among youths and women are: (a) Low ICT literacy and skills levels especially among women; (b) Low opportunities for access to ICT products and services; and (c) Entry barriers (financial, skills etc) for youths and women especially as entrepreneurs. 2.12 LEGAL & REGULATORY FRAMEWORK In 1994, Parliament enacted the Telecommunications Act, which resulted in the restructuring of the telecommunications sub-sector; removing the posts and telecommunications functions in the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) into two separate commercial entities: ZAMTEL and ZAMPOST. In addition, this included the removal of the regulatory functions from PTC through the establishment of an autonomous regulatory agency, the Communications Authority of Zambia (CAZ). On the other hand, the regulation of the postal sub-sector is still carriedout by the Ministry of Communications and Transport through a Licensing Committee comprising various stakeholders. Currently, the CAZ is responsible for regulating the provision of telecommunications products and services in the country. Its specific functions include issuing licences and promoting competition amongst providers of telecommunications services and products, promoting the interests of consumers and other users of ICT services/ products as well as ensuring that the benefits of the sector accrue to the nation at large. In addition, the Radio Communications Act of 1994 gives the CAZ responsibility for administering the utilisation of the Radio Frequency Spectrum as a scarce national resource. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 17 This function has impact on the performance of radio and TV broadcasting in the country. However, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services has been undertaking the regulatory function until recently. As part of the restructuring in the broadcasting sub-sector, the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act of 2002 provides for regulation of broadcasting outside the Ministry. Therefore, the functions of CAZ and IBA in the sector need to be harmonised taking into account the already converging telecommunications and broadcasting markets such as internet radio broadcasting and online content publishing. Some of the challenges that need to be addressed include: (a) The regulation of converging technologies, markets and services within the context of compartmentalised regulatory frameworks for telecommunications, broadcasting and other sub-sectors; (b) Institutional capacity to support the regulation of dynamic and fast technology oriented market; (c) Definition of clear roles and responsibilities among key players including policy makers, regulators and operators; (d) Addressing Intellectual Property issues amidst inadequate legal framework on copyright, trademarks, patents etc; (e) Inadequate capacity to deal with complex matters such as security of information systems, cyber crime, misuse of ICTs etc. 2.13 SECURITY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY In general, one of the greatest concerns in connected societies is security of information passing through networks and systems such as computers, financial transactions, health records etc. As Zambia embraces ICTs, more security concerns and abuse shall arise if no counter measures are put in place. Already, Zambia has experienced cases of misuse of ICTs especially with respect to corrupting website content. The proliferation of Internet and other ICT applications will also create opportunities for misuse. However, with measures such as implementing security policies, laws and technology solutions aimed at securing information, networks and systems, the impact can be mitigated. Therefore, every effort shall be made to ensure that as the country adopts, implements and uses ICTs in all spheres of life, security measures are put in place to minimise negative impacts on society at large. Specific challenges include: DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 18 (a) Security of government, public and private networks and communications systems in general; and in particular those systems carrying sensitive and critical data/information of great value to Government, businesses and individuals; (b) Protection of networks and information systems to guard against various types of malicious crimes and unauthorised access; safeguarding against undermining consumer confidence in online services including those based on E-Commerce, E-Government and E-Health systems; (c) Privacy of individuals, businesses and Government arising from connectivity to local, national and global networks. 2.14 POLICY IMPLEMENTATION Some of the issues that have contributed to the low ICT uptake and penetration in the country are lack of coordination and leadership in creating the vision for the sector. However, the initiative to develop this policy is the biggest step in creating a clear roadmap/vision for the sector. Therefore, the success of all the commitments and provisions of this policy depend on how well the implementation will be coordinated. The requirements include sustainable and effective institutional framework, coordination and resource mobilisation. Other challenges include; (a) Leadership of the national ICT portfolio; and the visibility of the National Champion for ICTs among the public; (b) Capacity for Policy formulation/development at various levels of society; (c) Institutional framework and capacity for policy implementation at national, provincial and district levels; (d) Developing clear roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders; (e) Mainstreaming of ICTs by Cooperating Partners in country programmes; and reflection of ICT commitment in national budgets; (f) Inadequate and ineffective legal and regulatory framework; (g) Inadequate capacity to undertake ICT investment promotion/campaigns at national, regional and international levels. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 19 CHAPTER 3 VISION The national ICT Policy is aligned to the following vision statement. A Zambia transformed into an information and knowledge-based society and economy supported by consistent development of, and pervasive access to ICTs by all citizens by 2030. 3.1 VISION ELEMENTS In realising the above vision; (a) The Government recognises the strategic opportunities and benefits that Information and Communication Technology offers to accelerate social and economic development across the country; (b) The Government realises that access to information and knowledge are some of the pre- requisites for wealth creation and for effective participation of Zambia in the global economy currently dominated by information and knowledge-based societies; (c) The Government further recognises the critical role that a high capacity, reliable and geographically distributed telecommunications backbone infrastructure covering the entire country can offer in accelerating ICT penetration; providing access to information and knowledge resources, domestic and global markets as well as in creation of empowerment opportunities for all Zambians; (d) The Government acknowledges the need for integrated national planning in order to ensure that other sectors of the economy benefit from the deployment of ICTs as part of social and economic development; (e) The Government is aware that the transition from a natural resource to a knowledge -based economy will depend on visionary leadership as well as the availability of quality human resource needed to steer the nation into an information society; (f) The Government is cognisant of the global and regional trends of the convergence of technologies, services and products and the resulting impact In managing the telecommunications, computing, broadcasting, media and postal services sub-sectors; (g) The Government is fully aware that ICTs alone cannot have an appreciable impact on Zambia s development prospects unless the use of ICTs in the society and economy is done within the context of poverty reduction DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 20 and other programmes addressing a number of critical success factors at central and local government; CHAPTER 4 RATIONALE In broad terms, the development of the National ICT Policy is designed to achieve the following: (a) Facilitating the implementation of constitutional provisions related to information and communication The constitution recognises the Right to Information as implied in the freedom of expression. The implementation of the above commitment requires a policy framework that underpins access to information. (b) Creating leadership and vision in the ICT sector The institutional framework in this policy creates the visibility that ICT deserves at the level of Government. This is in line with other countries that are reaping the benefits of adopting ICTs as part of the national development strategy; many countries on the African continent are recording success in general and ICTs in particular based on this approach. (c) Clear definition of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders The National ICT Policy shall adequately address the roles and responsibilities of various parties such as the Ministry responsible for the ICT portfolio, the Regulator, Legislature, Judiciary, Operators/Service Providers, Public and Private sector as well as Civil Society, Consumers and Individuals. (d) Support the creation of adequate and effective sector legislation and regulatory framework The current legal and regulatory framework governing the ICT sector is considered inadequate by industry players in addressing concerns mainly because it was drawn without a clear sector policy in place; thus creating room for speculation on key policy issues as well as lack of clear direction on roles and responsibilities. Therefore, the revised legislation will draw its powers from this Policy. (e) Creating investor confidence in the ICT sector The National ICT Policy sets clear guidelines on the Dos and Don ts to the local and foreign investors in the sector, especially the private investors thus creating certainty and long-term investor confidence. (f) Ensuring coordinated and effective use of ICTs as an instrument for accelerated social and economic development The digital divide and hence the development divide existing between the developed and developing countries is largely due to economic differences DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 21 arising from technology utilisation including ICTs; while developing countries are still focused on resource based economies ICTs have become economic drivers in developed countries. Zambia can benefit from this lesson to break the chain of poverty. C(g) Ensuring rational and harmonised application of ICTs and use of scarce resources The National ICT Policy establishes the technical, legal and institutional framework that guarantees not only a rational and harmonised use of ICTs for sustainable development but also a more profitable participation of stakeholders in sector and country activities. (h) Enhancing Zambia’s competitiveness in the global information society & economy The relevance of any given country in the global economy that is heavily characterised by use of information as a commodity is determined by the effectiveness and efficiency of using ICTs as part of the national development framework. Indeed, information and communication technologies have become, in this information age, the great common denominator of development projects, ranging from agriculture, mineral prospecting, environmental management, education, health, culture, tourism etc. (i) Creating a positive sector benchmark for cooperating partners Policy reforms in any sector are some of the benchmarks used to guarantee technical and financial assistance by many Cooperating Partners. Therefore, the existence of a sector policy creates not only confidence sector governance issues but also developmental aid flow a key element in resource mobilisation for implementing ICTs in the country. (j) Creating a framework for addressing and endorsing international commitments Zambia has participated in various activities of the United Nations, AU (NEPAD) and regional bodies such as COMESA and SADC in the area of ICT. Endorsing and implementing the provisions of such declarations and protocols require adequate sector policy framework. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 22 CHAPTER 5 GUIDING PRINCIPLES The implementation of this Policy shall be guided, among other things by the right of access to information, transparency, fairness and accountability. The following shall also be taken into account as key guiding principles: (a) This policy is designed to guide and mainstream the use of ICTs in all sectors of the economy; hence the policy is an ICT for Development (ICT4D) policy designed to fit within the socio-economic development agenda of the country rather than a stand-alone technology framework; (b) In order for this policy to make appreciable impact on Zambia s social and economic development, the policy goals and objectives shall be integrated into the overall national developmental objectives, priorities and programmes such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme and National Development Plans. Therefore, all sectors are expected to draw their ICT policies from this framework; (c) This Policy shall be Government-led and Private Sector-driven during implementation. Therefore, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) shall form the basis for implementation especially in matters and projects of national character and importance; (d) Government shall take leadership mainly in facilitating the mobilisation of investment required for development of a national telecommunications infrastructure backbone as well as the implementation of this policy; (e) This policy shall be supported by appropriate legislation aimed at effective separation of roles and responsibilities for policy formulation/guidance, regulation and operation in order to ensure transparent and effective regulatory functions based on convergence principles and establish institutional mechanisms for policy implementation; (f) The upgrading of existing and development of new infrastructure such as roads and electric power shall also be taken into account as complimentary services to the successful rollout of the telecommunications infrastructure and ICT services in order to increase penetration and open new investment opportunities across the country; (g) Priority shall be given to the establishment of coordination mechanisms at different levels to allow for integration of ICTs in key functions of society in order to ensure sustainability of ICT programmes and projects; (h) A deliberate and accelerated ICT manpower development policy and implementation plan shall form the basis for human resource development at all DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 23 levels in the country (i) The implementation of this policy shall be supported by intensive and extensive public awareness activities at all levels of society. This is expected to create demand for ICTs in areas such as training, service provision etc; (j) Mainstreaming of cross cutting issues such as Gender, HIV/AIDS and Environment is important and shall apply during implementation, monitoring and review of this policy; (k) Empowering special groups in society such as children, youths, women and the physically challenged shall be considered by providing special incentives to enable them have appropriate access to ICT tools, opportunities and services; (l) The implementation of this policy shall take into account relevant regional and global policies and best practices in transforming the nation into an information society targeting the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), WSIS, WTO, NEPAD, E-Schools and Infrastructure programmes, as well as COMESA and SADC initiatives.

It is recognized that the development of critical human resource is key to facilitating and accelerating the development of an information society. It is also acknowledged that the extent to which Zambia will benefit from the advances and the opportunities of the emerging information society will largely depend on the country s capacity to develop and harness the available human resource to support national development. Zambia, like most developing countries needs to develop and deploy the required human resources in key areas in order to transform the economy into a predominantly information and knowledge-based society. 6.1.1 POLICY GOAL To attain sufficient and world-class human resource capacity in critical and relevant ICT skills required for developing and driving Zambia s information and knowledge- based society and economy. 6.1.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:- (a) Facilitate the creation of Centres of Excellence for training/education in Electronic Engineering (Telecommunications), Computer Science/Information Technology, Media/Information Science etc; (b) Facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive human resource development programme targeting critical skill areas across key sectors of the economy in order to accelerate the development of Zambia s information society and economy; (c) Mainstream youth and gender issues in human resource development activities. 6.1.3 OBJECTIVES a) To increase the institutional capacity in terms of infrastructure and human resource in public and private colleges/ universities that offer ICT courses; b) To increase annual enrolment and output of students in key professional skills areas such as telecommunications/electronics engineering, computer science, media/information sciences etc; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 26 c) To address the human resource requirements in key sectors of the economy targeting critical managerial, technical and operator skills.

DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 27 6.2 PROMOTING ICT IN EDUCATION, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT It is recognized that for developing countries like Zambia to make major progress in social and economic development, there is need to invest significant effort and resources in the education system. Zambia s education system is currently under-resourced; with a substantial section of the population without access to high school and tertiary level education as well as professional training. Therefore, a significant percentage of the population is without educational attainment required for meaningful contribution to national development. 6.2.1 POLICY GOAL To integrate ICTs in the education system and develop the nation s Research and Development (R&D) capacity to support, facilitate and contribute to the development of key sectors of the economy including the development of appropriate local ICT products and services. 6.2.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Facilitate the creation of Centres of Excellence for research in Electronics Engineering/Telecommunications,Computer Science/Information Technology, Media/Information Science etc; (b) Take appropriate policy measures to facilitate and promote the integration of ICTs within the entire Zambian educational system to support administration, teaching, learning and research; (c) Adopt and adapt NEPAD E-Schools and other initiatives to promote E- learning and E-Education as well as life-long learning within the population at large; (d) Strengthen science and technical education as the basis for laying the foundation for human resource and skills development in ICT; and (e) Adequately invest in R&D as a way of developing the nation s scientific and industrial research capacity in ICTs. 6.2.3 OBJECTIVES a) To deploy ICTs at all levels of the Zambian educational system in order to improve and expand access to education, training and research facilities; b) To modernise the educational delivery system with the aim of improving the quality of education and training at all levels; c) To strengthen the administration and decision-making capacity in the educational system through the deployment of Education Management Information Systems; & d) To promote collaboration of R&D systems within the local industrial set-up to facilitate product development, innovation and delivery of world-class DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 28 services that can compete on the global market. 6.2.4 STRATEGIES a) Promote and facilitate the integration of computer skills into the teaching and learning process at basic (primary), high school and tertiary levels; b) Introduce programmes on teacher education in ICTs at all training institutions in the country; c) Develop partnerships with private sector and other stakeholders in the quest for increased ICT literacy; d) Accelerate the extension of tertiary education programmes at the nation s colleges and universities to teacher training colleges through E-learning systems; e) Develop a national ICT curriculum and qualification system at basic, high school and tertiary levels; f) Promote the development, deployment and utilization of electronic-based distance education, training and learning systems in the Zambian educational system to complement and supplement residential education and training; g) Promote and facilitate the development and the adoption of Educational Management Information Systems within the public and private educational institutions to improve the quality of managing educational delivery activities, operations and monitoring; h) Protect and facilitate the participation of the private sector and other establishments including industries and businesses in industrial research as well as Cutting-edge R&D activities; i) Encourage and facilitate collaborative research; R&D projects and knowledge transfer partnerships between Zambian universities/ research institutions with counterpart institutions in other countries; j) Implement special schemes and policy measures and packages aimed at promoting affordable acquisition of computers and other ICT products by students, trainers and educational institutions; k) Promote and facilitate the adoption of educational technologies and Internet access within the public and private educational institutions targeting all levels of the educational system; l) Allocate a significant percentage of the national budget to integration and DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 29 deployment of ICTs in the education system. 6.3 PROMOTING PUBLIC ACCESS, CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL HERITAGE Access to information forms the basis for creating an information society. Therefore, the availability of public access points, ICT tools, content and services are as important as the information itself in the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to support rural development, community based initiatives and projects in Zambia s developmental effort. The Government appreciates the development of the media and the promotion of local content development as well as enhancing, and safeguarding Zambia s cultural heritage through the use of ICTs. Therefore, efforts shall be directed at promoting the use of ICTs in rural, urban and underserved communities and ensuring that the net effect of the developmental gains resulting from ICTs does have a widespread impact at all levels in both rural and urban areas. 6.3.1 POLICY GOAL To promote widespread public access to information through appropriate traditional and new technology solutions based on relevant local content while promoting cultural heritage. 6.3.2 COMMITMENTS in order to reach out and benefit the majority of the Zambian population and improve the penetration of ICTs within society, the Government shall: (a) Develop universal access/service goals and strategies for rural telecommunications, radio and TV transmission infrastructure and service rollout; (b) Implement special incentives to facilitate the development and intensive use of traditional media such as the local newsprint, community radio and TV as part of the strategies to promote new technologies as well as information access/dissemination across the country;

The Zambian ICT industry is hardly involved in the production and development of local ICT products resulting in service providers being involved mainly in retailing (supplying imported computer hardware and software as complete systems) of computer products as well as providing basic IT services. On the other hand the privatisation of ZCCM and restructuring of Zambia Railways has resulted in high inactivity in software development centres operated under the above institutions before the privatisation process. This has affected the managerial and professional development capacity in IT services and software engineering in the country.

It is generally acknowledged that transmission networks for radio, telephone, TV, Internet are the basis for mass- media development. This is further enhanced by associated physical infrastructure such as roads, electricity and general utilities. With DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 34 respect to ICTs, lack of a reliable, widely distributed and high capacity network for data, voice (sound) and video (pictures) has greatly contributed to the low availability and penetration of ICT services as well as costly deployment of basic services especially in rural areas. This has resulted in inadequate telephone and Internet services; high start up costs for radio (especially community radio stations) and TV broadcasting. The net effect is low information access levels that are affecting citizen s participation in governance issues as well as the high cost of doing business across the country. 6.5.1 POLICY GOAL To increase access and promote widespread deployment of ICT services through the expansion of the nation s telecommunications backbone infrastructure covering the whole country. 6.5.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Endeavour to attain full liberalisation of all services in the ICT sector subject to regional and international protocols/agreements, best practices as well as market readiness;

f) Restructure the ICT market by separating the provision of wholesale, retail and value-added services. 6.6 PROMOTING ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT The Government machinery is normally viewed through institutions making up the public sector; and plays an important role in the nation s development process. Broadly speaking E-Government involves the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to facilitate the process of bringing Government closer to the people through major improvements in the delivery of goods and services as well as information provision in ways that are most convenient to citizens and other stakeholders. The purpose of DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 37 transforming Government through ICTs is to realise efficiency gains, reduce operational and administrative costs as well as streamline government processes and procedures. The Government is aware that the potential benefits that shall be derived from the implementation of E-Government are enormous. However, Government is also aware that mere deployment of ICTs in the public sector will not necessarily translate into improvements in service delivery unless appropriate institutional reforms to address the challenges that could hinder or undermine the process of effective implementation of ICTs are addressed. 6.6.1 POLICY GOAL To improve public sector management as well as efficient and effective delivery of public goods and services through the implementation of E-Government systems. 6.6.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: - (a) Develop an E-Government model to facilitate effective and efficient delivery of goods and services in the public sector; (b) Support the implementation of the decentralisation process by extensive integration and utilisation of ICTs at all levels; (c) Develop a Government-wide network and communication system utilising the same infrastructure backbone as the foundation for implementation of the E- Government strategy; and (d) Review and establish reforms aimed at legalising electronic procedures /processes and other forms of E-Services . 6.6.3 OBJECTIVES a) To transform Government service delivery and improve two-way communication in the management and operation of the public sector; b) To improve the operations of Government Ministries/Agencies within the wider scope of the public sector reform programme through the deployment of ICTs; c) To develop an institutional and coordination mechanism for information management in the public sector; and d) To safeguard public sector information and investment against negative DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 38 impacts of deploying and using ICTs. 6.6.4 STRATEGIES a) Develop and implement a comprehensive E-Government strategy targeting: Government to Government (G2G), Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Citizens (G2C) and Government to Employee (G2E) services; b) Identify, develop and implement E-Services in the provision of government information, health, educational and other services through the use of ICTs; c) Undertake a comprehensive change management and human resource development Programme to support the adoption of ICTs as part of the service delivery model; d) Develop and promote standards, guidelines and procedures to facilitate the acquisition, installation and maintenance of ICT systems within public sector institutions; e) Develop Provincial and District Information Resource Centres and implement an integrated Geographic Information System to support development planning and decision-making at national, provincial and district levels; f) Partner with civil society and private sector to participate in civic initiatives and other information/service delivery solutions including development of public access centres for online services such as license acquisition, registrations of births, deaths, marriages as well as voter registration at national, provincial and district levels as part of E- Government implementation; g) Establish and develop an Integrated Land Information System at district and provincial levels to enhance land management, security of tenure, land utilisation; monitoring and evaluation; h) Implement mechanisms and processes that will facilitate sharing and exchange of information, good practices and organisational experiences within the public sector; i) Implement schemes and initiatives targeted at motivating public service employees to acquire ICT literacy/skills as part of improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness; j) Establish legislative and other instruments aimed at enhancing access to information, as well as secure the privacy and security of information in public domain; k) Adopt an open policy for use of proprietary, free and/or open source software in developing E-Government solutions systems. 6.7 PROMOTING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE E-commerce broadly involves the use of electronic and traditional delivery systems such as the postal network to facilitate the process of trading in goods and services using electronic payment systems and technologies such as the Internet. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 39 Global communication networks such as the Internet, are rapidly removing the traditional barriers of time and distance key components influencing commerce and trade. Such technologies provide users, organisations and businesses in both the developed and developing countries with numerous opportunities including: setting up virtual shops to market and advertise business activities to the rest of the world at a very minimal cost. In Zambia, the scope for E-Commerce is growing largely due to increased use of electronic networks and payment systems. The role of the banking sub-sector and communication systems coupled with legal and regulatory framework is critical to the success of E-Commerce. 6.7.1 POLICY GOAL To promote Zambia s full and effective participation in national, regional and global trade through E-Commerce services and facilities. 6.7.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:- (a) Establish monetary and fiscal policy measures to ensure consumer confidence in E- Commerce; (b) Develop effective laws and regulations that shall govern E-Commerce at national level supported by regional and international systems; (c) Establish mechanisms to protect intellectual property rights related to E-Commerce. 6.7.3 OBJECTIVES a) To promote a stable, fair and competitive investment climate to facilitate the development of E-Commerce activities in the economy; b) To develop a highly competitive ICT industry capable of serving as the engine for driving Zambia s active participation in global trade; c) To facilitate the adoption of E-Commerce especially by SMEs in agriculture, tourism, small scale mining and manufacturing as well as non- traditional exports to ensure productivity and growth; d) To develop the services industry whose activities meet international standards in the production and delivery of globally competitive E- Commerce products and Services.

This sector accounts for a high proportion of the GDP and acts as the main source of employment and income in peri-urban and rural areas where the majority of Zambians reside. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 41 However, the sector has received top Government priority in the two main social and economic recovery initiatives namely; the Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme and the Transitional National Development Plan. Therefore, ICT shall be integrated in the agricultural sector reform process in order to contribute to the social and economic revival of the country. 6.8.1 POLICY GOAL To improve productivity as well as competitiveness of the agricultural sector through the use of ICTs in the planning, implementation, monitoring and the information delivery process. 6.8.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Facilitate private sector investment in the development and provision of ICT services including infrastructure in all Farming Blocks and Farm Resettlement Schemes as part of the integrated physical infrastructure (electricity, schools, clinics, water and roads) development projects targeted for those areas; (b) Institute necessary policy measures to deploy, exploit and integrate ICTs and other technologies into the operations and activities of the sector from production, through to processing, packaging, marketing and distribution; 6.8.3 OBJECTIVES a) To facilitate the development of a diversified and competitive agricultural sector that produces to meet the nation s food requirements while contributing to export earnings; b) To promote and support rural development in order to achieve long- term growth in the agricultural sector and the economy as a whole; c) To increase the competitiveness of farmers in production, processing and marketing of agricultural products and services through the utilisation of ICTs; d) To monitor the conservation and sustainable utilisation of natural resources in the agricultural production process; e) To promote the development of ICT entrepreneurs at SME level as part of the rural agro- business industry development and strengthen the development, application of ICTs in agriculture.

This has affected delivery of drugs, messages and data collection/dissemination. Another dimension is the recent exodus of experienced and DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 43 qualified manpower in the sector: most specialist doctors and nurses are confined to the line of rail leaving rural areas to cope with inadequate staff levels. Globally, ICT is playing a vital and effective role in the organisation and delivery of health services. Therefore, the deployment of ICTs is acknowledged to have the potential to facilitate the spread of health and medical services to rural and under-served areas; supporting public health education and information services, education and training of medical personnel among others; as well as for supporting decision making related to health service administration and management. 6.9.1 POLICY GOAL To improve access to quality healthcare as close to the family as possible through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs and other modern technologies. 6.9.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Invest in ICT-based healthcare systems to increase the opportunity for Zambians to have access to adequate and appropriate modern health services irrespective of time, distance and location; (b) Facilitate the development and implementation of a national telemedicine programme to efficiently and effectively utilise scarce human resources and to further improve human capacity in the healthcare delivery system; (c) Partner with private sector and civil society in the deployment and utilisation of ICTs in the health sector; (d) Develop a legal/regulatory and ethical framework for effective use of the Health Information and implement security measures to safeguard the privacy of patient information inherent in health care records; (f) Mainstream ICTs in the management and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other pandemics. 6.9.3 OBJECTIVES (a) To improve the health status of the population and reduce inequalities in the provision of health care services among the Zambian population; (b) To support, through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs, initiatives aimed at combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious diseases; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 44 (c) To provide information to people living with life-threatening diseases, Particularly HIV/AIDS; (d) To support research directed at addressing medical, social and economic aspects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases; (e) To facilitate the development, deployment and implementation of health information, management and decision support systems and facilities aimed at improving the planning, management and administration functions as part of effective and efficient health service delivery. 6.9.4 STRATEGIES a) Develop an appropriate National Health Management Information System; b) Facilitate connectivity and access to communication services in health institutions to support healthcare delivery; c) Develop appropriate ICT infrastructure at all levels of the healthcare system to support the collection, use, management and dissemination of health care information; d) Promote and encourage ICT training and skills development among healthcare professionals; e) Deploy ICTs to support education and awareness initiatives aimed at combating major national health threats such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases. 6.10 PROMOTING THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT Travel and tourism as a sector constitutes one of the economic pillars of global trade; this includes both wildlife and non-wildlife based tourism. Over the recent past, Zambia has positioned herself well in the global tourism market. By its very nature, the tourism sector is well suited for the integration and application of ICTs, which potentially can enhance marketing of tourism products and services; increase the efficiency and effectiveness of transactions and service delivery as well as providing Zambian enterprises with access to international tourism markets. However, large- scale ICT projects may impact negatively on the environment, natural resources and heritage. Therefore, protection and conservation measures need to be taken into account alongside the developments in ICT. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 45 6.10.1 POLICY GOAL To integrate ICTs in the development of the tourism industry and facilitate the conservation of Zambia s natural resources & heritage as well as to protect the environment. 6.10.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Implement specific policy measures to ensure that all development of ICT infrastructure in the country as well as the manufacture and disposal of ICT products shall be done in conformity with existing and future policies and guidelines on heritage/natural resources conservation and environmental protection; (b) Partner with the private sector as agents for extending and expansion of the ICT infrastructure and services in all tourist centres and destinations designated as priority in the development of the national tourism potential; (c) Implement ICT applications and systems that will enhance the audit, management and monitoring of the efficient and effective utilisation of Zambia s natural resources and heritage; (d) Mainstream gender issues using ICTs in the management, development and use of natural resources. 6.10.3 OBJECTIVES a) To improve communication systems across the country especially in tourist centres to support tourism development; b) To use ICTs in the documentation, promotion and effective marketing of the full Potential of Zambia s world class and niche tourist destinations to the local, regional and international market; c) To ensure that all ICT related activities have very minimal negative environmental impact during construction, operation and disposal/de- commissioning; d) To conserve natural resources and safeguard our heritage using ICT tools. 6.10.4 STRATEGIES a) Develop information platforms (portals) for niche tourism products and destinations and create databases for collection of tourism information DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 46 to support planning, monitoring and evaluation; b) Establish the National Spatial Data Infrastructure as mechanism for cross- sectoral collaboration in sharing and exchange of natural resources information; c) Develop institutional mechanisms to establish an Integrated Geographic Information System to support heritage conservation, natural resources Management and early warning systems to predict natural disasters /phenomena that may affect natural resources management, environment protection and tourism performance; d) Develop an integrated travel and tourism information systems to support operators in the travel and tourism industry; e) Promote and integrate ICT skills in the provision of world class training programmes by hospitality training services providers; and f) Develop partnerships with the private sector to support the development of E-Commerce solutions in the tourism industry. 6.11 MAINSTREAMING YOUTH AND WOMEN ISSUES The successful penetration of ICTs within the existing social and economic structures depends on its people. However, youths and women are heavily marginalised in most activities but constitute a very important segment of society. Therefore, there is need to address youths and women as special groups in society that can positively contribute to the growth of ICTs as well as the use of ICTs as empowerment tools in their daily activities. 6.11.1 POLICY GOAL To use ICTs as an instrument to mainstream youth and women issues in all activities of the economy and society as well as empower youths and women through opportunities created by the implementation of ICT projects and programmes in the country. 6.11.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:- (a) Implement actions that promote women and youth friendly initiatives; and promote fair access to ICTs by youths and women as well as the disadvantaged in society; (b) Make it mandatory for telephone (fixed or wireless) service providers to provide toll-free service to support special not-for-profit organisations targeting DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 47 their services at youths, women, vulnerable and the physically challenged groups; (c) Implement measures to counter gender imbalances affecting women s participation and benefiting from the information society at all levels; (d) Use ICTs to domesticate and harmonise youth and gender issues enshrined in regional and international protocols ratified by Zambia. 6.11.3 OBJECTIVES a) To increase empowerment opportunities through ICTs; and the participation of youths and women in national development; b) To promote ICT as an alternative career for youth and women in the informal and formal educational system; c) To encourage creativity and innovation around ICTs among youths and women leading to entrepreneurship development; d) To provide a forum for collaboration and exchange of ideas on matters affecting youths and women; e) To enable full and equal participation of women and youths in creating the Information society. 6.11.4 STRATEGIES a) Implement special ICT training programs for youths and women; b) Promote ICT awareness among youths and women and develop literacy programmes; c) Pro the mote the use of ICTs as tools to eliminate all forms of inequalities between sexes; d) Encourage the participation and integration of youths and women in organs and processes of national policy formulation, planning and decision-making through information access mechanisms; e) Promote innovative and start-up (incubator) projects for youths and women as ICT entrepreneurs; f) Promote moral use of ICTs such as the Internet especially among youths; g) Facilitate and encourage the development of electronic networks DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 48 and systems for associations and organisations engaged in the advancement of youth and Women issues in the country; h) Implement ICT programmes/projects focussing on combating HIV/AIDS Among youths and women; i) Acknowledge, protect and defend women s rights in the information society; and j) Provide infrastructure and affordable access to ICT tools and services in rural and urban areas. 6.12 DEVELOPING THE LEGAL & REGULATORY FRAMEWORK An appropriate and dynamic legal/regulatory framework is mandatory to act as the foundation for the development of the ICT sector. The rapid technological advances in telecommunications, information technology and broadcasting as well as the convergence of technologies, services and delivery platforms have made it necessary for countries in both the developed and developing countries to create and operate in an open, dynamic and responsive legal and regulatory framework to support the development of ICTs. Therefore, this scenario has created great challenges to regulators especially in telecommunications and broadcasting sub- sectors worldwide; however, reforms are now in place to support convergence with a view to streamlining regulatory frameworks. The current legal and regulatory framework is perceived to be inadequate in addressing the current market challenges. Therefore, periodic review of the operations, provisions and directives making up the legal and regulatory system is key to achieving positive ICT sector reforms in order to accommodate changes including convergence in the industry. 6.12.1 POLICY GOAL To develop appropriate institutional, legal and regulatory system in order to support the development of a competitive local ICT sector based on convergence principles; supported by fair, predictable, and transparent legal and regulatory framework. 6.12.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: (a) Implement a legal and regulatory system with special focus on: sustained inflow of local and foreign investment, investor and consumer confidence; and fair competition among market players; DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 49 (b) Implement a flexible and dynamic technology-neutral legal/regulatory and licensing framework that restricts regulation to the barest minimum; takes into account and reflects issues relating to convergence within the sector; reinforces innovation, competition and fair play in the industry as well as ensure that the basic rights, choices and preference of consumers are protected; and that the principle of equitable universal access and service are reinforced; (c) Put in place mechanisms for open and transparent dialogue/interaction among policy makers, the regulator and operators; as well as other stakeholders such as investors and consumers; (d) Put in place relevant and effective laws and regulations aimed at: promoting private sector confidence and participation; adherence to national, regional and international standards and best practices; promoting professionalism in the industry; protecting intellectual property rights in conformity with national, regional and international practices; creating specific laws to support E- Services and inhibit misuse of ICTs; enhance the performance of the justice system to mitigate crimes and offences arising from the misuse of ICTs; (e) Create an ICT tribunal designed to address only appeal cases arising from rulings or directives of the Regulator as the first line of dispute resolution among parties in the sector; (f) Promote the development of a licensing framework that takes into account the use of cost-effective technologies and systems that can assist in increasing access to ICTs especially in rural areas. 6.12.3 OBJECTIVES a) To facilitate the development of an effective, industry-responsive, timely legal and regulatory system capable of supporting the development and growth of the ICT sector; b) To establish a legal and regulatory framework that is harmonised with national legal and regulatory goals taking into account regional and international best practices, standards/protocols and Zambia s global commitments; c) To facilitate Zambia s full participation in the information society and economy, through the enactment of necessary laws and legislative provisions in area such as data/information protection and security, access to information; computer and cyber crimes; and other laws to facilitate electronic information- related activities in the country DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 50 including E-Government/E-Commerce. 6.12.4 STRATEGIES a) Develop harmonised laws and regulations for the ICT sector that incorporate international best practice and Zambia s obligations/commitments at SADC, COMESA, NEPAD and WSIS level; b) Create a clear framework/forum for dialogue/interaction with market players, stakeholders and consumers; c) Promote technology-neutral legal and regulatory framework that also accommodate issues pertaining to the convergence of technologies and services within the context of local and global communications industry; d) Put in place legal and regulatory provisions that ensure that consumer choice and affordability of services is paramount while ensuring that consumer interests and protection are adequately addressed; e) Promote and facilitate the creation of a sound investor friendly legal and regulatory environment to encourage local and foreign direct investment in the sector; f) Facilitate and promote universal service and access to information and communication services in under-served areas and communities by making access to Services affordable to a larger section of the population ; g) Build institutional capacity for ICT policy makers, regulator, operators and consumers alike to effectively manage the ICT industry.

Zambia like most countries in the world is vulnerable to some of the negative implications that may hinder the mainstreaming of ICTs in society. Therefore, specific security measures and mechanisms to ensure the safety of citizens, communities, businesses and the nation at large are needed as part of implementing this policy. 6.13.1 POLICY GOAL To safeguard national, institutional and individual security concerns to support the development, deployment and effective use of ICTs within the Zambian economy and society at large. 6.13.2 COMMITMENTS In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall; (a) Establish a Computer Crimes Investigation Unit for cyber law enforcement and the National Electronic communication Security Centre within the internal organs of specialised security agencies to safeguard information and communication infrastructure, networks and systems as part of the reform process to: ensure the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of Government, public and private communication networks and systems; data and information content integrity; consumer privacy and protection as well as address security issues aimed at damaging or corrupting Zambia s cultural heritage, national image and identity; (b) Compel all organisations providing public information services such as telecommunication services, Internet, email to deliberately incorporate administrative, technological and other such practical measures to enable national security agencies to curb misuse and unsolicited content and/or information products to their customers and the general public.

The country has to address the implementation of this policy and mainstreaming of ICTs amid strong competition for limited financial resources from other sectors. Therefore, the successful achievement of the ICT for Development ( ICT4D) policy goals and objectives depend on an integrated and wholesome approach during implementation underpinned by developing strategic synergies and partnerships between the public and private sector as well as civil society. This implies that clear definition of the roles, responsibilities and functions of all the stakeholders must be made. Developing this mutual understanding requires a deliberate and open process of broad-based consultations and participation among all major stakeholders to define the role of ICTs in various sectors. Apart from the Government having the responsibility to create the right policy environment to accelerate the nation s development through ICTs, the private sector and other key stakeholders like parliament, civil society, academia, media and legal/regulatory agencies as well as the cooperating partners also have key roles to play in order to facilitate the successful implementation of the provisions of this ICT4D policy. 7.1 STAKEHOLDER ROLES Within Government the following policy making institutions are important in creating a favourable institutional framework that will improve policy formulation, coordination and implementation. Currently, the mandate for ICT portfolio lies in the Ministry of Communications and Transport; however, in so doing the following portfolios are key in defining the required institutional framework. Finance and National Planning The Ministry of Finance and National Planning represents Government as the Shareholder in most Government owned business ventures such as parastatals. The coordination of planning activities as well as resource mobilisation and allocation in the country also falls under the same portfolio. Therefore, any efforts aimed at integrating ICT in national development requires the active participation of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. Telecommunications The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT) is currently overseeing the activities of ZAMTEL, CAZ (the existing regulator) and ZAMPOST; other institutions with significant telecommunications/communications component include TAZARA, Zambia Railways, National Airports Corporation. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 55 Electronic Media The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services (MIBS) oversees the operations of ZNBC, Zambia Daily Mail and Times of Zambia. However, the Independent Broadcasting Authority is soon to operate as a regulator in this sub-sector. Therefore, convergence principles adopted in this policy need to harmonise with proposed regulatory functions in the broadcasting sub-sector as a matter of priority. Science & Technology The Ministry of Science, Technology and Vocational Training (MSTVT) is currently overseeing the activities of vocational training in science and technology as well as overseeing certain research institutions in the country. TEVETA - the standards and training regulator, which is a body corporate under MSTVT, oversees the operations of organisations involved in human resource development including some institutions offering ICT training in the country. However, this does not include courses/training offered by Universities. Education The above institutions are critical in forming the core group for coordinating policy on ICTs. Therefore, the successful implementation of this policy requires active participation of all stakeholders. Specifically, the roles of the following stakeholders are recognised: 7.2 GOVERNMENT The single most important role for Government is to provide political and economic will, vision and leadership to facilitate and drive the ICT for Development process in order to speed up the development of Zambia s information society. In this way, Government shall set a positive national tone and sense of urgency in a way no other stakeholder can. In view of the above, Government is duty-bound to provide an enabling political, investment, institutional and legal/regulatory environment to guide the effective participation of other stakeholders. Therefore, the political leadership in the country takes centre stage in implementing a coherent national strategy for utilising ICTs as a matter of top priority. In this regard, Government shall: a) Provide visionary and catalysing leadership at the highest level of Government to Support the implementation of the National ICT Policy; the Ministry responsible for the ICT portfolio shall provide guidance in policy formulation, review and target setting in the area of ICT; b) Become the model user of ICTs as part of an ambitious program to drive E-Services development; and in particular the development of E- Government in Zambia . DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 56 c) Develop and implement rolling sector-based ICT4D Implementation/Action Plans to mainstream the provisions of the policy in National Development Plans and other strategic frameworks; d) Mainstream ICT programmes and projects in all sectors and ensure that this reflects in the national budget as means of commitment to Government; resource mobilisation, especially for programmes targeted at E- Government; e) Establish the Department of Communications (DoC) in the Ministry responsible for the ICT Portfolio to oversee policy development and coordinate the implementation of the policy. The main function of the Department of Communications is to coordinate and support the development of the ICT sector through advocacy and mainstreaming of ICTs in the national planning system and development agenda; focusing on sectoral application of ICTs and increasing individual, community, business and national level benefits and opportunities arising from the implementation of the National ICT Policy. Specifically, the DoC shall perform the following functions. i. Ensure the achievement of the country s ICT vision by advising Government on ICT matters relating to overall sector performance, policy reforms as well as regional and international trends that have impact on Zambia; ii. Coordinate ICT activities involving Public sector, Private Sector, Civil Society and Cooperating Partners at all levels; iii. Coordinate the development of National ICT Implementation Plans and assist in resource mobilisation for implementing the National ICT Policy; iv.

Adequately and effectively represent Zambia at regional and international level on all matters relating to ICTs. g) Position the Communications Authority of Zambia to regulate the ICT sector with clear specifications of responsibilities and powers, taking into account the relevance and functions of other existing regulatory agencies (where applicable) in sub- sectors including telecommunications, Information Technology, Broadcasting and Postal services to ensure a smooth transition to full convergence. However, care shall be taken to ensure minimal industry disruption and policy conflicts; h) Restructure and transform the Centralised Computer Services Department into a Centre of Excellence for E-Government implementation with appropriate institutional powers and linkages within the public sector; i) Mobilise and encourage Cooperating Partners to mainstream ICTs in all country programmes and projects as part of the crusade to accelerate the development and creation of an information society; 7.3 PARLIAMENT The liberalisation of the telecommunications, postal and broadcasting sectors worldwide has opened new requirements for transparent and effective legal and regulatory instruments to govern the sub- sectors. Therefore, the role of Parliament in the effective implementation of this policy shall include among others: a) Enacting appropriate and effective legislations that will create a flexible, dynamic and responsive legal and regulatory system in the sector to support the development of an information society; b) Creation of legal framework to support the establishment of policy, coordinating and implementation institutions and the amendment of relevant legislative provisions to facilitate the creation of a dynamic regulatory agency with the capacity to respond to technological advances as well as changes in the global communications industry ; c) Facilitate the allocation and approval of financial resources for mplementation of the ICT Policy in the public sector; d) Monitor the effective utilisation of financial resources allocated to public sector institutions for the implementation of the ICT Policy; e) Ensuring that good governance principles are applied and adhered to in the implementation of the National ICT Policy by public sector institutions. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 58 7.4 JUDICIARY The proliferation and penetration of ICTs across the country comes with potential misuse resulting in negative impacts to the nation, businesses and individuals. Therefore, the Judiciary is expected among other things to: (a) Assist in the delivery of justice to support the performance and growth of the ICT sector; (b) Implement ICT projects that can accelerate the delivery of justice to the benefit of all Zambians; (c) Build human resource capacity within the Judiciary system to support the growth of legal framework on ICTs; (d) Support the growth of regulatory processes especially in dispute resolution within the ICT sector. 7.5 CO-OPERATING PARTNERS Zambia s cooperating partners fall in the category of either multilateral or bilateral. Therefore, their participation in the promotion, integration and deployment of ICTs in country programmes is very essential. Access to information and knowledge resources through ICTs is now widely recognised as a vital component in accelerating social and economic development, especially for developing countries like Zambia. Today, the concept of ICT for Development is a priority agenda item in country programmes of many international organizations and development agencies. Therefore, Government shall work closely with cooperating partners involved in sustainable development programmes to undertake the following initiatives: a) Mobilise technical and financial resources to support the implementation of this policy; b) Integrate ICTs in development cooperation (country support programmes) in Zambia; c) Mobilise the support of other partners in fundamental areas of education, infrastructure and universal access, health, governance, scientific research, commerce, etc to participate in implementing this policy; d) Facilitate the setting up of links and relationships between national academic and research institutions and similar institutions abroad; e) Support the effective participation of Zambia in international fora concerned with ICTs; and f) Promote and encourage investment in ICT through Foreign Direct Investment, ICT Expos etc. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 59 7.6 REGULATOR A key provision of this Policy is to transform the existing regulatory agencies in the communications sector into a converged regulatory agency whose roles and responsibilities recognise and takes into account the rapid changes and developments in the local, regional and global communications industry. However, the implementation process shall take due regard of specific sub-sector demands so as to minimise policy, legal and regulatory conflicts as well as industry disturbances. Therefore, a phased approach to this vision shall be implemented in order to secure a smooth transition to a converged regulator. In implementing the above provision at the legal/regulatory level, the following laws among others may require repealing or amendment as the case may apply; a) Telecommunications Act of 1994 and its regulations b) Radio Communications Act of 1994 and its regulations c) Independent Broadcasting Act of 2002 and its regulations In line with Government s commitment to developing and promoting the implementation of an open, fair and flexible regulatory system, the roles and responsibilities prescribed for National Communications Regulatory Authorities as defined in the SADC and COMESA ICT Policy Guidelines shall form the basis for operationalisation of the regulatory framework. Therefore, the broad responsibilities of the regulator shall be to: (a) Ensure universal access with regard to basic communication services and universal service with regard to basic and advanced information services; (b) Ensure the provision of affordable, adequate, high quality and cost- effective ICT services that meet the diverse needs of consumers in order to promote economic growth and social development; (c) Facilitate the development of a seamless national, regional an international ICT infrastructure connectivity; and (d) Manage the Internet Governance including CLTD (.ZM) as a national resource; undertake domain name registration and assign the frequency spectrum to operators/services providers in the ICT sector.

The private sector is expected among other things: to serve as the key driver for the development of the Zambian economy by providing domestic and foreign investments in ICT services and infrastructure development; and facilitate the mobilisation of funding/ investments to implement ICT initiatives outlined in this policy. Other roles envisaged for the private sector include: a) Working closely with the Department of Communications to develop implementation plans and strategies for private sector and civil society participation in the policy implementation process; b) Supporting and participating in innovative and productive ways of establishing a competitive local ICT industry so as to guarantee Zambia s effective participation in the global economy; c) Taking advantage of business opportunities resulting from the implementation of information society initiatives at SADC, COMESA, NEPAD, and WSIS levels; d) Supporting the development of the nation s human resources including promoting private sector investment in education as well as in R&D; e) Developing local capability for manufacturing of ICT products; and creating innovative services for local and export markets; f) Investing in ICT projects for rural and underserved urban areas as well as traditionally disadvantaged areas; g) Active participation in policy formulation, implementation and review process on an on- going basis. DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 61 7.8 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION & LOCAL AUTHORITIES Information plays an important role in the governance (decentralisation of power) process of the country. In this regard, access to information, ICT tools and services form the backbone for governance and citizens participation in national, regional and global affairs. Therefore, provincial and district administrations in collaboration with the Department of Communications shall work closely with Central Government, private sector, civil society and other partners to implement this policy. In this regard, provincial and district administration as well as local authorities are expected to: a) Deploy and use ICTs in improving citizens participation in national planning and civic matters including Governance systems using ICTs; b) Implement information dissemination and development planning information systems c) Attract local initiatives aimed at promoting investments in Community Radio stations, Internet, Computerisation, ICT literacy training etc; d) Use ICTs to undertake investment promotion activities in various local authorities; and to jump-start the implementation of the decentralisation process through ICTs; e) Develop Public-Private Partnerships to implement ICT programmes; f) Mainstream and develop ICT Strategies and Implementation plans in liaison with the Department of Communications. 7.9 TERTIARY AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS In close collaboration with private sector, civil society, Department of Communications and other partners; the nation s colleges, universities and research institutions shall play a significant role in implementing this policy by: a) Expanding and consolidating the use of ICTs in scientific research and development (R&D) initiatives; b) Developing the nation s critical human and technical expertise as well as its scientific and industrial research capacity; c) Active participation in fundamental, applied and cutting-edge ICT-related industrial and scientific research as well as applying the results to facilitate Zambia s development; d) Mainstreaming the teaching of ICTs in all aspects of the education and training curricula of universities and colleges; e) Deploying and exploiting ICTs to extend scientific and research facilities and increase access to higher education; f) Assuming leadership in testing new technologies and to recommend to Government, the private sector and society in general on the appropriate DocumentsPDF Complete Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features Unlimited Pages 62 actions to be taken; g) Creating Centres of Excellence with specialised and multi-disciplinary research teams on ICTs; h) Publishing and disseminating the results of research and experimentation, both by traditional and new ICT tools, especially the Internet. 7.10 CIVIL SOCIETY Government recognises the important role that civil society (represented by traditional leadership, non-governmental and professional organisations, unions, community-based organisations, individuals etc.) play in the social and economic development of the country. Civil Society is a fundamental element in the preservation of human development and consolidation of governance systems. The challenges that face civil society in this area are related to: low literacy levels especially in the rural areas and the underserved poor urban communities; inadequate telecommunication facilities, electricity and road network infrastructure and the weak institutional coordination mechanisms. Therefore, civil society is encouraged to undertake the following initiatives in coordination with the Department of Communications, private sector and other partners: a) Exploit the potential of ICTs in the development of society, dissemination of information and knowledge; b) Use ICTs as a vehicle for the transmission and dissemination of information in development programmes; c) Incorporate an ICT component in community development programmes, and in programmes supported by international organisations; d) Create institutional mechanisms (NGOs, CBOs etc) to spearhead ICT awareness including implementation of projects at national and community levels; e) Monitor and evaluate the performance of the ICT sector in achieving developmental goals especially in community based initiatives; f) Assist in capacity building of ICT awareness and literacy programmes in the Country.

Box 50065 Fairley Road Lusaka                   April, 2006  Supported by United Nations Development Programme National Information & Communication Technology Policy  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm Administrator Note    ii  FOREWORD  The world has embraced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabler of social and economic development.  The industry is growing very fast and making significant contribution to global trade and investment.  ICT is receiving focus at various fora as demonstrated by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).  Both initiatives have resulted in the promotion of information and knowledge based society as the basis for creating wealth. An opportunity has arisen for Zambia to join the global village by connecting commerce and trade.  This policy sets the framework for Zambia s participation in the global economy.  At the national level, the importance of ICT in national development is demonstrated by the approval of the ICT Policy and the inclusion of ICT as a priority sector in the Fifth National Development Plan 2006-2010. This Policy is designed on thirteen pillars namely as follows:-  * Human Resource Development; * Agriculture; * Tourism, Environment & Natural Resources; * Education; *  Health * E-Commerce * E-Government * Youth and Women * Legal & Regulatory Framework * Security in Information Society * Access, Media, Content and Culture * ICT Services  A challenge has now arisen for the country to implement this policy and I therefore call upon all stakeholders to rise to this challenge.  This Policy shall be Government-led and it is the intention of Government to involve the private sector in its implementation through the Public-Private Partnerships. This partnership is especially important for mobilizing resources for infrastructure development.  At the operational level, it is expected that all ministries, institutions and  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   iii  organizations shall take the National ICT Policy as a guiding document to assist in developing sector-specific ICT policies and plans that will allow the application of ICTs in their respective programmes and projects.  To demonstrate Government commitment in providing leadership, Cabinet approved the creation of the Department of Communications in the Ministry of Communications and Transport which will coordinate and oversee the implementation of this policy.  Now that the first milestone of developing the national ICT policy has  been achieved, I wish to implore co-operating partners to consider ICT as a priority.  Hon. Abel M. Chambeshi, MP. Minister MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT  National Information & Communication Technology Policy  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   iv  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  My Ministry spearheaded the process of formulating the ICT Policy.  To facilitate the process, a National Technical Committee comprising experts with varied experience in research and policy analysis, telecommunications, information technology, media as well as legal and regulatory issues was appointed.  The team was assisted by an international Consultant who was hired on short term basis.  The policy development process started with the holding of a National ICT Policy Symposium on 25th August 2003 at Intercontinental hotel in Lusaka.  The symposium attracted speakers from Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana to share experiences on ICT Policy development.  The National Symposium was preceded by syndicate consultations with stakeholders which resulted in the production of the first draft ICT Policy document.  The draft was launched on 23rd December 2003 and following the launch the document was subjected to further stakeholder meetings through provincial workshops.  This process ended in August 2004.  Thereafter a second draft document was produced and subjected to public scrutiny through internet and print media.  After this process a second national stakeholders workshop a third and final draft document was developed reflecting the final views of stakeholders.  The final draft National ICT Policy document was submitted to the Ministry of Communications and Transport and subsequently to Cabinet Office for approval.  I wish to pay special tribute to institutions that accepted to provide experts to the national technical team, namely:  Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services; Ministry of Science, Technology & Vocational Training; Communications Authority Copperbelt University; University of Zambia; ZAMPOST; ZAMTEL; Bankers Association of Zambia; Computer Association of Zambia; CELTEL; and COMDEV(X) Ltd for website development hoisting and other specialised services offered to the Secretariat.  I also want to acknowledge the efforts of my predecessors for initiating the policy development process and co-operating partners in particular the Japanese Government for the pivotal role they played in financing the policy development process.  Last but not least I would like to thank the UNDP or the financial and technical assistance for policy development through operational and project management support to the TICAD Secretariat in the Ministry of Communications and Transport.  Tribute should also go to the World Bank and USAID who supported specific studies and capacity building to the Ministry respectively.  Finally, I want to thank all the staff in the Ministry who contributed in one way or the other to the successful development of this policy.

One such factor in inequitable access to resources among the citizenry and lack of technology to exploit the vast natural resources available in most countries.  One fundamental difference between the developed and the developing countries is that the former are also rich in information and has a well informed citizenry which is able to adapt quickly to changing social and economic environments, hence utilizing opportunities to overcome development challenges such as poverty.  In this regard, information is treated as a commodity which has potential to make significant changes in many aspects of our social and economic development.  ICTs can be used to bridge the digital divide within the context of globalization.  The digital divide presents barriers by denying an opportunity for the people to take best practices and make them applicable in the possible ways.  Zambia has the opportunity to make a difference by adopting and using ICT as a tool available to reduce the development divide thereby increasing the chances of improving the quality of life of the citizens.  ICT is an enabler to build an information centered society where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge leading to greater productivity, greater competitiveness and sustainable economic growth, a precondition for poverty reduction.  ICTs can also be used as an effective tool in enhancing good governance.  1.1 GLOBAL AND REGIONAL TRENDS AND COMMITMENTS  The developments in telecommunications and information technologies have improved and increased the connectivity between and within countries thereby removing barrier of time and spatial separation.  This in turn has resulted in increased integration of markets, improved commerce and geo-political relations.  At global and regional level, a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the development and use of ICTs have been developed.  The major drivers include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, the Universal Postal Union, the African Union and its specialized agencies such as the African Telecommunications Union, and the Pan African Postal Union, regional economic groupings such as the New Partnership for Africa s Development, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Southern Africa Development Community.  Zambia has participated in a number of global and regional events that are focusing on ICTs as a tool for sustainable growth and development.  Among the notable ones being the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action from the World Summit on the Information Society and the NEPAD E-Africa Commission.  Further the country is committed to the Millelium Development Goals and it is envisaged that ICTs can be harnessed to the achievement of these goals namely:-  i) The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; Ii) Achievement of universal primary education; Iii) Promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   1  Iv) Reduction of child mortality; v) Improvement of maternal health; vi) To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; vii) Ensuring environmental sustainability; and viii) Development of global partnership for the attainment of a more peaceful, just and  Prosperous world.  At the sub-regional level Zambia has been an active player in ICT initiatives under COMESA and SADC.  This policy therefore is influenced by the policy frameworks and principles recommended by the two bodies among them the following:-  I) Increasing market size through inte4gration and cross border trade with ICTs playing an  integral part of the social and economic development of member states;  Ii) Competition among market players in the ICT sector in member states;  Iii) Conveying of regulatory authorities in telecommunications and broadcasting;  Iv) Implementing independent and technology -neutral legal and regulatory frameworks;  v) Independence of market players especially the regulatory functions;  vi) Private sector participation in the development of ICT products and services.  1.2 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF ICTs IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  The Zambian economy has experienced decline since the 1980s due to several factors among them the low productivity in the mining, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The net effect has been increased poverty levels now estimated at over 70 percent of the population living with less than US$1 per day.  To address the economic quagmire Government liberalized the economy in 1991.  This new economic path can be, in part made possible by advances in information and communications technology, which can reduce the cost of and increase the speed of communicating in the country hence abolishing barriers of time and space.  ICT has also made possible the integration of national systems of production and finance. Further ICTs are driving significant changes in both micro and national levels by; increasing effectiveness and reach of development interventions, by enhancing good governance and lowering the cost of the delivery of basic social services.  In the sphere of education for example, ICTs have the potential to improve quality of education and training through e-learning and online learning.

In view of the above the sector needs to be addressed from a holistic point.  The Chapter discusses the current status of ICTs in Zambia and the challenges to be addressed by the policy.  2.1 HUMAN  RESOURCE  DEVELOPMENT  A number of institutions are involved in Education and Training of human resources in ICT programmes ranging from Certificate to Degree courses offering specialised subjects including Computer Science, Telecommunicaztions/Electronics Engineering, Media training/information sciences, Vocational ICT programmes and skills development.  Among the Institutions involved in human resource development in ICTs are the University of Zambia, Copperbelt University, ZAMCOM, ZAMTEL Staff Training College and Evelyn Hone College.  A number of other public and private sector institutions offer various ICT related courses.  Other programmes include Industry Certified (Microsoft, CISCO etc) course and others based on foreign syllabi such as Institute for Management of Information Systems (IMIS) and City & Guilds of the UK.  However, the compatibility of such programmes with the Zambian education curriculum and industry is very limited.  Therefore, an assessment of the requirements and local institutional capabilities shall form the basis for a comprehensive human resource development programme in the country.  Despite the above scenario, Zambia is currently facing a shortfall in critical ICT skills required for developing its information and knowledge economy at managerial, professional and technician levels in order to facilitate the development, deployment and application of ICTs in both the private and the public sector.  Some of the challenges to be addressed include:-  (a)  Law ICT literacy in the country, which is a major obstacle to the development of Zambia s information society;  (b) High cost of technology acquisition, thus making ICT technology and skill development programmes inaccessible to most Zambians;  (c) The Brain Drain  problem, which is resulting in considerable loss of the few skilled personnel from Zambia to other countries in search of better job opportunities;  (d) Limited local ICT industry thus offering inadequate services and few job opportunities;  (e) Lack of standardisation and certification programmes in the IT field resulting in external courses with little localisation to the Zambian education curriculum;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   3  (f) Inadequate institutional capacity among formal training providers to increase  intake and output numbers of ICT graduates. CHAP                      SITUATION ANALYSIS  2.2 EDUCATION, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT  The Zambian education system especiallyinpublic schools is characterised by low ICT adoption rates.  There are over 6,000 public schools out of which very few have ICT subjects as part of the curriculum.  In 1998, the Ministry of Education started an initiative to introduce camputer studies in selected secondary schools.  The results have not been as expected; however, the initiative needs to be encouraged and scales up to all schools.  On the other hand, private schools are promoting ICT literacy though only a small percentage of the pupils are ICT literate by the time they leave secondary school.  A number of research institutions have acquired human capacity to work with ICT tools such as computers.  However, the level of use of ICTs and the outcome of such activities needs to improve.  Holistic approaches to R&D with the support of ICTs need to be put in place. Again, R&D focused on developing products and services for the local  ICT market need to be encouraged.  It is acknowledged that Zambia faces a number of challenges in the educational system. Some of these include:-  (a) General financial and technological resource constraints that the Government faces in its  Effort  to develop and improve the educational system including fforts Directed at integrating ICTs in education;  (b) Inadequate awareness on the benefits of integrating ICTs in the administration of the delivery chain in the education sector;  (c) Lack of coordinated approach in the adoption and implementation of initiatives targeted at the deployment of ICTs within the educational system;  (d) High opportunity cost of deploying ICTs in the educational system - it is difficult to justify  spending scarce and limited resources on ICTs when many institutions are still lacking basic amenities and educational supplies; and  (e) Shortage of teachers with ICT skills to meet the requirements of the schools, thus limiting ICT penetration within the education system.  2.3 PUBLIC ACCESS, MEDIA & CULTURAL HERITAGE  For the majority of Zambians, access to information is mainly by way of physical means such as libraries, postal communications and print media.  However, radio and TV are some of the most popular means of access to information; though tv despite being the most attractive media has very limited coverage across the country.  Equally important, access to information via networked systems such as the Internet and mobile phones is very limited mainly due to non-availability of telecommunications infrastructure and high access costs for many consumers.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   4  Postal and Courier Services Postal  and  Courier  Services  are  mainly  provided  by  ZAMPOST.  The  Corporation covers  the country through a network of about 116 Post Offices, 64 Sub-Post Offices and 55 Postal Agencies.  A large percentage of the 72 districts have an operational post office. In addition, there are private courier services, which are concentrated along the Livingstone-Copperbelt corridor for delivery of parcels. However, some private courier operators now service provincial centres as well.  Telecentres There  are  cafés  and  business  bureaus  offering  telephone,  Email/Internet  access  in major  urban centres  and  a  few  in  rural  towns.  Currently,  there  are  about  300 licensed  telecenters  across  the country by 2004 against 108 in the year 2000. However, a larger percentage is along the line of rail. This  is  mainly  due  to  the relatively  good  telecommunication  infrastructure,  low  capital  and operation costs coupled with the high number of potential customers.  Library Services The  Ministry  of  Education  operates  the  largest  number  of  public  libraries  through the  Zambia Library Service. Currently, there are 6 major public libraries across the country covering at least six of  the  nine  provincial  centres.  The  Copperbelt  University, Mindolo  Ecumenical  Foundation  and UNZA have adequate libraries facilities in comparison to other libraries across the country. Various other  private  libraries  also exist  in  schools  and  colleges  offering  opportunities  for  access  to information. Local authorities mainly run community libraries as part of the public service though most of them need urgent attention.  In  general,  public  libraries  are  in  a  dilapidated  state,  normally  equipped  with outdated  reading materials and are urban centred in most cases. Most of the materials are imported with little local content and knowledge resources.  The process of equipping public libraries managed by the Zambia Library Service with ICT tools including Internet connectivity has started. However, the installed capacity needs to be increased in terms of hardware and Internet bandwidth. The main library at UNZA has reached advanced levels in integrating ICTs as part of the services to the university community and the general public.  On  the  other  hand,  the  national  Archives  is  one  source  of  political,  social  and economic information, particularly historical perspectives about Zambia which forms good background on the geo-political development agenda of the country. Access to such information by the public is very limited both in physical and electronic forms.

Until after the re-introduction of multi-party politics in 1991, radio and TV broadcasting was a preserve of the state, either as a Government department or as a statutory body.   However, the enactment of the following laws to facilitate the liberalisation of the media industry has opened new avenues for radio and TV services across the country:  (a)       Radio Communications Act of 1994 (b)       Independent Broadcasting Authority Act of 2002 (c) ZNBC (Amendment) Act of 2002  The  above  legislation  together  with  the  Zambia  National  Broadcasting  (ZNBC) Act  of  1987  and  the ZNBC   Licensing   Regulations   (1993)   provide   for   the legal   and   regulatory   framework   for   the broadcasting sub-sector in Zambia. The Independent Broadcasting Act also establishes the Independent Broadcasting Authority as the regulator for the broadcasting sub-sector. However, the regulatory agency is not yet functional.  Since 1994, Zambia has made significant advances in liberalising the airwaves thus allowing private sector participation in the sub-sector.  This has resulted in the opening of a number of commercial and  community  radio  stations.  There  is  at  least  one  (1) community  radio  station  and  ZNBC  FM Transmission in each province.  Three  TV broadcasting  stations  are  operational,  namely; ZNBC, Trinity Broadcasting and Muvi TV. On the other hand MultiChoice Zambia, part of the pan- African pay TV Company is providing subscription based Satellite TV services across the country while CASAT also provides pay cable TV services in Lusaka.  On  the  other  front,  the  convergence  of technologies  and  markets  has  created  opportunities  such  as Internet  radio broadcasting,  which  is  becoming  popular  among  local  commercial  radio  stations thus reaching the entire world with very minimum costs. While this situation expands opportunities in the ICT sector, the current regulatory framework in telecommunications and broadcasting sub-sectors are slowly becoming inadequate in addressing new challenges arising from convergence of services.  Some of the challenges include: (a) Non-availability of ICT tools and services especially in rural and underserved  urban areas; (b) High cost of access to ICT tools and services whenever available; (c) Inadequate local content to support cultural promotion and traditional Knowledge             development; (d) Limited coverage of electronic media across the country; (e) The  role of  ZNBC as the national broadcaster  with respect to information  delivery  to  the General  public  amidst  liberalised  airwaves  needs  clarity  to ensure,  responsibilities and equity;  (f) The regulation of Internet Telephony (VoIP) and Broadcasting amidst the  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   6  proliferation  of Multimedia technologies and Internet.  2.4 ICT SECTOR  The  ICT  sector  is  represented  by  a  four-tier  system,  namely  policymaking,  legal and  regulatory framework, operators and consumers (end users).  Policy Making The Policy making machinery in the country is an important component shaping the ICT industry. Given the crosscutting nature of ICT, all line ministries, legislators, traditional leaders, co-operating partners, public sector, private sector, civil society and individuals are key stakeholders to the policy making process. However, with respect to the ICT Portfolio, the Ministry of Communications and Transport  is  charged  with  the responsibility  of  setting  the  policy  direction  for  the  industry  and country at large taking into account stakeholder views. Therefore, a clear policy framework is the foundation for the development of ICTs in the country.  Legal and Regulatory Framework The  responsibility  for  development  of  the  legal  framework  for  the  sector  lies  in the  ministry  in charge of the ICT portfolio supported by the ministry responsible for the Justice portfolio and the legislature  (Parliament).  However,  another  important component  in  the  process  is  the  regulatory function  in  the  sector.  Currently,  the Communications  Authority  of  Zambia  and  the  Ministry  of Information and Broadcasting Services carry the  regulatory functions in Telecommunications and Broadcasting  sub-sectors  respectively.  With  the  enactment  of  the  IBA  Act,  on Independent Broadcasting Authority will assume the responsibility of regulating the broadcasting sub-sector.  Operators At the operator level, the major players can be classified as follows;  (a)   Telecommunications Services The telecommunications   sub-sector   is   composed   of   traditional   fixed telephony   and   mobile communications based on the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication standard.  Another category in this area includes Internet Service Providers. Equipment installation and other services is a small component of the sub-sector.  (b)  Information Technology  This  category  comprises  businesses  involved  in  office  automation  and networking  solutions  such  as supply   and   installation   of   computers   and networks,   system   vending,   end   user   training   and distributorship. Over the years, the number of projects in this category has increased. However, foreign companies  carry  much  of  the  substantial  works  leaving  local  companies  to provide  very limited services to clients.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   7  (c)  Postal Services  ZAMPOST is the major player in this category. However, a number of private sector competitors have entered the market especially in the courier business. Due to the introduction of technologies such as Internet on the market, the letter-based system has registered a downward trend over time. However, given the potential of E-Commerce in the country due to increased Internet use; there is great potential  for the postal system to contribute significantly to E-Commerce penetration in the country. Therefore, re- engineering of the sub-sector is required to fit the new business environment.  (d)  Broadcasting Services  Radio and TV form the key components of the sub-sector. The traditional approach to broadcasting has changed significantly over the years. Satellite and Internet technologies have created new opportunities and challenges for policy makers, broadcasters and regulators. This requires a lot of ingenuity given the not-so-clear separation  of  Radio/TV  and  Telecommunications  services  in  the  current scenario  where technology  and  market  convergence  are  driving  diverse industries  to  merge.  Currently,  electronic content  can  be  carried  irrespective of  the  technology  whether  it  is  radio/TV  or  telecommunications transmission networks. Therefore, this situation is changing the legal and regulatory framework required to administer the sub-sector.  Consumers The consumers of products and services form an important component of the sector. These include end users, dealers in consumer electronics, consumer associations and corporate customers.  A number of factors have been identified as inhibiting the growth of the local ICT industry. Among the key factors affecting the growth of a vibrant private sector-driven ICT sector are: (a) Many industry players consider the current investment regime (incentives and  taxes) to be unattractive  for  recapitalisation  and  new  investments  in telecommunications,  broadcasting and Information Technology subs-sectors;  (b) Lack  of  access  to  affordable  capital  among  Zambian  entrepreneurs  in  the ICT  industry; especially start-up capital for SMEs in the sector;  (c) High import tariffs and taxes imposed on ICT products and services are regarded as having a negative impact on the expansion of the ICT sector, this is despite the reduction of duty on computers from 15 to 5% in the 2004 budget;  (d) Inadequate supporting infrastructure development such as roads, telecommunications, and electric power to increase the demand for ICT services;  (e) Poor coordination of the ICT sector resulting in the inability to attract adequate domestic and foreign direct investment;  (f) Lack of a coordinated industry voice on business matters affecting the sector; and (g) Limited regulatory powers amidst convergence of services.  Information  Technology is not regulated despite forming a key component of the ICT sector.

However, over time the infrastructure capacity has deteriorated due to technology changes and system inadequacies.  In 1994, Parliament enacted the Telecommunications Act, which resulted in the restructuring of the telecommunications  sub-sector  by  separating  the  posts  and telecommunications  functions  in  the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) into two commercial entities:  ZAMTEL and ZAMPOST.  In  addition,  this  included  the removal  of   regulatory  functions  from  PTC;  thus resulting in the establishment of an autonomous regulatory agency, the Communications Authority of Zambia (CAZ).  In addition, the Radio Communications Act of 1994 gives CAZ the responsibility of administering the  utilisation  of  the  Radio  Frequency  Spectrum,  an  important component  in  the  effective performance of the telecommunications and broadcasting sub-sectors.  The liberalisation opened up the market to other competitors in almost all segments of the entire telecommunications industry apart from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the International Gateway. ZAMTEL maintains monopoly in the PSTN market while efforts have been made to liberalise the International Gateway component.  Public Switched Telephone Network ZAMTEL, a 100% state-owned company is the only provider allowed to operate a public switched telephone network (PSTN) in Zambia. It provides a wide range of services including local, national, long  distance,  and  international  fixed  telephone  services, domestic  satellite  telephone  (Domsat), mobile telephone, and leased line services. ZAMTEL Internet service was commissioned in May 1997.  The transmission network is predominantly analogue and is mainly based on microwave technology. A number of microwave trunk routes carry traffic to major provincial centres. However, a digital microwave network linking Lusaka to Copperbelt province, Eastern province and Siavonga has been commissioned.  A  digital  backbone  linking  Lusaka  and Livingstone  is  being  installed  as  part  of ZAMTEL s  network  upgrade.  Traffic  to medium  sized  towns  and  rural  areas  is  carried  via microwave links that also provide interconnection with neighbouring countries where applicable.  The  installed  capacity  of  fixed  telephone  lines  is  about  90,000  but  the  demand has  over  time exceeded the available capacity resulting in one of the lowest teledensity in Southern Africa of only 0.9 per 100 people (9 people per 1000 with telephone service) across the country.  Satellite Networks ZAMTEL operates three earth stations forming the International Gateway for links to USA,  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   9  Europe and  Asia;  Mwembeshi  I  was  installed  in  1974,  Mwembeshi  II  in  1987 while  Mwembeshi  III  was completed   in   2002.   Apart   from   telephone   services, all   earth   stations   transmit   and   receive international television via INTELSAT satellite. In recent years, ZAMTEL has also commissioned a Domestic Satellite system to provide telephony services to remote rural areas. Unfortunately, this service has not been extended beyond Sesheke, Sinazongwe and Kaputa, which were commissioned in 1995.  Wireless Local Loop (WLL) ZAMTEL has installed the WLL system to cater for peri-urban communities that are closer to the exchanges but cannot be serviced by wireline technology. However, deployment and coverage of the WLL  system  is  very  limited.  ZAMTEL  is  currently  conducting  a gradual  replacement  of  the analogue WLL system with digital technology, mainly in urban areas along the line of rail.  National Fibre Optic Backbone Unlike  neighbouring  countries  which  have  made  substantial  investments  in telecommunications infrastructure,   Zambia   lacks   a   modern   fibre   optic   backbone for   national   and   regional interconnection, despite the fact that fibre is terminating at Zambia s borders: Zimbabwe at Kariba, Botswana at Kazungula and Namibia at Katima Mulilo. The Copperbelt Energy Company (CEC) has  installed  a  24-core  520km  fibre optic  backbone  on  the  Copperbelt,  whose  excess  capacity  is available for resale to potential users. On the other hand, ZESCO has already installed a 45km fibre optic cable between Lusaka and Kafue. It is desirable that a national network covering the entire country will be developed taking advantage of existing infrastructure such as electricity powerlines as a means of quick rollout of the network (using powerline technology, about 3,500km of fibre optic cabling is needed to cover the country up to provincial level).  In order to leapfrog the existing capacity and technology requirements for overhauling the existing telecommunications  infrastructure,  thereby  laying  a  solid  foundation  for delivering  current  and future services ranging from digital radio, TV, Internet, data and other multimedia services, Fibre  based  technology  provides  a  comprehensive  and reliable  network  for  the  country.  The possibility  of  reducing  telephone  and  Internet costs  can  be  achieved  by  interconnecting  the proposed national Fibre Optic network to the under-sea cable running along the African coast (west and east) connecting to Europe and Asia; some of the most active communication destinations for Zambia.  However, this requires implementation modalities in terms of network licensing, access conditions, management and operation of the backbone in the most optimal and beneficial manner to the entire country.  Mobile Phone Services The CAZ has licensed three mobile cellular service providers by 2004 from one (01) in 1996, namely ZAMTEL  operating  as  CELL  ,  TELECEL (now acquired by MTN group) and  CELTEL  (formerly  ZAMCELL)  and  is considering the entrance of a fourth mobile  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   10  operator on the market.  One  of  the  results  of  the  liberalisation  of  the  telecommunications  sub-sector  has been  the accelerated development of mobile telephony. The most evident market difference between mobile and fixed line services is that, worldwide, mobile communications is growing much more rapidly in rollout and access. In 2002, few years after introduction of mobile communication in Zambia, the number of mobile subscribers surpassed the fixed-line (ZAMTEL) subscribers and is still growing for the following reasons: a) There is unfulfilled demand for service in both urban and rural areas; b)    Mobile networks can be installed more rapidly than fixed lines; c)  Pre-paid mobile cellular service allows users to obtain services where they may   not normally qualify for a fixed or mobile post-paid service because of their low  or irregular income and/or lack of  fixed-abode;  d)       Users find the functionality of mobile phones extremely useful; compared to  fixed Lines; and  e)      Mobile technology infrastructure is less susceptible to vandalism  The current combined subscriber base on the mobile networks stands at about 450,000 in just 5-8 years surpassing 90,000 fixed line subscribers that have been achieved over many years. However, the majority of the subscribers are along the line of rail. Currently all provincial centres are covered by at least one of the cellular network providers. On the other hand, fixed line growth is expected to slow down in the near future mainly due to the flexibility  and  convenience  of  mobile  communication.  However,  the  source  of future  growth  for fixed  lines  will  be  due  to  the  demand  for  faster  and  cheaper Internet  access.  Organisations  and individuals may increasingly opt for mobile phones and retain fixed-line primarily for Internet access and other value-added services. This may only happen when mass-market broadband technologies take root in the country.  Internet Service Providers Zambia  is  the  pioneer  of  Internet  in  Sub-Sahara  Africa  outside  South  Africa  in the  early  90s. However, this advantage has not been exploited in that the country now lags behind many African countries that started Internet services just a few years ago.  However, the Internet sub-sector is fully liberalised and is one of the most competitive in the ICT services industry in Zambia. The CAZ has so far licensed a number of players out of which six (6) are operational by 2004 from two (02) in 1996.  The  Internet  market  in  Zambia  is  still  developing with approximately 12,000 Internet subscribers and an additional 30,000 Internet users mainly patronising Internet cafes. However, the potential for rapid  growth  is  undermined  by  inadequate telecommunication  infrastructure  development  across the country, poor telephony accessibility and high access costs.  Though there are no market entry restrictions for new ISPs, the licensing fee has proven prohibitive to  many  Zambians.  Secondly,  the  limit  on  foreign  shareholding  for  ISPs  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   11  and  other  similar  value- added licenses is inhibiting most Zambians to enter the market due to inadequate access to start-up capital (financing) for such ventures. This has negated the benefits of the shareholding requirement though well intended to ensure that as many Zambians as possible are empowered as entrepreneurs in the sector.  Private Data Networks The provision of private data networks has been liberalised and is fully competitive. The financial sector leads the private data network segment. Most banks and other financial institutions involved in tax revenue collection and pension funds have set-up their own VSAT data network solutions linking  branches  across  the  country;  this  includes national  and  international  links  in  the  case  of international banks. However, VSAT technology has proved much more expensive in the long term especially  with  respect  to space  segment  costs  paid  to  foreign  operators/service  providers.  The introduction of these technologies in Zambia has tremendously improved the delivery of financial services,  with  cash  withdrawal  facilities  including  international  credit/debit  cards such  as VISA offered on the market. On the other hand, Internet Banking has just been introduced as some of the innovative services on the market. Such services will require reliable and cost-effective transmission and  access  technologies  thus  helping  spread banking  services  to  rural  areas.  On  the  other  hand, Virtual Private Network (VPN) licenses have increased from one (01) in 1996 to fifteen (15) in 2004.  Other Supporting Infrastructure Telecommunication infrastructure alone cannot be cost-effective if it is delivered in isolation. Given the high cost of deploying telecommunications infrastructure such as Fibre Optic, there is need to have a holistic approach to social and economic infrastructure development strategy in the country.  The development of road networks and rural electrification schemes play a complimentary role in attracting telecommunication rollout. The existence of roads and electric power whether via grid or off-grid (using renewable/non-renewable) technology can increase the uptake of ICT tools such as computers,  TV,  radio  etc.  This  strategy  is  imperative for  schools  and  clinics  which  are  major growth points  in urban and rural areas. Therefore, the delivery of integrated infrastructure (roads, electricity,  telecommunications) should  be  adopted  as  a  deliberate  measure  during  design  and construction of schools, clinics, farming blocks and resettlement schemes etc. This approach tends to lower the overall cost of delivering infrastructure especially in rural areas and in turn lowers the cost of services to the end user.  Therefore, some of the  challenges  in  the deployment   and   delivery   of telecommunications infrastructure across the country are;  (a) High  technology  acquisition  and  deployment  costs  especially  in  the development  of  the national telecommunications backbone infrastructure;  (b) Limited coverage   and   poor   quality   of   existing   telecommunications   and  Internet  infrastructure in the country;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   12  (c) High cost and limited access to ICT infrastructure incurred by individuals and businesses;  (d) Lack of special incentives for private sector participation in the development,            management and operation of ICT and related infrastructure projects; (e) Monopolies  in  wholesale  and  retail  markets  of  the  telecommunication  services  sub-sector including infrastructure; (f) Duplication  of  communications  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  public  sector  resulting under-utilisation of scarce resources; (g) Lack of universal access/service goals  coupled with lack of a rural  telecommunication infrastructure and service development strategy; (h) Inadequate licensing framework given the convergence in telecommunications and             Broadcasting and the emergence of new services offered by new technologies; (i) Lack of a structured and streamlined Internet governance system in the country;  and (j) Legalising  and  regulation  of  outlawed   but  cost-effective  technologies  such  as  Voice    over  Internet Protocol (VoIP)  2.6 E-GOVERNMENT  Electronic  Government  (E-Government)  is  the  provision  of  Government  products  and services through electronic technologies such as Internet, E-mail, Electronic Document Management Systems, and electronic payment (Financial Management Systems)/service delivery.  Currently, a number of initiatives are being undertaken within the public sector. The number of ICT projects  has  increased  over  the  years  resulting  in  building  blocks  such as  the  Integrated  Financial Management  Information  System  (IFMIS)  Project,  Payroll Management  and  Establishment  Control Project and building of Local Area Networks; these are central to the establishment of E-Government. However, such building blocks are being implemented in the public sector with very little coordination and   integration   with existing   systems   at   operational   level.   In   addition,   over-duplication   of telecommunications  infrastructure  has  resulted  in  inefficient  and  ineffective  projects with  very  little positive impact on the overall development agenda. Some of the challenges in E-Government development include;  (a)       Inadequate and fragmented ICT infrastructure and connectivity within the public sector;  (b) Lack  of  supportive  institutional  framework  to  coordinate  and  promote  E-             Government development; (c) Inadequate manpower in the area of computing and information technology in the             public sector; (d) Concerns about security of information as well as inadequate mechanisms for             information flow within the public sector.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   13  2.7 E-COMMERCE  Electronic  payment  systems  are  the  cornerstone  of  E-Commerce  development  in  the country  by ensuring convenience and flexibility when undertaking commercial transactions and trade. Therefore, the banking  sub-sector  plays  an  important  role  in  the development  of  E-Commerce  solutions.  With  the adoption  of  Internet,  some  of  the financial  institutions  are  already  offering  Internet  banking  and international cash payment via electronic cards such as VISA to customers. Mobile commerce solutions via GSM phones are increasing on the market mainly due to the convenience, flexibility and increase in the use of mobile phones. However, the growth of E-Commerce depends on good telecommunications infrastructure,  effective  legal/regulatory  framework, widespread  use  of  E-Commerce  related  services, awareness creation and development of E-commerce solutions etc.  Some of the challenges in the development of E-Commerce include: (a) Lack of effective ICT infrastructure to support widespread use of E-Commerce            solutions; (b) Inadequate laws and legal system to support E-Commerce; (c) Inadequate innovative solutions from the ICT industry that can promote the spread  of E-Commerce; (d) Lack  of  supportive  and  integrated  investments  in  ICT,  energy  and  other  social infrastructure projects to increase uptake, access and demand for E- Commerce.  2.8 AGRICULTURE  The  National  Agriculture  Information  Service  (NAIS)  is  the  major  information  and communication framework for farmers and other stakeholders in the agriculture sector. However, this channel is limited to radio programmes especially servicing the rural areas. Programmes on TV are proving to be more effective  but  the  limited  coverage  of  the TV  network  across  the  country  has  resulted  in  limited exploitation of the technology. Usage of effective voice communication systems among farmers such as radio  phones as a community service has not been exploited. However, it is desirable that TV, Phones and Internet  should  make  an  impact  as  information/communication  channels  among stakeholders  in the sector.  Some of the challenges in integrating ICTs in Agriculture include: (a) Inadequate channels for information delivery among framers, businesses and  policy           makers; (b) Poor  quality  of  existing  infrastructure  and  high  cost  of  ICT  infrastructure  rollout  thus limiting access to ICT products and services among stakeholders; (c) Limited coverage  of  effective  media  tools  like  radio   and   TV   among  rural   farming communities coupled with high cost and limited energy (electric)  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   14  supply to enhance uptake of ICTs; (d) Inadequate ICT literacy skills  especially in rural areas; and (e) Lack   of   integrated   approach   in   rollout   of   ICTs,   energy   and   other  social   services infrastructure.  2.9 HEALTH  The potential of ICT in contributing to the efficient and effective performance of the health sector is very   high   especially   in remote   diagnosis   and   treatment.   Timely collection,   management   and dissemination of critical information has significant bearing on the performance of the sector in general.  To  this  extent,  the  health  sector  has  embarked  on  reforms  that  include development  of  Health Management Information Systems at various levels. Equally important is the Telemedicine programme being initiated as a deliberate effort to maximise the services provided by the few but highly experienced medical  personnel whose  services  can  only  be  extended  through  technologies  such  as  Telemedicine. Therefore, connectivity of medical institutions to services such as telecommunication and Internet is an important milestone in the use of ICTs in the health sector.  Telemedicine  also  can  be  used  to  provide  both  basic  and  continuous  skills  transfer to  health professionals. This will help mitigate isolation of health professionals in rural areas. The dissemination of  medical  information  through  ICTs  will  facilitate  informed decision-making  particularly  in  hard  to reach areas.  Some of the challenges in integrating ICTs in the health sector include:  (a) The  need  to  improve  ICT  Infrastructure  to  support  basic  communication systems  and specialised applications such as telemedicine;  (b) Inadequate ICT awareness and skills among health professionals to effectively utilise the ICT tools and services;  (c) Inadequate support services for installed ICT equipment especially in rural areas; (d) Incorporating and prioritising ICT in the core business of healthcare delivery.  2.10   TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES  The Zambian travel and tourism industry largely depends on the availability of efficient and effective infrastructure across the country. This infrastructure includes roads, power supply, lodges and airports. Above all, telecommunication plays a vital role in the development of such infrastructure and the overall performance of the sector at national, regional and international levels. Specific ICT services such as mobile communications, broadcasting networks, electronic facilities and services add immense value to the desired performance of the sector.  Zambia s most famous tourist destination, Livingstone, has seen an increase in communication facilities over the years including international roaming  service on major  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   15  GSM networks thus increasing the flexibility  and  convenience  especially  for international  tourists.  Special  attention  is  needed  to  rollout communication  facilities  in other  important  destinations  especially  in  national  parks  as  part  of  a comprehensive  programme  to  upgrade  facilities  in  various  upmarket  tourist destinations.  This  is  so because Zambia will for a long time to come depend on wildlife based tourism. Therefore, ICTs can trigger enormous investments especially in wildlife based tourist destinations and contribute to general improvement of commerce, travel and tour operations.  However, the proliferation of ICT equipment such as computers and other accessories requires special effort   to   mitigate   any   negative   impacts   on   the   environment and   natural   resources.   Therefore, environmental  strategies  need  to  be  adopted  at an  early  stage  in  the  acquisition,  manufacture  and disposal of ICT products.  Notwithstanding the above situation, the industry faces a number of challenges that are constraining the development of the sector and limiting its contribution to national development. Some of these include:  (a)   Limited  and  inadequate  ICT  infrastructure,  which  presents  significant  barriers to  the deployment of value-added ICT services and effective application of ICTs in the sector;  (b) Lack of adequate, reliable, timely and relevant information on tourism products and services including lack of information on tourist destinations available in the country;  (c) Lack   of   proper   ICT   hardware   and   accessory   disposal   mechanisms and/or   recycling technologies.  2.11 YOUTH AND WOMEN  The  value  of  ICTs  is  largely  seen  through  increased  productivity,  more  efficient operations, improved  information  access  and  dissemination;  equitable  participation in  social,  political,  and economic  spheres;  access  to  education  and  health;  and breaking  barriers  of  isolation.  Therefore, successful  diffusion,  application  and  use of  ICTs in  the  development  process  will  depend  on  the involvement of women who are marginalized in society and yet constitute over half (51%) of the Zambian population.  On the other hand, youths constitute a special group capable of using, deploying and taking ICTs into the future. This is even true given that, youths constitute about 60% of the population and are usually the early adopters of ICTs in any given society. It is widely accepted that any development activity that excludes youths and women will not achieve sustainable results.  Information access and dissemination are some of the key empowerment tools for youths  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   16  and women as special groups. Currently, the emergence of GSM (mobile) communications system has increased the level of mobile teleshops  most of which are owned and operated by youths. Therefore, by increasing sustainable  programmes  targeted  at youths  and  women  as  special  groups,  greater  empowerment opportunities can be created.  A rapid survey  conducted  among the youths along the line of rail revealed the following; i)      Using media channels for accessing information, 96% of the youths listen to the radio,   81% read newspapers, 60% read magazines, 51% access the Internet for purposes  other than email; daily usage of the Internet stands at 13% with the majority being  College/University students;  ii)     The purpose for which they access information is diverse; however, the survey reveals         that 53% is for educational opportunities, 52% for sports and 48% for job         opportunities; iii)     About  44%  of  the  youths  own  mobile  phones  which  are  used  primarily  for          voice and sms communication; iv)      Libraries on the other hand are sources of information for 59% of the youths mainly          Associated with school/academic work.   Some of the challenges of ICTs among youths and women are:  (a) Low ICT literacy and skills levels especially among women; (b) Low opportunities for access to ICT products and services; and (c) Entry barriers (financial, skills etc) for youths and women especially as  entrepreneurs.  2.12   LEGAL & REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  In 1994, Parliament enacted the Telecommunications Act, which resulted in the restructuring of the telecommunications sub-sector; removing the posts and telecommunications functions in the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) into two separate commercial entities:  ZAMTEL and ZAMPOST. In  addition,  this  included  the  removal  of  the regulatory  functions  from  PTC  through  the establishment  of  an  autonomous regulatory  agency,  the  Communications  Authority  of  Zambia (CAZ).  On  the  other hand,  the  regulation  of  the  postal  sub-sector  is  still  carriedout  by  the Ministry  of Communications  and  Transport  through  a  Licensing  Committee  comprising  various stakeholders.  Currently, the CAZ is responsible for regulating the provision of telecommunications products and services in the country.   Its   specific   functions   include   issuing   licences and   promoting   competition   amongst providers of telecommunications services and products, promoting the interests of consumers and other users of ICT services/ products as well as ensuring that the benefits of the sector accrue to the nation at large. In addition, the Radio Communications Act of 1994 gives the CAZ responsibility for administering the utilisation of the Radio Frequency Spectrum as a scarce national resource.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   17  This function has impact on the performance of radio and TV broadcasting in the country. However, the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Broadcasting  Services  has  been undertaking  the  regulatory  function until recently. As part of the restructuring in the broadcasting sub-sector, the Independent Broadcasting Authority  Act  of  2002  provides for  regulation  of  broadcasting  outside  the  Ministry.  Therefore,  the functions  of  CAZ and  IBA  in  the  sector  need  to  be  harmonised  taking  into  account  the  already converging telecommunications and broadcasting markets such as internet radio broadcasting and online content publishing.  Some of the challenges that need to be addressed include:  (a) The  regulation  of  converging  technologies,  markets  and  services  within  the context  of compartmentalised regulatory frameworks for telecommunications, broadcasting and other sub-sectors;  (b) Institutional  capacity  to  support  the  regulation  of  dynamic  and  fast technology  oriented market;  (c) Definition  of  clear  roles  and  responsibilities  among  key  players  including policy  makers, regulators and operators;  (d) Addressing  Intellectual  Property  issues  amidst  inadequate  legal  framework on  copyright, trademarks, patents etc;  (e) Inadequate capacity to deal with complex matters such as security of information systems, cyber crime, misuse of ICTs etc.  2.13   SECURITY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY  In  general,  one  of  the  greatest  concerns  in  connected   societies  is  security  of information  passing through networks and systems such as computers, financial transactions, health records etc. As Zambia embraces ICTs, more security concerns and abuse shall arise if no counter measures are put in place.  Already,  Zambia  has  experienced  cases  of  misuse  of  ICTs  especially  with  respect to  corrupting  website content. The proliferation of Internet and other ICT applications will also create opportunities for misuse.  However,  with  measures  such  as implementing  security  policies,  laws  and  technology solutions aimed at securing information, networks and systems, the impact can be mitigated.  Therefore, every effort shall be made to ensure that as the country adopts, implements and uses ICTs in all spheres of life, security measures are put in place to minimise negative impacts on society at large. Specific challenges include:  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   18  (a) Security  of  government,  public  and  private  networks  and  communications systems  in general;  and  in  particular  those  systems  carrying  sensitive  and critical  data/information  of great value to Government, businesses and individuals;  (b) Protection of networks and information systems to guard against various types of malicious crimes and unauthorised access; safeguarding against undermining consumer confidence in online  services  including  those  based  on  E-Commerce, E-Government  and  E-Health systems;  (c) Privacy  of  individuals,  businesses  and  Government  arising  from  connectivity to  local, national and global networks.  2.14   POLICY IMPLEMENTATION  Some of the issues that have contributed to the low ICT uptake and penetration in the country are lack of coordination and leadership in creating the vision for the sector. However, the initiative to develop this policy is the biggest step in creating a clear roadmap/vision for the sector.  Therefore, the success of all the commitments and provisions of this policy depend on how well the implementation  will  be  coordinated.  The  requirements  include  sustainable and  effective  institutional framework, coordination and resource mobilisation. Other challenges include;  (a) Leadership  of  the  national  ICT  portfolio;  and  the  visibility  of  the  National            Champion   for ICTs among the public;  (b) Capacity for Policy formulation/development at various levels of society;  (c) Institutional  framework  and  capacity  for  policy  implementation  at  national,             provincial  and district levels;  (d) Developing clear roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders;  (e) Mainstreaming of ICTs by Cooperating Partners in country programmes; and            reflection of ICT commitment in national budgets;  (f) Inadequate and ineffective legal and regulatory framework;  (g) Inadequate  capacity  to  undertake  ICT  investment  promotion/campaigns  at           national,  regional and international levels.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   19  CHAPTER 3 VISION  The national ICT Policy is aligned to the following vision statement.  A  Zambia transformed into an information and knowledge-based society and economy supported by consistent development of, and pervasive access to ICTs by all citizens by 2030.  3.1  VISION ELEMENTS  In realising the above vision;  (a)      The Government recognises the strategic opportunities and benefits that Information and Communication  Technology  offers  to  accelerate  social  and  economic             development across the country;  (b)      The Government realises that access to information and knowledge are some of the           pre-  requisites  for  wealth  creation  and  for  effective  participation  of              Zambia  in  the   global economy currently dominated by information and     knowledge-based societies;  (c) The  Government  further  recognises the  critical  role  that  a  high  capacity,               reliable and geographically  distributed  telecommunications  backbone    infrastructure  covering the  entire country  can  offer  in  accelerating      ICT               penetration;  providing  access  to    information  and knowledge resources,     domestic and global markets as well as in creation  of empowerment    opportunities for all Zambians;  (d) The  Government  acknowledges the  need  for  integrated  national  planning  in  order to ensure that other sectors of the economy benefit from the               deployment of ICTs as part of   social and economic development;  (e) The Government is aware that the transition from a natural resource to a knowledge -based economy  will  depend  on  visionary  leadership  as  well  as the  availability  of quality  human resource needed to steer the nation into an information society;  (f) The  Government  is  cognisant of  the  global  and  regional  trends  of  the convergence  of technologies, services and products and the resulting impact      In managing the telecommunications, computing, broadcasting, media and postal services sub-sectors;  (g) The  Government  is  fully  aware that  ICTs  alone  cannot  have  an appreciable  impact  on Zambia s development prospects unless the use of ICTs in the society and economy is done within  the  context  of  poverty  reduction  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   20  and  other  programmes  addressing  a  number  of critical  success  factors  at central  and  local  government;  CHAPTER 4  RATIONALE  In broad terms, the development of the National ICT Policy is designed to achieve the following:  (a) Facilitating  the  implementation  of  constitutional  provisions  related  to information and communication             The constitution recognises the Right to Information  as implied in the freedom of expression. The implementation of the above commitment requires a policy framework that underpins access to information.  (b) Creating leadership and vision in the ICT sector The  institutional  framework  in  this  policy  creates  the  visibility  that  ICT deserves  at  the   level  of Government. This is in line with other countries that are reaping the benefits of adopting ICTs as part of the national development strategy; many countries on the African continent are recording success in general and ICTs in particular based on this approach.  (c) Clear definition of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders The National ICT Policy shall adequately address the roles and responsibilities of various   parties  such  as  the  Ministry  responsible  for  the  ICT  portfolio,  the Regulator,  Legislature,  Judiciary, Operators/Service Providers, Public and Private sector as well as Civil Society, Consumers and Individuals.  (d) Support  the  creation  of  adequate  and  effective  sector  legislation  and regulatory framework The current legal and regulatory framework governing the ICT sector is considered inadequate by industry players in addressing concerns mainly because it was drawn without a clear sector policy in place; thus creating room for  speculation  on  key  policy  issues  as  well  as  lack  of  clear  direction  on roles  and  responsibilities. Therefore, the revised legislation will draw its powers from this Policy.  (e) Creating investor confidence in the ICT sector The National ICT Policy sets clear guidelines on the Dos and Don ts  to the local and foreign investors in the sector, especially the private investors thus creating certainty and long-term investor confidence.  (f) Ensuring  coordinated  and  effective  use  of  ICTs  as  an  instrument  for accelerated social and economic development             The digital divide and hence the development divide existing between the developed and developing countries is largely  due  to  economic  differences  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   21  arising  from  technology  utilisation  including  ICTs;  while  developing countries are  still  focused  on  resource  based  economies  ICTs  have  become  economic drivers  in  developed countries. Zambia can benefit from this lesson to break the chain of poverty.  C(g)   Ensuring rational and harmonised application of ICTs and use of scarce     resources  The National ICT Policy establishes the technical, legal and institutional framework that guarantees  not  only  a  rational  and  harmonised  use  of  ICTs for  sustainable  development  but  also  a  more profitable participation of stakeholders in sector and country activities.  (h)  Enhancing Zambia’s competitiveness in the global information society & economy The relevance of any given country in the global economy that is heavily characterised by use of information as a commodity is determined by the effectiveness and efficiency of using ICTs as part of the national development framework. Indeed, information and communication technologies have become, in this information age, the great   common   denominator   of   development projects,   ranging   from   agriculture,   mineral   prospecting, environmental management, education, health, culture, tourism etc.  (i) Creating a positive sector benchmark for cooperating partners Policy reforms in any sector are some of the benchmarks used to guarantee technical and financial assistance by many Cooperating Partners. Therefore, the existence of a sector policy creates not only confidence sector governance issues but also developmental aid flow a key element in resource mobilisation for implementing ICTs in the country.  (j) Creating a framework for addressing and endorsing international commitments Zambia has participated in various activities of the United Nations, AU (NEPAD) and regional bodies such as COMESA and SADC in the area of ICT. Endorsing and implementing the provisions of such declarations and protocols require adequate sector policy framework.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   22  CHAPTER  5  GUIDING PRINCIPLES  The implementation of this Policy shall be guided, among other things by the right of access  to  information,  transparency,  fairness  and  accountability.  The  following  shall also  be  taken  into account as key guiding principles:  (a)        This policy is designed to guide and mainstream the use of ICTs in all sectors of              the economy; hence the policy is an ICT  for  Development  (ICT4D)  policy              designed to fit within the socio-economic development agenda of the country   rather than a stand-alone technology framework;  (b)          In order for this policy to make appreciable impact on Zambia s social and               economic development, the policy goals and objectives shall be integrated  into               the  overall  national developmental  objectives,  priorities  and  programmes               such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme  and  National  Development               Plans. Therefore, all  sectors  are expected to draw their ICT policies from this               framework;  (c)         This  Policy  shall  be  Government-led  and  Private  Sector-driven  during              implementation. Therefore, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) shall form the basis              for implementation especially in matters and projects of national character and              importance;  (d)         Government shall take leadership mainly in facilitating the mobilisation of              investment required for development of a national telecommunications              infrastructure backbone as well as the implementation of this policy; (e)            This policy shall be supported by appropriate legislation aimed at effective                 separation of roles and responsibilities for policy formulation/guidance,                 regulation and operation in   order   to   ensure   transparent   and   effective                 regulatory   functions   based   on convergence principles and establish                 institutional mechanisms for policy implementation;  (f)            The upgrading  of  existing  and  development  of  new  infrastructure such  as                 roads  and  electric power shall also be taken into account as complimentary                 services to      the successful rollout  of  the  telecommunications  infrastructure                 and  ICT       services  in  order  to increase penetration and open new                 investment opportunities across the country;  (g)    Priority shall be given to the establishment of coordination mechanisms at    different levels to  allow  for  integration  of  ICTs  in  key  functions  of    society  in order  to  ensure sustainability of ICT programmes and projects;  (h)      A deliberate and accelerated ICT manpower development policy and implementation plan shall form the basis for human resource development at all  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   23                  levels in the country  (i)      The implementation of this policy shall be supported by intensive and extensive public awareness activities at all levels of society.  This is expected to create demand for ICTs in areas such as training, service provision etc;  (j)  Mainstreaming of cross cutting issues such as Gender, HIV/AIDS and Environment is important and shall apply during implementation, monitoring and review of this policy;  (k)  Empowering special groups in society such as children, youths, women and the  physically challenged shall be considered by providing special incentives to  enable them have appropriate access to ICT tools, opportunities and services;  (l) The implementation of this policy shall take into account relevant regional and global policies and best practices in transforming the nation into an information society targeting the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), WSIS, WTO, NEPAD, E-Schools and Infrastructure programmes, as well as COMESA and SADC initiatives.

Therefore, the availability of public access points, ICT tools, content and services are as important as the information itself in the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to support rural development, community based initiatives and projects in Zambia s developmental effort.  The  Government  appreciates  the  development  of  the  media  and  the  promotion  of local  content development as well as enhancing, and safeguarding Zambia s cultural heritage through the use of ICTs.  Therefore,  efforts  shall  be  directed  at  promoting the  use  of  ICTs  in  rural,  urban  and underserved communities and ensuring that the net effect of the developmental gains resulting from ICTs does have a widespread impact at all levels in both rural and urban areas.  6.3.1 POLICY GOAL  To promote widespread public access to information through appropriate traditional and new technology solutions based on relevant local content while promoting cultural heritage.  6.3.2 COMMITMENTS  in order to reach out and benefit the majority of the Zambian population and improve the penetration of ICTs within society, the Government shall:  (a)          Develop universal access/service goals and strategies for rural               telecommunications, radio and TV transmission infrastructure and service rollout;

The  Zambian ICT  industry  is  hardly  involved  in  the  production  and development of local ICT products resulting in service providers being involved mainly in retailing (supplying imported computer hardware and software as complete systems) of computer products as well as providing basic IT services.  On the other hand the privatisation of ZCCM and restructuring of Zambia Railways has resulted in high  inactivity  in  software  development  centres  operated  under  the above  institutions  before  the privatisation process. This has affected the managerial and professional development capacity in IT services and software engineering in the country.

It is  generally acknowledged that transmission networks for radio, telephone, TV, Internet are the basis for mass- media  development.  This  is  further  enhanced  by associated  physical  infrastructure  such  as  roads, electricity and general utilities. With  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   34  respect to ICTs, lack of a reliable, widely distributed and high capacity  network  for data,  voice  (sound)  and  video  (pictures)  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  low availability and penetration of ICT services as well as costly deployment of basic services especially in rural areas.  This has resulted in inadequate telephone and Internet services; high start up costs for radio (especially community radio stations) and TV broadcasting. The net effect is low information access levels that are affecting citizen s participation in governance issues as well as the high cost of doing business across the country.  6.5.1 POLICY GOAL  To  increase  access  and  promote  widespread  deployment  of  ICT  services  through the expansion of the nation s telecommunications backbone infrastructure covering the whole country.  6.5.2 COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:  (a) Endeavour  to  attain  full  liberalisation  of  all  services  in  the  ICT  sector subject  to regional  and  international  protocols/agreements,  best  practices as  well  as  market readiness;  (b) Put  equitable  and  cost-effective  mechanisms  to  manage  the  country s strategic communication  resources  such  as  the  frequency  spectrum  and Country  Top  Level Domain (CTLD  (.ZM)) in order to allow for the development of modern, effective and efficient communication systems in the country;

and plays an important role in the nation s development process.  Broadly speaking E-Government involves the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to facilitate the process of bringing Government closer to the people through major improvements in the delivery of goods and services as well as information provision in ways that are most convenient to citizens and  other  stakeholders.  The  purpose  of  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   37  transforming  Government  through  ICTs  is  to  realise efficiency  gains,  reduce operational  and  administrative  costs  as  well  as  streamline  government processes and procedures. The Government is aware that the potential benefits that shall be derived from the implementation of E-Government are enormous.  However,  Government  is  also  aware  that  mere  deployment  of  ICTs in  the  public sector  will  not necessarily translate into improvements in service delivery unless appropriate institutional reforms to address the challenges that could hinder or undermine the process of effective implementation of ICTs are addressed.  6.6.1 POLICY GOAL  To improve public sector management as well as efficient and effective delivery of public goods and services through the implementation of E-Government systems.  6.6.2 COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall: -  (a) Develop  an  E-Government  model  to  facilitate  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of goods and services in the public sector;  (b) Support the implementation of the decentralisation process by extensive integration and utilisation of ICTs at all levels;  (c) Develop a Government-wide network and communication system utilising the  same infrastructure backbone as the foundation for implementation of the E-  Government strategy; and  (d) Review  and  establish  reforms   aimed   at   legalising   electronic   procedures  /processes and other forms of E-Services .  6.6.3 OBJECTIVES   a)   To transform Government service delivery and improve two-way       communication   in  the management and operation of the public sector;  b) To improve the operations of Government Ministries/Agencies within the  wider scope of the public sector reform programme through the     deployment of ICTs;   c)       To develop an institutional and coordination mechanism for information  management in the public sector; and     d)       To  safeguard  public  sector  information  and  investment  against  negative  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   38   impacts  of deploying and using ICTs.  6.6.4 STRATEGIES  a)    Develop and implement a comprehensive E-Government strategy   targeting:  Government to Government (G2G), Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Citizens (G2C) and Government to Employee (G2E) services;    b)    Identify, develop and implement E-Services in the provision of government  information, health, educational and other services through the use of ICTs;     c)     Undertake a comprehensive change management and human resource development Programme to support the adoption of ICTs as part of the service delivery model;  d)   Develop and promote standards, guidelines and procedures to facilitate the  acquisition, installation and maintenance of ICT systems within public sector  institutions; e)   Develop  Provincial  and  District  Information  Resource  Centres  and  implement  an integrated  Geographic  Information  System   to  support  development planning  and decision-making at national, provincial and district levels;    f) Partner with civil society and private sector to participate in civic initiatives and other information/service  delivery  solutions  including  development  of  public access  centres for online services such as license acquisition, registrations of births, deaths, marriages as well  as  voter  registration  at  national,  provincial and  district  levels  as  part  of  E- Government implementation;  g)   Establish and develop an Integrated Land Information System at district and  provincial levels to enhance land management, security of tenure, land utilisation;  monitoring and evaluation;     h)    Implement  mechanisms  and  processes  that  will  facilitate  sharing  and   exchange  of information, good practices and organisational experiences within  the public sector; i) Implement  schemes  and  initiatives  targeted  at  motivating  public  service  employees  to acquire ICT literacy/skills as part of improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness;     j) Establish legislative and other instruments aimed at enhancing access to information, as well as secure the privacy and security of information in public domain;   k)      Adopt an open policy for use of proprietary, free and/or open source              software in developing E-Government solutions systems.  6.7     PROMOTING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE  E-commerce  broadly  involves  the  use  of  electronic  and  traditional  delivery  systems such  as  the postal network to facilitate the process of trading in goods and services using electronic payment systems and technologies such as the Internet.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   39  Global communication networks such as the Internet, are rapidly removing the traditional barriers of time and distance key components influencing commerce and trade. Such technologies provide users, organisations and businesses in both the developed and developing countries with numerous opportunities including: setting up virtual  shops to market and advertise business activities to the rest of the world at a very minimal cost.  In  Zambia,  the  scope  for  E-Commerce  is  growing  largely  due  to  increased  use  of electronic networks  and  payment  systems.  The  role  of  the  banking  sub-sector  and communication  systems coupled with legal and regulatory framework is critical to the success of E-Commerce.  6.7.1 POLICY GOAL  To promote Zambia s full and effective participation in national, regional and global trade through E-Commerce services and facilities.  6.7.2 COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:- (a)     Establish monetary and fiscal policy measures to ensure consumer confidence in          E- Commerce;  (b)     Develop  effective  laws  and  regulations  that  shall  govern  E-Commerce  at          national level supported by regional and international systems;  (c)      Establish mechanisms to protect intellectual property rights related to          E-Commerce.  6.7.3 OBJECTIVES   a)     To promote a stable, fair and competitive investment climate to facilitate the     development of E-Commerce activities in the economy;  b)     To  develop  a  highly  competitive  ICT  industry capable of serving as the      engine for    driving Zambia s active  participation in global trade;  c)     To  facilitate  the  adoption  of  E-Commerce  especially  by  SMEs in  agriculture, tourism,  small  scale mining and manufacturing as well as non-  traditional exports to ensure productivity and growth;  d)         To develop the services industry whose activities meet international             standards in    the production and delivery of globally competitive E-             Commerce products and  Services.

This sector accounts for a high proportion of the GDP and acts as the main source of employment and income in peri-urban and rural areas where the majority of Zambians reside.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   41  However, the sector has received top Government priority in the two main social and economic recovery  initiatives  namely;  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Programme and  the  Transitional National  Development  Plan.  Therefore,  ICT  shall  be  integrated in  the  agricultural  sector  reform process in order to contribute to the social and economic revival of the country.  6.8.1 POLICY GOAL  To improve productivity as well as competitiveness of the agricultural sector through the use  of  ICTs  in  the  planning,  implementation,  monitoring  and  the  information delivery process.  6.8.2 COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:  (a)    Facilitate  private  sector  investment  in  the  development  and  provision  of  ICT           services  including  infrastructure  in  all  Farming  Blocks  and  Farm  Resettlement           Schemes as part of the integrated physical infrastructure (electricity, schools,           clinics, water and roads) development projects targeted for those areas;  (b)     Institute necessary policy measures to deploy, exploit and integrate ICTs and other    technologies  into  the  operations  and  activities  of  the  sector  from  production,   through to processing, packaging, marketing and distribution;  6.8.3 OBJECTIVES  a)      To  facilitate  the  development  of  a  diversified  and  competitive  agricultural      sector  that produces to meet the nation s food requirements while contributing to      export earnings;  b)       To  promote  and  support  rural  development  in  order  to  achieve  long-       term  growth  in  the agricultural sector and the economy as a whole;     c)       To  increase   the   competitiveness   of  farmers  in  production,  processing       and   marketing of agricultural  products and services through the utilisation of       ICTs;   d)      To    monitor    the    conservation    and    sustainable    utilisation    of       natural   resources   in   the agricultural production process;      e)      To promote the development of ICT entrepreneurs at SME level as part of the   rural agro- business  industry  development  and  strengthen  the   development,  application  of  ICTs  in agriculture.

This has affected  delivery of drugs, messages and data collection/dissemination.  Another  dimension  is the recent exodus of experienced and  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   43  qualified manpower in the sector:  most specialist doctors and nurses are confined to the line of rail leaving rural areas to cope with inadequate staff levels.  Globally, ICT is playing a vital and effective role in the organisation and delivery of health services. Therefore, the deployment of ICTs is acknowledged to have the potential to facilitate the spread of health and medical services to rural and under-served areas; supporting public health education and information  services,  education  and  training  of medical  personnel  among  others;  as  well  as  for supporting decision making related to health service administration and management.  6.9.1 POLICY GOAL  To  improve  access  to  quality  healthcare  as  close  to  the  family  as  possible  through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs and other modern technologies.  6.9.2 COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:  (a) Invest in ICT-based healthcare systems to increase the opportunity for Zambians to have access to adequate and appropriate modern health services irrespective of time, distance and location;  (b) Facilitate   the   development   and   implementation   of   a   national telemedicine programme  to  efficiently  and  effectively  utilise  scarce  human resources  and  to further improve human capacity in the healthcare delivery system;  (c) Partner  with  private  sector and civil society in the deployment and utilisation of ICTs in the health sector;  (d) Develop  a  legal/regulatory  and  ethical  framework  for  effective  use  of the  Health Information  and  implement  security  measures  to  safeguard  the privacy  of  patient information inherent in health care records;  (f) Mainstream  ICTs in  the  management  and  treatment  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  pandemics.  6.9.3 OBJECTIVES  (a) To  improve  the  health  status  of  the  population  and   reduce  inequalities   in the provision of health care services among the Zambian population;  (b) To support,  through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs, initiatives aimed at combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious diseases;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   44  (c) To  provide   information  to  people  living  with   life-threatening   diseases,  Particularly HIV/AIDS;  (d) To support research directed at addressing medical, social and economic          aspects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases;  (e) To      facilitate the development, deployment and implementation  of health information,  management  and  decision  support  systems  and facilities  aimed  at improving  the  planning,  management  and  administration functions  as  part  of effective and efficient health service delivery.  6.9.4  STRATEGIES   a)       Develop an appropriate National Health Management Information System;   b)       Facilitate connectivity and access to communication services in health       institutions to   support healthcare delivery;   c)        Develop appropriate ICT infrastructure at all levels of the healthcare  system  to  support the collection, use, management and dissemination of health  care information;     d)         Promote  and  encourage  ICT training and skills development  among         healthcare professionals;        e)         Deploy  ICTs  to  support  education  and  awareness  initiatives  aimed  at          combating  major national health threats such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and          other   infectious diseases.  6.10 PROMOTING THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT &         NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  Travel and tourism as a sector constitutes one of the economic pillars of global trade; this includes both wildlife and non-wildlife based tourism. Over the recent past, Zambia has positioned herself well  in  the  global  tourism  market.  By  its  very  nature,  the tourism  sector  is  well  suited  for  the integration and application of ICTs, which potentially can enhance marketing of tourism products and services; increase the efficiency and effectiveness of transactions and service delivery as well as providing Zambian  enterprises  with  access  to  international  tourism  markets.  However,  large- scale ICT projects may impact negatively on the environment, natural resources and heritage. Therefore, protection and conservation measures need to be taken into account alongside the developments in ICT.

However, youths and women are heavily marginalised in most activities but constitute a very important segment of society. Therefore, there is need to address youths and women as special groups in society that can positively contribute to the growth of ICTs as well as the use of ICTs as empowerment tools in their daily activities.  6.11.1 POLICY GOAL  To use ICTs as an instrument to mainstream youth and women issues in all activities of the economy and society as well as empower youths and women through opportunities created by the implementation of ICT projects and programmes in the country.  6.11.2   COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:-  (a) Implement actions that promote women and youth friendly initiatives; and promote fair access to ICTs by youths and women as well as the disadvantaged in society;  (b) Make  it  mandatory  for  telephone   (fixed  or  wireless)  service  providers  to provide toll-free service to support special not-for-profit organisations targeting  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   47  their services at youths, women, vulnerable and the physically challenged groups;  (c) Implement    measures    to    counter   gender   imbalances   affecting   women s participation and benefiting from  the information society at all levels;  (d) Use  ICTs  to  domesticate  and  harmonise  youth  and  gender  issues  enshrined in regional and international protocols ratified by Zambia.  6.11.3 OBJECTIVES    a)      To  increase  empowerment  opportunities  through  ICTs;  and  the        participation of youths and women in national development;    b)      To promote ICT as an alternative career for youth and women in the        informal and   formal educational system;  c)      To encourage creativity and innovation  around ICTs  among  youths  and        women leading to entrepreneurship development;       d)      To provide a forum for collaboration and exchange of ideas on matters        affecting  youths and women;        e)     To  enable  full   and  equal   participation   of  women  and  youths  in         creating  the Information society.       6.11.4   STRATEGIES  a)      Implement special ICT training programs for youths and women;  b)        Promote ICT awareness among youths and women and develop literacy            programmes;  c)       Pro the    mote  the  use  of  ICTs  as  tools  to  eliminate  all  forms of          inequalities between  sexes;  d)       Encourage  the  participation  and  integration  of  youths  and  women  in    organs  and processes of national policy formulation, planning and    decision-making    through information access mechanisms;  e)        Promote  innovative  and  start-up  (incubator)  projects  for  youths  and            women as ICT entrepreneurs;   f)        Promote moral use of ICTs such as the Internet especially among youths;   g)        Facilitate   and   encourage   the   development   of   electronic   networks  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   48              and  systems   for associations and organisations engaged in the             advancement of youth    and Women issues in the country;  h)         Implement  ICT  programmes/projects  focussing  on  combating  HIV/AIDS              Among youths and women;   i)          Acknowledge, protect and defend women s rights in the information          society; and    j)          Provide  infrastructure  and  affordable  access  to  ICT  tools  and  services               in  rural  and  urban areas.  6.12      DEVELOPING THE LEGAL & REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  An appropriate and dynamic legal/regulatory framework is mandatory to act as the foundation for the  development  of  the  ICT  sector.  The  rapid  technological advances  in  telecommunications, information technology and broadcasting as well as the convergence of technologies, services and delivery  platforms  have  made  it necessary  for  countries  in  both  the  developed  and  developing countries to create and operate in an open, dynamic and responsive legal and regulatory framework to support  the  development  of  ICTs.  Therefore,  this  scenario  has  created  great challenges  to regulators  especially  in  telecommunications  and  broadcasting  sub- sectors  worldwide;  however, reforms are now in place to support convergence with a view to streamlining regulatory frameworks.  The current legal and regulatory framework is perceived to be inadequate in addressing the current market challenges. Therefore, periodic review of the operations, provisions and directives making up the  legal  and  regulatory  system  is  key  to achieving  positive  ICT  sector  reforms  in  order  to accommodate changes including convergence in the industry.  6.12.1  POLICY GOAL  To  develop  appropriate  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory  system  in  order  to support  the  development  of  a  competitive  local  ICT  sector  based  on  convergence principles; supported by fair, predictable, and transparent legal and regulatory framework.  6.12.2   COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall:  (a) Implement a legal and regulatory system with special focus on: sustained inflow of local   and   foreign   investment,   investor   and   consumer   confidence;

Zambia like most countries in the world is vulnerable to some of the negative implications that may hinder the mainstreaming of ICTs in society. Therefore, specific security measures and mechanisms to ensure the safety of citizens, communities, businesses and the nation at large are needed as part of implementing this policy.  6.13.1 POLICY GOAL  To  safeguard  national,  institutional  and  individual  security  concerns  to  support  the development,  deployment  and  effective  use  of  ICTs  within  the  Zambian  economy and society at large.  6.13.2   COMMITMENTS  In order to achieve the above goal, Government shall;  (a) Establish a Computer Crimes Investigation Unit for cyber law enforcement and the National Electronic communication  Security  Centre within    the    internal organs  of  specialised   security   agencies    to   safeguard   information   and communication infrastructure,  networks  and  systems  as  part   of   the   reform process  to:  ensure  the  availability,  authenticity,  integrity  and  confidentiality of  Government,  public  and private   communication   networks   and   systems; data   and   information   content integrity; consumer privacy and protection   as well as  address  security  issues  aimed  at  damaging  or  corrupting  Zambia s cultural heritage, national image and identity;  (b)      Compel all organisations providing public information services such as telecommunication services, Internet,  email to deliberately incorporate administrative,  technological  and  other  such  practical  measures to  enable  national security   agencies   to   curb   misuse   and   unsolicited content   and/or   information products to their customers and the general public.  (c)     Enact   and   enforce   legislation   that   allows   for   effective   investigation  and prosecution of cyber related crimes;  (d) Ensure that due regard, recognition and protection of intellectual property                rights and protection  of  individual/personal  information  and  privacy  rights                are  adhered  to  in the pursuit of implementing security measures; therefore,                Security Agencies shall not in  any  way  interfere  with  the  privacy;  the                right  to  communicate  and  freedom  of expression by citizens without lawful  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   52                 warrant.  6.13.3  OBJECTIVES   a)        To  secure  the  nation s electronic communication  system (individual,   private and    public) as part of creating the information society;      b) To enhance user confidence and trust among the public as well as to                both  protect data and network integrity;    c)       To prevent, detect and respond to cyber-crime and misuse of ICT so as to   contribute  to the fight against national, regional and international crimes   such as pornography,   fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking and   terrorism;   d)        To ensure cross-sectoral linkages and co-ordination among security agencies   in   order to adequately address ICT related security concerns.  6.13.4  STRATEGIES   a)        Develop security policies, standards and procedures to guide the         implementation of ICTs in the country;   b)       Implement ICT Security awareness programmes amongst corporate and         users as well as the general public;  c)     Implement systems that will help in the detection, prevention and timely           response to threats relating to ICT crimes and misuse;  d)         Deploy   ICTs    to    facilitate,    support    and    enhance    the           management,     operation   and administration of security matters as well as           the command   and   control structure of National Security Agencies;     e)           Implement  ICT  skills  development  within  the  Security  Agencies  to  support           effective deployment and application of ICTs in operations and service  delivery.

The country has to address the implementation of this policy and  mainstreaming  of  ICTs  amid  strong  competition  for limited  financial  resources  from  other sectors.  Therefore, the successful achievement of the ICT  for  Development   ( ICT4D)  policy goals and objectives depend on an integrated and wholesome approach during implementation underpinned by developing strategic synergies and partnerships between the public and private sector as well as civil society. This implies that clear definition of the roles, responsibilities and functions of all the stakeholders must be made. Developing this mutual understanding requires a deliberate and open process of broad-based consultations and participation among all major stakeholders to define the role of ICTs in various sectors.  Apart  from  the  Government  having  the  responsibility  to  create  the  right  policy environment  to accelerate the nation s development through ICTs, the private sector and other key stakeholders like parliament,  civil  society,  academia,  media  and legal/regulatory  agencies  as  well  as  the  cooperating partners  also  have  key roles  to  play  in  order  to  facilitate  the  successful  implementation  of  the provisions of this ICT4D  policy.  7.1 STAKEHOLDER ROLES Within Government the following policy making institutions are important in creating a favourable institutional  framework  that  will  improve  policy  formulation,  coordination and  implementation. Currently,  the  mandate  for  ICT  portfolio  lies  in  the  Ministry of  Communications  and  Transport; however,  in  so  doing  the  following  portfolios are  key  in  defining  the  required  institutional framework.  Finance and National Planning The Ministry of Finance and National Planning represents Government as the Shareholder in most Government owned business ventures such as parastatals. The coordination of planning activities as well  as  resource  mobilisation  and  allocation  in  the  country also  falls  under  the  same  portfolio. Therefore,  any  efforts  aimed  at  integrating ICT  in  national  development  requires  the  active participation of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning.  Telecommunications The  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Transport  (MCT)  is  currently  overseeing  the activities  of ZAMTEL,   CAZ   (the   existing   regulator)   and   ZAMPOST;   other institutions   with   significant telecommunications/communications  component  include TAZARA,  Zambia  Railways,  National Airports Corporation.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   55  Electronic Media The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services (MIBS) oversees the operations of ZNBC, Zambia  Daily  Mail  and  Times  of  Zambia.  However,  the  Independent Broadcasting  Authority  is soon to operate as a regulator in this sub-sector.  Therefore,  convergence  principles  adopted  in  this  policy  need  to  harmonise  with proposed regulatory functions in the broadcasting sub-sector as a matter of priority.  Science & Technology The Ministry of Science, Technology and Vocational Training (MSTVT) is currently overseeing the activities  of  vocational  training  in  science  and  technology  as  well  as overseeing  certain  research institutions  in  the  country.  TEVETA  -  the  standards  and training  regulator,  which  is  a  body corporate  under  MSTVT,  oversees  the operations  of  organisations  involved  in  human  resource development including some institutions offering ICT training in the country. However, this does not include courses/training offered by Universities.  Education The  above  institutions  are  critical  in  forming  the  core  group  for  coordinating policy  on  ICTs. Therefore,   the   successful   implementation   of   this   policy   requires active   participation   of   all stakeholders. Specifically, the roles of the following stakeholders are recognised:  7.2  GOVERNMENT The single most important role for Government is to provide political and  economic  will, vision and leadership to facilitate and drive the ICT for Development  process in order to speed up the development of Zambia s information society. In this way, Government shall set a positive national tone and sense of urgency in a way no other stakeholder can.  In  view  of  the  above,  Government  is  duty-bound  to  provide  an  enabling political,  investment, institutional   and   legal/regulatory   environment   to   guide   the effective   participation   of   other stakeholders. Therefore, the political leadership in the country takes centre stage in implementing a coherent national strategy for utilising ICTs as a matter of top priority.  In this regard, Government shall:  a)     Provide  visionary  and  catalysing  leadership  at  the  highest level of     Government  to   Support  the   implementation  of   the  National  ICT  Policy;     the  Ministry    responsible   for  the  ICT portfolio   shall  provide    guidance     in policy formulation, review and target setting in the area of ICT;  b)      Become   the   model   user  of  ICTs  as  part  of  an  ambitious   program   to     drive E-Services  development;  and  in  particular  the  development  of E-     Government in   Zambia .  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   56  c)      Develop and  implement  rolling  sector-based  ICT4D      Implementation/Action  Plans  to  mainstream   the  provisions  of  the      policy  in National Development Plans and other   strategic frameworks;  d)       Mainstream  ICT  programmes and projects in all sectors and ensure  that      this reflects in   the national   budget   as   means   of   commitment   to      Government; resource   mobilisation,     especially   for programmes      targeted at E- Government;  e)      Establish the Department of Communications (DoC) in the Ministry responsible       for the  ICT Portfolio to oversee policy development  and coordinate the       implementation of the policy.  The main function of the Department of Communications is to coordinate and support the development of the ICT sector  through  advocacy  and  mainstreaming  of  ICTs  in  the national planning system and development agenda; focusing on sectoral application of ICTs and increasing individual,  community,  business  and  national  level  benefits  and opportunities  arising  from  the implementation  of  the  National  ICT  Policy. Specifically, the DoC shall perform the following functions.  i. Ensure the achievement of the country s ICT vision by advising Government on ICT  matters  relating  to  overall  sector  performance,  policy  reforms  as  well as regional and international trends that have impact on Zambia;  ii. Coordinate  ICT  activities  involving  Public  sector,  Private  Sector,  Civil Society and Cooperating Partners at all levels;  iii. Coordinate the development of National ICT Implementation Plans and assist in resource mobilisation for implementing the National ICT Policy;  iv.

Support networking activities involving ICT stakeholders in Zambia; ix. Collaborate  with  Government  agencies  and  other  public  sector  institutions  to support E-Government development; x. Conduct   countrywide   regular   ICT   surveys   to   monitor   and   evaluate  the performance of the sector; xi. Coordinate the development of national projects such as fibre optic  telecommunications backbone infrastructure;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   57  xii. Adequately and effectively represent Zambia at regional and international level on all matters relating to ICTs.  g)       Position  the Communications Authority of Zambia to regulate the ICT sector with clear   specifications of responsibilities  and  powers,  taking  into  account  the relevance  and    functions   of  other  existing  regulatory    agencies    (where applicable)    in    sub-   sectors including  telecommunications, Information Technology, Broadcasting and  Postal  services to ensure a   smooth transition to full  convergence.  However,  care  shall  be  taken  to ensure  minimal industry disruption  and  policy conflicts;  h)        Restructure and transform the Centralised Computer Services Department into a   Centre of Excellence for E-Government implementation with appropriate   institutional powers and  linkages within the public sector;  i) Mobilise   and   encourage   Cooperating   Partners   to   mainstream   ICTs   in all country programmes and projects as part of the crusade to accelerate the development and creation of an information society;  7.3 PARLIAMENT The liberalisation of the telecommunications, postal and broadcasting sectors worldwide has opened new requirements for transparent and effective legal and regulatory instruments to govern the sub- sectors. Therefore, the role of Parliament in the effective implementation of this policy shall include among others:  a)     Enacting   appropriate   and   effective   legislations   that   will   create   a  flexible,  dynamic   and  responsive  legal  and  regulatory  system  in the sector  to support the development of an information society; b)     Creation   of   legal   framework   to   support   the   establishment   of   policy,   coordinating  and implementation  institutions  and  the  amendment  of  relevant legislative  provisions  to facilitate  the  creation  of  a  dynamic  regulatory agency with  the  capacity  to  respond  to technological advances as well as changes in the global communications industry ;  c)      Facilitate  the  allocation  and  approval  of  financial  resources  for mplementation  of the ICT Policy in the public sector;  d)     Monitor   the   effective   utilisation   of   financial   resources   allocated   to public sector institutions for the implementation of the ICT Policy;   e)      Ensuring   that   good   governance   principles   are   applied   and            adhered  to  in       the implementation of the National ICT Policy by public            sector institutions.

Therefore, the Judiciary is expected among other things to:  (a) Assist  in  the delivery  of  justice  to  support  the  performance and growth of the ICT sector;  (b)     Implement ICT projects that can accelerate the delivery of justice to the  benefit of all Zambians;  (c) Build human resource capacity within the Judiciary system to support the growth of  legal framework on ICTs; (d) Support the growth of regulatory processes especially in dispute resolution  within the ICT sector.  7.5 CO-OPERATING PARTNERS  Zambia s cooperating partners fall in the category of either multilateral or bilateral. Therefore, their participation in the promotion, integration and deployment of ICTs in country programmes is very essential. Access to information and knowledge resources through ICTs is now widely recognised as a  vital  component  in  accelerating  social and  economic  development,  especially  for  developing countries like Zambia. Today, the concept of ICT for Development is a priority agenda item in country programmes of many international organizations and development agencies. Therefore, Government shall  work  closely  with  cooperating  partners  involved  in  sustainable  development programmes to undertake the following initiatives:  a)   Mobilise technical and financial resources to support the implementation of this     policy;  b)   Integrate ICTs in development cooperation (country support programmes) in     Zambia;  c)      Mobilise   the   support   of   other   partners   in     fundamental   areas   of     education,   infrastructure and universal access, health, governance, scientific  research, commerce, etc to participate in implementing this policy;  d)      Facilitate the setting up of links and relationships between national academic and     research institutions and similar institutions abroad;  e)      Support the effective participation of Zambia in international fora concerned with     ICTs; and  f)     Promote and encourage investment in ICT through Foreign Direct Investment, ICT     Expos  etc.  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   59  7.6 REGULATOR  A key provision of this Policy is to transform the existing regulatory agencies in the communications sector into a converged regulatory agency whose roles and responsibilities recognise and takes into account  the  rapid  changes  and developments  in  the  local,  regional  and  global  communications industry. However, the implementation process shall take due regard of specific sub-sector demands so as to minimise policy, legal and regulatory conflicts as well as industry disturbances. Therefore, a phased  approach  to  this  vision  shall  be  implemented  in  order  to secure  a  smooth  transition  to  a converged regulator.  In implementing the above provision at the legal/regulatory  level,  the  following  laws among others may require repealing or amendment as the case may apply;    a)    Telecommunications Act of 1994 and its regulations   b)     Radio Communications Act of 1994 and its regulations  c)     Independent Broadcasting Act of 2002 and its regulations  In  line  with  Government s  commitment  to  developing  and  promoting  the implementation  of  an open,  fair  and  flexible  regulatory  system,  the  roles  and responsibilities  prescribed  for  National Communications Regulatory Authorities as defined in the SADC and COMESA ICT Policy Guidelines shall  form  the  basis  for operationalisation  of  the  regulatory  framework.  Therefore,  the  broad responsibilities of the  regulator shall be to:  (a) Ensure universal access with regard to basic communication services and universal service with regard to basic and advanced information services;  (b) Ensure  the  provision  of  affordable,  adequate,  high  quality  and  cost- effective  ICT services  that  meet  the  diverse  needs  of  consumers  in  order  to promote  economic growth and social development;  (c)     Facilitate the development of a seamless national, regional an           international ICT infrastructure connectivity; and  (d) Manage  the  Internet  Governance  including  CLTD  (.ZM)  as  a  national  resource; undertake domain name registration and assign the frequency  spectrum to operators/services  providers  in  the  ICT  sector.  However,     The  role of  allocating frequencies for specific uses by other  stakeholders in the country including the ICT sector shall remain the  duty   of  the  Ministry  responsible for the  ICT portfolio. Specifically, the role of     the Regulator shall include:  a)      Regulating   services  and   activities  of  ICT  operators  and  service      providers  in    the  public interest;  b) Achieving progress towards the Vision of the National ICT policy including      universal access and service goals;  DocumentsPDF Complete  Click Here & Upgrade Expanded Features  Unlimited Pages  http://www.pdfcomplete.com/1002/2001/upgrade.htm   60   c)     Ensuring  the  provision  of  a  wide  range  of  ICT services to stimulate and      support  sustainable social and economic development;    d)      Stimulating investment, innovation, and a level playing field   where      competitive entry  is permitted in the ICT sector;    e)      Protecting the interests of ICT users and consumers;     f)      Effective  management  of  common  national  scarce  resources,  such as  the       radio frequency spectrum, numbering plan and Internet Governance in      Zambia;       g)    Actively   participate   in   the    management,    and    developments   in      national,   regional   and international standards; and     h)       Promoting   public   confidence   in   the   ICT   market   by   establishing         transparent    regulatory,  licensing  and  operational   policies   and    guidelines   including   tariffs,   interconnection agreements, dispute resolution   and consume rights/obligations.  7.7 PRIVATE SECTOR  The  private  sector  as  a  key  partner  to  Government  is  recognised  as  having  a critical  role  in  the process of developing Zambia s information society and economy. The private sector is expected among other things: to serve as the key driver for the development of the Zambian economy by providing   domestic   and   foreign investments   in   ICT   services   and   infrastructure development;  and  facilitate  the mobilisation  of  funding/  investments  to  implement  ICT initiatives outlined in this policy.  Other roles envisaged for the private sector include:   a)   Working closely with the Department of Communications to develop  implementation plans and strategies for private sector and civil society  participation in the policy  implementation process;  b)  Supporting  and  participating  in  innovative  and  productive  ways  of  establishing a competitive local ICT industry so as to guarantee Zambia s  effective participation in the global economy;  c)    Taking  advantage  of  business  opportunities  resulting  from   the   implementation of information society initiatives at SADC, COMESA, NEPAD, and   WSIS levels;  d)  Supporting    the    development    of    the   nation s   human   resources  including promoting private sector investment in education as well as in R&D;  e) Developing  local  capability  for   manufacturing  of  ICT  products;   and  creating  innovative services for local and export markets;  f)        Investing  in  ICT   projects    for  rural  and  underserved  urban  areas  as  well  as traditionally disadvantaged areas;  g)  Active  participation in policy formulation, implementation and review process on  an  on- going basis.

Civil Society is a fundamental element in the preservation of human development and consolidation of governance systems.  The challenges that face civil society in this area are related to: low literacy levels especially in the rural areas and the underserved poor urban communities; inadequate telecommunication facilities, electricity and road network infrastructure and the weak institutional coordination mechanisms.  Therefore,  civil society  is  encouraged  to  undertake  the  following  initiatives  in coordination  with the Department of Communications, private sector and other partners:  a)        Exploit   the   potential   of   ICTs   in   the   development  of  society,  dissemination   of information and knowledge; b)   Use  ICTs  as  a  vehicle  for  the  transmission  and  dissemination  of  information  in   development programmes; c)    Incorporate  an  ICT  component  in  community  development  programmes,  and  in programmes supported by international organisations; d)    Create    institutional    mechanisms    (NGOs,    CBOs    etc)    to    spearhead  ICT  awareness including implementation of projects at national and community levels;  e)   Monitor   and   evaluate    the   performance   of   the   ICT   sector    in  achieving developmental goals especially in community based initiatives; f)  Assist  in  capacity  building of ICT awareness  and literacy programmes  in the Country.

Therefore, an Implementation Strategy for all sectors with special focus on the 13 pillars of the policy shall be developed. All sectors shall draw their ICT policies and implementation plans from this policy under the coordination of the Department of Communications by ensuring synchronisation with national planning and budgeting cycles; and will be consolidated into The  National  ICT  Implementation  Plan ,  with  sub-plans  for implementation  on  a  priority  basis covering the short, medium and long-term periods.  In developing   the   Implementation   Plans,   various   models   shall   be   evaluated. However,   the SUNRISE model shall guide the development and implementation of the national and sector plans. The SUNRISE model is expanded as follows;  S   Special ICT Programmes, Development of Incentives and Policy instruments  U   Universal Human Resource Development Programme N   National ICT Applications such as E-Government, Telemedicine etc R   Resource (Technical and Financial) Mobilisation and Deployment I   Integrated ICT (Public Sector Computerisation) Programme S   Standards, Practices and Guidelines for ICT deployment and  exploitation E   Enabling Legal/Regulatory and Institutional Framework  In order to facilitate ownership of the National ICT Policy implementation process, sector-specific ICT  policies  and  implementation  plans  shall  dovetail  into  the  national policy   framework  and incorporate the following as a minimum;      a)     Vision statement for Ministry/Agency  set within the context  of  the       National    ICT    Policy         b)     Broad strategies to be pursed by the Ministry/Agency toward the       realisation often   the sector vision on ICTs;   c)      Specific    sector    goals,    objectives     and     strategies       including        security  measures   aimed   at facilitating the operations and activities of        the sector/agencies;       d)      Clear   statement  of  commitments  of  the  sector/Ministry/Agency   with         respect  to mainstreaming ICTs;        e)      Identify  ICT  activities  based  on  the  SUNRISE  model  that  will  contribute         to improved service delivery in the sector;        f)     Indicate   mechanisms   or    Monitoring   and  Evaluation  based  on  sound         sector  Indicators.

The role of co-operating partners and other stakeholders is very important. The  Department of Communications shall  be  responsible  for  coordinating  resource  mobilisation  in  conjunction  with  the Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  for  implementing  the  National  ICT  Plan. This shall include coordinating investments, providing for equitable and transparent resource allocation as well as monitoring and evaluation.  In particular, financial resource mobilisation shall include;  a)        Contributions from the national budget reflected as percentage expenditure on ICTs in the sector budgets;  b)        Contributions/sponsorship from national stakeholders/local industries; c)        Contributions from bilateral/multilateral cooperating partners; d)        Contributions from the Rural ICT and Enterprise Development Funds.  CHAPTER  10 MONITORING AND EVALUATION  The development of the National ICT Implementation Plan shall form the basis for Monitoring and Evaluation  (M&E)  of  the  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  this policy.  Specifically, the Department of Communications in conjunction  with  private sector,  academia,  civil  society  and  other  stakeholders  shall develop  an  M&E system  based  on  agreed  sector  indicators  as  part  of  the  development  of  an integrated National ICT Implementation Plan.  In  view  of  the  above,  periodic  consultative  sector  reviews  shall  be in-built in  the implementation process  at  all  levels.  This  will  include  overall  review  of  the implementation  strategy  taking  into account  policy  directives as  well  as  other national  priorities.  The review process shall in turn feedback into the policy making cycle.

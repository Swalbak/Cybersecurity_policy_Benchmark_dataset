In order to support the economic recovery of Europe, especially to ensure smart, sustainable economic growth and to promote social inclusion, the European Union has prepared the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020, with the primary objective of developing the Digital Single Market. Some of the objectives set by the European Digital Agenda were taken and adapted to the current context of Romania, in proportion as they are relevant and aligned with the strategic vision of the Romanian ICT for 2014-2020. The purpose of this action is to ensure the alignment of the Romanian ICT development with the level recorded by the countries in the region, to establish premises of Romania's integration in terms of ICT, in the European digital single market. Europe 2020 Targets for Romania Europe 2020, EU’s growth strategy for the next ten years, which was initially submitted in 2010, addresses the shortcomings of Europe’s growth models and aims to create the conditions of an environment which is smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive. This strategy outlines 5 key common-goals parameters of where EU should be by 2020: 1. Employment – 75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed 2. R&D – 3% of the EU's GDP to be invested in Research & Development 3. Climate change and energy sustainability 4. Education - at least 40% of 30-34–year-olds completing third level education 5. Fighting poverty and social exclusion - at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion These goals are seen as strongly interrelated and mutually reinforcing and were translated into national targets for each member state of the European Union. For Romania, these are depicted below. Indicator Target by 2020 for Romania Current state Employment rate (in %) 70% 63.9% (2013) R&D in % of GDP 2% 0.49% (2012) CO2 emission reduction targets -19% -50.46 (2011) Renewable energy 24% 22.9% (2012) Page 6 of 172 Energy efficiency– reduction of energy consumption in TOE (thousand tones oil equivalent) 10toe 33.6 toe (2012) Early school leaving in % 144kbps =2mbps =10mbps =30mbps =100mbps 15,6% 15,2% Source: ANCOM – Market of services of electronic communications, 2012 Digital Inclusion and Access to IT&C In 2013, 45% of the population was using the Internet regularly (at least once a week), significantly below the EU average of 72%. Internet users on a daily basis has reached in 2013 a 32% score. Furthermore, a huge 42% of the population has still never used the Internet, more than double the rate for the EU average of 20%. With regard to disadvantaged people, the rate was 24%, 30% points below the EU average of 54%. Between June, 2010 – June, 2012 Romania registered a constant increase of the overall number of broadband internet connections on fixed points. If in June 2010 the value of such index was of 2,93 million, within 2 years, until June 2012, the overall number of broadband internet connections on fixed points increased to 3,42 million. In what concerns the broadband cover per environments of residence, in June 2012 it was registered a penetration rate on 100 inhabitants in urban environment of 26, 12%, by only 1, 19% more than in the same period of the year 2011. In the rural environment, the same index registered a more significant increase, from 6, 98% in 2011 to 8, 82% in June 2012. The improvement of penetrations of broadband connections on rural level involves in most of cases significant investments for reaching the far points/dwellings geographically speaking. The rural fixed broadband coverage scored in 2013 a 78%. This form of digital divide has been and will be for several years included on digital agenda of development of Romania, leading indirectly to percentage increases stronger from one year to another of the rate of penetration rural environment, comparatively to the evolutions registered in the urban environment. In what concerns the report between the households with access to internet and those with access to broadband connection it may be noticed in Romania a reduction of the gap in the years. Whereas in 2006 out of 14% households with access to internet only 5% had broadband connection, in 2013, 56% of households benefit from broadband connection. In 2013, the coverage of fast broadband, of minimum 30 Mbps was of 55% and the minimum of 100 Mbps is reached by 25% of total households.

The lowest share of households with Internet connection is in the North East (45.7%) and South Muntenia (47.2%)  The main segments of Internet users opposite to their occupational status are those of skilled/unskilled workers (20%), pupils/students (19%) and engineers, physicians, architects, professors and economists (15%). The proportions are almost identical in case of users using fixed connections, whereas the Internet users using mobile connections come significantly as well from the category of contractors, free-lancers, managers or administrators (13%)  Most of internet users come, without significant differences between those using fixed or mobile connections, from the households formed of 3 - 4 individuals (59%), with a higher share of those with three members Mobile broadband penetration has increased but it is still at insufficient quotas and fixed high-speed Internet remains still a privilege of big cities. In 2012, third generation mobile broadband (HSPA) was available to 96.2% of Romanian population (96.3% in the EU). Meanwhile, 4th generation (LTE) was available only for 23.6% of population, compared with the EU average of 26.2%. The take-up rate of mobile broadband reached 41% in June 2013, being still below the EU average of 54.5%. Public Services of eGovernment In 2013, 5% of citizens in Romania made use of the internet for eGovernment services. Out of these, 2% of users returned to the Government authorities filled forms. On the level of enterprises, 63% of Romanian enterprises are using the Internet up to the 3rd degree of sophistication – transactional eGovernment services for interaction with public authorities (which is below the EU27 average of 87%) and almost 20% are submitting offers through SEAP. 21 Page 108 of 172 Indicators of efficiency of governing act, Romania 2011 2012 RO EU27 RO EU27 Efficiency of governing (1-100) 48.00 82.00 - - Administrative modernization, out of which: Use of e-governing services by citizens (%) 11% 49% 31% - Time necessary to incorporate a new company (days) 3.00 7.00 - - Cost necessary to incorporate a new company (EUR) 100.00 400.00 - - Hours necessary for conformity to the norms of tax return, out of which: Income tax - - 42.00 Labor tax - - 120.00 Consumption tax - - 60.00 2011 2012 RO EU27 RO EU27 Bribe (1-very common - 7 – never happens) 4.00 5.10 3.70 5.00 Defalcation of public funds (1-very common - 7 – never happens) 2.80 4.40 2.50 4.20 Source: European Commission, 2011 – 201222 Share of Enterprises interacting online with public administration per stages (%), Romania Source: INS, Informational society, 2013 23 22 Page 109 of 172 APPENDIX 2 – SOCIAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS Relevant indicators taken from The Digital Agenda Scoreboard – 2013 show Romania’s position compared to EU standards. 23 Page 110 of 172 Page 111 of 172 Page 112 of 172 Page 113 of 172 Page 114 of 172 Page 115 of 172 Page 116 of 172 Source: Administrative division of Romania, December 31 2012 Number of counties 421 (including Bucharest) Number of cities and municipalities 320 Of which: municipalities 103 Number of townships 2861 Number of villages 12957 Population separation based on sexes, age groups and environments, July 1 2012 Page 117 of 172 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total 21469959 21431298 21354396 21316420 Sexes Male 10457219 10434143 10392537 10375200 Female 11012740 10997155 10961859 10941220 Age groups 0-14 years 3245775 3241295 3213339 321143711 1 15-59 years 13949544 13837516 13724839 1369556411 1 60 years and above 4274640 4352487 4416218 44488481 1 On environments Urban 11823516 11798735 11727153 11678600 Rural 9646443 9632563 9627243 9637820 1 On the 1 st of January 2012.

Page 136 of 172 SWOT FOR ROMANIAN ICT INFRASTRUCTURE Page 137 of 172 Strengths Weaknesses Romania is a technology agnostic market with high level of availability of NGN choices for the consumers. Also, the high take-up of ultra fast broadband (>100Mbps) is attributed to the maturity of the market as well as the sophistication and appetite of the consumers (mainly the youngsters segment). Mobility is also encouraged by the high availability of 3G mobile coverage (96%) and the most recent fast development of LTE coverage, driving fixed to mobile substitution. However, the low purchasing power, the demographic structure of the population as well as the low e-literacy of the older population result in low penetration of Internet connections even in grey and/or black areas; in addition, there are still many white spots that are not covered by private investments and require public intervention (especially in rural areas) This low take-up is applicable both to fixed access networks as well as mobile broadband and discourages private investments driving unavailability of financing both for start- ups and existing operators. Opportunities Threats and constraints RONET project laying backhaul will harmoniously complete the NGN developments into an overall NGN Plan for Romania; Romania is one of the lowest markets regarding prices for broadband and triple play which drives up the competition between operators; A fairly large high proportion of companies are using e- procurement platforms; Structural Funds are still available for Romania; despite a low absorption rate these funds are expected to fuel State aid notification delays; Administrative delays in updating the necessary legislation framework; providing assistance and aids for rollout of broadband infrastructure in both urban and rural areas; Difficulties in implementing RO-NET initiative; Deployment of 4G networks requires significant investment and operators are prudent in coverage plans (Romania has good 3G coverage but below average for 4G). Page 138 of 172 further developments of the market; The existing access networks provide fast uplink speeds and this comes to the benefit of Romania serving as outsourcing destination for Shared Service Centers and IT/Software development hubs as well as providing cloud services to the rest of the European markets.

With the main objective to create a European Digital Single Market, Digital Agenda will generate both horizontal and sectorial effects and which will have the destination a wide variety of public and private participants. The implications of the Digital Agenda will have reform purpose and involves the implementation of an extensive process of governmental transformation. This type of implementation involves a common and effective coordination in order to ensure full cooperation of direct participants (Ministries, institutions, agencies, private sector representatives, etc). Having an implementation methodology that can act as a framework for reference for all public bodies is a key mechanism for ensuring the successful application of the Fields of Actions in Romania and also can provide the required evidence to assess the benefits realization. In order to ensure the success of the Digital Agenda for Romania 2014 – 2020, we outline the key characteristics of the implementation methodology:  Every Ministry in charge of Fields of Actions or Lines of Actions outlined within the National Strategy for Digital Agenda 2020 will include their specific Fields/Lines of Actions complete with target indicators and a methodology for assessing these indicators in a National Implementation Plan for the Digital Agenda. The Technical Economic Committee will oversee the implementation of the Implementation Plans for Digital Agenda for Romania and will provide best practices, guidelines and advices for the Ministries during the development of the National Implementation Plans  In the National Implementation Plans for the Digital Agenda, each Ministry will be responsible for defining the indicators that will be used in order to track the completion of their specific objectives and targets  Each initiative developed by public entities under the Digital Agenda for Romania Program will define a set of specific indicators that can directly impact the Strategic Targets for Romania (those specified above) or present a correlation methodology for describing the impact of their indicators on the Strategic Targets. These indicators will be reviewed by the Technical Economic Committee as part of their usual ICT project assessment  Each public entity implementing projects under the Digital Agenda for Romania Program will send to the Technical Economic Committee bi-annually a status report for monitoring purposes in a Page 152 of 172 format agreed by TEC, which will highlight the key achievements and missed milestones. At the end of the each implementation initiative, a detailed report will be sent to the Technical Economic Committee.  The evaluation of the impact for the Strategic Targets for each initiative will be conducted annually by each supervising authority under the Ministries and will be sent for review and consolidation to the Technical Economic Committee.  The Agency for Digital Agenda Romania will be in charge with monitoring the implementation of the Strategy and the delivery of the Programme to track overall progress and ensure that the lessons from monitoring and evaluation evidence are fed back into decision making and shared across policy and programme areas.  As such, the Agency for Digital Agenda Romania will act as a consultancy agency for all public bodies in respect to the objectives and strategy of the Digital Agenda and a monitoring and evaluation body for the progress on the Digital Agenda Roadmap, and the Technical Economical Committee will act as the operational body that will be in charge with supervision at the project / program level. Accelerating the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Romania A workgroup has been created at the Prime Minster Chancellery level in order to accelerate the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Romania Strategy. This workgroup, composed of the major Ministries in Romania that will be involved in the reformation process for Digital Agenda in Romania, aims to provide a joint responsibility for the objectives and initiatives outlined in this document and adopting a plan of measures. A series of steps have been identified, that irrespective of other significant initiatives – such as the Government Enterprise Architecture, can be used in order to stimulate the adoption of the Strategy and its principles:  Consultations on the Digital Agenda for Romania with the Ministries responsible for Lines of Actions with the clear objective of having the document approved by all the involved parties within a clear timeframe  Defining the major (strategic) projects with all the involved parties for Field of Action I  Starting the development of the National Interoperability Framework for Romania  Out setting the discussions with other parties that can finance the Strategic Lines of Development and minimize the financing gap – World Bank, Ministry of Finance, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  Signing a protocol with all the Ministries for the Government Enterprise Architecture initiative (described below) Page 153 of 172 The relationship between all the stakeholders involved in the Digital Agenda Strategy for Romania 2014 – 2020 is depicted below.

In aiding the public entities pursuing initiatives under the Digital Agenda for Romania, The Ministry for Information Society will be the publishing the Structured Meta Model and will review the initiatives based on the Digital Agenda Guiding Principles (found below)  Prioritize – In this phase, initiatives will be assessed based on their impact against the targets set by this document and their benefits realization in accordance with the necessary budget. o Prioritization for the initiatives will be done based on the following criteria (guidelines will be published by the Ministry for Information Society and will be refined iteratively):  Funding sources and requirements  Estimated impact of the initiative on the Strategic Targets versus funding needs  Type of project: strategic enabler projects that aim to create the necessary context for other projects to be implemented will be prioritized  Evidence of stakeholder involvement and feedback from the targeted users requesting the initiative through the means of consultation  Evidence of realistic planning in terms of funding, resources, phases etc.  Evidence of benchmarking done in other EU countries / similar projects in order to assess the feasibility of the initiative  Adherence to National Strategy of the Digital Agenda and Guiding Principles and Ministry Strategy  Adherence to National Standards (security, interoperability, etc) o Prioritization for the lines of actions will be done based on the following criteria (guidelines will be published by the Ministry for Information Society and will be refined iteratively):  Strategic lines of actions are the first lines of actions for which funds will be allocated due to their important nature in the roadmap for the Digital Agenda Page 155 of 172  Enabler lines of actions are the second priority for implementation projects, as these are the projects that will facilitate the implementation of other projects (included the ones in the Operational status)  Operational lines of actions are tertiary in terms of importance for the Strategic Targets, and calls for this lines of actions will be made after the successful implementation of the Strategic and Enabler lines of actions  Monitor – This phase in the lifecycle of an initiative will check progress against the planned targets and will ensure that the necessary evidence for the spend and outputs is collected. For monitoring purposes, the Ministries will send consolidated data for each initiative to the Technical Economic Committee in a format published by the Ministry for Information Society in which the status of the projects will be reported and the missed milestones / targets will be transparent, along with a list of risks and mitigation actions  Evaluate – This phase will assess the effectiveness of an initiative and its efficiency during and after implementation. In order to evaluate the impact of each initiative, in the definition phase of the initiative, each entity will be responsible for defining the indicators and the methodology used for the evaluation of the initiative in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe and its targets. The methodology for evalution will have clear indicators on how the stakeholders of each project will be involved in evaluating the impact and the success of each program / project. This methodology and the indicators will be reviewed by the Technical Economic Committee. Structured Meta Model Apart from the strategic perspective of the Digital Agenda, a much needed improvement in Romania is introducing a set of standards for describing, running, managing and evaluating initiatives and projects. In order to have a coherent mechanism for defining an opportunity and assessing change in the current context, Romania will adopt a Structured Meta Model for projects and initiatives. This is a strategic endeavor of Digital Agenda Romania with the purpose of bringing structure and clarity to the description and rationale for each project and will be systematically applied all the Field of Actions contained in the Digital Agenda and all projects under each Line of Action. Adopting a Meta Model will bring the following benefits:  Maintain the same structure for the description of the initiatives / projects  Relay the right messages to all the stakeholders  Adopt a uniform description of the projects that will ensure the minimal amount of re-work  Act as a checklist/starting point for any entity commencing an initiative, easing the burden of creating the initial documents  Ensure that the necessary data is collected for the Monitoring and Evaluation phases Page 156 of 172 This Meta Model can be applied iteratively starting from strategic initiatives to programs and individual projects pertaining to the overarching governance and needs to be completed and refined from the first iteration to the most granular approach. Regardless of the document structure in which the following information will be provided, each public entity will have the recommendation of using these data points as a checklist to confirm against the completeness and accuracy of a project. The six mandatory components for defining the Meta Model will be: Context, Objectives, Actions, Principles, Timeline and Interdependencies.

Understanding the causes, effects and resolution of this pervasive issue is outside the scope of this strategy, but having the right mechanisms and tools to address it is paramount for reaching the objectives and indicators assumed by Romania. As such, the National Strategy for Digital Agenda in Romania 2014 – 2020 proposes different approaches that can be used to provide better administrative capacity for developing, implementing and monitoring initiatives and policies, which are outlined below. The feasibility of these approaches and any other options and will be explored as part of the Government Enterprise [1] Page 157 of 172 Architecture initiative, being one of the most important factors of the business perspective of the Romanian Administration.  Using better operational models – Romania needs to analyze ways in which to build and sustain for longer periods the right levels of competency in distinct areas (such as Program Management, Enterprise Architecture, specific public sector consultancy) – this will be done in the initial Government Enterprise Architecture exercise. In the past, capacity outsourcing to private sector and creating dedicated Project Management Units (with separate funding for personnel) have shown great promise in maintaining the necessary administrative capacity  Increasing the cooperation between public entities – The Romanian Administration will look for ways to increase the cooperation between public institutions and entities – in terms of knowledge, skill sets, competencies and information. Example: CTE (Technical-Economical Committee)  Increasing the cooperation between public and private entities – One of the most important success factors in building the proper administrative capacity is increasing the cooperation between public and private entities, by encouraging the public administration to collaborate with the business environment (companies and associations of companies) for innovative solutions and new paradigms for overcoming this shortcoming  Having a clear strategy and consensus – By adhering to a strict set of Guiding Principles and Public Service Criteria and by enforcing them at an operational level through the Technical Economical Committee, the public administration will ensure that all the efforts are channeled to a cohesive strategy Government Enterprise Architecture – the core initiative for eGovernment  Creating the legislation and operational framework for implementing Government Enterprise Architecture. After its adoption, the Minister for Information Society will become the responsible entity for Government EA at the Executive Level. The framework for Government Enterprise Architecture will be tailored from industry recognized standards and will include at a minimum the Business, Data, Application, Technology and People perspectives. The main objective of the Government Enterprise Architecture will be to define a uniform set of standards, policies and architectural guidelines which the agencies will use for ICT initiatives and investments. Key outcomes of this initiative that will be prioritized before all other lines of actions are: o Developing solutions for building administrative capacity for implementing the Digital Agenda and creating the necessary Enterprise Architecture capabilities o Creating the necessary legal framework with clear ownership for services, data and initiatives o Creating the as-is map with public systems available or in the implementation phase Page 158 of 172 o Creating the to-be roadmap for public administration in terms of Business, Data, Technology and Applications that adheres to the Digital Agenda Strategy o Developing the National Interoperability Framework (see below more details) and the roadmap for this implementation in current context o eGovernment ICT Standards Checklist (See below more details) o Creating the mechanism for managing the Digital Agenda Strategy throughout the implementation period PURPOSE: CREATING THE GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK FOR ROMANIA BENEFITS: UNIFORM VISION IMPLEMENTATION AND PROMOTION FOR ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES AND PROJECTS TIMELINE: MID 2015  Creating the Government Enterprise Architecture capabilities within the Ministries - empowering and educating the agencies for using and applying the Government Enterprise Architecture for their initiatives PURPOSE: SUPPORT PUBLIC ENTITIES IN ADOPTING GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS: BETTER ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT EA, UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF EA TIMELINE: MID 2015  Evaluating the ICT investments in Romania on following and meeting the Guiding Principles and Public Service Criteria PURPOSE: EVALUATE ICT INVESTMENTS BENEFITS: OVERSEE ALL ICT INVESTMENTS IN ROMANIA ARE IN LINE WITH THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES, PUBLIC SERVICE CRITERIA AND ROMANIA’S STRATEGY TIMELINE: END 2014 IN PLACE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  Issuing and overseeing the implementation of the National Interoperability Framework that will ensure end-to-end interoperability between future systems from the public sector, following the European Interoperability Framework guidelines. Major outcomes of the National Interoperability Framework should be reducing the number of redundant data sources in public administration and increasing the ability to provide services that are cross-organization by using standard data formats PURPOSE: NATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY FRAMEWORK BENEFITS: ENSURE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN NATIONAL SYSTEMS. ADHERE TO BEST PRACTICES. ADHERE TO EUROPEAN LEGISLATION TIMELINE: MID 2015  Issuing the eGovernment ICT Standards Checklist which will provide the list of recommended standards for ICT projects (Mandatory, Recommended, Optional, Obsolete, Not recommended etc.), together with the lifecycle process for these standards (Proposing, Approving, Commenting, Decommissioning etc.) For specialized standards (healthcare, banking, finance etc.), the Page 159 of 172 corresponding entity from other Ministries will propose these standards and they will enter the approval process defined by the Ministry for Information Society PURPOSE: ICT STANDARDS CHECKLIST BENEFITS: CONSISTENT SET OF STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED BY ICT PROJECTS TIMELINE: MID 2015, CONTINUOS IMPROVEMENT  Issuing best practices and recommendations for ICT acquisitions and implementations (including but not limited to: Software Delivery Process, Design Guidelines for the Public Entities, necessary key data points for any public service, system lifecycle management, infrastructure management) PURPOSE: BEST PRACTICES AND RECOMMENDATIONS BENEFITS: CONSISTENT SET OF STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED BY ICT PROJECTS TIMELINE: MID 2015, CONTINUOS IMPROVEMENT THE PRINCIPLES TO MOVE FORWARD Definition of public services – Digital Agenda for Romania will offer better public services The definition of public services, as expressed in this document, means any endeavor undertaken by the Romanian Government on behalf or for the advantage of the citizens or the businesses under jurisdiction of Romania, regardless of their transactional (e.g. issuing a birth certificate) or transformational nature (e.g. taxation legislation). From a European Union terminology, public services in Romania encompass both Services of General Interest and Services of General Economic Interest. That is why, entities pursuing to implement services adhering to the Digital Agenda for Romania should take into account the following criteria, on which quality public services should be defined and managed:  C1 - Center on user needs – All public services exist to server their customers, their needs and they should be built, adapted and maintained for a particular and real demand. Each entity has to identify all types of potential users, understand what they want and need and create or reform services with respect to these - because in the end quality represents achieving maximum customer satisfaction  C2 - Be integrated – Partnerships between entities should be implemented in order to provide to the customer a one stop shop for addressing a particular need (starting from the Life Events). This will in turn increase the confidence in public services, make them easier to user and also increase the collaboration between public entities. This can be met only by planned and systematic collaboration between the parties involved in offering an integrated service, with shared goals that are agreed consensually.  C3 - Be easy to use – Simple and responsive services which the public can understand. Users should have a choice of service delivery in terms of payment methods, location of points of contacts, opening hours and delivery times.  C4 - Meet a publicly committed service level – All public services should meet a publicly committed quality standard in terms of responsiveness, availability and performance. The users of a public service should be able to quickly identify what kind of services are available, what are criteria for that public service and also should be able to swiftly identify what to expect from that service and should be able to have the mechanism with which to ask questions and file complaints about that service. Page 160 of 172  C5 - Be safe – The services should protect all the information provided by the public. Security should cover all the requirements for safety, privacy, confidentiality, availability and integrity for data or processes in order to ensure trust in that specific public service.  C6 - Be accessible - Identify and work to eliminate barriers to access to services for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion, as well as those facing geographic barriers to services.  C7 - Be cost-effective – Services should be efficiently operated, adequately staffed and highly productive for both the internal and external users. A public service should be able to demonstrate how it can contribute to national, initiative or projects objectives and outcomes. Adopting the Guiding Principles and the Public Services Criteria We understand that in order to have a consistent application of Digital Agenda for Romania for every Field of Action, it is essential for the Guiding Principles (found in chapter 1.2) and Public Services Criteria to act as the foundation to build upon projects pertaining to Digital Agenda in Romania, regardless of their Field of action. As such:  All public bodies will include the Guiding Principles in their Implementation Strategy, together with specific recommendations and implications  All public bodies will need to make sure they document the implications of following the Guiding Principles and the Public Services Criteria in their detailed eGovernment plans  The 7 Public Services Criteria will act as a reference for defining the as-is and to-be state for any public service  The Minister for Information Society will be responsible for evaluating the adherence to the Guiding Principles and how eGovernment projects are meeting the Public Service Criteria  For each criteria from the Public Services Criteria, the Minister for Information Society is responsible for defining the proper mechanisms of describing, evaluating, controlling and governing  The Agency for Digital Agenda (described below) will be responsible for evaluating and supporting the public bodies in adopting the Guiding Principles and Public Services Criteria The Technical - Economical Committee It is essential for the success of the Digital Agenda in Romania to create one public entity under the authority of the Ministry for Information Society (the issuer of DAR) which will oversee the implementation of this strategy, from an operational and tactical perspective. The objectives of the newly formed Technical-Economical Committee are to define, correlate, control and monitor the ITC framework in Romania, acting as the Lead Design Authority for eGovernment projects in Romania. Support systems for the Technical Economical Committee In order to make the Technical Economical Committee fully operational, a series of information systems need to be created. These will act as the knowledge base for the committee and for other public entities that want to build ICT project, supporting them in structuring and collecting information that can help Page 161 of 172 sustain a rapid growth of investments in this field, while making sure that all these initiatives are coherent and adhesive to our vision. The first system is the National Register for Information Systems (NRIS), which will hold general and specific information pertaining to information systems in Romania (Authority, Description, Funding, Technical Components, Supplier, Integrations with other systems, Lifecycle status, Exceptions etc.). This system needs to be fully integrated and automated with the e-Procurement system and needs to make its data available to the general public and to other public entities. The committee will use this system for Knowledge Management and it will update it based on the Evaluation Forms used for evaluating ICT investments in Romania. The public bodies will inform the owner of this system for any changes in the lifecycle of their project (for example, when decommissioning a system which is registered in NRIS). BENEFITS: KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR ICT SYSTEMS IN ROMANIA RESPONSIBLE: TECHNICAL ECONOMICAL COMMITTEE SUPPORT: ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES TIMELINE: END OF 2016 The second system, National Register for Data and Metadata (NRDM), will act as the repository for data standards and metadata pertaining to ICT projects (for example, data sets and types of data handled by a specific project). This system will evolve into automated access gateway to all the National Registers. This will ensure that the appropriate owners of data at the Government level are responsible and accountable for data which they provide. Clear responsibilities for data sets and data types will be identified and defined by the Technical Economical Committee and steps will be taken to safeguard against public entities using data sets which are not provided by the responsible bodies. BENEFITS: KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR DATA TYPES AND DATA STANDARDS. REDUCING OVERLAPPING RESPONSABILITIES ON THE DATA IN ROMANIA. RESPONSIBLE: TECHNICAL ECONOMICAL COMMITTEE SUPPORT: ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES TIMELINE: END OF 2016 Governing rules for Broadband Infrastructure  Mapping and a detailed analysis of the coverage: ANCOM to implement a mapping of the national telecommunications/broadband infrastructure as per obligations imposed by Law 154/2012.  Public consultation All measures will be publicly communicated and public consultation will allow stakeholders and public opinion to be expressed, at the national level  A competitive bidding procedure Whenever the authorities that grant their support will select an operator to build and/or manage the subsidized infrastructure, a bid will be organized.  The most beneficial bid in economic terms Page 162 of 172 In the context of a competitive bidding procedure, the authority granting support will establish qualitative award criteria based on which the submitted bids will be evaluated (e.g. addressing coverage priorities, co-financing, etc.);  Technological neutrality In principle, broadband services can be provided by means of a network infrastructure platform based on wired, wireless, satellite and mobile technologies, or on a combination thereof. The future bids will thus not favor or exclude a certain technology or network platform.  Use of the existing infrastructure Since the possibility to re-use the existing infrastructure is one of the main factors that determine the cost related to the introduction of broadband communications, the government will encourage bidders to use the available existing infrastructure, in order to avoid any useless and inefficient duplication of resources and to reduce the amounts assigned to public financing.  Wholesale access Effective wholesale access of third parties to a subsidized broadband infrastructure is a requisite component of any State measure to support broadband communications. Especially, wholesale access allows third party operators to compete with the selected bidder (when such bidder is present also at the level of retail market), thus consolidating the supply and competition in the areas envisaged by the measure while avoiding at the same time the creation of regional service monopolies.  Rationalizing investments In the rural area, with a low density of the population, where there are limited broadband services, imposing all the types of access products might disproportionately increase the investment costs, without obtaining significant benefits as far as the stimulation of the competition is concerned. In such a situation, consideration might be given to the possibility that those access products which imply costly and unforeseen interventions at the subsidized infrastructure (for instance, collocation in the intermediate distribution points) should be offered only of there is a reasonable request from a third party operator.  Price policy in case of wholesale access The prices for wholesale access should be based on certain principles for establishing the prices as defined by ANCOM and on certain reference criteria, and they should take into account the aid received by the network operator.  Monitoring and claw-back mechanism The authorities granting aid will closely monitor throughout the entire term of the project the implementation of the broadband project. The inclusion of a repayment mechanism may contribute to the ex post and retroactive minimization of the value of the aid initially estimated to be necessary.  Transparency The aid beneficiary has the obligation to provide entitled third parties with global and undiscriminating access to the information about its infrastructure (including, inter alia, pipes, street cabinets and fiber optic) developed under a State aid agreement. The aid beneficiary must provide all the useful information Page 163 of 172 about the broadband network to a central register of broadband infrastructures to be developed by ANCOM and/or at local administration level.  Reporting Every two years, the authority grating the State aid will communicate to the European Commission essential information about the aid project, commencing on the measure application date Page 164 of 172 APPENDIX 6 – LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN DIGITAL AGENDA FOR ROMANIA 2014 – 2020 Following is a list of public authorities, institutions and entities involved in the IT Thematic Committee that was in charge of giving feedback and insights for the Digital Agenda for Romania 2014 – 2020.

economic growth and increase competitiveness in Romania, both by direct action and support of   development of effective Romanian ICT and  through indirect actions such as increasing efficiency and   reducing public sector costs in Romania, improving private sector productivity by reducing administrative   barriers in relation to the state, improving the competitiveness of the labor force in Romania and beyond.   In order to support the economic recovery of Europe, especially to ensure smart, sustainable economic   growth and to promote social inclusion, the European Union has prepared the Digital Agenda for Europe   2020, with the primary objective of developing the Digital Single Market.   Some of the objectives set by the European Digital Agenda were taken and adapted to the current context   of Romania, in proportion as they are relevant and aligned with the strategic vision of the Romanian ICT   for 2014-2020. The purpose of this action is to ensure the alignment of the Romanian ICT development   with the level recorded by the countries in the region, to establish premises of Romania's integration in   terms of ICT, in the European digital single market.      Europe 2020 Targets for Romania   Europe 2020, EU’s growth strategy for the next ten years, which was initially submitted in 2010, addresses   the shortcomings of Europe’s growth models and aims to create the conditions of an environment which is   smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive. This strategy outlines 5 key common-goals parameters of   where EU should be by 2020:   1. Employment – 75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed   2. R&D – 3% of the EU's GDP to be invested in Research & Development   3. Climate change and energy sustainability   4. Education - at least 40% of 30-34–year-olds completing third level education   5. Fighting poverty and social exclusion - at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and   social exclusion   These goals are seen as strongly interrelated and mutually reinforcing and were translated into national   targets for each member state of the European Union. For Romania, these are depicted below.   Indicator Target by 2020 for Romania Current state   Employment rate (in %) 70% 63.9% (2013)   R&D in % of GDP 2% 0.49% (2012)   CO2 emission reduction targets -19% -50.46 (2011)   Renewable energy 24% 22.9% (2012)          Page 6 of 172      Energy efficiency– reduction of   energy consumption in TOE   (thousand tones oil equivalent)   10toe 33.6 toe (2012)   Early school leaving in % < 11.3% 17.3% (2013)   Tertiary education in % 26.7% 22.8% (2013)   Reduction of population at risk of   poverty or social exclusion in   number of persons   < 580,000 8,907,000 (2012)   Source: Eurostat, Europe 2020 Targets – all information are based on the latest available data      Tailoring the Digital Agenda for Romania   While the above environment is necessary to give context to the National Strategy on Digital Agenda for   Romania, this needs to be tailored and adapted to the current national economic and social climate. The   underpinning principle of Romania’s Strategy is creating a competitive environment which encourages   and attracts honest tax-paying citizens and businesses, which in turn is the paramount measure of a   country’s success and sustainable long-term growth.    Romania is the seventh largest country in the EU in terms of population (20.12 million) and the second   largest from the group of New Member States, after Poland. Within 2001-2008, the Romanian economy   expanded by an average of 5-6 percent per year, representing one of the fastest growth rates in the   European Union. During 2009-2012, the GDP of Romania had an oscillating trend. A modest economic   recovery is forecast with ~ 2.2% in 2014.   Nevertheless, Romania is still lagging significantly behind the majority of European countries in terms of   economic development. GDP per capita recorded in purchasing power standard (PPS) was just under half   of the EU 27 average in 2012 and only around 70% of the average GDP per capita of the new EU Member   States.   Targeted and prioritized investments in ICT are essential in meeting the specific targets set by Digital   Agenda for Europe 2014 – 2020, and in turn is the main lever for converging to the Europe 2020 strategic   targets. This strong association between the strategic objectives and the specific objectives in ICT is   characterized by the pervasive reach of the digital economy and the transformation properties that   implementing ICT can have on several layers (legislation, innovation, procedural changes, behavioral   changes etc.).    In terms of funding, as it is mentioned in the Romanian Partnership Agreement for the 2014 -2020   programming period, the investments in the field of ICT’s will proceed under the umbrella of the National   Strategy for Digital Agenda – the strategic policy framework for digital growth. That is why we believe it is   of utmost importance for the Digital Agenda for Romania to build the foundation for coherent and   convergent initiatives, that will allow Romania to have a clear roadmap for the future and a strategic   vision which takes into account all the interdependencies and background factors (demographic & social   context, strengths and weaknesses of the legislation framework, long-term vs. near-term goals, economic   disparity etc.).   http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/europe_2020_indicators/headline_indicators http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/targets_en.pdf        Page 7 of 172            The 4 Fields of Actions for Digital Agenda for Romania 2014 - 2020   The key performance objectives of the Digital Agenda impose cumulative efforts of European countries to   achieve the targets assumed by the European Commission. Romania's contribution, according to these   objectives and related targets can be seen in the graph below.   Taking into consideration the 7 pillars that form the basis of the Digital Agenda for Europe 2014 – 2020,   Romania has adapted them to the current context and has defined 4 major fields of action that will be   pursued as Romania’s vision of the ambitious program that will drive the economic growth and increased   competitiveness, for covering the underpinning principle stated above in pursuit of sustainable long-term   economic growth. These 4 fields of action are summarized as follows:    Field of action 1 - eGovernment, Interoperability, Cyber Security, Cloud Computing, Open Data,   Big Data and Social Media – increase efficiency and reduce the public sector costs in Romania by   having a modern administration. Implementing and correlating  the uniform vision of the  fields of   action 1 and 2 will  generate for the period 2014-2020, an estimated impact on the Romanian   economy of about 5% of GDP grow and 1% in terms of jobs.    Field of action 2 – ICT in Education, Health, Culture and eInclusion – support at a sectorial level that   will ensure ICT investments create a positive impact in the social context.     Field of action 3 - eCommerce, Research & Development and Innovation in ICT – builds on the   comparative advantages of regional Romania and supports economic growth in the private sector.   The implementation of the measures of the field of action 3 will generate in the period 2014-2020   an estimated impact on the Romanian economy of approximately 3% increase at the GDP level and   2% in terms of jobs.    Field of action 4 – Broadband and Digital Services Infrastructure – ensures social inclusion and   enables the benefits across all other fields of actions.    Direct and indirect impact on the economy of the Strategy for Digital Agenda for Romania,   calculated in accordance with good practice observed in other European countries who have made   similar investments may be translated into GDP growth by 13%, increasing the number of jobs by   11% and reduce administration costs by 12% during 2014-2020.   ICT play an important role in improving business efficiency and extending market reach and the social   impact of ICT has become significant. ICT development is a key area to improve the competitiveness of the   business environment, to increase public sector efficiency and to reduce bureaucracy.          Page 8 of 172      1 INTRODUCTION   1.1 ALIGNMENT TO THE DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE 2020  The National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania was developed in alignment with the Digital Agenda   for Europe as framework of reference to define an overview on how to boost the digital economy for the   2014 – 2020 period.    This strategy is developed in alignment with all of the Government actions in terms of Information Society,   including agencies from Ministry of Health, Ministry of National Education and Transport Ministry.   However, due to the evolving nature of the Digital Agenda Strategy of Romania and its pervasive effect on   other National Strategies and Implementation Plans, we outline the key Strategies that should be   harmonized or govern the following topics:    All strategies (including the Digital Agenda for Romania) will be reviewed after the Government   Enterprise Architecture initiative that will take place in Romania according to Appendix 5 –   Implementation Methodology    Field of Action 1.2 – Cyber Security – Romania’s Cyber security Strategy     Field of Action 1.5 – Open Data – National Anticorruption Strategy 2014 – 2016    Field of Action 2.2 – ICT in Health – Romania’s Public Healthcare Strategy for 2014 – 2020    Field of Action 3.2 – Research – Development and Innovation – National Strategy in Research,   Innovation and Technological Development for 2014 -2020    Field of Action 4 – NGN Plan   The objectives and areas of actions described in this Digital Agenda for Romania 2014-2020 impose   cumulative efforts of European countries to achieve the targets, where Romania needs to maximize the   impact of public policies and to look at the investment in ICT as a way to transform the Romanian   economy.

The Digital Agenda for Europe is comprised of 7 pillars that allow meeting   the set targets for 2020.   1. Pillar I – Digital Single Market – enables the free flow of online services and entertainment across   national borders   2. Pillar II – Interoperability & Standards – allows seamless integration of devices, applications, data   and services that need to interact across borders   3. Pillar III – Trust & Security – increases the trust of web users in electronic services and online   transactions in order to boost consumption of ICT services   4. Pillar IV – Fast and ultra-fast Internet Access – targets investments for broadband infrastructure   in order to take advantage of new technologies and services   5. Pillar V – Research and Innovation – stimulates adequate funding for increasing the competitive   edge of innovation and research    6. Pillar VI – Enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion – bridges the digital divide for all   consumers in order to benefit equally and fully from the advantages of ICT services   7. Pillar VII – ICT-Enabled benefits for EU Society - focuses on ICT’s capability to reduce energy   consumption, support ageing citizens' lives, revolutionizes health services and deliver better public   services   Mapping the 4 action fields in Romania with the 7 pillars of Digital Agenda for Europe.    Each one of these field of actions is supported by operational objectives which will have specific targets   and will be described in full in the Digital Agenda for Romania Strategy.

These cumulative efforts for   convergence of short-term and long-term strategies for all the stakeholders involved in the governing act   were necessary in order to align all the aspects of their respective approach and form a cohesive structure,   with clear responsibilities and actions to be taken and ensuring that no real need is not covered or   expressed in the National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania.   While providing a general framework of objectives and measurements for Romania’s strategy, each field   of action is insufficient by itself. Following this rationale, lines of actions have been drafted for   implementation. For each line of action a detailed description of context, stakeholders and responsible   actors, dependencies, actions and timelines can be found in the chapter dedicated to each Field of Action.

Romania needs to attract honest tax-paying citizens and business in   order position Romania as a solid ground for investments and retain the advantage of highly educated          Page 27 of 172      professionals. A sustainable, transparent and visible economy is the only way to ensure that Romania will   bridge the gap with other EU economies and reduce as much as possible disparities in terms of living   standards   Examples: All investments should be based on establishing or improving at least one of the criteria described in Annex 1  (for example,   an investment should improve at least the security of a public service). All initiatives should describe tangible and quantifiable   outcomes that can be measured and monitor for fulfilling this principle   2. Put the citizens and businesses at the center of any initiative   Each initiative or project should keep in mind that its final purpose is providing high-valued and quality   services to their final customers – which are always (even if indirectly) the citizens and businesses in   Romania.   Examples: Each entity offering a public service should firstly identify their potential target and strive to understand their needs and   reasonably meet them. The customers and innovators voices should be included in a collaborative manner, so as to provide them the   benefits which they can use in the real world. Entities should make it easy for their customers to find, access and use the public services   3. Use standards and reference models   For each initiative, the entity responsible for its implementation will look for industry standards or   reference model that can be leveraged to provide best practices, lessons learned and to ensure a smooth   transition to a proven model.   Examples: The order of decisions for investment in information systems is: Buy, Customize, Build. This means that generally, an entity   will first look for already existing solutions that satisfy the needs of their customers, even if that implies a transformational project for   that entity. This will drive down the complexity of the environment, the costs for development and the time to deployment.    4. Formulate legislation to support the initiatives   This document acknowledges that there may exist some gaps in legislation pertaining to the use,   operation or maintenance of information systems. It is of utmost importance to create the correct climate   for change in ITC and these needs to start from the legislative framework which should clearly define the   boundaries and the cascading effects of this charter to all the underlying functions.   Examples: Where gaps are found between the current legislation and what needs to be achieved, the entities are responsible for   proposing new legislation and monitoring its implementation in a timely manner   5. Protect security and privacy   Ensuring a trusting environment for public services is crucial for a fast adoption of these in an online   environment. A small security flaw in one service can have a detrimental effect on the perceived benefits   of all others services and special care should be taken so that no data loss or breach is incurred.   Examples: All investments will take all the appropriate measures for ensuring security for services, data, and processes. Security should   cover all aspects of a service (financial security, operational security, transactional security). Security should not compromise usability   of a service (for example entities should not impose a non-standard way for authentication, registration, authorization; entities should   not issue a different token / card than the one marked as standard by the Romanian Government)   6. Encourage transparency and openness   What, how and where the state provides public services (irrespective of their online form) should be   fundamental questions and guidelines for each entity in the Romanian Government. The citizens (private   or enterprises) should be able to find the answers quickly, in an accessible manner.   Examples: Where not in conflict with any explicit mention in the law, public entities should make their data publicly available. This will   ensure better quality for the service quality and also reduce the costs associated with data quality. This action will enable individuals          Page 28 of 172      and businesses to use data in ways most helpful to them including developing applications relevant to their own needs and interests   and such increase innovation. All internal and external processes should be transparent to the customers   7. Drive continuous improvement   Processes and systems should be constantly evaluated and improved in light of their efficiency,   effectiveness and flexibility. This principle should be applied foremost on new investments, which are first-  of-a-kind for the Romanian Government, to safeguard against initial significant investments that bring only   reduced added value. Additionally, this should be applied in a continual manner to all running initiatives.   Examples: A monitoring, feedback and improvement mechanism will be put in place for the satisfaction and overall quality of a system   by each entity investing in public services. Entities should make the most out of the available information – start small and aim for   perfection   8. Aim for sustainable initiatives   Complementing the above principle, all investments in ICT sector need to be sustainable – that means self-  funding themselves or with a solid Return on Investment plan for the Government, even if not financially.   This principle will ensure that all initiatives in Romania are prioritized with respect to their costs (initial   and recurrent for the entire lifespan of the initiative)  and will not bring significant burden to the budget   without clear results, in detriment to other planned or strategic investments which can yield additional   benefits.   Examples: Entities should secure funding for the investment for a period up to 5 years for all recurrent costs of that investment   objective (including initial investment, maintenance, upgrades etc.). For all decentralized initiatives, a centralized system needs to be   put in place – ensuring uniformity and efficiency for processes, data and technology   9. Facilitate innovation   In order to create technological innovation and growth which can make possible significant enhancements   in the way Romania delivers its services, a competitive and equal chances environment should be in the   center of all Romanian initiatives.   Examples: Technology is an enabler for minimizing disparity meaning that having access to the right technology at the right time is an   enabler for reducing inequity for all major perspectives of a citizen. With proper technology in place, the current environment can   be monitored and evaluated, leading to improvements in areas found inadequate. Consecutively, the right services can be   identified and delivered through the use of technology.   10. Maximize initial investment   All investments need to make sure they achieve their full potential.   Examples: Entities should break down barriers of adoption by incentivizing the use of the service (for example reducing the time   needed to interact with that public service and/or reducing fees). Entities should put in place a mechanism for evaluating and   improving the rate of adoption.      From a tactical perspective, based on consultation with the stakeholders in Romania (both in terms of   citizens / private business as well as public sector representatives), the following table summarizes the   main issues underlying the need for change.

Romania’s          Page 30 of 172      Doing Business (DB) ranking indicates significant scope of improvement in creating conductive business   environment. ICT play an important role in improving business efficiency and extending market reach and   the social impact of ICT has become significant. ICT development is a key area to improve the   competitiveness of the business environment, to increase public sector efficiency and to reduce   bureaucracy.   Economic impact of ICT represents 5% of European GDP and in Romania the percent was 4.1% in 2011,   value decreased versus 2010.  In the ICT sector in 2011, the investments was around 3 billion RON,   significantly lower than in other countries with a total number of employees of 128.000 in the field of ITC.    The goal for 2020 is to reach 250.000 employees for Romania. While in recent years the ICT sector has   observed a slowdown in terms of development and employment, this figure takes into account the   average growth of ICT employment in Romania (7% year on year growth) before the economic downturn   and projects it for the 2014 – 2020 period as a target for future investments. Major contributions have   already been made in order to improve the growth of the ICT employment by the Romanian Government   (for example the state aid scheme for creating a minimum number of jobs).   ICT contributed to GDP growth in all economies, but productivity was increased mainly within the   developed economies and based on the below indicators Romania needs to improve the overall growth in   employment.

Direct and indirect impact on the   economy, calculated in accordance with good practice observed in other European countries who have   made similar investments may be translated into GDP growth by 13%, increasing the number of jobs by   11% and reduce administration costs by 12% during 2014-2020.   The Romanian and European Union objectives through the Digital Agenda are ambitious and involve   partnership and participation of all actors in the sector, whether it's leading ICT sector representatives,   representatives of financial institutions or international organizations supportive.   From a methodological perspective, the investment requirements were assessed for each line of action   through comparison with similar investments for the same objective done by other countries and   adjusting them to take into account the specific Romanian social-economic context. The estimated impact   for each Field of Actions was derived from statistical analysis of historical data in countries which   implemented similar projects or impact assessments published by European Commission / World Bank.   The assessed investment calculation for each line of investment was performed based on the following:    Values estimated at the level of the European Union for the implementation of the Digital Agenda   and presented within the analysis of the impact of the proposed measures     Values generated from studies published by the JRC – Joint Research Centre, European   Commission    Values published for investments which are comparable identified at the level of other countries –   it refers to investments with the same perimeter, performed under comparable conditions     Values resulted from the statistical analysis performed based on the figures recorded in countries   which finalized similar investments     Similar investment rates   These values were adjusted afterwards with relevant indicators for Romania:    The number of inhabitants – ex. Total estimated investments for the computerization of the public   services were estimated at a total level for the European Union; Romania’s rate was estimated   based on the average cost per inhabitant, the population of Romania and the country’s level of   development     The Gross Domestic Product – the estimated investments for Romania were adjusted at the total   economy value expressed through the  Gross Domestic Product    Also, the calculations performed both for the estimation of the future investments which will be   performed by Romania within the Digital Agenda strategy, as well as for the estimation of the impact upon   the economy, were performed starting from and considering the methodology published by the European   Commission for the performance of such calculations.

In the last   years there has been a visible progress within all European Union countries in terms of the general   framework for the eGovernment Strategy which has as a starting point best practices and methodology.   The strategy and mission of the public administration in Romania has been created in accordance with the   Digital Agenda for Europe 2020 and will use the resources, proven experience that can be found in the   framework for electronic public administration used by the EU states.   eGovernment 2.0 Definition   The fundamental principle for which Romania needs to implement eGovernment 2.0 is foremost related   to the citizens’ cultural and behavioral transformations, with added benefits coming from the social   aspects of the interaction between the Government and its users (e-services, e-democracy, e-  participation, e-management etc.). To fulfill its full potential, it is important not to limit the scope of this   initiative to a restrictive definition of delivering transactional public services over the Internet, but mainly,   eGovernment should mean “the transformational approach enabled by the use of information technology   to offer better public services by the government, while engaging its citizens and supporting government   operations”.   2.1.2 European context   The ranking resulted from the survey conducted by United Nations (eGovernment Development 2012   Survey) reflects the supremacy of European countries in defining and implementing efficient strategies in   this area.            Page 35 of 172      Source: EGovernment Development Survey 2012, conducted by United Nations      The general development of economic, social and cultural life in European countries, combined with the   new requirements from the European Union and the new technologies from ICT will allow the countries to   experiment similar moves towards eGovernment and identify the challenges on how to adapt the policy in   order to achieve the goals.   The governments of developed countries in the world decided to adopt the paradigm of eGovernment   services focused on the need of citizens.    Good practices in the field have proved in time that a solid implementation of eGovernment must be   regarded completely from the following perspectives:    1. Public services and connection between them   2. eGovernment platforms and interfaces    3. Local and central, public and private structures involved in such process and in the collaboration   between them   4. Work procedures for the development of eGovernment solutions and for the management of   subsequent eGovernment activity   5. Electronic centralized system of authentication of users and unique identification of the users   prepared so as to incorporate all needs of electronic identification resulted from the   implementation of online public services   Increasing the efficiency and transparency of the public administration and improving the business   environment represents short term strategic priorities aimed at contributing to the effective approach of   the major obstacles regarding the economic growth and employment.      eGovernment Approach in Romania   Public services and their efficiency are considered to have a significant impact on the economic and social   condition across the country. The main direction is to use eGovernment projects to modernize   Government Agencies and Local Governments offering services for citizens and businesses, in an   integrated, transparent and secure manner. The current Programme for Government is the expression of   an outlook on Romania’s future and will be in alignment with the long term development strategy.   The intention is to create a modern public administration, become more proactive, increase internal   efficiency, achieve a greater transparency, reduce the operational expenses, interact with citizens and   develop new sources of growth.   The Strategy for eGovernment in Romania as outlined in this document is to focus on the services that   provide elements to Life Events and bring them on the 4th level of sophistication. Prioritizing the   government services pertaining to the Life Events will bring a significant improvement in the way the   citizens and business perceive the Government, as refining those services will alleviate much of the   burden from the way in which they interact with public bodies. Also, we consider that this approach can   have synergize with other eGovernment strategies in Romania.        Page 36 of 172         2.1.3 National context   In 2013, according to the European Commission Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014, Romania has scored only   5% regarding the use of eGovernment services by the citizens. The target that Romania has assumed to   reach is 35% until the end of 2020.      Romanian indicators pertaining to eGovernment   Currently, the EGDI index (eGovernment Development Index) granted to Romania by the United Nations,   during the latest study on eGovernment (0. 5632) is under the average value granted in Eastern Europe   (0.6333). This index is calculated as an accumulation of three factors:     online services (estimated in terms of the % of use of online services depending on the 4 degrees  of sophistication),     telecom infrastructure (calculated depending on % of internet users, % of subscribers of fixed  telephony, % subscribers of mobile telephony, % internet subscribers in fixed line and %  broadband subscribers)     the index of human capital (generated depending on the education level noticed on adults and %   of school enrolments).      Sursa: EGovernment Survey 2014, United Nations        Page 37 of 172      Current status:    In Europe, the  average usage of eGovernment in European Union countries taken together is   around 40% of EU population    In Romania, the % of citizens who have used eGovernment services in 2013 has reached 5%, with   an assumed target of 35% to reach until the end of 2020.          Source: http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/scoreboard/romania      2.1.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Romania’s strategic pursuits for eGovernment and Interoperability   In pursuing the desired outcomes for Romania outlined by the Digital Agenda for Europe and in order to   achieve the national targets referenced above, Romania needs to concentrate on 3 key aspects of the   governing act from a technological perspective, hereby referred to as Strategic Lines of Development,   which will enable a full transformation of how the public interacts with the public services in Romania:    Romania needs to provide better public services through the use of eGovernment 2.0. While   there have many major steps in Romania in the later years in Romania (from access perspective as   well as implementing major information systems), the majority of initiatives faced challenges in   terms of adoption, quality, legislation and uniformity. Concentrating on new or improved public   services, but with a coherent model in place for ensuring greater impact in the social-economic        Page 38 of 172      context, together with restructuring the rationale behind providing those public services will lead   to beneficial results in every layer of the society.    Public entities need to increase the adoption of eGovernment Services. Without proper adoption   of public services in their computerized form, the impact of the Digital Agenda will be reduced.    Public entities need to optimize the use of technology for effective government operations. As   technology is an enabler for reducing financial and administrative overheads and maximizing   Romania’s needs to look into the ways in which to reduce unnecessary burdens.       Lines of Actions for addressing the Strategic Lines of Development   Below is a comprehensive list of action points that need to be followed and executed in meet the desired   outcomes for the Digital Agenda for Romania and as a broader scope, support Romania’s targets for   Europe 2020.    Lines of Development Lines of Actions Rationale   Provide better public services   through the use of   eGovernment 2.0   Define the Informational   Perimeter of Public Services   (Strategic)   Romania will focus firstly on implementing   the services derived from “life events” as   these are the services which have the   greatest impact in the interaction with   eGovernment.   Romania will use the toolset offered by this   methodology to asses and improve its   current offer of e-services following the   steps:     Define “life-events” activities in   Romanian social and economic   landscape : divide the process   related to each “life event” into   specific activities     Discover the current situation,   identifying for each activity :    o the public services   involved and their   availability in the online   environment;   o TIC systems that provide   the services and their   interoperability degree.   Identify the socio-economic needs regarding   the further development of on-line public   services and prioritize accordingly their   implementation using the customer-centric   approach defined by this methodology.        Page 39 of 172      The main actor of this initiative will be the   new public institutional structure that will be   created to coordinate and supervise the   development of eGovernment in Romania   (please see appendix 5 – Guiding Principles).     Implement an institutional   structure meant to support the   implementation of eGovernment   projects   (Strategic)   In order to implement the eGovernment   system as a program (a set of projects which   target a common final goal), it has to be   instituted a centrally coordinated facility,   meant to include obligatorily a   transformation flow, which on its turn   facilitates, supports and promotes the active   involvement of citizens in preparing online   public services and promotion by   implementation of online collaborative   systems and participative online services.   Also, the experience of some countries more   developed show that decentralized   implementation by local representatives is   not effective in time, considering that they   do not assume entirely the responsibilities.   Their role should be turned into a satellite   role – part of implementation, of facilitator.   The two new formed public bodies (Digital   Agenda Agency and Technical Economic   Committee) will be the main actors of this   initiative. They will oversee all Romanian   implementations pertaining to the Digital   Agenda in Romania and will support the   implementation of eGovernment project   that are in line with the Guiding Principles   and Public Services Criteria.   Promote better standards   (Operational)   By using the open standards, the   information administrated by the systems is   available into stable, public, vendor-  independent formats that make it accessible   to a large audience over a long period of   time. Consequently, the information of   public interest – statistics, laws, research   results etc. – will not depend on a specific   software product and it may be accessed by   any computer literate citizen that will be   able to disseminate it to the rest of the   society   All public bodies will adhere to this Line   Action.   Identification of data registries The most practical option for actual        Page 40 of 172      and of relevant owners of data   registries for interoperability   (Operational)   identification of actions related to   interoperability of informational systems   used in the public administration is the   conducting of a feasibility study with direct   identification of both the entire   informational ecosystem implemented on   the level of public administration, of data   registries involved and of related owners of   data registries and by marking the relations   and dependencies between the related   informational flows.    All the public bodies will adhere to this Line   Action. The responsible public body for   centralizing the data will be the Technical   Economic Committee.   Promote transparency and   openness   (Operational)   Use of open source and open standards and   providing open access to the application   already purchased and susceptible to be   implemented on the level of public   administration   All public bodies will adhere to this Line   Action.   e-Participation    (Enabler)   The Ministry for Information Society will   develop an electronic channel allowing   citizens and businesses to suggest potential   new eGovernment services and to track   progress of their suggestions. Also, all public   bodies that provide services pertaining to   Life events will use this channel for   improving their services.   Additionally, in order to leverage new   technologies and to ease the burden of   paying for online services, ghiseul.ro will   become a one stop shop for paying for   public services, with multiple channels for   delivery (for example: paying online by card,   SMS pay, m-Wallet, etc.)   All public bodies will adhere to this Line   Action.

The   switch to electronic communication   between public institutions and citizens or   businesses requires new forms of   identification and authentication using a   personal signature.   In order to simplify the access to   eGovernment services it is necessary either a   single sign on mechanism allowing the users,   once authenticated, to use the services to   which they are entitled or a unique element   of identification, known by all suppliers of   eGovernment services.   This identification element may consist in an   electronic identity stored on the electronic   identity card as in the case of other states,   members of European Union. In order to   achieve this, it is necessary a coordinated   involvement of several institutions, including   the institutions directly involved in issues   related to data security.

The occurrence of cyber incidents is mainly determined by human or procedural reasons. Thus, some of   the incidents were identified as the main cause of the lack of consistent security policies to protect data   that is  collected, handled, processed and stored by computer networks..   Cyber Security Definition   Cyber Security is defined as \"the state of normality that results after provisioning proactive and reactive   measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and non-repudiation of electronic   information, of private and public resources and services in the cybernetic environment. These reactive   and proactive measures can include policies, concepts, standards, security guides, risk management,   training and awareness activities, implementation of technical solution to project the cybernetic   infrastructure, identity management, outcome management.” 2   2.2.2 European context   At EU level, the European Commission is funding several projects to protect critical infrastructure   information via the CIIP initiative, for border security and resilience of critical information and   communications infrastructure by stimulating and supporting the development of national and   multinational capabilities in this area. At the beginning of 2013, published a proposal on European Cyber    Security Strategy was published, for a directive concerning measures to ensure a high common level of   network and information security across the Union.   A new Cyber Security Strategy was developed by the European Commission which comprises internal   market, justice and home affairs and foreign policy angles of the cyberspace issues. The Strategy is   accompanied by the technical legislative proposal by the European Commission's Directorate General   Connect to strengthen the security of information systems in the EU and is comprised of 4 major priorities:                                                                2 http://www.cert-ro.eu/files/doc/StrategiaDeSecuritateCiberneticaARomaniei.pdf        Page 46 of 172       Freedom and openness    The laws, norms and EU's core values apply as much in the cyberspace as in the physical world:    Developing cyber security capacity building    Fostering international cooperation in cyberspace issues    To respond to EU cyber strategy, to address cyber security in a comprehensive manner, the activity should   be spread over three sub-key pillars - NIS network and information security – law enforcement – defense,   sub-pillars that already operate in various institutions in Romania horizontally and vertically as in the   following scheme:         Source: European Commission Strategy http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-  and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security      In its Pillar III \"Security and Trust\", the Digital Agenda for Europe defines a series of cyber security   initiatives at European level to ensure cyber security incident response capabilities and the protection of   personal data.   In this context, the responsibility of the national cyber infrastructure protection, whose compromise   would undermine national security or prejudice the Romanian state, is equal to all institutions and   companies that own such facilities, primarily the state institutions constituting the Cyber Security   Operations Council in accordance with the Cyber Security Strategy of Romania.   In order to achieve a strengthened network and information security policy, cooperation is needed   between EU governments, public institutions and private companies to improve the exchange of   information and to ensure that security issues will be effectively addressed and solved. ENISA will provide   the exchange and collaboration. A real-time response to threats is required, implementing and improving   the CERT network in Europe, including the European institutions. At the national level it is necessary to   develop the operational capabilities of CERT-RO as required by law, to monitor and implement the   principles provided by EC, as well as to draft amendments for improving business expertise of CERT-RO.   In fighting against cyber-attacks on the information systems, Member States must amend the existing   criminal law on attacks against information systems. The main purpose is to provide greater authority to   the European legislation on cybercrime. The initiative will improve the security of citizens and businesses,   and it is expected to have a positive effect on companies, as information systems repair costs are very   high. At the national level, it will provide points of contact for complaints and information gathering on   http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security      Page 47 of 172      cyber security incidents either in an automated manner or secured through direct communication as   appropriate. It will also identify, analyze and classify security incidents in the cyber infrastructure, as per   the area of competence. CERT-RO will develop proposals to amend the legislative framework to foster the   development of cyber security infrastructure that provides public utility functionality or information   society services. It will also continue to develop the partnership with ENISA on combating cyber incidents   and to establish task forces to work jointly at EU level in order to increase the speed of response to   attacks.   To achieve a European platform on cybercrime, Europol in cooperation with the European Commission   has called for the integration of all relevant EU platforms in only one. The platform should serve as a   center for collecting and storing information about cyber-attacks. It will be the major element in the   European Centre CyberCrime. At the national level it will be carried out the analysis and optimization of   existing security platforms, eventually merging and consolidating their national platform and access to   Europol and staff training in fighting against cybercrime. The implementation, monitoring and   interconnection between the European and national platforms will be achieved.   In order to intensify the fight against cybercrime at international and European level it will be enhanced   the cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against cyber-attacks. In this respect, in the EU   we will need to create a European forum for discussion between the national government to integrate risk   management, and to create a public-private partnership. Regarding the transatlantic cooperation it is   necessary to improve the EU-US relations for the application of the European Commission's cyber security   plan and to have an ongoing dialogue and exchange of information with the U.S.   In this matter, at national level, we will consider implementing processes of security risk management in   the public administration. At the same time, we will aim at enhancing consultations with similar bodies in   the EU and U.S., and at exchanging specialists with the U.S. and other EU countries for 1-2 years, hiring   these specialists and their active involvement when they return home.      2.2.3 National context   Cyber Security Approach in Romania   Risks of cyber incidents occurrence are caused by human or procedural reasons. Thus, some of the   incidents were identified as the main cause of the lack of consistent security policies to protect data that   are taken, handled, processed and stored by computer networks.   A positive development in the field of cyber security is the setting up of CERT -RO (http://www.cert-ro.eu),   which is the national contact point for similar structures and is responsible for the development and   distribution of public policies to prevent and fight against incidents taking place in the national cyber   infrastructure.   Also, Romania's cyber security strategy adopted by Decision no. 271/2013 sets out the objectives,   principles and main directions of action for understanding, preventing and deterring threats,   vulnerabilities and cyber security risks and promotes Romania's interests, values and national objectives in   cyberspace. The strategy and action plan aim at setting targets for cyber security and lines of action for   the coming years. The Romanian approach is aligned to the guidelines proposed by the European   Commission in the Digital Agenda and its Pillar III - Trust and Security – as well as to the progress of other   European Union Member States.   The topic \"Network Information Security\" is a real priority of both the European Commission and national   structures. Raising cybersecurity awareness, issues such as viruses and malware, how to use passwords,   social engineering - blogging, how to use your computer at home, how to use \"social media\", how to work   http://www.cert-ro.eu/      Page 48 of 172      outside the office, send and receive emails, use fax machines and all types of data structures is one of the   high priorities of the national structures with responsibilities in the field.   The National Cyber Security System (NSCC) is the general framework for cooperation that brings together   public authorities and institutions with responsibilities and capabilities in the field, in order to coordinate   national actions for cyberspace security, including the cooperation with academia and business trade   associations and nongovernmental organizations-NGOs.   The National Center for Response to Cyber Security Incidents - CERT-RO is a structure of expertise and   research and development in the cyber infrastructure protection, under the coordination of the Ministry   for Information Society, which has the capacity to prevent, analyze, identify and respond to cyber security   incidents of information systems.   Developing cooperation between the public and private sectors in order to ensure cyber security   represents a priority for action at the national level, given that cyberspace include cyber infrastructure   owned and managed by both the State and private entities.   Currently, institutions within the National Cyber Security System creates, at the level of public institutions,   the technical and operational framework in order to ensure interoperability between computer security   components in order to protect the cyber infrastructure within the public and increase the availability and   level of confidence in the specialized public services provided to citizens, businesses and government.   Romanian Indicators pertaining to Cyber Security   According to a Eurostat survey on ICT3 usage by individuals and households:    45% of the Romanian users use the Internet at least once a week    52% of the Romanian users are at least fairly confident in buying online or online banking    33% of Romanian users are concerned about misuse of the their personal information online    37% of Romanian users are concerned about security related aspects of online payments.      2.2.4 Strategic Lines of Development    Strategic Lines of Development for Cyber Security in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Actions Description   Establishing the necessary   conceptual and organizational   framework for cyber security      Establishing and operationalization   of the  national cyber security   system   (Strategic)       Setting up the platform for   cooperation and harmonization of   the existing CERT capabilities at   national level that should capitalize   the tools, will work to strengthen   expertise in cyber risk, by fostering   synergies between different action   plans on cyber security (military and   civil, public-private, government,   non-government);

Understanding and managing risks   related to the adoption and integration of cloud computing capabilities into public bodies is a key   challenge. Effectively managing the security and resilience issues related to cloud computing capabilities is   prompting many public bodies to innovate, and some cases to rethink, their processes for assessing risk   and making informed decisions related to this new service delivering model.   Currently, a range of issues faced by public authorities in terms of managing the infrastructure of   informational systems entails a careful analysis of the organization strategy. Among these, some of the   more important issues are:    IT infrastructures existing on the level of different governmental organizations have problems of   scalability, effectiveness of costs, and are often not updated to the current standards     Updating technical skills for the staff serving applications in different governmental organizations   becomes a less efficient process due to heterogeneous and / or old technology, not complying   with standards, insulation of IT infrastructure and people in different institutions, etc.    Heterogeneous security solutions which reflect in greater security risk    Granular purchase of hardware and software solutions does not provide transparency on   governmental level.      Cloud Computing can address all these issues by:    Enabling rapid and cost-effective procurement of information systems / services for all state   agencies    Eliminating the duplication of effort    Reducing risk management costs         Cloud Computing Definition   Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, over a   network. At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of converged infrastructure and   shared services.   2.3.2 European context   On European level, intense activities are carried out for the standardization of concepts related with Cloud   Technologies. In the communication submitted by the European Commission \"Unleashing the Potential of   Cloud Computing in Europe\", one provides the first definitions and European strategies in this field. Based   on the materials published by European Commission, Cloud Computing is understood as being a capacity   of storing, processing and accessing data encountered on remote calculation systems. In this model, the   users may assign calculation resources almost unlimited for which they need major capital investments.   The adoption in private sector of Cloud technologies within the European Union exceeds 64%, however   the organizations are still circumspect in implementing them. The general inclination is to use hybrid   patterns of Cloud and testing non-critical services.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converged_infrastructure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_services      Page 52 of 172      The adoption of Cloud technologies in the public sector is not very different from private one. The main   issues followed in the public sector are the reduction of costs and the increase of the quality of services   supplied by Cloud platforms.   Having such major benefits, noticed or estimated, the European Commission proposed the Cloud   technologies for economic development and reduction of negative impact on environment of economic   activities. Thus, in order to stimulate the development of Cloud 3 major actions may be undertaken:    Standardization of the series of data and informational applications    Adjusting the terms and conditions for contracts    Determining a partnership for European Cloud which supports innovation and development in the   public sector      2.3.3 National context   Cloud Computing Approach in Romania   Cloud computing has several advantages which also Romanian Government and public authorities can   benefit from. Therefore, we have looked to the couple of European countries who already adopted cloud   computing in the public sector or are planning to do so. As a conclusion, the dominant cloud computing   deployment model in those countries is a so-called G-Cloud (Governmental Cloud), a private or community   cloud especially designed for national governmental use.   The Governmental Cloud has a double role. The first issue refers to the relation of governments with   citizens in the eGovernment context. But there is also a secondary issue, equally important, related to   determining a technical work frame for the interoperability of governmental organizations. The concept of   governmental Cloud approaches both issues combining a particular concept of a hybrid Cloud with an area   of public Cloud for citizens and an area of private Cloud for interoperability.    In the context of eGovernment and creation of an interoperability frame in the space of public services the   governmental Cloud is a versatile infrastructure of support which presents certain indisputable technological   advantages such as:    Lower operation costs    Necessary optimized of human resources    flexible infrastructure adjusted to changes in the context of a faster launch of eGovernment   services            2.3.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for Cloud Computing in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Actions Description   Creation of a safe and scalable IT   infrastructure, common to all   organizations of public sector    Consolidation of the Acquisition   Process for the Public Institutions IT   Infrastructure   (Enabler)   The pattern changes the manner by   which IT products, infrastructure and   services are purchased, managed   and used independently by the   organizations of public institutions,   by using common elements of   infrastructure which reduce        Page 53 of 172      significantly the costs and complexity   of interoperation of eGovernment   services. Similarly, the pattern of   infrastructure proposed allows the   use by all public institutions of   common elements of IT   infrastructure such as the courier   services, the collaboration platforms,   the data connections, the security   platforms (on the level of data   centers).

All public bodies   will adhere to this Line of  Action   Reduction of number of data   centers in the public institutions and   consolidation of infrastructure   Data Centers Consolidation   (Enabler)   Currently, the data centers are   encountered within all governmental   institutions.    The result of the action of reducing   the number or the size of data   centers will be the centralization   within a sole data center with a high   level of availability, security,   redundancy for protection in case of   disasters, protection to data loss,   etc. IT services which may be   supplied by third parties – in   outsourcing business model – must   be first identified, and then planned   for migration to the cloud   All services which are provided from   the data centers in progress of being   consolidated will be submitted to   analysis to check which of them   must be:    either migrated as such    merge with other systems  already centralized    re-designed    or decommissioned   Responsible: Ministry for   Information Society. All public bodies   will adhere to this Line of Action      The main benefits are reduction of costs, improvement of services, and much faster process of   deployment of the new services:        Page 55 of 172       A pattern which allows the reduction of costs durably for IT services in the public sector, including  hardware, software and operations    Reduction of costs for the migration of services towards new platforms      Reduction of the number of applications and services (redundant) in the public sector    Reduction of the time and cost for procurement of new services    Shifting IT investments to more efficient computing platforms    Ability to use shared applications for common Government functions (ERP, HR, SCM, GIS etc.)    Promoting the use of Green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of  government data centers    Cost savings by providing common services, utilities, and facilities to multiple public institutions  who had previously enacted these operations independently    The attention can be focused on development, deployment and management of cloud-based  infrastructures and services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) over large-scale, distributed, heterogeneous,  dynamic computing and storage environments    The IT infrastructure within the cloud that is faster, more secure, and continually refreshed with  the latest application versions and updates    Agencies can consolidate servers, departments can consolidate data centers and move to one  email system, and even across different departments services like payroll applications, can be  shared    Improved services for citizens by reducing the time by which a governmental service is rendered     Reduction of carbon emissions by optimizing the use of the resources of data center,  decommissioning of redundant services and purchase of \"green\" systems with regards to energy  consumption    Increase of security on the level of data center by implementation of up-to-date, standard and  proved security solutions.  Data will be much less prone to loss because the data backup processes  within a cloud environment will render the data much safer.          Page 56 of 172      2.4 SOCIAL MEDIA   2.4.1 Introduction   Preamble   We have seen how the social media environment has evolved over the past years, from a communication   channel between citizens to a business marketing tool.   Social media, together with the wider internet have become useful business tools in other countries,   currently helping governments to be part of the conversation. They have understood that they cannot   isolate themselves and that they can provide better services when consulting with and involving the   citizen.     Social Media Definition   Social Media are defined as specific Web 2.0 communication tools which enables people to interact,   generate and share content using the online environment. These social platforms can be seen in several   forms:    Social news: dedicated websites where the user can read about different topics, give feedback by  voting or commenting on the articles.     Social networks: platforms that allow the user to connect and interact with other people, based  on mutual interests and experiences, and also to publish and recommend content based on  personal/public accounts.     Blogs/Forums: platforms that are owned by people, communities or businesses of any kind which  deliver general or personalized content. The difference between them and a website is that blogs  & forums are generally build on free platforms or unique domains and can allow a more direct  interaction with the target audience. Their users and beneficiaries can comment or add articles  within these platforms.      Social bookmarking: websites that allow the user to publish, recommend and comment any kind  of content. Bu using the “bookmark” function, the user can find and bookmark sites and  information of interest that can be accessed from anywhere and also, they can be shared with  other users.    Photo/video sharing: websites where the user is given the possibility to create, upload, publish,  share and receive feedback on photo and video content.    Social media are one of the most famous and used instruments for creating online communities, based on  shared values and interests. These virtual communities can create, use and share high volume of data and  information, can conduct to creating and developing new social trends and can determine their present  and future evolution.      2.4.2 European context   Analyzing the European context, at the beginning of 2014 we know that there are 293 million social media   users, of which 193 million accessing social media through mobile devices4. Otherwise said, 40% of the   total European population is represented by active social network users.                                                                 4 Global Web Index, Q2, 2014 (https://www.globalwebindex.net/) via wearesocial.net   https://www.globalwebindex.net/      Page 57 of 172                                                   A recent study conducted by TNS Digital Life states that 42% use social media at least once a week, while   27% use social media every day, or almost every day. These percentages give us an idea of how many   people one could reach using social media.   There are notable differences in the geographical use of social networking and social media technologies   amongst EU Member States; the biggest users of social media are UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.    However, there is also a generational split as younger people use the Internet less outside social   networking sites in all Member States, while older people who use social networking sites are practically        Page 58 of 172      the same as the percentage of Internet users. The generational split has two main components: 15-39 and   over 40. These differences have a major impact on the effective deployment and uptake of social   networking and social media by business and public sector organizations.   Romania’s intention is to use their good example and drive innovation further in our country, by tailoring   and implementing the good practices used so far, in this field of action. Through this field of action,   Romania needs to pursue a revaluing of the current communication process of public entities in Romania,   by modernizing communication channels. The context of this approach is favorable in Romania, as recent   statistics (published by Quintly.com), has placed Romania in top 10 countries worldwide of increase in   number of users for online media platforms (4.78% users every 4 weeks).

Based on a study published by Eurostat in December 2012, 73% of Romanians are using   the internet to read newspapers online. Posting messages on social media occupies with 48% the second   place in the classification of the motivation for using the internet, followed by searching for tourist   services, creation of a website and internet banking, the last reason being claimed only by 8% of users.   However, the most common activities in online environment remain the sending/receiving emails and   searching for information about goods and services.   Public institutions in Romania (Ministries, Municipalities) need to involve the citizen, as their primary   customer, in their work, their decisions, research and implementation. The citizen should be considered   the main source for feedback and solution improvement, because he is the main beneficiary of their   services. Social media and e-petitions are able to increase citizen involvement into the government   decisions (acts). This will ensure that policy is developed in consultation with citizens.   Currently, the Romanian public institutions have low social media representation. Most of those   institutions have developed a one way type of communication, reporting information, but not giving the   possibility of real time comments and feedback.       2.4.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for Social Media in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Actions Description   Modernization of Communication   Structures,  Communication   Channel & Indicators   Define key principles and business   framework for the communication   process within the public institutions   (Strategic)   Establish key coordinators and teams   for the communication process – PR   Communication Departments within   the public institutions    (Strategic)   Define the communication plan   tailored for each public institution   (Enabler)   Design the conversation for 1 to   many, rather than use repeatedly 1   to 1, which is cheaper and quicker –   one of the most useful opportunities   of social media   (Operational)   Structure:    Single web portal with access to   all public institutions websites   and public services.    Public institutions websites with   real time feedback option   implemented.

It is both a philosophy   of action and a profession of faith, a practice and a goal. But its application to the field of public data is not   obvious. Open Government Data can be used to help the public better understand what the government   does and how will it performs, and to hold it accountable for wrongdoing or unachieved result. Also, open   data is a contributing factor to innovation in the private sector. As such, where not in conflict with any   explicit mention in the law, public entities should make their data publicly available.    The concept of “Open Data” involves making available to public freely data accessible, reusable and re-  sharable. Open Data is applied in fields such as scientific environment and governmental environment.    Open Data relies on 3 principles:   1. Transparency- the data is published by the directly competent institutions and it has to be easy to  understand, amend, reuse and mainly in a standard format in order to allow easy integration in  other informational or analysis systems    2. Participation – the data may also be obtained from public demands therefore the citizen- administration interaction is provided in order to serve their needs    3. Collaboration – open data will provide opportunities to work together (improvement of service,  generation of data sets) with natural persons, as well as the groups in the public sector, non- profit, university and private in order to answer the needs of community      Open Data Definition   Open data means that data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish,  without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. The final goals of the open  data movement are similar to those of other \"Open\" movements such as open source, open hardware,  open content, and open access.   2.5.2 European Context   The European Commission work in the area of open data is focusing on generating value through re-use of   a specific type of data – public sector information, sometimes also referred to as government data.        Page 62 of 172      They are supporting open data for 4 reasons:    Public data has significant potential for re-use in new products and services    Addressing social challenges – having more data openly available will help us discover new and   innovative solutions;    Achieving efficiency gains through sharing data inside and between public administrations;    Fostering participation of citizens in political and social life and increasing transparency of government   In accordance with the Digital Agenda for Europe, the Member States can contribute to making open data   a reality through the rapid adoption, transposition and implementation of the revised Directive on the re-  use of public sector information. This will create the conditions for economic activity based on open data,   and will stimulate cross-border applications.      Open Data place among governmental projects worldwide   Commitment Activity Focus Area Number of projects   eGovernment 199   Open Data 190   Citizen Engagement 131   Access to Information/ Freedom of Information 93   Budgets & Financial Planning 79   Sub-national Governance 57   Public Servants/Civil Service  50   Anti-Corruption 34   Procurement 29   Capacity Building/ Training 28   Source: Global Integrity, July 2012     In any case, the national particularities are essential to take into account when someone wants  to build up a working Open Government Action Plan.      2.5.3 National context   Until now, a total of 64 Governments from all around the globe are part of Open Government Partnership   (OGP) or the Partnership for an Open Governance (PGD). Governments joining OGP in different phases are   committing to open government across four key areas:    fiscal and budget transparency    freedom of information    asset disclosures for public officials    citizen engagement 5                                                                  5  http://www.opengovpartnership.org/        Page 63 of 172      In April 2012, the Romanian Government has strengthened its commitment and, with the approval of the   Memorandum on participation in the OGP, has taken on the 2012-2014 National Action Plan for the   implementation of commitments.   The Government’s goal was to fulfill the open government principles – promoting the governmental   transparency, using new technologies to increase efficiency and to fight corruption, and increasing the civil   participation in the public life. Thus, the main measures of the National Action Plan 2012-2014 has been   included the following areas: Increasing the public access to open data; improving the delivery of public   services in electronic format (eGovernment); increasing the citizen participation in the decision-making   process.   The OGP National Action Plan reflects the priorities of the Romanian Government with regard to   promoting good governance. The short and medium-term measures planned to be effected express   Romania’s determination to implement the OGP commitments, with a special note being given to the   following challenges:    improving public services    increasing public integrity    more effectively managing public resources     2.5.4 Strategic Lines of development   Open Data Approach in Romania   Openness and transparency are the key words on how the Government can be transformed. A significant   and most marking benefit politically speaking is that of significant improvement of transparency and   Strategic Lines of Development supervision of administrative act. The Open Data impact on the perception   of citizen related to the corruption of the system of public administration is major due to the free, direct   and complete access concerning public activity and the offer of instruments of direct supervision of the   performance of the activity of public administration. Freeing up public data and putting it in people's   hands can help them have more of a say in the reform of public services.   Concepts Lines of Action Comments   Open data – making available to public   freely accessible data, reusable and re-  sharable.

The benefits of Open Data proved to be   closed to the applicability of using the   information, than its availability. Thus,   the simple collection of data and   presentation of it was not enough, the   added value to which the citizens   answered was related to data   processing and presentation of   structured information in order to   Identification and achievement of the  possibilities of combination and data  processing    (Operational)   Definition and use of relevant standards  and format to be used for presentation  of data (for example: open standards)   (Strategic)   Improvement of the degree of  presentation of civil society and its  capacity to use and integrate the                                                                6 FOI – Freedom of Information        Page 64 of 172      information generated by Open Data   (Enabler)   support both them and the civil society,   in taking certain decisions.

By high amount of data one understands an interval included between dozens of Terabytes and several   Petabytes of information. An additional challenge is the fact that the data sets proposed for analysis have   a high dynamic, forming a set of data “in movement” which changes permanently, several times in real   time. The third challenge is related to the format in which such information is encountered and may be   approached, varying between structured, semi-structured formats and non-structured formats.   The Big Data systems may provide information both to governmental organisations and to citizens from   different sources which may be identified as follows:    Paper document (physical environment)    Digital documents    Points of access to governmental web    Websites located on Internet    Social Media    Operational systems available  The information provided by Big Data systems does not include personal information or information   restricted by mechanisms of control and confidentiality.      Big Data Definition   Big Data is the term for a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process   using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. There's nothing   new about the notion of big data, which has been around since at least 2001. Big Data is related with the   information owned by your private organization or public institution obtained and processed through new   techniques to produce value in the best way possible.   2.6.2 European context   Data creation is occurring at an unexpected record rate. Market research analysts believes that   organizations that are best able to make real time business decisions using Big Data solutions will thrive,   while those that are unable to embrace and make use of this shift will increasingly find themselves at a   competitive disadvantage in the market and face potential failure.    Big data, a general term for the massive amount of digital data being collected from all sorts of sources, is   too large, raw, or unstructured for analysis through conventional relational database techniques. Many   white papers, journal articles, and business reports have proposed ways governments can use big data to   help them serve their citizens and overcome national challenges (such as rising health care costs, job   creation, natural disasters and nationals security).   At the European level, the improvement of the analytics and data processing, especially Big Data, will  allow to:        Page 66 of 172       transform Europe's service industries by generating a wide range of innovative information  products and services;    increase the productivity of all sectors of the economy through improved business intelligence;   more adequately address many of the challenges that face our societies;   improve research and speed up innovation;   achieve cost reductions through more personalized services;   increase efficiency in the public sector   get insights from data that can prevent or deter fraud and abuse.   Currently, the European Technology Platform for Software and Services NESSI, together with partners  from the FP7 project Big, has drafted a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) on Big Data Value  for Europe. The objective of the SRIA is to describe the main research challenges and needs for advancing  Big Data Value in Europe in the next 5 to 10 years.   2.6.3 National context  Big data analytics can improve efficiency and effectiveness across the broad range of government  responsibilities, by improving existing processes and operations and enabling completely new ones.  After  a high level analysis, we discovered that health and human services organizations face constant pressure  to collect more revenue, reduce operational costs per case, ensure eligible citizens receive benefits, lower  claims adjudication time, improve collections and maintain program integrity. An important direction will  be in the area of tax organizations which are having a high pressure on collecting more revenue, in  reducing operational costs and improve collections.     2.6.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Big Data Approach in Romania   Concepts Lines of Action Comments   Big Data - refers to an   informational initiative which   solves the issue related to   processing high amounts of data   (an interval included between   dozens of Terabytes and several   Petabytes of information), within a   limited interval.

Technology is a high spend consideration for most schools yet smarter   spending on the right equipment and infrastructure ensures that learners are engaged and motivated and   that every pupil reaches their potential.   In recent years, ICT skills have become essential in the learning process, once with the development of   technology and thus of e-learning products. Romania is part of the group of countries where ICT subjects   are transversal, specific skills being developed and included into the teaching process of other subjects,   thus the assessment not being conducted directly.   ICT Education Definition   ICT is a framework of technologies designed for many purposes. Specifically for the education domain, it   can enhance communication, creation and information management through all its components:   computers, the Internet, broadcasting technologies and telephony. The benefits are translated into   improvement in efficiency and effectiveness of education at all levels and in both formal and non-formal   settings.   3.1.2 European context   An advanced digital society requires that most citizens can regularly access the Internet and benefit from   the opportunities if offers. For this reason, the European Union has set up the ambitious objective, by   2015, of having at least 75% of the citizens and 60% of people in disadvantaged groups using the Internet   on a regular basis, and of reducing the percentage of population that has never used it to below 15%.   A forerunner factor of using computers and the Internet in the learning process is the pupil access to these   technologies. Besides the horizontal measures of improvement in the number of broadband connections,   development of digital infrastructure and increase of digital inclusion, the best practices show as   appropriate the direct intervention in education, an acceleration factor of digitalization through the role of   children within the family. Thus, measures such as the provision of equipment and relevant infrastructure   in schools and ICT specific training courses are directly related to the improvement of the quality of the   learning process and digital skills.      3.1.3 National context   ICT in Education Approach in Romania   The ICT instruments supporting the learning process are the most representative in the support   of development pursuant to the completion of classes and for continuous training of citizens, as   well as for facilitating digital inclusion. Such instruments provide flexibility to the learning and   specialization process in time, entailing a new specialization when the economy of a country        Page 69 of 172      provides other possibilities and development of entrepreneurial sense related to the professional   evolution of individual. Such approach is perfectly aligned to the strategy of economic   development based on smart specialization which involves an approach of economic   development and innovation in accordance with the specificity of area and competition   advantage which may be developed.   Based on the priorities set forth by the European Commission and undertaken by Romania, the instructions   to be followed related to ICT in education may be organized in 3 categories, in conformity to the specificity   of learning process:   1. Education by curricular activity based on ICT   This kind of education relies mainly on OER resources and Web 2.0 on learning and evaluation based on   projects and e-Portfolio of results of the pupil or student, on creation of original digital content and   interaction.   On national level, a similar exercise was performed for the development on the level of ICT in education of   disfavored communities from Romania, identified and supervised within the project Knowledge Economy   Romania.   2. Education by extracurricular activity based on ICT   The resources used within this project are the TIC technologies for the support of extracurricular networking   activities (creation camps, experience exchange, visits of international study and e-Holiday project).   3. Continuous professional training - Life Long Learning with the help of ICT   The objective of continuous professional training consists in providing knowledge and skills necessary to   adult individuals so they may have the perspective of a work place and to develop an individual professional   career. In this respect, special attention must be paid to forming a politics in the field, based on national   consensus obtained pursuant to social dialogue.   The analysis of the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) results in the national context   highlights the need of improvement of the teaching methods, as well as the curriculum, particularly in   terms of development of specific skills such as interpretation, application and reflection on information in   different contexts. According to PISA 2009 in Romania, students coming from schools located in urban   areas (with population between 100,000 and 1 million inhabitants) manage to achieve performance, on   average, by almost one level of competency higher than students in rural.      Romanian Indicators pertaining to ICT in Education   Based on the Eurostat data for 2015, only 1,6% of Romanian adults (25-64 years) continue to engage in   education and professional training processes, with a slightly higher participation of female individuals,   compared to 26 % in Iceland, 32% in Denmark, 11% in the Czech Republic and 4.5% in Poland. Moreover,   Romania still has much to recover compared to the EU average of 8.9% and the Euro Area average of   8.2%.   As regards the implementation of e-Learning solutions in universities, in 2010 more than half of the   universities (58%) had e-Learning solutions, and in the years that followed other 9 universities have   implemented such platforms by means of POSCCE and POSDRU financing.

If the investment plan will focus on a   balance between rural and urban   areas, in the long term the quality of   education will improve and the   phenomenon of the digital division   will blur, leading to social inclusion   of the disadvantaged areas.   The existence of an ICT network in   each school will also allow a better   management of educational   materials and facilitate students'   access to information.   Additionally, the implementation of   an ICT infrastructure, complemented   by the installation of educational   software (for teaching, testing) will   encourage the ICT-assisted teaching   and will impose an objective   evaluation of pupils’ performances.

Responsible: Ministry of Education   with support from Ministry for   Information Society         3.2 ICT IN HEALTH   3.2.1 Introduction   Preamble   Technology is providing ever more ways of storing and processing medical data. The increasing processing   power of portable devices in particular has led to the development and linking together of services that   would have been hard to imagine only a few years back. ICT use in healthcare is wide now and plays a        Page 73 of 172      strategic role in the delivery of better and efficient healthcare services. ICT in healthcare can increase   quality and safety of patient care.    The European society is characterized by high costs for its health system and a shrinking work force due to   health reasons and an aging population. These aspects put an enormous pressure on the economy and the   social system. Personal lifestyle and environmental impact factors are the most significant risk factors   influencing health status.      eHealth Definition   eHealth is a relatively recent term for healthcare practice supported by electronic processes and   communication. In the last years, the focus of e-health investments was on e-health services.     3.2.2 European context   The e-Health strategies of EU and EEA countries are not always labeled as such. Some countries may   indeed publish a policy document which refers to the ICT strategy in the healthcare sector. Other   countries such as France and Germany have enshrined the central e-Health activities in legislation   governing the healthcare sector. In Germany, the relevant law is the law on the modernization of   healthcare; in France the introduction of an electronic medical record is included in a law concerning   social security.   The European Commission presented a 2014-2020 multiannual action program in healthcare. This   program addresses the need to support Member States in their efforts to improve citizens’ health and to   ensure the sustainability of healthcare systems according to the European Strategy 2020.   For 2014-2020, after identifying current problems, the following objectives have been developed in terms   of the development of the e-health sector:    Strengthening and diversifying the unique integrated health information system    Upgrading and consolidation of nomenclatures (classification of diseases groupings etc.) and   ensuring the inter-operability between systems at national and European level    Monitoring and assessing the health of the population    Increasing preventive activities in relation to the curative ones    Expansion and diversification of emergency medical services    Implementing e-Health solutions that facilitate disease prevention methods     3.2.3 National context   ICT in Health Approach in Romania    The healthcare sector has always been a continuous challenge for many countries in Europe and it still is a   complex and sensitive topic to be addressed in any part of the world. During the past two decades,   Romania has gone through a period of rapid and major changes in every sector, including health.   At present, Romania’s healthcare system is still dominated by the public healthcare system, being funded   by a combination of employer and employee contributions to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)   and of direct allocations from the state budget.   Romania currently has a unique integrated system (SIUI), a solution designed to better manage the Unique   National Fund of Health Insurance by on-line collection and real-time processing of all medical information   of the insured patients.        Page 74 of 172      By June 2013, besides SIUI, Romania has implemented the following IT systems specific to healthcare   sector:    System of classification by groups of diagnoses (Diagnosis Related Groups – DRG’s)    Electronic Prescription System (EP)    Electronic Health Insurance Card (EHIC) System - currently being implemented    System of management of patients’ electronic medical records – in tender phase   In Romania, telemedicine has become a great interest in the past nine years, the first center developed in   this respect being located in Targu Mures. Telemedicine stands for the electronic transfer of the medical   data (ex.  High definition images, sounds, life video transmissions, recordings related to the patient) from   one place to another, at a certain distance. This transfer of medical data might use different types of   technologies, including – but not being limited only to the technologies which are listed below – regular   telephone lines, Internet, Intranet and satellites. Telemedicine is used by the suppliers in a more and more   increased number of medical specialties which include the dermatology, oncology, radiology, surgery,   cardiology and psychiatry.    Currently Romania has not a clearly appointed authority to coordinate the national e-Health policy and to   be a technical partner of the European Commission for common targets, as, for example, e-Health   interoperability. The Ministry of Health is the only institution connecting together all health related   activities of the country.      Romanian Indicators pertaining to ICT in Health   In terms of Infrastructure, 97% of the Romanian GP practices use a computer during a patient consultation   and 65% of them use the computer to electronic storage of individual medical patient data.7    Romania displays its best eHealth performance in the area of patient data storage and the use of a   computer for consultation purposes. Half of Romanian practices register administrative patient data and   about one-third of GP practices store at least one type of medical electronic patient data. The electronic   transfer of individual patient data has not yet arrived on the agenda of Romanian GPs. Only 6% of   Romanian GP practices exchange medical data with other careers and only around 2% of the practices   transfer administrative patient data to reimburse via networked connections. The exchange of medical   data via networked connections is equally little established: only 2% of the GP practices participating in   the survey reported having exchanged medical data with other care providers while 4% received results   from laboratories this way.   As of 2010 all public hospitals (427) and all family doctors (over 11500) have a minimal IT endowment. A   survey conducted in 2008 showed that 411 public hospitals subordinated to the Ministry of Health had an   average of around 8 hospital beds per computer, half of them used in clinical and pre-clinical fields.    eHealth use by GPs in  Romania  Source:    http://www.ehealth- indicators.eu                                                                        7 Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014    for Romania, CE        Page 75 of 172          3.2.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for ICT in Health in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Actions Description   Increase of the level of inter-  hospital cooperation based on the   ICT tools – telemedicine – especially   in the field of emergency medicine   and of specialty medicine       Improvement of the availability of   the telemedicine equipment   (Enabler)   Ensuring equitable access to all   citizens, especially vulnerable   groups, to quality and cost effective   health care through integrated   delivery and remote healthcare   (Strategic)   Provision of out-patient care and   emergency services in integrated   and inter-operable mode   (Operational)         Telemedicine represents the   electronic transfer of medical data   (e.g. high picture definition, sounds,   live video transmissions, records, all   related to patients) from one place   to another, at great distance.

Telemedicine   is used by providers in an increasing   number of specialties including   dermatology, oncology, radiology,   surgery, cardiology and psychiatry.   Improving the availability of the   telemedicine equipment will   facilitate access to quality medicine   among elders and people, especially   where distance is a critical factor.   ICT-assisted medicine will improve   elders’ quality of life, providing   permanent assistance, helping them   to acquire a certain independence   and ensuring social inclusion for   those located in remote areas.

Beyond this   significant contribution to GDP, the cultural and creative sectors represent a driver for significant changes   in lifestyle and progress, including the development of modern skills, adaptation of teaching and learning   and intergenerational and intercultural dialogue.    Digital technologies keep transforming radically our approach on creativity and culture. They not only   change the way we access and preserve the cultural assets, but they also provide unique tools to inspire   us to create and communicate more effectively. ICT has become an important means of enriching the   ‘creative capital’ growth and the ability of competing globally.   This is why the digital content is one of the major policy areas within the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE).   This policy aims to strengthen Europe's cultural creativity, continue the development of the internal   market for digital content, preserve our cultural resources and make them more accessible for all the   citizens.   3.3.2 European context   The objectives of the European Union structured within the Digital Agenda and the digital targets assumed   for 2020 involve measures directly connected to the preservation and the promotion of the European   patrimony. Out of these we can mention the following:   EU Goals    Supporting the effort of digitization of all European cultural content and providing a platform for aggregating  digitized cultural resources with an easy and single access point to information related to the cultural heritage,  but, also to education, leisure, etc.   Materialization and digitalization of cultural heritage (libraries, physical archives and audiovisual works,   museums) to facilitate access to the European level and to ensure its preservation over time   Development of the Europeana.eu – the European digital library – in close collaboration with all the involved   institutions (with the precise target of making 30 million objects available by 2015)      Over the last 10 years, the European Commission and Member States have invested millions of Euros to   support cultural heritage institutions (museums, archives and libraries), to digitize their collections and   upload them on the Internet. This investment has led to an unprecedented period of technical research   and development in the European cultural heritage sector, when all the organizations, no matter the scale,   have developed different models and methodologies for Digitization.   The European Digital Library is the maximum interest focus point of the ITC strategy in the field of culture   and stands for a unique access point towards millions of books, paintings, movies, and museum objects   and archiving documents which were digitalized within the entire Europe. Also, it represents a source of   information derived from the European cultural and scientific institutions, a promoter support of the   cultural inheritance, by means of knowledge transfer, innovation and technology, a platform for the   exchange of knowledge between the librarians, museum curators, archivists and representatives of the   creational cultural industries and a way to stimulate the creative economy and to promote the cultural        Page 79 of 172      tourism. Making the collections held by Europe's libraries, archives, museums and audiovisual archives   available online is a win-win for culture, economic growth and individual fulfillment.      3.3.3 National context   ICT in Culture Approach in Romania    Based on the objectives of the European Union, Romania has set the following digital targets for 2020:    Romania Goals    Development of the digital archives of Romania and contribution to the further development of Europeana.eu   (with the precise target of exposing within Europeana ~750.000 digital items until 2015)   Promoting the creation of original digital content, specific to the communities in Romania   Better interaction between the library and the citizen through ICT resources      In Romania, same as in all the EU Member States, online accessibility of Europe's cultural heritage needs   requires the right conditions for proceeding with digitization, online accessibility and preservation of   cultural content. This all requires close collaboration between Member States and cultural institutions,   and also between these cultural institutions and other stakeholders.      Stakeholders Responsibilities   The European Commission       Monitors progress towards the implementation of the   Commission's Recommendations    Facilitates the exchange of information and good   practices of MS policies and strategies   Europeana Foundation  Runs the Europeana.eu portal and coordinates the   network of contributing cultural institutions, currently   around 2,200   Romania as EU’s Member State    Ministry of Culture (responsible)    Ministry for Information Society (support)    Provides most of the funding for digitization and   implement decisions taken jointly at European level    Contribute to the development of Europeana.eu   Romanian Cultural institutions  Drive the creation of Europeana.eu and provide  digitized content      On national level, the eCulture project within the „Knowledge based Economy” programme, 255   Romanian disadvantaged communities had the opportunity to create and store in the Europeana.eu   library original cultural material which represent their community at European level.       There are several ongoing initiatives following the Europe 2020 strategy, for a better interaction between   the library and the citizen, as follows:       E-Accessibility in Public Libraries Provides a Portal to New Worlds for People with Disabilities   The European Commission has made E-Accessibility a central policy priority of the Digital Agenda for  Europe, to ensure that all people—regardless of age or disability—are able to access ICT equally. With  more than 80 000 visually impaired people living in Romania, the Iasi County Public Library approached   http://pro.europeana.eu/foundation http://www.europeana.eu/portal/ http://www.europeana.eu/portal/      Page 80 of 172      the “Biblionet” Romania programme (including voice recognition software and other specialized Internet  functions and capabilities such as email, search engines, online music, chat, and radio broadcasts. ) with  the goal of becoming a specially designated public library branch providing visually-impaired persons with  access to technology to help them reach their personal and professional goals.       Public Libraries Provide a Path to Employment  The Europe 2020 strategy to create smart, sustainable growth across the European Union aims to secure  employment for three-quarters of citizens between the ages of 20 and 64 by 2020. With unemployment  hovering around 7% in Romania, public libraries are an invaluable resource to job seekers.      Internet Access in Public Libraries Supports Agriculture, Romania’s Primary Job Sector   Public libraries are actively helping the 70% of citizens in rural areas of Romania that are employed in the  agriculture sector that accounts for up to 12% of national GDP. In 2012, more than 41 000 farmers filed  online applications for agricultural subsidies at public libraries in Romania, directly resulting in more than  US $63 million in subsidies from the Ministry of Agriculture to individuals.      Public Libraries Support Improved Digital Literacy  Since it began in 2009, the “Biblionet” Romania programme has provided E-Skills training to more than  1.300 participants, especially hard-to-reach citizens like the elderly, retirees, adults, students, and the  unemployed.  More than 1.8 million Romanians currently use public libraries, and 1 million have expressed  interest in participating in free ICT courses.      Public Libraries Break Down Barriers to eInclusion  Just 19% of disadvantaged people in Romania are regular Internet users, compared to 51% across the EU.  eInclusion efforts in Romania seek to break down marginalizing barriers like age, income, and geography,  and directly support the European 2010 initiative on eInclusion and the EU 2020 Growth Strategy. By  enabling everyone to have access to ICT, the benefits of digital technology like eGovernment, eHealth, and  e-Employment services can be extended to all.        Public Libraries Connect Older Adults to New Skills and Communities  To ensure that older people can fully engage in a digital society, the EU has outlined key policy initiatives  in the 2020 Growth Strategy and i2020 that support better access to information and communications  technology (ICT) for the elderly. By 2020, 17 per cent of the population of Romania will be age 65 or older,  demonstrating a growing demand for health information, government resources, and social connections.  This is why, beginning with 2009, public libraries in Romania have introduced more than 17,000 older  adults to a range of ICT skills, including email, browsing the Internet, online banking and commerce, and  social media.     National Indicators pertaining to ICT in Culture   In order to estimate the necessary ICT investment in culture, one considered the estimations published on   European Union level concerning the digitalization of digital content. With respect to the situation and   targets undertaken by Romania, the estimated value of ICT investment in Culture amounts to 37,5 million   Euro (out of which 15 mil. Euro from ERDF).   By implementing and correlating the uniform vision of the first 2 fields of action specified within DAE   2020, the estimated impact on the Romanian economy would be of 5% growth in terms of GDP and 1%   growth in terms of jobs.   Computer access is currently available in around 65%-70% of public libraries in Romania, and our country   will run policies in order to improve the percentage of cultural facilities/libraries implementing TIC   resources of biblioteconomy or similar.        Page 81 of 172      According to The Official Journal of the European Union, currently Romania contributes to Europeana.eu   with 35.852 cultural items, while the indicative target for 2015 is about 789.000 cultural. Romania will   have to digitalize approximately 1000 cultural works/day in order to achieve the precise target.       Making the collections held by Europe's libraries, archives, museums and audiovisual archives available   online is a win-win for culture, economic growth and individual fulfillment. By combining policy, research   and innovation, the DAE actions aim at making our cultural heritage a driver for innovation and creativity   and to enable the wider diffusion of European culture and values worldwide.      3.3.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for ICT in Culture in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Actions Description   Development of Digital Archives of   Romania Cultural Patrimony      Digitize the Romanian cultural   patrimony   (Operational)   The main advantage resulting from  the action of digitization of the  cultural patrimony of Romania is  represented by the preservation of  national cultural works.    By designing all representative  cultural creations in a wide digital  universe, within an electronic  consistent format,  will provide  access of future generations to the  artistic creations from the past   By facilitating the access to these  digital registries, including heritage  items, citizens’ awareness of the  Romanian cultural inheritance could  increase.

Digital division affects a significant percentage of the world population. There is a clear need for adequate   ICT infrastructure, easy and affordable Internet usage, generalized ability and easier access to useful   information. Many countries are facing a shortage of e-Skills and all types of ICT skills are in high demand   in close connection with eInclusion objectives.   eInclusion Definition   eInclusion is a social movement which aims to end the digital divide, a term used to describe the fact that   the world can be divided into people who do and people who do not have access to modern technology or   lack the necessary digital skills.    3.4.2 European context   Social inclusion and fight against poverty are part of the European Union's objectives in terms of economic   growth and employment. It proposes formal and informal education for citizens to develop digital literacy   in all levels of education. 8   According to the European Digital Agenda, ICT represent a very important tool for improving the process   of social inclusion because it gives people means of finding a new job, provides information on rights and   obligations of individuals, facilitates professional development and, at the same time, offers a way to   general and uniform improve the  ICT skills throughout the country. This entire process is known as   eInclusion.    Ability to access ICT networks does not involve people capacities to use the Internet and ICT equipment or   tools. The differences are due to:    Low-income communities    Regional discrepancies: the poverty rate in rural areas is much higher compared to the urban    Social and physical disabilities         3.4.3 National context   eInclusion Approach in Romania    Besides the infrastructure in terms of ICT, social inclusion represents a very important issue of national   interest. Broadly speaking, in Romania we have all the 3 previously mentioned categories as groups of   disadvantaged communities that might face difficulties in adapting to the modern requirements of today's   society, thus requiring assistance to improve the level of social inclusion.                                                                8 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/docs/gdansk_roadmap.pdf   http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/docs/gdansk_roadmap.pdf      Page 84 of 172      In Romania, a representative project in the field of eInclusion was the “Access to Information and   Communication Technology (ICT) and improvement of digital skills”. This project aimed to provide access   to ICT services by providing physical and connectivity equipment, as well as to permit people with basic   digital skills to use them9. Overall, 255 communities across Romania, namely 1.8 million people living   within this communities had the opportunity to be part of a new knowledge-based economy, through a   successful implementation of local electronic networks. These are informational networks serving as   knowledge centres, which are still providing information and services to local authorities, schools, public   libraries, citizens and small enterprises.      National Indicators pertaining to eInclusion   In 201110  , 40.3% of the Romanian population was facing the risk poverty or social exclusion, being a   significantly higher value than the European average (24.1%). To a total of 8.63 million people at risk of  poverty or social exclusion in 2011, 4.74 million people were facing the risk of poverty.           % of Romanian Population facing poverty and social exclusion       Source: http://www.fonduri-ue.ro/res/filepicker_users/cd25a597fd-62/2012- 2020/Dezbateri%20parteneriale/Rezultatele%20analizei%20documentare/03.06.2013/7.Social%20inclusion_23%20mai.pdf     In 2012, the rate of absolute poverty11 in urban environment was of 2.4%, whereas that of rural   environment was of 7.4%12   In what concerns individuals with disabilities in Romania, their number reached in 2012 about 690,000,   out of which 8.8% are children and 91.2% adults.

These services contribute, among others, to the minimization of the time spent for the filling in   and the consultation of the paperwork and to the increase of the online activity (reading newspapers,   verifying the bank accounts and performing electronic payments, sending e-mails, searching for   information, communicating by means of the social networks, etc.). The electronic commerce continues to   increase significantly, even in the context of the actual economic crisis. In 2013, 30% of people living in   Europe use eCommerce service.    eCommerce Definition   eCommerce (Electronic Commerce or EC) is the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet,   especially the World Wide Web. Electronic Commerce or eCommerce is currently a catalyst for other   technologies, such as: electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, internet marketing, social   media, electronic data interchange. For online retail selling, the term e-tailing is sometimes used.      4.1.2 European context   Online Internet penetration and purchasing still differ in the various parts of Europe, according to the   maturity of the market, the level of trust, the availability of offers, the penetration of reliable payment   options, reliable and affordable delivery, Internet-usage and penetration, and consequently, the number   of e-shoppers.   European B2C eCommerce is developing extremely well. In 2010 Europe overtook the USA, the biggest   market in the world until then. The total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Europe in 2012 is estimated to   have reached around 16 trillion Euro, of which the GDP of the EU28 was just over 80%. eCommerce   Europe estimates the share of the European Internet economy at 3.5%, a percentage that is set to double   by 2016 and to triple by 2020.   The development of the electronic commerce will generate concrete benefits for the consumers, in the   sense of price reduction and increase of the products and goods offer and quality, due to the cross-border   exchanges and to the possibility to compare the offers more easily.   The current communication of the European Commission identifies five main obstacles in the way of   creating a unique digital market, and defines an action plan for their removal:   1. Insufficient regulatory framework established with respect to the offer of online services, regulatory  and cross-border.   2. Lack of information of the online services operators and lack of protection of the internet users.   3. Non-adequate payment and delivery services: purchasing an item over the internet should be a  flexible process, facilitated through e-commerce.    4. Too numerous abuses and litigations which are difficult to be solved.         Page 88 of 172      5. Insufficient implementation of the high speed communication networks and of the advanced  technological solutions.   An important factor which is known and tackled at European Union level is the lack of trust in online   payment systems and their security14. Approximately 35% of internet users avoid using online commerce   channels due to this factor. Also, the financial costs related to the micro-payments are considered to be   excessive by the SME’s, having a significant impact upon the profitability of the business model in online.    Consequently, Romania indicates a very strong tendency to finalize online transactions by means of cash   payment, upon delivery (70% of the online transactions performed in 2010 were finalized in this manner).      4.1.3 National context   eCommerce Approach in Romania   The Eastern European region, led by Russia, has shown an impressive 32.6% growth, reaching a turnover of   13.4 bil Euro and a 4% market share. In this context, as well Romania is one of the top 5 countries in   percentage growth in 2012.      Source: Ecommerce Europe, 2013: e-sales of goods and services      National Indicators pertaining to eCommerce   According to the data provided by Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014 for Romania, only 8 % of population aged   between 16-74 years has used the internet in 2013 for the acquisition of goods and services for personal use   in Romania.    However, the overall trend registered a small increase; this increase started in 2006, when only 1% of the   population used the internet for the performance of online shopping, followed by a fluctuant evolution   during the following years. Until 2008 the value of the index increased to 4%, only to register a decrease in   2009, when the effects of the crisis were felt more severely, going down to 2%. Afterwards, an improvement   was recorded in 2011, with 6 % of use.                                                                 14 Eurostat Household Survey, 2009        Page 89 of 172      In Bucharest, 14% of population aged between 16-74 years used the internet for online shopping in 2011,   recording a significant increase as compared to the value of 7% recorded in 2009 and to the valued of 8%   recorded in 2010.15     Regarding the eCommerce use by the business environment, in 2013 only 9% of SMEs and 13% of large   enterprises in Romania have sold or bought services online.        4.1.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for eCommerce in Romania   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Action Comments   Developing a regulatory  framework with respect to the e- commerce cross-border offer   Improvement of the regulatory  framework for the support of the e- commerce system and the retail  commerce transfer in the electronic  media.

There is no progress in ICT without innovation. And innovation is driven by smart people and smart ideas,   solving everyday problems.  We intend to pay more attention to everyday problems and create a better   framework for generating better solutions.    4.2.2 European context   As part of the UE cohesion policy for the 2014 – 2020 period, the European Commission proposes as an  intelligent specialization16 to become a preliminary condition („ex ante conditionality”) for the support of  investments within the two key-objectives:    Consolidation of research, technical development and innovation (the Research & Innovation target)    Enhancement of access to ICT and of it being used in a qualitative manner (ICT target)   The entire innovative potential of the UE regions must be mobilized so that it will reach the objective of  intelligence growth, proposed by Europe 2020. Innovation is important for all the regions: the more  advanced regions must maintain their current position and the less developed regions should reduce the  distance that separates them from the more advanced ones17.                                                                 16 Strategii de cercetare si inovare pentru specializarea inteligenta - POLITICA DE COEZIUNE 2014-2020   17 R. Wintjes, H. Hollanders, „The regional impact of technological change in 2020”.        Page 92 of 172      The knowledge and innovation capacity of the regions depends of several factors – entrepreneurial culture,  competencies of the man power, education and formation institutions, services for innovation support,  mechanisms for technology transfer, infrastructure for ICT innovation, mobility of the researchers, business  incubators, new financing sources and local creative potential. Good governing is also essential. The  performance in the field of innovation varies widely inside the UE, as indicated by the regional index with  respect to the performance in the field of innovation, as a composite indicator of many of those factors.       4.2.3 National context   Research - Development and Innovation în ICT Approach in Romania   Investment in research, development and innovation in ICT and application of accomplished results  through said investment are key factors to improve competitiveness of our companies and Public  Institutions.  At Romanian level, the development of the smart specialization strategy – intelligent specialization –  represents a prerequisite for the preparation and for the accessing exercise of European funds for the  period 2014-2020. In this context, Romania must perform a regional analysis of the innovative potential, to  place itself in this context, to develop the specific intelligent specialization vision and to set its development  priorities by the end of June 2013.    According to analysis of the regional context18, developed by the Ministry of Research, and to the  Romania’s innovative potential, four areas of development were identified:    Agriculture and biotechnology     Information and communication technology     Energy and Environment     Technological and engineering sciences (especially the automotive industry)      National Indicators pertaining to Research - Development and Innovation in ICT   From the total of the overall turnover accomplished in 2011 at the level of the Romania’s enterprises, 4.1%  is achieved by the ICT sector, value which decreased by 1% as compared to the one achieved in 2010. Within  the ITC sector, 47.2% of the overall turnover recorded in 2011 is generated by the Telecommunication sub- sector, 24.8% by the Software and IT services sub-sector, and the rest of 28.0% is assigned to the Hardware  sub-sector.   At the beginning of 2011, in Romania, 14,595 of SMEs activated in the ITC field, representing approximately  3% of the total of SMEs registered and active in Romania in the same period of time. Out of this number,  approximately 15% (2,156 companies) recorded technological innovation in the period 2006-2008.   In 2011, 128,000 employees were active in the ITC field, which stands for approximately 3% of the overall  man power. The increased investments in the wide range connections and infrastructure, as well as in the e- commerce investments connected to the ITC products and services innovation will have as direct implication  the increase of the number of available working places, both in the ITC sector as well as in other sectors of  economy as a result of outsourcing.    According to the study developed for Romania, ITC indicated the highest development in the Bucharest -  Ilfov regions, in the North-Western and Western regions, with excellence centers developed around the big  academic centers: Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi and Timisoara.                                                                18 JASPERS, Analysis and Evidence Base of the R&D&I Market in Romania, Martie 2013        Page 93 of 172      Out of the net investment performed in Romania19 in the past few years, approximately 10% come from the  state budget and from other local budgets, the majority of the amounts (between 60-70%) being supported  by the own funding resources of the private sector. In the ICT sector, in 2011, investments were performed  in the amount of 3 bil. RON, which is approximately 8% of the turnover of the sector for this period.       4.2.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Strategic Lines of Development for Research - Development and Innovation în ICT in Romania   The strategies of intelligent specialization may assure a more efficient use of the public funds and can  stimulate the private investments. They can help the regions to concentrate resources upon a few essential  priorities, more than to spread, less intense, the investments within all the fields and sectors of activity.   In the case of the Romanian Digital Agenda the main lines of action are related to the promotion of   Promotion of innovative clusters and of the competitiveness poles for regional growth, to increase the   efficiency of public investment in the Innovation, Research & Development in ICT; encourage the   research of the infrastructure development at regional level and expand the Romanian participation in   Innovation, Research & Development in ICT.      Strategic Lines of Development Lines of action Description / Comments   Promotion of innovative clusters  and competitiveness poles for  regional growth       Promotion of the competitiveness  clusters and of the employees’  specialization in this field especially  in the excellence centers: Bucharest,  Cluj, Iasi and Timisoara. (Strategic)   Responsible: Ministry for Information  Society   Clusters – geographical  concentrations of small enterprises,  usually SME’s, which interact with  one another and also with clients  and suppliers, and which usually  have in common a fund of  specialized man power, financial  services and for the enterprises,  facilities in the field of innovation  and formation – they are an  important element in the strategies  of intelligence specialization. They  provide a favorable environment  which stimulates the  competitiveness and the  innovation. The support for the  cluster’s development must be  concentrated upon the fields with a  comparable advantage.   Alternatively, virtual clusters can  also be considered for investments.  A virtual cluster is a concentration  of SMEs distributed geographically,  but grouped together by common  interest through means of  technology.                                                                19 Institutul National de Statistica – Romania in cifre 2012:   http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/Romania%20in%20cifre_%202012.pdf   http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/Romania%20in%20cifre_%202012.pdf      Page 94 of 172      The poles for the regional  competitiveness – support for the  sustainable regional development  based on knowledge. The scope of  the competitiveness poles is the  increase of the competitiveness  promoting capacity, entrepreneurial  formation, and innovation,  technological transfer as a regional  sustainable development policy by  means of interconnecting the  technologies, the know-how and the  persons.    Encourage the research of the  infrastructure development at  regional level                                    Continuous development and use of  the electronic infrastructure based  on ITC for the interconnection and  the facilitation of the collaboration  between the research teams which  are spread from a geographical point  of view and the separation of the  resources and of the scientific  knowledge is a key-method in order  to accomplish this issue. (Enabler)   Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   The research infrastructure is very  important for the systems which are  based on knowledge. A  tridimensional approach is needed  in order to help the regions to fulfil  their full potential:     Development of the  research and of the ITC  infrastructure al global level, based  on the existent regional scientific  research     Establishment of research  facilities networks for the countries  which have a less intensive use of  research and the development of  facilities for the regional partners     Promotion of the  competency transfer between  partners and the support of a solid  regulatory framework  with respect  to the copyright issues    Expanding the participation to the  Innovation, Research &  Development projects in ICT within  the international initiatives       Increase Romanian participation in  international projects of Innovation,  Research & Development in ICT  through European programmes and  resources. (Operational)   Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   Some challenges of the society  determine that there is a need for a  major approach, coordinated at the  EU level in order to find and to  implement effective solutions for  the ITC promotion.    The innovating union includes  several partnerships for innovation  which will deal with specific  challenges through providing means  of putting into common resources  and to reunite all the main actors,  as well as the political instruments,  at EU and national level, in order to  fulfil common objectives.    The regional policy will continue to  approach these challenges  integrating the involved  partnerships and putting it into  application and identifying a        Page 95 of 172      sustainable model for the project’s  financing.   Funding of innovative start-ups in  Romania    Increase the Romanian Government  contribution in supporting  innovative ICT start-ups. (Enabler)   Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   We propose a tiered investment  strategy from the Government in  ICT start-ups that can bring  significant value in technology,  creating a productive ground for  innovation in Romania:   - Tier 1 – Small investments in new  technologies with market potential  which are not yet proven to bring  significant added value / return on  investment   - Tier 2 – Medium investments in  new technologies / start-ups which  have a proven market potential and  have demonstrated the return on  investment   - Tier 3 – Large investments for  technology innovation in proven  models that have received funding  from multiple credible sources   Any project can apply for funding  and the criteria for qualification in  each tier will be defined by the  Ministry for Information Society.         Page 96 of 172      5 FIELD OF ACTION IV - BROADBAND AND DIGITAL SERVICES   INFRASTRUCTURE          5.1.1 Introduction   Preamble   The analysis made at the European Union level show that Europe must intensify efforts to stimulate the   development of new generation broadband access. A study on the socio-economic impact of broadband   infrastructure shows that without intervention, by 2020, 94% of households will be covered with   connection at speeds of above 30 Mbps and only 50% could be covered with connections at speeds of   over 100 Mbps with a penetration rate of 26%, significantly lower than the one specified in the Digital   Agenda for Europe.      Measures to be assumed at national level   In this context, the European Commission has undertaken the following measures to be assumed at   national level:   • First, the Commission shall endeavor to ensure a predictable and consistent regulatory   framework that encourages competition while providing incentives to investors.   • Secondly, the Commission proposes measures to encourage demand, particularly the demand   for broadband services.   • Thirdly, the Commission adopts various measures within the Radio Spectrum Policy in an   effort to provide sufficient spectrum for future mobile broadband, recognizing the increasing   use of mobile and wireless Internet.   • Fourthly, the Commission adopts initiatives to ensure that in the European Union ther are   available sufficient funds for development in areas that are underserved. If in densely   populated areas ( \"black\" ) operators are ready to invest and the market will deliver with no   aid, in the ' gray' and 'white' areas it is necessary the aid of the public authorities. To this end,   the structural funds and public financing within the revised Guidelines on State aid for   Broadband will contribute to achieve the objectives.      5.1.2 European context   The Digital Agenda sets ambitious coverage and speed targets and requires Member States to take   measures, including legal provisions, to facilitate broadband investment.    The rolling out of high-speed fixed and wireless electronic communications networks across the Union   requires substantial investments a significant portion of which is represented by the cost of civil   engineering works. A major part of these costs can be attributed to inefficiencies in the rollout process   related to the use of existing passive infrastructure (such as ducts, conduits, manholes, cabinets, poles,   masts, antenna installations, towers and other supporting constructions), bottlenecks related to co-  ordination of civil works, burdensome administrative permit granting procedures, and bottlenecks   concerning in-building deployment of networks.        Page 97 of 172      The 2012 Spring Council has asked for steps to be taken at EU level to achieve costs savings in the   deployment of high-speed broadband networks, as part of the efforts to complete the Digital Single   Market by 2015.   A significant fraction of this untapped potential can be found at the level of network infrastructures:   different regulatory approaches to network roll-out increase the cost of access to national markets,   prevent the exploitation of economies of scale at services and equipment level and hinder the   development of innovative services which could emerge on very high-speed networks running in a   seamless fashion across borders. While the deployment of access networks often involves provisions and   procedures administered at local level, such measures, including local secondary legislation may indirectly   affect the freedom to provide services and justify Union intervention. Furthermore, based on Article 114   of the TFEU, the Union has previously legislated, in order to foster local network infrastructure   deployment, through unbundling of the local loop.    The Union cannot afford to leave citizens and businesses outside the footprint of such infrastructures and   has subscribed to ambitious broadband targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe: by 2013, basic   broadband for all Europeans, and by 2020, (i) access to speeds of above 30 Mbps for all Europeans, and (ii)   subscription of internet connection above 100 Mbps for 50% or more of European households. These   goals will only be achieved if the infrastructure deployment costs are lowered across the EU.       5.1.3 National context   Primary Objective   New Generation Networks strategy has as its objective the availability of a group of highly advanced,   state-of-the-art telecommunications networks, assuring nationwide coverage. For this purpose, the   construction of fiber-optic networks will be promoted, with national coverage and a wide spread of   distribution points, as close as possible to the end user  and with appropriate levels of symmetry and   interactivity, to guarantee a greater two-way transmission of information. Nevertheless, given the   advances developments of the wireless communications sector in Romania, we envisage that these   networks will be integrated and thus complement existing wireless infrastructure constructed according to   New Generation Wireless technology (e.g. LTE), allowing for mobility, and extending the levels of access   coverage.     Thus the primary objective of the National Plan for the Development of NGN Infrastructure is the   definition and planning of political and administrative measures that can stimulate the development of   the next generation broadband infrastructure and, respectively, the penetration of high speed access   services in Romania up to the level assumed under the Digital Agenda for Europe for 2020.       Specific objectives   • Sizing: the identification of the volume of investments necessary in the development of the   next generation access infrastructure for the purpose of the attainment of the objectives   related to the development of the access services assumed under the Digital Agenda for   Europe    • Delimiting: identification of the geographical areas where the current rate of investments in   broadband next generation access infrastructure impose the taking of certain public   intervention measures (rural areas, areas with a low density of the population, etc)        Page 98 of 172      • Financing: identification of investment models compliant with good practices and European   recommendations with respect to the financing of the development of next generation   electronic communications infrastructure.   • Stimulating: stimulating the investment in the next generation access infrastructure in   Romania through the identification of the measures to cut costs and increase the efficiency of   its development.      Broadband infrastructure coverage in Romania   The coverage by fixed broadband infrastructure of the population and households situated in localities   with at least one Internet access services provider has reached 96%, while the total number of fixed   broadband access lines reached 3.54 million in January 2013. Romania is, thus, on the ninth place as far as   the number of lines in EU is concerned.   Indicator Status   Mobile Internet access 7.1 M active connections (2012)   Broadband internet connections 10.6M connections (2012)   Number of fixed telephony lines 4.43M (2012)   Subscribers to re-broadcasting services 6.03 M (2012)   Penetration of bundle offers per hundred inhabitants 37.5%  (2012)   Investments in infrastructure 537M € (2012)   Source: ANCOM – Market of services of electronic communications, 2012      Broadband services penetration in Romania   According to ANCOM’s biannual reports, the demand for broadband Internet services  recorded a genuine   boom starting from 2006 – with respect to both fixed and mobile technologies.   According to the Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014 for Romania, in 2013 there was a national spread of   broadband connections of 56%. Romania also provides a broadband Internet coverage for 90% of total   population, and 78% coverage for rural area.      Investment in “white” spots    In the underserved (“white”) areas, as there were defined in Broadband Guidelines, where the inherent   profitability of investment in broadband infrastructure is low, neither ex ante regulation nor demand-side   measures will be sufficient to enable the supply of broadband service. In the situation currently presented,   the efforts from alternative instruments (including demand stimulation and ex ante regulation) did not   solve the problems related to the lack of supply of broadband on the targeted areas.   In support of the sub-measure “Investments regarding the broadband infrastructure in the rural area”   within the National Rural Development Program, ANCOM carried out, in the period November 2012 –   January 2013, a program for consulting the operators with respect to the existence of infrastructure and   the intention to invest in a total number of 12,487 localities from the rural environment.         Page 99 of 172      Further to centralization, the following useful results were obtained in the development of the national   broadband next generation infrastructure:   • In 2.307 localities (18.47%), there are no communications networks of broadband local loop.   • In 6.064 localities (48.56%) there are no broadband backhaul communications networks.   • In 3.666 localities (29.35%) no broadband communications services are provided.   • In 210 localities there are private operators intending to develop broadband networks in the   next 3 years. Supporting documents were presented in only 5 of the 210 cases.   As such, a number of 783 localities were selected (declared eligible) to be included in a state-aided   development of backhaul infrastructure: the RONET project. These localities were grouped in 7 well-  balanced areas - from economic/investment perspective - that were put out for Design-Build-Operate   concessions (public tender).      Broadband support for meeting the National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania   The broadband communications are enabling, and thus facilitating, the development of a wide array of   IT&C services, increasing at the same time productivity and competitiveness and thus driving GDP growth;   it is accepted worldwide that IT&C determined 40-50% productivity increase in the last 10 years, several   studies showing a strong correlation between the broadband penetration and GDP per capitai (R2=0.5419).   The positive repercussions of extending broadband access to the less developed regions of a country have   been the subject of many international studies. As it has been shown through these studies, the main   anticipated long term benefits for the affected areas through the implementation of this project are the   following:   • Alleviation of social exclusion in geographically isolated groups of population.   • Boost in regional business activity due to the capacity:  o to access a greater customer base,  o for enterprises to provide new services, and  o to access information relevant for the business in a more timely manner and less costly.   • Improvement in the quality of life because of:  o the simplification of the transaction processes with the state and the enterprises, and  o time-savings in transport    • The development of tele-medicine with direct repercussions in the reduction of the necessity  for dispersed building infrastructures for medical care, the prevention of deaths, the savings  of the relevant cost in the insurance system and the reduction in transport costs and of the  cost of management of emergency situations.   • The development of distance-learning and the promotion of life-long education: broadband  communications will contribute to the implementation of the new learning methods,  increasing thus the teaching quality and accessibility    • eGovernment: broadband will facilitate the interaction between government and  citizens/companies, leading to the increase of public administration efficiency and accessibility   • eEconomy: broadband communications contribute to the e-business development, having as a  result cutting costs and increase of companies’ competitiveness   By ensuring equitable provision of coverage and access to broadband communications across Romania,   the measure helps achieving greater cohesion and contributes to the formation of the single market for   ICT services.           Page 100 of 172      5.1.4 Strategic Lines of Development   Broadband and digital services infrastructure approach in Romania   In the attainment of the proposed objectives, 4 action directions were identified:   • Encouraging access to the existing passive infrastructure;   • Improving the transparency and coordination in the relevant civil works;   • Simplifying the authorization procedures for the new network developments;   • Norms regarding the NGN infrastructure for new buildings.   The estimated costs of rolling-out NGN infrastructure in Romania to a level that can support the objectives   of the National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania are estimated to reach up to a level between 1.3   to 3.5 bil. Euro, depending on the technology of choice. These costs are going to be covered only partially   by private investments.   Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Action Comments   Deployment of Next Generation  Backhaul and Backbone  Infrastructure   Implementation of the RoNET  project (Enabler)  Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   Although the competition on the   electronic communication market   increased considerably, this is   concentrated in the urban areas;   many rural areas are white areas,   with no broadband coverage.   Following the consultation process   with electronic communications   providers, no operator expressed   intentions to extend in the next   three years their broadband   networks in existing white areas. As   such, population living in white   areas will remain uncovered - not   even basic broadband access -   unless public intervention will be   used.     Further extensions of the backhaul  and backbone networks (2014 –  2020) (Enabler)  Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   During the 2014 – 2020 budgetary  exercise further developments of  the national NGN backbone and  backhaul coverage will be enabled  by the government either by  launching new state-aid programs  or by taking additional measures  that will encourage private  investment in NGN Broadband  infrastructure.   Implement Monitoring Mechanisms  (Operational)   Responsible: Ministry for  Information Society   The providers of the New  Generation Networks within the  future state-aided Broadband  developments will be obliged to  publish access-related information  (inter alia, technical specification,  terms and conditions) for interested  parties and to provide open access  to all electronic communication  operators. Compliance with the  obligations will be supervised by the        Page 101 of 172      Strategic Lines of Development Lines of Action Comments   MCIS-PIU based on quarterly  reports submitted by the respective  companies.   Monitoring of the NGN broadband  networks construction   For all state-aid NGN developments  the developers will have to submit  MCIS-PIU progress reports  regarding implementation status.  During NGN network constructions,  teams of auditors of appropriate  expertise (Information &  Communication Technology  technicians/engineers, economists,  accountants, etc.) shall be  appointed by MCIS-PIU to audit the  physical and financial scope of the  specific projects.   Monitoring of the network  management, maintenance and  operation   NGN network operators will submit  MCIS-PIU periodical reports  regarding specific KPIs related to  network management: major  operation failures, security  incidents, operations &  maintenance.   Financial monitoring and Claw-back  mechanisms   The Entrustment Act will mandatory  include provisions concerning the  effective modality to calculate the  level of compensation, taking into  consideration the amount of the  expenses necessary in order to  provide the public service and all  the revenues generated by the  newly created backhaul  infrastructure.   Administrative and Legislative  Proposals. (Strategic)   • Amendment of Law No.  50/1991 regarding the  authorization of construction  works, so that the construction  of electronic communications  networks, of infrastructure  elements and of supporting  infrastructure for electronic  communications networks  should be governed by a  distinct, coherent and  simplified chapter in this law.

From this number, around 15% (2.156 companies) registered a technological innovation during the   period 2006-2008.   Innovation and Research   In 2012, Romania has spent £ 2.8727 billion for research-development. Research and development   expenses represented 0.49% of GDP, with 0.01 percentage points more than in 2011. At the end of 2012,   42674 employees were conducting their activities in the R&D sector, roughly the same number registered   in late 2011.            Page 105 of 172         Employees in ICT   In 2012, 131.200 of employees were active in the field of TIC, around 3% of the overall workforce. The   increased investments in broadband connections and infrastructure, as well as the investments in   innovation of TIC products and services type e-commerce will have as direct implication the increase of   the number of available jobs, both in TIC sector, and in other sectors of economy pursuant to externalities.      eCommerce   Based on the data supplied by Eurostat, the percentage of population aged between 16-74 years who   used the internet in 2013 to purchase personal goods and services in Romania was of only 8%, increasing   the value registered in 2012 of 5%. Overall, in this field it is noticed a slow increase, started in 2006, when   only 1% of population was using the internet for purchases, followed by a fluctuating evolution during the   following years. Until 2008 the value of index increased to 4%, only to decrease in 2009, when the effects   of crisis were experienced the most, to the value of 2%. Subsequently, it followed a restoration up to the   value of 6% in 2011. In capital, the percentage of those aged between 16-74 years and who used the   internet for shopping in 2011 was of 14%, registering a significant increase opposite to the value of 7%   registered in 2009 and that of 8% in 2010.20   Regarding the private sector, in 2013 9% of SMEs sold goods and services online. Large enterprises had in   2013 a percentage of 13% in selling goods and services online, compared with 10% in 2012.       Broadband connections and infrastructure of digital services in Romania   During the period 30.06.2010 – 30.06.2012 Romania registered a constant increase of the overall number of   broadband internet connections on fixed points. If in June 2010 the value of such index was of 2,93 million,   within 2 years, until June 2012, the overall number of broadband internet connections on fixed points   increased to 3,42 million.    Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014 upon Romania is showing for the year 2013 a 90% fixed broadband   coverage of total population and a 78% rural fixed broadband coverage. The NGA broadband coverage   reached 66%, with 55% of population shared subscriptions with at least 30 Mbps and 25% of subscriptions   were with at least 100 Mbps.

Internet users on a daily basis has reached in 2013 a 32% score.   Furthermore, a huge 42% of the population has still never used the Internet, more than double the rate   for the EU average of 20%. With regard to disadvantaged people, the rate was 24%, 30% points below the   EU average of 54%.    Between June, 2010 – June, 2012 Romania registered a constant increase of the overall number of   broadband internet connections on fixed points. If in June 2010 the value of such index was of 2,93   million, within 2 years, until June 2012, the overall number of broadband internet connections on fixed   points increased to 3,42 million. In what concerns the broadband cover per environments of residence, in   June 2012 it was registered a penetration rate on 100 inhabitants in urban environment of 26, 12%, by   only 1, 19% more than in the same period of the year 2011. In the rural environment, the same index   registered a more significant increase, from 6, 98% in 2011 to 8, 82% in June 2012.    The improvement of penetrations of broadband connections on rural level involves in most of cases   significant investments for reaching the far points/dwellings geographically speaking. The rural fixed   broadband coverage scored in 2013 a 78%. This form of digital divide has been and will be for several   years included on digital agenda of development of Romania, leading indirectly to percentage increases   stronger from one year to another of the rate of penetration rural environment, comparatively to the   evolutions registered in the urban environment.   In what concerns the report between the households with access to internet and those with access to   broadband connection it may be noticed in Romania a reduction of the gap in the years. Whereas in 2006   out of 14% households with access to internet only 5% had broadband connection, in 2013, 56% of   households benefit from broadband connection.   In 2013, the coverage of fast broadband, of minimum 30 Mbps was of 55% and the minimum of 100 Mbps   is reached by 25% of total households.

The lowest share of   households with Internet connection is in the North East (45.7%) and South Muntenia (47.2%)    The main segments of Internet users opposite to their occupational status are those of   skilled/unskilled workers (20%), pupils/students (19%) and engineers, physicians, architects,   professors and economists (15%). The proportions are almost identical in case of users using fixed   connections, whereas the Internet users using mobile connections come significantly as well from   the category of contractors, free-lancers, managers or administrators (13%)    Most of internet users come, without significant differences between those using fixed or mobile   connections, from the households formed of 3 - 4 individuals (59%), with a higher share of those   with three members   Mobile broadband penetration has increased but it is still at insufficient quotas and fixed high-speed   Internet remains still a privilege of big cities. In 2012, third generation mobile broadband (HSPA) was   available to 96.2% of Romanian population (96.3% in the EU). Meanwhile, 4th generation (LTE) was   available only for 23.6% of population, compared with the EU average of 26.2%. The take-up rate of   mobile broadband reached 41% in June 2013, being still below the EU average of 54.5%.      Public Services of eGovernment   In 2013, 5% of citizens in Romania made use of the internet for eGovernment services. Out of these, 2% of   users returned to the Government authorities filled forms.    On the level of enterprises, 63% of Romanian enterprises are using the Internet up to the 3rd degree of   sophistication – transactional eGovernment services for interaction with public authorities (which is below   the EU27 average of 87%) and almost 20% are submitting offers through SEAP.                                                                    21 http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/information_society/data/main_tables    http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/information_society/data/main_tables      Page 108 of 172      Indicators of efficiency of governing act, Romania    2011 2012    RO EU27 RO EU27   Efficiency of governing (1-100) 48.00 82.00 - -   Administrative modernization, out of which:       Use of e-governing services by citizens (%) 11% 49% 31% -   Time necessary to incorporate a new company (days) 3.00 7.00 - -   Cost necessary to incorporate a new company (EUR) 100.00 400.00 - -   Hours necessary for conformity to the norms of tax   return, out of which:          Income tax - - 42.00    Labor tax - - 120.00    Consumption tax - - 60.00      2011 2012    RO EU27 RO EU27   Bribe (1-very common - 7 – never happens) 4.00 5.10 3.70 5.00   Defalcation of public funds  (1-very common - 7 – never   happens)   2.80 4.40 2.50 4.20   Source: European Commission, 2011 – 201222      Share of Enterprises interacting online with public administration per stages (%), Romania      Source: INS, Informational society, 2013 23                                                                  22 http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/key-areas/index_en.htm    http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/key-areas/index_en.htm      Page 109 of 172      APPENDIX 2 – SOCIAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS   Relevant indicators taken from The Digital Agenda Scoreboard – 2013 show Romania’s position compared   to EU standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               23 http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/ISI/publicatia_SI_13.pdf   http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/ISI/publicatia_SI_13.pdf      Page 110 of 172                                                                                                                                         Page 111 of 172                                                   Page 112 of 172                                                                            Page 113 of 172                                                                                                                                            Page 114 of 172                                                                   Page 115 of 172                                                                               Page 116 of 172                         Source: http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/Romania%20in%20cifre%202013_ro.pdf      Administrative division of Romania, December 31 2012   Number of counties  421 (including Bucharest)   Number of cities and municipalities  320   Of which: municipalities  103   Number of townships  2861   Number of villages 12957      Population separation based on sexes, age groups and environments, July 1 2012   http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/Romania%20in%20cifre%202013_ro.pdf      Page 117 of 172       2009 2010 2011 2012   Total 21469959 21431298 21354396 21316420   Sexes   Male 10457219 10434143 10392537 10375200   Female 11012740 10997155 10961859 10941220   Age groups   0-14 years 3245775 3241295 3213339 321143711 1    15-59 years 13949544 13837516 13724839 1369556411 1    60 years and above 4274640 4352487 4416218 44488481 1    On environments   Urban 11823516 11798735 11727153 11678600   Rural 9646443 9632563 9627243 9637820  1  On the 1  st  of January 2012.

Page 136 of 172      SWOT FOR ROMANIAN ICT INFRASTRUCTURE             Page 137 of 172               Strengths Weaknesses   Romania is a technology agnostic market with high   level of availability of NGN choices for the consumers.   Also, the high take-up of ultra fast broadband   (>100Mbps) is attributed to the maturity of the market   as well as the sophistication and appetite of the   consumers (mainly the youngsters segment).   Mobility is also encouraged by the high availability of   3G mobile coverage (96%) and the most recent fast   development of LTE coverage, driving fixed to mobile   substitution.   However, the low purchasing power, the demographic   structure of the population as well as the low e-literacy of the   older population result in low penetration of Internet   connections even in grey and/or black areas; in addition,   there are still many white spots that are not covered by   private investments and require public intervention   (especially in rural areas)    This low take-up is applicable both to fixed access networks as   well as mobile broadband and discourages private   investments driving unavailability of financing both for start-  ups and existing operators.   Opportunities  Threats and constraints    RONET project laying backhaul will harmoniously   complete the NGN developments into an overall NGN   Plan for Romania;   Romania is one of the lowest markets regarding  prices   for broadband and triple play which drives up the   competition between operators;   A fairly large high proportion of companies are using e-  procurement platforms;    Structural Funds are still available for Romania; despite   a low absorption rate these funds are expected to fuel   State aid notification delays;   Administrative delays in updating the necessary legislation   framework;  providing  assistance and  aids for rollout of   broadband infrastructure in both urban and  rural areas;   Difficulties in implementing RO-NET initiative;    Deployment of 4G networks requires significant investment   and operators are prudent in coverage plans (Romania has   good 3G coverage but below average for 4G).        Page 138 of 172      further developments of the market;   The existing access networks provide fast uplink   speeds and this comes to the benefit of Romania   serving as outsourcing destination for Shared Service   Centers and IT/Software development hubs as well as   providing cloud services to the rest of the European   markets.

With the main objective to create a   European Digital Single Market, Digital Agenda will generate both horizontal and sectorial effects and   which will have the destination a wide variety of public and private participants. The implications of the   Digital Agenda will have reform purpose and involves the implementation of an extensive process of   governmental transformation. This type of implementation involves a common and effective coordination   in order to ensure full cooperation of direct participants (Ministries, institutions, agencies, private sector   representatives, etc).   Having an implementation methodology that can act as a framework for reference for all public bodies is a   key mechanism for ensuring the successful application of the Fields of Actions in Romania and also can   provide the required evidence to assess the benefits realization.    In order to ensure the success of the Digital Agenda for Romania 2014 – 2020, we outline the key   characteristics of the implementation methodology:    Every Ministry in charge of Fields of Actions or Lines of Actions outlined within the National   Strategy for Digital Agenda 2020 will include their specific Fields/Lines of Actions complete with   target indicators and a methodology for assessing these indicators in a National Implementation   Plan for the Digital Agenda. The Technical Economic Committee will oversee the implementation   of the Implementation Plans for Digital Agenda for Romania and will provide best practices,   guidelines and advices for the Ministries during the development of the National Implementation   Plans    In the National Implementation Plans for the Digital Agenda, each Ministry will be responsible for   defining the indicators that will be used in order to track the completion of their specific   objectives and targets    Each initiative developed by public entities under the Digital Agenda for Romania Program will   define a set of specific indicators that can directly impact the Strategic Targets for Romania (those   specified above) or present a correlation methodology for describing the impact of their indicators   on the Strategic Targets. These indicators will be reviewed by the Technical Economic Committee   as part of their usual ICT project assessment    Each public entity implementing projects under the Digital Agenda for Romania Program will send   to the Technical Economic Committee bi-annually a status report for monitoring purposes in a        Page 152 of 172      format agreed by TEC, which will highlight the key achievements and missed milestones. At the   end of the each implementation initiative, a detailed report will be sent to the Technical Economic   Committee.    The evaluation of the impact for the Strategic Targets for each initiative will be conducted   annually by each supervising authority under the Ministries and will be sent for review and   consolidation to the Technical Economic Committee.     The Agency for Digital Agenda Romania will be in charge with monitoring the implementation of   the Strategy and the delivery of the Programme to track overall progress and ensure that the   lessons from monitoring and evaluation evidence are fed back into decision making and shared   across policy and programme areas.    As such, the Agency for Digital Agenda Romania will act as a consultancy agency for all public   bodies in respect to the objectives and strategy of the Digital Agenda and a monitoring and   evaluation body for the progress on the Digital Agenda Roadmap, and the Technical Economical   Committee will act as the operational body that will be in charge with supervision at the project /   program level.   Accelerating the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Romania   A workgroup has been created at the Prime Minster Chancellery level in order to accelerate the   implementation of the Digital Agenda for Romania Strategy. This workgroup, composed of the major   Ministries in Romania that will be involved in the reformation process for Digital Agenda in Romania, aims   to provide a joint responsibility for the objectives and initiatives outlined in this document and adopting a   plan of measures. A series of steps have been identified, that irrespective of other significant initiatives –   such as the Government Enterprise Architecture, can be used in order to stimulate the adoption of the   Strategy and its principles:    Consultations on the Digital Agenda for Romania with the Ministries responsible for Lines of   Actions with the clear objective of having the document approved by all the involved parties   within a clear timeframe    Defining the major (strategic) projects with all the involved parties for Field of Action I    Starting the development of the National Interoperability Framework for Romania    Out setting the discussions with other parties that can finance the Strategic Lines of Development   and minimize the financing gap – World Bank, Ministry of Finance, European Bank for   Reconstruction and Development    Signing a protocol with all the Ministries for the Government Enterprise Architecture initiative   (described below)        Page 153 of 172      The relationship between all the stakeholders involved in the Digital Agenda Strategy for Romania 2014 –   2020 is depicted below.

In aiding the public entities pursuing   initiatives under the Digital Agenda for Romania, The Ministry for Information Society will be the   publishing the Structured Meta Model and will review the initiatives based on the Digital Agenda   Guiding Principles (found below)    Prioritize – In this phase, initiatives will be assessed based on their impact against the targets set   by this document and their benefits realization in accordance with the necessary budget.    o Prioritization for the initiatives will be done based on the following criteria (guidelines will   be published by the Ministry for Information Society and will be refined iteratively):    Funding sources and requirements     Estimated impact of the initiative on the Strategic Targets versus funding needs    Type of project: strategic enabler projects that aim to create the necessary   context for other projects to be implemented will be prioritized    Evidence of stakeholder involvement and feedback from the targeted users   requesting the initiative through the means of consultation    Evidence of realistic planning in terms of funding, resources, phases etc.    Evidence of benchmarking done in other EU countries / similar projects in order to   assess the feasibility of the initiative    Adherence to National Strategy of the Digital Agenda and Guiding Principles and   Ministry Strategy    Adherence to National Standards (security, interoperability, etc)   o Prioritization for the lines of actions will be done based on the following criteria   (guidelines will be published by the Ministry for Information Society and will be refined   iteratively):    Strategic lines of actions are the first lines of actions for which funds will be   allocated due to their important nature in the roadmap for the Digital Agenda         Page 155 of 172       Enabler lines of actions are the second priority for implementation projects, as   these are the projects  that will facilitate the implementation of other projects   (included the ones in the Operational status)     Operational lines of actions are tertiary in terms of importance for the Strategic   Targets, and calls for this lines of actions will be made after the successful   implementation of the Strategic and Enabler lines of actions    Monitor – This phase in the lifecycle of an initiative will check progress against the planned targets   and will ensure that the necessary evidence for the spend and outputs is collected. For monitoring   purposes, the Ministries will send consolidated data for each initiative to the Technical Economic   Committee in a format published by the Ministry for Information Society in which the status of the   projects will be reported and the missed milestones / targets will be transparent, along with a list   of risks and mitigation actions    Evaluate – This phase will assess the effectiveness of an initiative and its efficiency during and   after implementation. In order to evaluate the impact of each initiative, in the definition phase of   the initiative, each entity will be responsible for defining the indicators and the methodology used   for the evaluation of the initiative in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe and its targets.   The methodology for evalution will have clear indicators on how the stakeholders of each project   will be involved in evaluating the impact and the success of each program / project. This   methodology and the indicators will be reviewed by the Technical Economic Committee.    Structured Meta Model   Apart from the strategic perspective of the Digital Agenda, a much needed improvement in Romania is   introducing a set of standards for describing, running, managing and evaluating initiatives and projects.   In order to have a coherent mechanism for defining an opportunity and assessing change in the current   context, Romania will adopt a Structured Meta Model for projects and initiatives. This is a strategic   endeavor of Digital Agenda Romania with the purpose of bringing structure and clarity to the description   and rationale for each project and will be systematically applied all the Field of Actions contained in the   Digital Agenda and all projects under each Line of Action.   Adopting a Meta Model will bring the following benefits:    Maintain the same structure for the description of the initiatives / projects    Relay the right messages to all the stakeholders    Adopt a uniform description of the projects that will ensure the minimal amount of re-work    Act as a checklist/starting point for any entity commencing an initiative, easing the burden of   creating the initial documents    Ensure that the necessary data is collected for the Monitoring and Evaluation phases        Page 156 of 172      This Meta Model can be applied iteratively starting from strategic initiatives to programs and individual   projects pertaining to the overarching governance and needs to be completed and refined from the first   iteration to the most granular approach.   Regardless of the document structure in which the following information will be provided, each public   entity will have the recommendation of using these data points as a checklist to confirm against the   completeness and accuracy of a project.   The six mandatory components for defining the Meta Model will be: Context, Objectives, Actions,   Principles, Timeline and Interdependencies.

Understanding the causes, effects and resolution of this pervasive issue is outside the scope of this   strategy, but having the right mechanisms and tools to address it is paramount for reaching the objectives   and indicators assumed by Romania. As such, the National Strategy for Digital Agenda in Romania 2014 –   2020 proposes different approaches that can be used to provide better administrative capacity for   developing, implementing and monitoring initiatives and policies, which are outlined below. The feasibility   of these approaches and any other options and will be explored as part of the Government Enterprise                                                                [1] http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2014/csr2014_romania_en.pdf        Page 157 of 172      Architecture initiative, being one of the most important factors of the business perspective of the   Romanian Administration.    Using better operational models – Romania needs to analyze ways in which to build and sustain   for longer periods the right levels of competency in distinct areas (such as Program Management,   Enterprise Architecture, specific public sector consultancy) – this will be done in the initial   Government Enterprise Architecture exercise. In the past, capacity outsourcing to private sector   and creating dedicated Project Management Units (with separate funding for personnel) have   shown great promise in maintaining the necessary administrative capacity    Increasing the cooperation between public entities – The Romanian Administration will look for   ways to increase the cooperation between public institutions and entities – in terms of   knowledge, skill sets, competencies and information. Example: CTE (Technical-Economical   Committee)     Increasing the cooperation between public and private entities – One of the most important   success factors in building the proper administrative capacity is increasing the cooperation   between public and private entities, by encouraging the public administration to collaborate with   the business environment (companies and associations of companies) for innovative solutions and   new paradigms for overcoming this shortcoming    Having a clear strategy and consensus – By adhering to a strict set of Guiding Principles and Public   Service Criteria and by enforcing them at an operational level through the Technical Economical   Committee, the public administration will ensure that all the efforts are channeled to a cohesive   strategy      Government Enterprise Architecture – the core initiative for eGovernment    Creating the legislation and operational framework for implementing Government Enterprise   Architecture. After its adoption, the Minister for Information Society will become the responsible   entity for Government EA at the Executive Level. The framework for Government Enterprise   Architecture will be tailored from industry recognized standards and will include at a minimum the   Business, Data, Application, Technology and People perspectives. The main objective of the   Government Enterprise Architecture will be to define a uniform set of standards, policies and   architectural guidelines which the agencies will use for ICT initiatives and investments. Key   outcomes of this initiative that will be prioritized before all other lines of actions are:   o Developing solutions for building administrative capacity for implementing the Digital   Agenda and creating the necessary Enterprise Architecture capabilities    o Creating the necessary legal framework with clear ownership for services, data and   initiatives   o Creating the as-is map with public systems available or in the implementation phase        Page 158 of 172      o Creating the to-be roadmap for public administration in terms of Business, Data,   Technology and Applications that adheres to the Digital Agenda Strategy   o Developing the National Interoperability Framework (see below more details) and the   roadmap for this implementation in current context   o eGovernment ICT Standards Checklist (See below more details)   o Creating the mechanism for managing the Digital Agenda Strategy throughout the   implementation period       PURPOSE: CREATING THE GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK FOR ROMANIA   BENEFITS: UNIFORM VISION IMPLEMENTATION AND PROMOTION FOR ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES AND PROJECTS   TIMELINE: MID 2015    Creating the Government Enterprise Architecture capabilities within the Ministries - empowering   and educating the agencies for using and applying the Government Enterprise Architecture for   their initiatives   PURPOSE: SUPPORT PUBLIC ENTITIES IN ADOPTING GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE   BENEFITS: BETTER ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT EA, UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF EA   TIMELINE: MID 2015    Evaluating the ICT investments in Romania on following and meeting the Guiding Principles and   Public Service Criteria   PURPOSE: EVALUATE ICT INVESTMENTS   BENEFITS: OVERSEE ALL ICT INVESTMENTS IN ROMANIA ARE IN LINE WITH THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES, PUBLIC SERVICE   CRITERIA AND ROMANIA’S STRATEGY   TIMELINE: END 2014 IN PLACE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT    Issuing and overseeing the implementation of the National Interoperability Framework that will   ensure end-to-end interoperability between future systems from the public sector, following the   European Interoperability Framework guidelines. Major outcomes of the National Interoperability   Framework should be reducing the number of redundant data sources in public administration   and increasing the ability to provide services that are cross-organization by using standard data   formats   PURPOSE: NATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY FRAMEWORK   BENEFITS: ENSURE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN NATIONAL SYSTEMS.

From a European Union terminology, public services in Romania encompass   both Services of General Interest and Services of General Economic Interest. That is why, entities pursuing   to implement services adhering to the Digital Agenda for Romania should take into account the following   criteria, on which quality public services should be defined and managed:    C1 - Center on user needs – All public services exist to server their customers, their needs and  they should be built, adapted and maintained for a particular and real demand. Each entity has to  identify all types of potential users, understand what they want and need and create or reform  services with respect to these -  because in the end quality represents achieving maximum  customer satisfaction    C2 - Be integrated – Partnerships between entities should be implemented in order to provide to  the customer a one stop shop for addressing a particular need (starting from the Life Events). This  will in turn increase the confidence in public services, make them easier to user and also increase  the collaboration between public entities. This can be met only by planned and systematic  collaboration between the parties involved in offering an integrated service, with shared goals  that are agreed consensually.     C3 - Be easy to use – Simple and responsive services which the public can understand. Users  should have a choice of service delivery in terms of payment methods, location of points of  contacts, opening hours and delivery times.    C4 - Meet a publicly committed service level – All public services should meet a publicly  committed quality standard in terms of responsiveness, availability and performance. The users of  a public service should be able to quickly identify what kind of services are available, what are  criteria for that public service and also should be able to swiftly identify what to expect from that  service and should be able to have the mechanism with which to ask questions and file complaints  about that service.         Page 160 of 172       C5 - Be safe – The services should protect all the information provided by the public. Security  should cover all the requirements for safety, privacy, confidentiality, availability and integrity for  data or processes in order to ensure trust in that specific public service.    C6 - Be accessible - Identify and work to eliminate barriers to access to services for people  experiencing poverty and social exclusion, as well as those facing geographic barriers to services.    C7 - Be cost-effective – Services should be efficiently operated, adequately staffed and highly  productive for both the internal and external users. A public service should be able to  demonstrate how it can contribute to national, initiative or projects objectives and outcomes.      Adopting the Guiding Principles and the Public Services Criteria   We understand that in order to have a consistent application of Digital Agenda for Romania for every Field   of Action, it is essential for the Guiding Principles (found in chapter 1.2) and Public Services Criteria to act   as the foundation to build upon projects pertaining to Digital Agenda in Romania, regardless of their Field   of action. As such:    All public bodies will include the Guiding Principles in their Implementation Strategy, together   with specific recommendations and implications    All public bodies will need to make sure they document the implications of following the Guiding   Principles and the Public Services Criteria in their detailed eGovernment plans    The 7 Public Services Criteria will act as a reference for defining the as-is and to-be state for any   public service    The Minister for Information Society will be responsible for evaluating the adherence to the   Guiding Principles and how eGovernment projects are meeting the Public Service Criteria    For each criteria from the Public Services Criteria, the Minister for Information Society is   responsible for defining the proper mechanisms of describing, evaluating, controlling and   governing    The Agency for Digital Agenda (described below) will be responsible for evaluating and supporting   the public bodies in adopting the Guiding Principles and Public Services Criteria      The Technical - Economical Committee   It is essential for the success of the Digital Agenda in Romania to create one public entity under the   authority of the Ministry for Information Society (the issuer of DAR) which will oversee the   implementation of this strategy, from an operational and tactical perspective. The objectives of the newly   formed Technical-Economical Committee are to define, correlate, control and monitor the ITC framework   in Romania, acting as the Lead Design Authority for eGovernment projects in Romania.    Support systems for the Technical Economical Committee   In order to make the Technical Economical Committee fully operational, a series of information systems   need to be created. These will act as the knowledge base for the committee and for other public entities   that want to build ICT project, supporting them in structuring and collecting information that can help        Page 161 of 172      sustain a rapid growth of investments in this field, while making sure that all these initiatives are coherent   and adhesive to our vision.   The first system is the National Register for Information Systems (NRIS), which will hold general and   specific information pertaining to information systems in Romania (Authority, Description, Funding,   Technical Components, Supplier, Integrations with other systems, Lifecycle status, Exceptions etc.). This   system needs to be fully integrated and automated with the e-Procurement system and needs to make its   data available to the general public and to other public entities. The committee will use this system for   Knowledge Management and it will update it based on the Evaluation Forms used for evaluating ICT   investments in Romania. The public bodies will inform the owner of this system for any changes in the   lifecycle of their project (for example, when decommissioning a system which is registered in NRIS).   BENEFITS: KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR ICT SYSTEMS IN ROMANIA   RESPONSIBLE: TECHNICAL ECONOMICAL COMMITTEE   SUPPORT: ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES    TIMELINE: END OF 2016    The second system, National Register for Data and Metadata (NRDM), will act as the repository for data   standards and metadata pertaining to ICT projects (for example, data sets and types of data handled by a   specific project). This system will evolve into automated access gateway to all the National Registers. This   will ensure that the appropriate owners of data at the Government level are responsible and accountable   for data which they provide. Clear responsibilities for data sets and data types will be identified and   defined by the Technical Economical Committee and steps will be taken to safeguard against public   entities using data sets which are not provided by the responsible bodies.   BENEFITS: KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR DATA TYPES AND DATA STANDARDS. REDUCING OVERLAPPING RESPONSABILITIES ON THE DATA   IN ROMANIA.   RESPONSIBLE: TECHNICAL ECONOMICAL COMMITTEE   SUPPORT: ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES    TIMELINE: END OF 2016      Governing rules for Broadband Infrastructure    Mapping and a detailed analysis of the coverage:    ANCOM to implement a mapping of the national telecommunications/broadband infrastructure as per   obligations imposed by Law 154/2012.     Public consultation   All measures will be publicly communicated and public consultation will allow stakeholders and public   opinion to be expressed, at the national level..     A competitive bidding procedure   Whenever the authorities that grant their support will select an operator to build and/or manage the   subsidized infrastructure, a bid will be organized.     The most beneficial bid in economic terms        Page 162 of 172      In the context of a competitive bidding procedure, the authority granting support will establish qualitative   award criteria based on which the submitted bids will be evaluated (e.g. addressing coverage priorities,   co-financing, etc.);    Technological neutrality   In principle, broadband services can be provided by means of a network infrastructure platform based on   wired, wireless, satellite and mobile technologies, or on a combination thereof. The future bids will thus   not favor or exclude a certain technology or network platform.     Use of the existing infrastructure   Since the possibility to re-use the existing infrastructure is one of the main factors that determine the cost   related to the introduction of broadband communications, the government will encourage bidders to use   the available existing infrastructure, in order to avoid any useless and inefficient duplication of resources   and to reduce the amounts assigned to public financing.     Wholesale access   Effective wholesale access of third parties to a subsidized broadband infrastructure is a requisite   component of any State measure to support broadband communications. Especially, wholesale access   allows third party operators to compete with the selected bidder (when such bidder is present also at the   level of retail market), thus consolidating the supply and competition in the areas envisaged by the   measure while avoiding at the same time the creation of regional service monopolies.     Rationalizing investments   In the rural area, with a low density of the population, where there are limited broadband services,   imposing all the types of access products might disproportionately increase the investment costs, without   obtaining significant benefits as far as the stimulation of the competition is concerned. In such a situation,   consideration might be given to the possibility that those access products which imply costly and   unforeseen interventions at the subsidized infrastructure (for instance, collocation in the intermediate   distribution points) should be offered only of there is a reasonable request from a third party operator.    Price policy in case of wholesale access   The prices for wholesale access should be based on certain principles for establishing the prices as defined   by ANCOM and on certain reference criteria, and they should take into account the aid received by the   network operator.    Monitoring and claw-back mechanism   The authorities granting aid will closely monitor throughout the entire term of the project the   implementation of the broadband project. The inclusion of a repayment mechanism may contribute to the   ex post and retroactive minimization of the value of the aid initially estimated to be necessary.    Transparency   The aid beneficiary has the obligation to provide entitled third parties with global and undiscriminating   access to the information about its infrastructure (including, inter alia, pipes, street cabinets and fiber   optic) developed under a State aid agreement. The aid beneficiary must provide all the useful information        Page 163 of 172      about the broadband network to a central register of broadband infrastructures to be developed by   ANCOM and/or at local administration level.     Reporting   Every two years, the authority grating the State aid will communicate to the European Commission   essential information about the aid project, commencing on the measure application date           Page 164 of 172      APPENDIX 6 – LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN DIGITAL   AGENDA FOR ROMANIA 2014 – 2020      Following is a list of public authorities, institutions and entities involved in the IT Thematic Committee that   was in charge of giving feedback and insights for the Digital Agenda for Romania 2014 – 2020.

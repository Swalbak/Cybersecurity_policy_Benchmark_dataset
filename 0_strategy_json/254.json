This plan is being interpreted and implemented through subsequent five-year medium term plans. According to Vision 2030, the BPO sub-sector alone is projected to generate over 20,000 job opportu- nities and contribute more than 10 per cent to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the Plan period. These projections entail development of a vibrant ICT sector to promote expansion and to drive productivity in other growth sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, financial and entertainment industries. At the same time, ICT influences and promotes eq- uity, transparency and accountability in the socio-political sectors necessary for wealth and job creation. To achieve the above, the Government created the Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology through executive Order No. 2 of 2013, along with its associated agencies with the mandate to develop and implement ap- propriate policies and programmes aimed at generating ICT related products and services required by providers of such goods and services in both Govern- ment and the private sector. To effectively carry out its mandate, the ministry has developed its 2013-17 Strategic Plan. ICT will be instrumental in enhancing good governance and efficiency across all sectors of the economy lead- ing to improved public service delivery. Among other considerations, this Strategic Plan aims to deepen and strengthen the foundation aimed at transforming Kenya into a knowledge-based and a globally competitive na- tion. This transformation will be done in line with the Vision 2030, by encouraging and stimulating investments in the sector through rapid expansion of ICT networks and services that are affordable and accessible to all. The global trend in the delivery of telecommunications, broadcasting information technology and postal ser- vices requires that governments, supported by a strong and independent regulatory institutional set-up should ensure a holistic management of available resources. In this regard, the Government consolidated all ICT devel- opment activities under an ICT Authority (ICTA) to ensure prudent utilisation of available resources. This will be done through integration and collaboration with the public, private and non-governmental stakeholders in the development planning and implementation of various initiatives and activities. This strategy is expected to en- hance participation in the development of hardware and software, infrastructure, local content, and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES). It is my sincere hope that the full implementation of this Plan will provide the necessary enabling environment which will propel the country’s economic growth through increased productivity spanning all the sectors of our economy. FRED MATIANG’I, PhD Cabinet SeCretary For inForMation, CoMMUniCationS and teChnoLoGy. Foreword by the Cabinet Secretary vii PreFaCe and aCknowLedGeMent by the PrinCiPaL SeCretary The ministry acknowledges the great potential of ICT as an enabler for the society’s socio-economic empowerment. This is drawn from the remarkable achievements that Kenya has made in the past five years, which include: elec- tronic cash transfer through mobile telephony platform, development of 60 per cent of the planned national ICT infrastructure to improve universal access to ICT services, connectivity to the international broadband highway through four sub-marine fibre optic cables, connecting all major towns through the National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI), and the development and implementation of the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act, 2009 and the Kenya Information and Regulations, 2010. In this Plan, the ministry draws its strategic priorities from the achievements of the predecessor, the lessons learnt, emerging issues and challenges. It also takes cognisance of a totally new structure of Government and the general policy direction. It is our conviction that the implementation of these policies, programmes and the associated activities bears the potential to transform Ke- nya’s way of life as envisioned in the second medium term plan. This Plan has prioritised various programmes and activities for implementation under six broad strategic priori- ties, namely: (i) Policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms; (ii) Improvement of universal access to ICT services; (iii) Building capacity within the ICT sector (iv) Creating employment and facilitating economic growth; (v) Building a digital economy and Government; and (vi) Promoting regional integration through ICT. In the fulfillment of Article 10 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, the Ministry adopted a participatory approach where senior staff in the Ministry and its Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies (SAGAs), the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), the academia, the physically challenged and the county governments presented their views and proposals on the various issues considered in the Plan. To deliver its planned objectives, the ministry’s institutional structure has been reorganised to include the ICT Authority (ICTA), the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK), the Information and Public Communications Director- ate, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), the Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK), Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC), the Media Council of Kenya, the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board (KYEB) and the Brand Kenya Board (BKB). This Strategic Plan would not have been effectively delivered without the full commitment and dedication of the Ministerial Taskforce, which coordinated and managed the process. As we embark on the implementation phase, the ministry will work closely with other sectors whose services contribute to its outcomes to ensure all projects and programmes are implemented successfully. Specifically, the availability and distribution of electricity is important to induce the use of ICTs; access roads and way-leaves are required to access many of our sites, while security and water are basic and critical requirements in areas of our interest. The ministry will strive to implement the Plan through performance contract targets, annual work plans and individual work plans. In addition, a monitoring and evaluation framework will be developed and used to track the implementation of projects and programmes. In conclusion, I thank all those who participated in the preparation of this Plan, including all government min- istries and agencies, community-based organisations, non-governmental organisations and the private sector whose diverse contributions made this exercise a success. JOSEPH TIAMPATI OLE MUSUNI PrinCiPaL SeCretary, MiniStry oF inForMation, CoMMUniCationS and teChnoLoGy Preface and Acknowledgement by the Principal Secretary viii The Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology’s Strategic Plan spells out key policy actions, legal and regulatory frameworks, institutional reforms, programmes and projects that will be implemented in the 2013-2017 medium term plan period. The Plan takes into consideration the requirements of the Kenya Constitu- tion, 2010, and the Second Medium Term Plan (MTP2) of the Kenya Vision 2030 Long Term Blue Print. This Strategic Plan promises effective utilisation and application of ICTs across multi-faceted service delivery and internal government operations with a view to achieve the goals of Vision 2030. The Plan is based on assess- ment and analysis of current social-economic, political and environmental climates and the past performance in order to ensure that national aspirations, stakeholder requirements and global best practices are taken into account. The Plan starts by presenting the background of the ICT sector and its status in chapter one. It identifies the vision as “Kenya as a globally competitive knowledge-based economy” while the mission is “To facilitate universal access to ICT infrastructure and services within the country”. The plan spells out the mandate and the goal of the ministry. The chapter also reviews the performance of the sector during the first Strategic Plan period 2008-2013 and builds on the results to ensure that completed projects are well utilised while those on-going are completed in the second MTP period. Emerging issues, challenges and lessons learned area also highlighted. Situation analysis is dealt with in Chapter two. a detailed environmental scan has identified internal and external factors that are likely to influence the ministry’s activities and incorporates them in the development strategies. Following a review of the ministry’s functions, recommendations are made on merging certain functions under internal departments or with others under different ministries to remove overlaps and duplication. The chapter ends with a SWOT and sector related challenges analysis. Chapter three and four details the national development agenda and the role of ICT. Chapter three highlights priority areas to be addressed under the second medium term plan, including the Kenya Constitution 2010, devolution issues, security, equity and governance. Stakeholder analysis is also discussed. Chapter four details the sector’s flagship and other projects to be implemented in the second MTP period. In line with the Vision 2030 overarching goal of making Kenya a middle income nation by the year 2030, Chapter five defines the ministry’s strategic areas, objectives and strategies and its overall goal of strengthening the foundation of a competitive knowledge-based economy by tackling the under-listed strategic areas: 1. Policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms 2. National Broadband Connectivity Network 3. Digital economy and government 4. ICT capacity 5. Strong public private partnership (county and regional integration) 6. Content and application development 7. Employment and wealth creation 8. Mainstreaming of crosscutting issues From the above strategic areas, the plan proposes various programmes and projects that will be implemented during the plan period. First to enhance business environment within the sector, the ministry will develop, review and amend policy, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks to spur growth. Proper formulation and review of policies, legal and institutional frameworks will play a key role to achieve the objectives and goals of the Plan. Other key programmes to be implemented in this strategic area include restructuring of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK); rolling out of the Digital Government Initiative and the National Electronic Payment System; roll out of the 4G network and broadband connectivity and public information and communication management.  To improve broadband connectivity, the Government will continue to build high-speed broadband national ICT Infrastructure comprising the Backbone Infrastructure Network and the Long-term Technology Evolution (LTE) network projects, among others. On a digital economy and government, the plan proposes to improve access to ICTs, develop critical mass of local ICT skills and secure all networks and facilities in the country. The Government also proposes to create ICT centres of excellence, incubation hubs and labs, develop ICT skills data banks, develop industry-based curriculum and modernise ICTs training facilities. To enhance equity and equality, the ministry will promote county and regional integration through harmonisation of ICT strategies. A county liaison office at the ministry’s headquarters will be established. The plan proposes to streamline the management of public information and communication through Executive Summary ix development and implementation of a public communication policy to be used across all government agencies. The ministry will also support local content and application development where Kenyans will be encouraged to tell their stories on the net. The Government will develop capacity within the ICT sector and also establish techno-cities and multimedia parks to create employment and wealth for Kenyans. The plan also ensures that cross-cutting issues are mainstreamed in all programmes that will be implemented during the plan period. In line with the Kenya Vision 2030, the Plan recognises Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) as its flagship. The programme entails the establishment of a techno-city at Konza in Makueni and Machakos counties, marketing, capacity building and development of business incentives packages to attract investors in this field. The plan classifies those projects that would be implemented within the Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives. It also identifies energy, science and technology, education and training, trade and industry as key enablers for a successful and sustainable knowledge-based economy. To successfully implement the plan, chapters six and seven draw out the implementation model and coordination framework. In particular, chapter six lists all the departments and parastatals in the ministry, detailing their role towards the achievement of the plan. Chapter seven explains strategies to achieve the planned objectives and also the sources of required funds. Chapter eight gives details of capacity building, the resultant costs and development strategy. Chapter nine highlights the risks that may affect the implementation of the Plan and gives recommendation on risk management. The human capacity and structure required to successfully deliver the Plan; financial requirements for the activities in the programmes have been worked out and explicitly tabulated in Chapter ten. To implement the programmes, the ministry requires approximately KShs75 billion from the Government while the private sector is expected to invest in the other identified areas. The Ministry also proposes to carry out monitoring and evaluation exercises to ensure that various activities are undertaken within the specified timeframe. Achievable and objectively verifiable indicators have been developed to guide the monitoring and evaluation activities in Chapter twelve. In its conclusion, the Strategic Plan looks at recommendations to be addressed for its successful implementation. It is expected that successful implementation of this Plan will provide the necessary tool to manage our knowledge for development in order to transform Kenya into a Digital Economy. Executive Summary x 1 1.0 introdUCtion Over the past decade, the Government has initiated and adopted several policies, laws and regulations to guide the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) in order to harness its potential for socio- economic development. However, the convergence in the modern technology requires continuous review of the policy and legal frameworks to accommodate technological changes for maximum utilisation of ICT’s potential and benefits. ICT advances over the past few decades have seen the convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications, com- puting and content. The developments have changed the way business is conducted, facilitated learning and knowledge sharing, generated new global information flows, empowered citizens and communities, resulting in a global information society. Increasingly, ICT is playing the central catalytic role in pushing the development process forward and boosting the efficiency of the increasingly integrated global economy. In industrial coun- tries, it is widely acknowledged to be the engine of economic growth and directly linked to productivity. Conse- quently, countries that have harnessed the ICT potential have attained significant social and economic develop- ment. The Government of Kenya is, therefore, committed to creating an enabling environment for members of the public to access information as provided for in Chapter 35 (1) (a) of the Constitution of Kenya. Kenya has always been among the leaders in the region in the deployment of ICT. The country’s capacity to develop as a leading ICT hub will determine the future success of Kenya in enhancing its competitiveness in the regional and global economy, and improving the quality of life of its people. However, this will only be achieved through application of international best practices in the use of ICT in all aspects and sectors of its economy. Since most industrial countries and many developing nations have already set out to become leading regional and global ICT hubs, it is essential that a high level of priority and commitment by the Government and the private sector of Kenya is given to fast-track the successful implementation of the Strategic Plan so that the objectives set-out above are achieved. Success in achieving this objective requires sustained effort in setting policies, devising strategies, and adopting standards that ensure the full potential of ICT to be harnessed so as to meet the present and future social, economic and cultural sustainable development aspirations of the people of Kenya. The Government has recognised the importance of ICT in stimulating national development, in particular, modernisation and globalisation of the economy, and creating a platform for participation by all sections of the population. In this context, the Government has initiated the process of developing a comprehensive National ICT Policy. This policy document serves to guide ICT development, access and its utilisation on a national scale to meet the challenges of the information age. It will also lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive ICT Master Plan. 1.1 ViSion, MiSSion, Mandate and Core VaLUeS. 1.1.1 ViSion Kenya as a globally competitive knowledge-based economy. 1.1.2 MiSSion To facilitate universal access to ICT infrastructure and services all over the country.

The information and broadcasting sub-sector is responsible for gathering and dissemination of news and information through radio and television, production and dissemination of features, training of mass media personnel, information marketing, advertising and image building. Through press accreditation, it also regulates the activities of local and foreign journalists to ensure upholding of mass media communication professionalism and ethics. Introduction 3 The information and broadcasting sub-sector is made up of two main departments: a) The Department of Information b) The Department of Public Communications Specialised activities under the sub-sector are performed by Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies (SAGAs), which include the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board, Kenya Institute of Mass Communications and the Media Council of Kenya. The communications sub-sector comprises the telecommunications, ICTs and the postal services. The main de- partments are: a) The Department of Telephone services b) Directorate of Communications; and c) The Information Technology Services Unit. Specialised services under this sub-sector are performed by the Communication Authority of Kenya, the Na- tional Communications Secretariat, the Communications Multimedia Appeal Tribunal, the Postal Corporation of Kenya, the Kenya ICT Authority, The East African Marine System (TEAMS) and the proposed Fibre Optic National Network (FONN). 1.3 PaSt PerForManCe 1.3.1 aChiVeMentS Under StrateGiC PLan 2008-2013 Under the first Vision 2030-based Strategic Plan, the ICT sector made tremendous progress. Kenya led the world in electronic cash transfer through the mobile telephony platform, resulting in immense benefits to micro-cred- its and savings. The sector also witnessed development of 60 per cent of the planned national ICT infrastructure to improve universal access to ICT services. The country is currently connected to the international broadband highway through the SEACOM, TEAMS, EASSY, and LION cables. All major towns in the country are now con- nected through the National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI) and Government Common Core Net- work (GCCN). Demand for the Internet and data services has been rising, with Internet subscription increasing from 1,579,387 subscribers in 2009 to 8,506,748 in 2012. This has enhanced business activities and created job opportunities. The Government developed a tier-2 Government Data Centre (GDC) infrastructure to ensure security of Gov- ernment data and applications. Bandwidth support to government offices was increased from 80 to 100 MB of broadband Internet capacity. This has improved the quality and reliability of the Government’s communication system. Several ministries have developed online systems geared towards improving service delivery. They include the re-engineered Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); County Revenue Col- lection System; application of public service jobs online; status tracking of ID and passports; public examination results and candidate selection into secondary schools; digitised education content in 12 subjects at the second- ary school level; online submission of tax returns; online custom declaration; electronic reporting of corruption; and a business licensing e-registry. The Konza Techno City business plan with its physical development plan was developed. The focus areas to drive growth of the Techno-City include BPO, Internet Enabled Services (ITES), software development, data centres, disaster recovery centres, call centres and light assembly manufacturing. Other initiatives in the sector included establishment of digital villages, digitising government records and providing connectivity to government, learning and social institutions; software development and film production; and establishment of an open data portal. This has made Kenya to be ranked second in Africa and 22nd (2012) worldwide in the open data initiative. The Government developed and implemented the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act, 2009, and the Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2010. These legislations led to improved competition and broad choices of ICT services. Introduction 4 The ICT sector in Kenya grew at an average of nearly 20 per cent annually from 1999 to 2013. The number of phone subscriptions has grown from the equivalent of one per 1,000 adults in 1999 to nearly one per adult in 2013. Internet usage rates for 2013 were around five for every ten adults. Person-to-person mobile money trans- actions at the end of 2010 were equivalent to around 20 per cent of the GDP with two of every three Kenyan adults being users. ICT has been one of the main drivers of Kenya’s economic growth over the last decade. Since 2000, Kenya’s economy grew at an average of 3.7 per cent, with ICT being responsible for 0.9 of the 3.7 per cent annual GDP growth, and for all of Kenya’s GDP per capita growth (World Bank).   The 2013 statistics show that the ICTs forward and backward linkages have continued to improve, with employ- ment opportunities hitting over 150,000. For instance, there were 103,165 mobile money agents by June 2013. The number, according to the CBK data, has been growing by at least 3,000 agents each month. The rise in the number of agents indicates increased access of mobile money transfer services as well as creation of employ- ment opportunities in ICT. Other areas that are likely to grow exponentially include the broadcasting services when the country fully mi- grates to the digital platform where over 200 TV channels will be made available, ITES/BPO Services when the first phase of Konza Techno-City is implemented, software and hardware development, among many others. The table below shows performance of ICT in the last nine years. tabLe 6: key inForMation and CoMMUniCationS eConoMiC indiCatorS indicator 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 as at 30th Sep 2013 1 Mobile telephony Mobile telephony capacity 6,800,000 10,600,000 18,200,000 25,964,700 29,400,000 46,628,948 47,677,000 49,977,000 55,077,000 Mobile subscribers 6,484,791 9,304,818 12,933,653 17,362,257 19,364,559 24,968,891 26,980,771 30,432,782 31,301,506 Mobile penetration (%) 15.74 21.62 33.65 39 49.7 63.2 68.4 77.2 76.9 Licensed mobile operators 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 Mobile money transfer service subscribers 10,615,386 17,395,727 19,318,684 25,114,462 Licensed mobile money transfer service operators 1 1 3 5 6 6 6 2 Fixed telephony Fixed line/wire line capacity 513,82 516,993 505,103 512,281 485,581 421,528 400,764 380,135 362,627 Wire line connections 293,364 339,229 527,064 247,972 243,656 226,587 92,275 70,390 58,749 Wireless connections - 84,107 274,449 448,529 429,289 154,161 186,939 177,910 150,590 Total wire line & wireless connections 293,364 347,226 527,064 696,501 672,945 380,748 279,214 248,300 209,339 Fixed line tele-density (%) 0.86 0.90 1.8 1.7 0.96 0.71 0.63 0.51 3 International outgoing fixed line traffic (minutes) 42,558,605 46,957,348 27,363,876 15,582,304 14,471,643 14,761,211 11,455,952 20,058,628 121,164,636 International incoming fixed line traffic (minutes) 157,836,403 113,692,918 85,672,270 83,148,332 88,538,230 38,550,399 31,866,685 17,796,496 154,885,621 4 Internet and data services Licensed Internet service providers 72 66 96 108 124 132 141 165 169 Licensed data carrier network operators 2 3 6 8 12 19 19 20 21 Introduction 5 indicator 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 as at 30th Sep 2013 Internet subscribers 527,460 555,550 1,385,148 1,679,776 1,981,048 3,296,975 6,152,664 8,506,748 11,671,337 Estimated internet users1 1,054,920 1,111,000 2,770,296 3,359,552 3,962,096 8,884,850 11,305,592 13,537,658 19,162,055 Internet penetration (%) 3.0 3.0 7.5 8.7 9.7 22.1 28.7 35.5 47.1 International Internet leased bandwidth (Mbps) 160.17 174.43 485.14 1,421.15 9,949.9 20,209.5 53,479.78 278,329 360,900.1 5 Licensed radio stations 225 270 284 323 376 387 435 461 579 Licensed TV stations 77 105 112 121 108 108 104 2282 371 Digital signal distributor service providers 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 6 Postal and courier services PCK postal outlets 768 721 744 710 702 698 690 634 622 Private letter boxes 400,016 411,716 414,616 412,006 410,709 414,750 427,900 431,181 432,000 Letter posting boxes 1,049 966 827 890 905 890 890 752 890 Public counter positions 1,388 1,388 1,390 1,279 1,229 1,296 1,261 1,030 1102 Stamp vending licences 4,242 4,125 4,609 4,505 4,454 5,205 5,260 2,847 4,274 Stamp vending machines - 264 246 280 297 280 280 280 280 Private courier operator outlets 521 554 606 622 625 840 635 683 707 Licensed postal and courier operators 164 159 176 190 214 Source CAK 1.3.2 eMerGinG iSSUeS and ChaLLenGeS The ICT sector as a whole faced the following challenges in the implementation of the first Vision 2030-based strategic plan programmes: · Inadequate financing coupled with delayed disbursement; · Inadequate human capacity for research and development in ICT and the film industry; · Inadequate legislation for better exploitation of ICT in commerce and entertainment with adequate safeguards against crime and ICT media abuse; · Decentralised ICT coordination structures leading to slow implementation of automated systems, duplication and implementation of ICT innovations; · Digital divide between the rural and urban areas which limits public awareness of the advantages and opportunities of ICT; · Slow adoption of ICT services by learning, social and government institutions; · Non-incorporation of ICT cabling in new building designs; · Lack of harmonised data management system; · Inadequate information resource centres in the rural areas; · Low ICT skills; · Vandalism of ICT infrastructure; · Sophistication in cyber attacks and cyber crimes; · Lack of or inadequate supply of affordable and uninterrupted power supply; and · Limited penetration of telecommunication infrastructure in rural areas Introduction 6 1.3.3 LeSSonS Learnt The cost of communication may have come down considerably but there still remains a wide digital divide between urban and rural areas. The cost of ICT delivery, utilisation and maintenance in the rural areas also tend to be higher than in the urban areas. Reforms in trade and industry are key in enabling e-business to flourish. However, these reforms are yet to be fully realised and can only be achieved if there is political stability and peace among citizens. In the years of relative peace, the country experiences growth and development due to increased investments, calm and focus among citizens. Delay in the implementation of these initiatives was experienced when the ministry was involved in lengthy ten- dering and negotiation process, particularly on the privatisation of Telkom Kenya and the awarding of tender to implement the TEAMS project. Competition has been observed to be a good element for development, especially in the growth of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Diaspora Direct Investment (DDI). In telecommunication, for instance, the cellular market has grown and spread all over the country, allowing Kenyans to communicate easily and carry out economic activities. Competition has also lowered the cost of communication. For Kenya to have a fully ICT induced economy, the ICT users must be literate enough rather than only having ICT systems and content alone. Education and training curricular reviews have not been carried out to ensure this is done. Population awareness of ICT should be championed countrywide to spread the use and importance of ICT, and also educate the illiterate on some basic facts of ICT. For Kenya to fully utilise ICT as an economic driver, there is need to address other support sectors such as energy whose cost and availability of energy has hindered the development of ICT. Kenya has a population with different talents as far as innovations in ICT application in mobile technologies is con- cerned. This, therefore, calls for the country to start programmes that recognise talents and start growing them. The current state of ICT infrastructure is still a major hindrance to the country’s full exploitation of the economic and commercial potential of the sector. To develop this infrastructure, private sector participation will be needed. Public sector communications must be well managed and coordinated by State entities to project a positive image of the Government. Managing communications is essential in meeting the high expectations of the citizenry for quality public service delivery. Poor management of public communications reduce Government visibility, accessibility and acceptability. This subsequently results in reduced public trust and confidence in the integrity, reliability and impartiality in the Public Service. The ongoing modernisation of equipment has improved the information gathering and delivery to the citizenry. Budgetary constraints delayed the implementation and extension of information resource centres. Freezing of recruitment and blocking of staff promotions affected effective delivery of services to the public. Expansion of the media space saw the growth of social media, which has improved uptake of information. The successful implementation of TEAMS as a PPP indicates that the Government can effectively collaborate with the private sector to implement key programmes which require huge capital investment through a structured PPP framework. Introduction 7 2.0 SitUationaL anaLySiS 2.1 introdUCtion Currently Kenya is one of Africa’s fastest growing ICT markets where ICTs have increased productivity in all spheres of production process and have enabled expansion of skills, contributing to improved standards of living for Ken- yans. The First Strategic plan of 2008-12 aimed at addressing the key foundation components in ICT in order to achieve the goal of becoming a knowledge-based economy. The second Strategic Plan 2013-17 will build on the areas identified in the first plan, which consists of the following: Development of national ICTs policies and legal frameworks, infrastructure development, capacity development, content and application development, employ- ment and wealth creation, and public private partnerships. 2.2 enVironMentaL SCan The environmental scan will be analysed from the perspectives of opportunities and threats at three levels namely: Global, regional and local.

The aim of the Vision is to make Kenya “a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life by 2030”. It aims at transform- ing Kenya into “a newly-industrialised, middle income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment”. Simultaneously, the Vision aspires to meet the MDGs for Kenyans. The Vi- sion is anchored on economic, social and political pillars. The economic pillar aims to achieve an economic growth rate of 10 per cent annually and sustaining the same till 2030 in order to generate more resources to address the MDGs. A number of flagship projects have been identified in every sector. These are to be implemented over the vision period to facilitate the desired growth that can support the implementation of the MDGs on a sustainable basis. The key sectors identified under this pillar are shown in Table 3 below: table 3: economic pillar sectors Sector objective tourism To be one of the top ten long-haul tourist destinations in the world, offering high-end, diverse and distinctive visitor experience. agriculture To promote an innovative, commercially-oriented and modern agriculture sector. Manufacturing To have a robust, diversified and competitive manufacturing sector. wholesale and retail trade To move towards raising earnings by giving our large informal sector opportunities to transform itself into a part of the formal sector that is efficient, multi-tiered, innovative and diverse in product range. business process outsourcing To become the top off-shoring destination in Africa. Financial services To create a vibrant and globally competitive financial sector promoting high levels of savings and financing for Kenya’s investment needs.

The Second MTP outlines policies designed to implement devolution, accelerate growth, reduce poverty, trans- form the structure of the economy and create more quality jobs, as the country prepares to achieve middle income status by 2030. The following are key priority areas that the Government will implement over the Plan period: Constitution and devolution: The Government is committed to full implementation of the Constitution to ensure the rapid set-up of all the county institutions. Chapter Two, Article 6 (1) to (3) and the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution will be implemented without disrupting public service delivery at national and county levels. Priority will be given to the development of the capacity of all county governments, improve policy coordination and implementation in order to get the full benefits of devolution. national cohesion: The government believes in unity with diversity as a principle. It will therefore build peace, reduce ethnic rivalry and promote issue-based politics by providing a framework for inter-ethnic peace building founded on mutual respect and resolution of conflicts. Security: Security in the country will be addressed in order to provide individual safety to Kenyans and to inves- tors. The National Police Service will, therefore, be better trained and equipped and the operational capability improved. In line with the Constitution, security regulations and behaviour must conform to local and interna- tional human rights standards. drought emergencies and food security: The Government will prioritise implementation of the Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE) plan as an integral part of this MTP. Priority will also be given to increasing invest- ment in irrigation to reduce the country’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. Strategies to mechanise agricul- ture, revive cooperatives and farmers unions and subsidise farm inputs will be undertaken. Additionally, empha- sis on value addition in the production and supply chain will be prioritised. equity in access to opportunities and lower cost of living: The government will lay emphasis on implemen- tation of affirmative action in employment opportunities in public sector, and ensure resource distribution ad- dresses regional imbalances. Another key priority will be to reduce the cost of living through lowering the cost of food and other basic needs. The Government will, therefore, support expansion of production of food through irrigation, use of local competitively priced supply chains to deliver food to consumers more cheaply and im- Kenya’s Development Agenda 15 proved management of the marketing systems. health: Kenya has made major gains in health care, especially in tackling communicable diseases such as HIV- AIDs, T.B and malaria. However, a lot still needs to be done to improve the overall health care system. The Gov- ernment will put emphasis on universal access to health care, preventive and primary health care, clean water, management of communicable disease, maternal and child health, and non-communicable diseases. It will also invest in medical research, pharmaceutical production and health tourism as a means of diversifying external revenue sources and serve as a regional hub for health services. education: Significant progress was made under First MTP but several challenges persist and in particular, qual- ity. The Government will, therefore, focus on addressing low enrollment in areas that remain below the national average, retain students in school up to 18 years, provide education more effectively through a digital platform, and match education and training with the demand for the skills required in the workplace. In addition, the Gov- ernment will hire additional teachers in order to lower pupil-teacher ratio and improve quality as well as ensure that teachers devote the required time to teaching and learning. infrastructure: The Second MTP will build on successes of the First MTP. New investments will include cheaper and adequate electricity; local and regional rail and road networks that provide safe, efficient and cost effective transport; adequate water for households and industry; affordable quality housing and sustainable environmen- tal management. industrialisation: The Kenyan economy is still reliant primarily on agriculture and services. The growing con- sumer demand for manufactured goods has been met mainly by imports. The government will facilitate growth of the manufacturing sector; make agriculture competitive and diversify the economy for employment creation. The Government will also support local entrepreneurs to increase their share in local and external markets through better supply chain and making local enterprises more price-competitive in order to serve a growing local, regional and continental market. improved trade: The country will focus on expanding trade to increase its share in the fast expanding regional and other emerging markets. Trade in the broader region will be backed by joint infrastructural investments with neighboring countries. During the plan period, the Government will facilitate research in business development and entrepreneurship under a new entity called “Biashara Kenya” to provide funding and leverage investment from local banks. This will develop capacity and productivity of local manufacturing geared to competitively priced quality exports to Africa and the global market. investment to support growth: The strategies in the Second MTP are designed to increase investment to GDP ratio by investing prudently in key sectors. Land reforms and registration will be undertaken to make land a pro- ductive asset. In addition, new initiatives will be undertaken to encourage the financial sector mobilize savings and improve resource allocation to key growth sectors. Competitiveness and rebalancing growth: To make Kenya globally competitive, the Government will increase investment in expansion, development and modernisation of roads, rail, ports, ICT and telecommunications in order to make Kenya a top logistics hub. In addition, priority will be given to development of the Lamu Port, Southern Sudan and Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor and the oil, gas and other mineral resources sector to spur higher economic growth. Priority will also be given to implementing the National ICT Master Plan (2013- 2017) and the implementation of reforms to improve World Bank. The PPP Act will be operationalised to facilitate private sector investment in infrastructure in order to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of the economy. Strengthening social protection: The Government will deepen the effectiveness of social protection by bring- ing more areas and groups under social protection coverage. This will be done by enhancing social assistance, social security and health insurance. Governance and public financial management reforms: The Public Financial Management Act (2012) will be implemented with the aim of exercising controls in public spending and improving the quality of public expen- diture through full implementation of the Integrated Public Financial Management Systems (IFMIS) at national and county levels. Further training of public officials involved in budgeting and expenditure at both levels of government will be Kenya’s Development Agenda 16 undertaken. Reforms in public financial management will be guided by transparency, cost- efficiency better de- livery of public services, and accountability to the public on taxation and the use of public funds. Land reforms: The National Land Policy of 2007 will be reviewed to align it with the Constitution. Land will be adjudicated and title deeds issued to individuals and communities that presently lack these in order to promote secure land ownership and more investment. arts, sports and culture: Investment will be made to position creative arts, cultural heritage and sports as major sources of employment and income earning opportunities especially for the youth. The strategy will be to identify and nurture talents, support its commercialisation and provide necessary infrastructure at national and county levels. 3.2 SeCtor StakehoLderS Table 1: Role of sector stakeholders Stakeholder roles The Treasury Programme funding and formulation of financial policies Government ministries and agencies Formulation and implementation of Government policies Development partners Provides funds and technical support The public Produces data, tax payers, suppliers and consume services NGOs Facilitate and mobilise programme implementation CBOs Facilitate and mobilise programme implementation Community ad- vocacy Academic institutions Provision of expertise, professionalism, human capacity building and promotion of science, technology and innovations Knowledge transfer of new innovations International research institutions Collaborative research, collaboration in programme development, implementation and provision of quality and efficient extension services, policy guidelines, synergies and capacity building Industry regulators and marketing agents Marketing and industry regulation Private sector Partnering with sector in programme development and implementation Kenya’s Development Agenda 17 4.0 roLe oF the iCt in kenya’S deVeLoPMent aGenda The Government recognises ICT as a foundation for economic development.

Implementation Model 30 7.0 Co-ordination FraMework In order to achieve the above objectives and successfully implement the Strategic Plan, MoICT will continuously review and develop key performance management systems ensuring effective adjustments in management process, especially in its annual performance contracts. Specifically, the ministry will employ the following meas- ures for successful implementation of its 2013-2017 Strategic Plan: 7.1 StrateGy(S) to aChieVe PLanned objeCtiVeS 7.1.1 StakehoLder enGaGeMent The ministry will continue engaging stakeholders on the implementation of the plan through workshops, semi- nars and other fora to evaluate the processes in order to generate and implement appropriate and timely inter- ventions. This approach, among other benefits, will ensure the requisite participation of all the key partners in the implementation and delivery of the Plan. 7.1.2 annUaL PerForManCe ContraCt(S) Preparation of annual performance contract targets by the ministry will form the basis of the realisation of the strategic plan’s objectives. 7.1.3 PreParation oF the MiniSteriaL annUaL work-PLanS The Ministry will prepare its annual work plan, prioritising key activities to be implemented during the plan pe- riod. This work plan will be derived from the strategic plan. 7.1.4 PreParation oF dePartMentaL annUaL work-PLanS Preparation of the departmental work-plan will be derived from the ministerial performance contract and the ministerial work-plan. The departmental work-plan will detail key activities to be implemented under their man- date and in the Strategic Plan. 7.1.5 PerForManCe aPPraiSaL SySteMS The heads of departments will cascade the departmental work from the ministerial performance contract and then set individual targets from the departmental work-plan. Each head of department will appraise the staff on the targets signed with the Principal Secretary and later signed with the departmental staff. 7.1.6 indiVidUaL work-PLanS Individual work plans will be based on departmental annual work plan. Every individual staff will contribute to achievement of the ministry’s strategic goals and objectives. 7.1.7 PreParation oF bUdGet ProPoSaLS The ministry will prepare its budget proposal to the National Treasury during the Plan period prioritising key programmes and projects financial requirements to be implemented during the(MTE) period. This will enable the ministry to mobilise the required resources for the implementation of the Plan. Co-ordination Framework ChaPter SeVen 31 7.1.8 MonitorinG & eVaLUation Periodic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) exercise will also enhance the success of the Plan implementation. Heads of departments and project coordinators will carry out monthly, quarterly and biannual M&E by giving quarterly progress reports submitted to the Principal Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary. 7.1.9 bi-MonthLy ProjeCtS rePortinG The Plan implementation will be conducted through bi-monthly reporting of priority projects using the pre- scribed format. 7.1.10 hUMan reSoUrCe The ministry will provide an enabling working environment to its employees to ensure maximum output towards the Plan implementation. It will alsl continue offering capacity building in key areas that requires intervention. 7.1.11 FinanCiaL ConStraintS The no commitment by the National Treasury to fund new projects, in addition to provision of inadequate funds, contributes to untimely implementation and completion of the programmes. 7.2 SoUrCeS oF FUndS The ministry will prepare its budget proposal to the National Treasury during the Plan period, prioritising finan- cial requirements of key programmes and projects to be implemented during the MTEF period. This will enable the ministry to acquire the required resources for Plan implementation. In addition, the ministry encourages public private partnership initiatives in the Plan implementation by engaging the private sector stakeholders, bilateral and multilateral development donors, support agencies and non-governmental organisations in fund- ing key ICT priority programmes and projects. Co-ordination Framework 32 8.0 CaPaCity bUiLdinG 8.1 CaPaCity aSSeSSMent The Ministry is in charge of four technical units, namely departments of Information, Public Communications, Telephone Services and ICT. The four departments require personnel with professional skills in the field of infor- mation, public communications, telephone operations and ICT operations. The ministry also hasnthe added new responsibility of ICT development in the country. The creation of the ICT Authority is intended to create a one stop shop for all ICT related issues. The ministry, therefore, needs to recruit ICT professionals, information and public communication officers to work in these departments. · A capacity analysis needs to be done in the Department of Information and Public Communications to facilitate optimal utilisation of personnel in the most efficient and effective way, and help the depart- ments in achieving their set goals and objectives. With the creation of counties and county govern- ments, a new structure needs to be developed to take cognisance ofEestablishment of co-ordination, collaboration and linkage mechanisms for wider consultations amongst national and county govern- ments. · Employment of information and public communications officers in the devolved units of governmen and facilitating and equipping the departments for effective service delivery. The Departments of Public Communications and that of Information are highly affected by shortage of staff, partly due to non-filling of posts left vacant by retirement, resignations, deaths, transfers and dismissals. As at June, 2004, the ministry’s establishment was at 2,051 posts with an in post of 715 officers. Due to reorganisation of the Government, the Ministry has an authorised establishment of 2,051 with an in post of 754 and a variance of 1,297 officers. This has affected productivity in the said technical departments. Shortage of staff and lack of essential equipment has also hindered efficient service delivery. 8.2 CaPaCity deVeLoPMent StrateGy In order to address the human resource capacity constraints, the ministry plans to develop a critical human resource mass that is capable of delivering the results of Kenya Vision 2030 through appointment, recruitment and capacity building of new officers to fill the vacant posts. In addition, the ministry should procure additional modern equipment to facilitate officers in the ministry to discharge their duties. ICT Authority needs to be ad- equately staffed and equipped. The ministry endeavours to offer training to all its officers and develop a sound succession management plan. 8.3 CoSt oF CaPaCity bUiLdinG and deVeLoPMent StrateGy The estimated cost of capacity development is Ksh.20M million per annum to cover personnel and training. Ad- ditional resources will be required for personnel emoluments and procurement of plant and equipment. Capacity Building ChaPter eiGht 33 9.0 aCCoUntabiLty and riSk ManaGeMent The following are some of the organisational, financial, technological, political, structural and environmental changes that could affect implementation of the plan. 9.1 orGanizationaL FaCtor All departments in the ministry will be required to c-operate and harmonise work plans towards the implemen- tation of planned programmes. Lack of proper co-ordination may derail completion of programmes. 9.2 FinanCiaL FaCtor Inadequate funds to the ministry’s budget have a negative effect in the implementation of the Plan. Bilateral and multilateral development partners, and non-governmental organisations should, therefore, supplement the National Treasury through(PP) arrangements and Government to Government initiatives. 9.3 teChnoLoGiCaL FaCtor Trends in technology may affect implementation of the Strategic Plan both positively and negatively. If the na- tion adapts to changes in technology, it will be easierefor a successful implementatio . Conversely, failure will stagnate the implementation of planned projects. 9.4 PoLitiCaL FaCtor Political stability will favour implementation but poor governance and political instability will hinder the smooth running of operations and projects towards implementing the Plan. 9.5 StrUCtUraL FaCtor Construction of roads may tamper with or damage fibre optic cables that have already been put in place. Build- ings should also be designed to include broadband cabling for easy connections. 9.6 enVironMentaL FaCtor Some programmes may be affected by vagaries ofeweather. Terrestrial fibre may be washed away by floods or wind if not well buried in the earth. It is recommended that climatic conditions be considered when such projects are being implemented. 9.7 exPeCted riSkS and MitiGation aCtionS The following are expected risks and their action for mitigation: 9.8 Poor GoVernanCe Increased poor governance may affect implementation of the Plan.

This plan is being interpreted and implemented  through subsequent five-year medium term plans. According to Vision 2030,  the BPO sub-sector alone is projected to generate over 20,000 job opportu- nities and contribute more than 10 per cent to the national Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) over the Plan period. These projections entail development of  a vibrant ICT sector to promote expansion and to drive productivity in other  growth sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, financial and  entertainment industries. At the same time, ICT influences and promotes eq- uity, transparency and accountability in the socio-political sectors necessary  for wealth and job creation.   To achieve the above, the Government created the Ministry of Information,  Communications and Technology through executive Order No. 2 of 2013, along  with its associated agencies with the mandate to develop and implement ap- propriate policies and programmes aimed at generating ICT related products   and services required by providers of such goods and services in both Govern- ment and the private sector. To effectively carry out its mandate, the ministry has developed its 2013-17 Strategic  Plan.  ICT will be instrumental in enhancing good governance and efficiency across all sectors of the economy lead- ing to improved public service delivery. Among other considerations, this Strategic Plan aims to deepen and  strengthen the foundation aimed at transforming Kenya into a knowledge-based and a globally competitive na- tion. This transformation will be done in line with the Vision 2030, by encouraging and stimulating investments  in the sector through rapid expansion of ICT networks and services that are affordable and accessible to all.  The global trend in the delivery of telecommunications, broadcasting information technology and postal ser- vices requires that governments, supported by a strong and independent regulatory institutional set-up should  ensure a holistic management of available resources. In this regard, the Government consolidated all ICT devel- opment activities under an ICT Authority (ICTA) to ensure prudent utilisation of available resources. This will be  done through integration and collaboration with the public, private and non-governmental stakeholders in the  development planning and implementation of various initiatives and activities. This strategy is expected to en- hance participation in the development of hardware and software, infrastructure, local content, and Information  Technology Enabled Services (ITES).  It is my sincere hope that the full implementation of this Plan will provide the necessary enabling environment  which will propel the country’s economic growth through increased productivity spanning all the sectors of our  economy.  FRED MATIANG’I, PhD  Cabinet SeCretary For inForMation,  CoMMUniCationS and teChnoLoGy.  Foreword by the Cabinet Secretary    vii  PreFaCe and aCknowLedGeMent by the PrinCiPaL SeCretary  The ministry acknowledges the great potential of ICT as an enabler for the  society’s socio-economic empowerment. This is drawn from the remarkable  achievements that Kenya has made in the past five years, which include: elec- tronic cash transfer through mobile telephony platform, development of 60  per cent of the planned national ICT infrastructure to improve universal access  to ICT services, connectivity to the international broadband highway through  four sub-marine fibre optic cables, connecting all major towns through the  National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI), and the development  and implementation of the  Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act, 2009  and the Kenya Information and Regulations, 2010.  In this Plan, the ministry draws its strategic priorities from the achievements  of the predecessor, the lessons learnt, emerging issues and challenges. It also  takes cognisance of a totally new structure of Government and the general  policy direction. It is our conviction that the implementation of these policies,  programmes and the associated activities bears the potential to transform Ke-  nya’s way of life as envisioned in the second medium term plan.  This Plan has prioritised various programmes and activities for implementation under six broad strategic priori- ties, namely: (i) Policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms; (ii) Improvement of universal access to ICT  services; (iii) Building capacity within the ICT sector (iv) Creating employment and facilitating economic growth;  (v) Building a digital economy and Government; and (vi) Promoting regional integration through ICT.  In the fulfillment of Article 10 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, the Ministry adopted a participatory approach  where senior staff in the Ministry and its Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies (SAGAs), the Kenya Private  Sector Alliance (KEPSA), the academia, the physically challenged and the county governments presented their  views and proposals on the various issues considered in the Plan.   To deliver its planned objectives, the ministry’s institutional structure has been reorganised to include the ICT  Authority (ICTA), the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK), the Information and Public Communications Director- ate, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), the Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK), Kenya Institute of  Mass Communication (KIMC), the Media Council of Kenya,  the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board (KYEB) and the  Brand Kenya Board (BKB).  This Strategic Plan would not have been effectively delivered without the full commitment and dedication of the  Ministerial Taskforce, which coordinated and managed the process. As we embark on the implementation phase, the ministry will work closely with other sectors whose services  contribute to its outcomes to ensure all projects and programmes are implemented successfully. Specifically, the  availability and distribution of electricity is important to induce the use of ICTs; access roads and way-leaves are  required to access many of our sites, while security and water are basic and critical requirements in areas of our  interest.  The ministry will strive to implement the Plan through performance contract targets, annual work plans and  individual work plans. In addition, a monitoring and evaluation framework will be developed and used to track  the implementation of projects and programmes.  In conclusion, I thank all those who participated in the preparation of this Plan, including all government min- istries and agencies, community-based organisations, non-governmental organisations and the private sector  whose diverse contributions made this exercise a success.  JOSEPH TIAMPATI OLE MUSUNI PrinCiPaL SeCretary,  MiniStry oF inForMation,  CoMMUniCationS and teChnoLoGy  Preface and Acknowledgement by the Principal Secretary    viii  The Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology’s Strategic Plan spells out key policy actions, legal  and regulatory frameworks, institutional reforms, programmes and projects that will be implemented in the  2013-2017 medium term plan period.  The Plan takes into consideration the requirements of the Kenya Constitu- tion, 2010, and the Second Medium Term Plan (MTP2) of the Kenya Vision 2030 Long Term Blue Print.  This Strategic Plan promises effective utilisation and application of ICTs across multi-faceted service delivery and  internal government operations with a view to achieve the goals of Vision 2030.  The Plan is based on assess- ment and analysis of current social-economic, political and environmental climates and the past performance  in order to ensure that national aspirations, stakeholder requirements and global best practices are taken into  account.   The Plan starts by presenting the background of the ICT sector and its status in chapter one. It identifies the  vision as “Kenya as a globally competitive knowledge-based economy” while the mission is “To facilitate  universal access to ICT infrastructure and services within the country”. The plan spells out the mandate and  the goal of the ministry. The chapter also reviews the performance of the sector during the first Strategic Plan  period 2008-2013 and builds on the results to ensure that completed projects are well utilised while those  on-going are completed in the second MTP period. Emerging issues, challenges and lessons learned area also  highlighted.  Situation analysis is dealt with in Chapter two. a detailed environmental scan has identified internal and  external factors that are likely to influence the ministry’s activities and incorporates them in the development  strategies. Following a review of the ministry’s functions, recommendations are made on merging certain  functions under internal departments or with others under different ministries to remove overlaps and  duplication. The chapter ends with a SWOT and sector related challenges analysis.  Chapter three and four details the national development agenda and the role of ICT. Chapter three highlights  priority areas to be addressed under the second medium term plan, including the Kenya Constitution 2010,  devolution issues, security, equity and governance. Stakeholder analysis is also discussed. Chapter four details  the sector’s flagship and other projects to be implemented in the second MTP period.   In line with the Vision 2030 overarching goal of making Kenya a middle income nation by the year 2030, Chapter  five defines the ministry’s strategic areas, objectives and strategies and its overall goal of strengthening the  foundation of a competitive knowledge-based economy by tackling the under-listed strategic areas:   1. Policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms 2. National Broadband Connectivity Network  3. Digital economy and government 4. ICT capacity 5. Strong public private partnership (county and regional integration) 6. Content and application development 7. Employment and wealth creation 8. Mainstreaming of crosscutting issues  From the above strategic areas, the plan proposes various programmes and projects that will be implemented  during the plan period. First to enhance business environment within the sector, the ministry will develop, review  and amend policy, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks to spur growth. Proper formulation and review  of policies, legal and institutional frameworks will play a key role to achieve the objectives and goals of the Plan.  Other key programmes to be implemented in this strategic area include restructuring of Kenya Broadcasting  Corporation (KBC) and the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK); rolling out of the Digital Government Initiative  and the National Electronic Payment System; roll out of the 4G network and broadband connectivity and public  information and communication management.    To improve broadband connectivity, the Government will continue to build high-speed broadband national ICT  Infrastructure comprising the Backbone Infrastructure Network and the Long-term Technology Evolution (LTE)  network projects, among others.  On a digital economy and government, the plan proposes to improve access to  ICTs, develop critical mass of local ICT skills and secure all networks and facilities in the country.   The Government also proposes to create ICT centres of excellence, incubation hubs and labs, develop ICT skills  data banks, develop industry-based curriculum and modernise ICTs training facilities. To enhance equity and  equality, the ministry will promote county and regional integration through harmonisation of ICT strategies. A  county liaison office at the ministry’s headquarters will be established.  The plan proposes to streamline the management of public information and communication through   Executive Summary    ix  development and implementation of a public communication policy to be used across all government agencies.  The ministry will also support local content and application development where Kenyans will be encouraged to  tell their stories on the net.  The Government will develop capacity within the ICT sector and also establish techno-cities and multimedia  parks to create employment and wealth for Kenyans. The plan also ensures that cross-cutting issues are  mainstreamed in all programmes that will be implemented during the plan period.   In line with the Kenya Vision 2030, the Plan recognises Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) as its flagship. The  programme entails the establishment of a techno-city at Konza in Makueni and Machakos counties, marketing,  capacity building and development of business incentives packages to attract investors in this field.   The plan classifies those projects that would be implemented within the Public Private Partnership (PPP)  initiatives. It also identifies energy, science and technology, education and training, trade and industry as key  enablers for a successful and sustainable knowledge-based economy.  To successfully implement the plan, chapters six and seven draw out the implementation model and  coordination framework. In particular, chapter six lists all the departments and parastatals in the ministry,  detailing their role towards the achievement of the plan. Chapter seven explains strategies to achieve the  planned objectives and also the sources of required funds. Chapter eight gives details of capacity building, the  resultant costs and development strategy. Chapter nine highlights the risks that may affect the implementation  of the Plan and gives recommendation on risk management.    The human capacity and structure required to successfully deliver the Plan; financial requirements for the  activities in the programmes have been worked out and explicitly tabulated in Chapter ten. To implement  the programmes, the ministry requires approximately KShs75 billion from the Government while the private  sector is expected to invest in the other identified areas. The Ministry also proposes to carry out monitoring and  evaluation exercises to ensure that various activities are undertaken within the specified timeframe. Achievable  and objectively verifiable indicators have been developed to guide the monitoring and evaluation activities in  Chapter twelve.  In its conclusion, the Strategic Plan looks at recommendations to be addressed for its successful implementation.  It is expected that successful implementation of this Plan will provide the necessary tool to manage our  knowledge for development in order to transform Kenya into a Digital Economy.  Executive Summary    x    1  1.0 introdUCtion  Over the past decade, the Government has initiated and adopted several policies, laws and regulations to guide  the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) in order to harness its potential for socio- economic development. However, the convergence in the modern technology requires continuous review of the  policy and legal frameworks to accommodate technological changes for maximum utilisation of ICT’s potential  and benefits.   ICT advances over the past few decades have seen the convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications, com- puting and content. The developments have changed the way business is conducted, facilitated learning and  knowledge sharing, generated new global information flows, empowered citizens and communities, resulting  in a global information society.  Increasingly, ICT is playing the central catalytic role in pushing the development  process forward and boosting the efficiency of the increasingly integrated global economy. In industrial coun- tries, it is widely acknowledged to be the engine of economic growth and directly linked to productivity.  Conse- quently, countries that have harnessed the ICT potential have attained significant social and economic develop- ment. The Government of Kenya is, therefore, committed to creating an enabling environment for members of  the public to access information as provided for in Chapter 35 (1) (a) of the Constitution of Kenya.  Kenya has always been among the leaders in the region in the deployment of ICT.  The country’s capacity to  develop as a leading ICT hub will determine the future success of Kenya in enhancing its competitiveness in the  regional and global economy, and improving the quality of life of its people. However, this will only be achieved  through application of international best practices in the use of ICT in all aspects and sectors of its economy.  Since most industrial countries and many developing nations have already set out to become leading regional  and global ICT hubs, it is essential that a high level of priority and commitment by the Government and the  private sector of Kenya is given to fast-track the successful implementation of the Strategic Plan so that the  objectives set-out above are achieved. Success in achieving this objective requires sustained effort in setting  policies, devising strategies, and adopting standards that ensure the full potential of ICT to be harnessed so as  to meet the present and future social, economic and cultural sustainable development aspirations of the people  of Kenya.  The Government has recognised the importance of ICT in stimulating national development, in particular,  modernisation and globalisation of the economy, and creating a platform for participation by all sections of the  population.  In this context, the Government has initiated the process of developing a comprehensive National  ICT Policy.  This policy document serves to guide ICT development, access and its utilisation on a national scale to meet the  challenges of the information age. It will also lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive ICT  Master Plan.    1.1 ViSion, MiSSion, Mandate and Core VaLUeS.  1.1.1 ViSion  Kenya as a globally competitive knowledge-based economy.    1.1.2 MiSSion  To facilitate universal access to ICT infrastructure and services all over the country.

The information and broadcasting sub-sector is responsible for gathering and dissemination of news and  information through radio and television, production and dissemination of features, training of mass media  personnel, information marketing, advertising and image building. Through press accreditation, it also regulates  the activities of local and foreign journalists to ensure upholding of mass media communication professionalism  and ethics.   Introduction    3  The information and broadcasting sub-sector is made up of two main departments: a) The Department of Information  b) The Department of Public Communications  Specialised activities under the sub-sector are performed by Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies (SAGAs),  which include the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board, Kenya Institute  of Mass Communications and the Media Council of Kenya.   The communications sub-sector comprises the telecommunications, ICTs and the postal services. The main de- partments are:  a) The Department of Telephone services b) Directorate of Communications; and  c) The Information Technology Services Unit.   Specialised services under this sub-sector are performed by the Communication Authority of Kenya, the Na- tional Communications Secretariat, the Communications Multimedia Appeal Tribunal, the Postal Corporation of  Kenya, the Kenya ICT Authority, The East African Marine System (TEAMS) and the proposed Fibre Optic National  Network (FONN).   1.3 PaSt PerForManCe   1.3.1 aChiVeMentS Under StrateGiC PLan 2008-2013    Under the first Vision 2030-based Strategic Plan, the ICT sector made tremendous progress. Kenya led the world  in electronic cash transfer through the mobile telephony platform, resulting in immense benefits to micro-cred- its and savings. The sector also witnessed development of 60 per cent of the planned national ICT infrastructure  to improve universal access to ICT services. The country is currently connected to the international broadband  highway through the SEACOM, TEAMS, EASSY, and LION cables. All major towns in the country are now con- nected through the National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI) and Government Common Core Net- work (GCCN). Demand for the Internet and data services has been rising, with Internet subscription increasing  from 1,579,387 subscribers in 2009 to 8,506,748 in 2012. This has enhanced business activities and created job  opportunities.  The Government developed a tier-2 Government Data Centre (GDC) infrastructure to ensure security of Gov- ernment data and applications. Bandwidth support to government offices was increased from 80 to 100 MB of  broadband Internet capacity. This has improved the quality and reliability of the Government’s communication  system. Several ministries have developed online systems geared towards improving service delivery. They  include the re-engineered Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); County Revenue Col- lection System; application of public service jobs online; status tracking of ID and passports; public examination  results and candidate selection into secondary schools; digitised education content in 12 subjects at the second- ary school level; online submission of tax returns; online custom declaration; electronic reporting of corruption;  and a business licensing e-registry.  The Konza Techno City business plan with its physical development plan was developed. The focus areas to drive  growth of the Techno-City include BPO, Internet Enabled Services (ITES), software development, data centres,  disaster recovery centres, call centres and light assembly manufacturing. Other initiatives in the sector included  establishment of digital villages, digitising government records and providing connectivity to government,  learning and social institutions; software development and film production; and establishment of an open data  portal. This has made Kenya to be ranked second in Africa and 22nd (2012) worldwide in the open data initiative.  The Government developed and implemented the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act, 2009, and the  Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2010. These legislations led to improved competition and  broad choices of ICT services.  Introduction    4  The ICT sector in Kenya grew at an average of nearly 20 per cent annually from 1999 to 2013. The number of  phone subscriptions has grown from the equivalent of one per 1,000 adults in 1999 to nearly one per adult in  2013. Internet usage rates for 2013 were around five for every ten adults. Person-to-person mobile money trans- actions at the end of 2010 were equivalent to around 20 per cent of the GDP with two of every three Kenyan  adults being users.   ICT has been one of the main drivers of Kenya’s economic growth over the last decade. Since 2000, Kenya’s  economy grew at an average of 3.7 per cent, with ICT being responsible for 0.9 of the 3.7 per cent annual GDP  growth, and for all of Kenya’s GDP per capita growth (World Bank).    The 2013 statistics show that the ICTs forward and backward linkages have continued to improve, with employ- ment opportunities hitting over 150,000. For instance, there were 103,165 mobile money agents by June 2013.  The number, according to the CBK data, has been growing by at least 3,000 agents each month. The rise in the  number of agents indicates increased access of mobile money transfer services as well as creation of employ- ment opportunities in ICT.   Other areas that are likely to grow exponentially include the broadcasting services when the country fully mi- grates to the digital platform where over 200 TV channels will be made available, ITES/BPO Services when the  first phase of Konza Techno-City is implemented, software and hardware development, among many others. The  table below shows performance of ICT in the last nine years.  tabLe 6: key inForMation and CoMMUniCationS eConoMiC indiCatorS  indicator 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012  as at 30th  Sep 2013  1 Mobile telephony  Mobile telephony  capacity  6,800,000 10,600,000 18,200,000 25,964,700 29,400,000 46,628,948 47,677,000 49,977,000 55,077,000  Mobile subscribers 6,484,791 9,304,818 12,933,653 17,362,257 19,364,559 24,968,891 26,980,771 30,432,782 31,301,506  Mobile penetration (%) 15.74 21.62 33.65 39 49.7 63.2 68.4 77.2 76.9  Licensed mobile  operators  2 2 2 4 4 4 4          4 4  Mobile money transfer  service subscribers  10,615,386 17,395,727 19,318,684 25,114,462  Licensed mobile money  transfer service operators   1 1 3 5 6 6 6  2 Fixed telephony  Fixed line/wire line  capacity  513,82 516,993 505,103 512,281 485,581 421,528 400,764 380,135 362,627  Wire line connections 293,364 339,229 527,064 247,972 243,656 226,587 92,275 70,390 58,749  Wireless connections - 84,107 274,449 448,529 429,289 154,161 186,939 177,910 150,590  Total wire line & wireless  connections  293,364 347,226 527,064 696,501 672,945 380,748 279,214 248,300 209,339  Fixed line tele-density  (%)  0.86 0.90 1.8 1.7 0.96 0.71 0.63 0.51  3  International outgoing  fixed line traffic  (minutes)  42,558,605 46,957,348 27,363,876 15,582,304 14,471,643 14,761,211 11,455,952 20,058,628 121,164,636  International incoming  fixed line traffic  (minutes)  157,836,403 113,692,918 85,672,270 83,148,332 88,538,230 38,550,399 31,866,685 17,796,496 154,885,621  4                                                                                          Internet and data services  Licensed Internet service  providers  72 66 96 108 124 132 141 165 169  Licensed data carrier  network operators  2 3 6 8 12 19 19 20 21  Introduction    5  indicator 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012  as at 30th  Sep 2013  Internet subscribers 527,460 555,550 1,385,148 1,679,776 1,981,048 3,296,975 6,152,664 8,506,748 11,671,337  Estimated internet users1 1,054,920 1,111,000 2,770,296 3,359,552 3,962,096 8,884,850 11,305,592 13,537,658 19,162,055  Internet penetration (%) 3.0 3.0 7.5 8.7 9.7 22.1 28.7 35.5 47.1  International Internet  leased bandwidth (Mbps)  160.17 174.43 485.14 1,421.15 9,949.9 20,209.5 53,479.78 278,329 360,900.1  5  Licensed radio stations 225 270 284 323 376 387 435 461 579  Licensed TV stations 77 105 112 121 108 108 104 2282 371  Digital signal distributor  service providers  0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2  6                                                       Postal and courier services  PCK postal outlets 768 721 744 710 702 698 690 634 622  Private letter boxes 400,016 411,716 414,616 412,006 410,709 414,750 427,900 431,181 432,000  Letter posting boxes 1,049 966 827 890 905 890 890 752 890  Public counter positions 1,388 1,388 1,390 1,279 1,229 1,296 1,261 1,030 1102  Stamp vending licences 4,242 4,125 4,609 4,505 4,454 5,205 5,260 2,847 4,274  Stamp vending machines - 264 246 280 297 280 280 280 280  Private courier operator  outlets  521 554 606 622 625 840 635 683 707  Licensed postal and  courier operators  164 159 176 190 214  Source CAK  1.3.2 eMerGinG iSSUeS and ChaLLenGeS  The ICT sector as a whole faced the following challenges in the implementation of the first Vision 2030-based  strategic plan programmes:  ·  Inadequate financing coupled with delayed disbursement;  ·  Inadequate human capacity for research and development in ICT and the film industry;  ·  Inadequate legislation for better exploitation of ICT in commerce and entertainment with adequate   safeguards against crime and ICT media abuse;  ·  Decentralised ICT coordination structures leading to slow implementation of automated systems,   duplication and implementation of ICT innovations;  ·  Digital divide between the rural and urban areas which limits public awareness of the advantages and   opportunities of ICT;  ·  Slow adoption of ICT services by learning, social and government institutions;  ·  Non-incorporation of ICT cabling in new building designs;  ·  Lack of harmonised data management system;  ·  Inadequate information resource centres in the rural areas;  ·  Low ICT skills;  ·  Vandalism of ICT infrastructure;  ·  Sophistication in cyber attacks and cyber crimes;  ·  Lack of or inadequate supply of affordable and uninterrupted power supply; and  ·  Limited penetration of telecommunication infrastructure in rural areas  Introduction    6  1.3.3 LeSSonS Learnt  The cost of communication may have come down considerably but there still remains a wide digital divide between  urban and rural areas. The cost of ICT delivery, utilisation and maintenance in the rural areas also tend to be higher  than in the urban areas.  Reforms in trade and industry are key in enabling e-business to flourish. However, these reforms are yet to be fully  realised and can only be achieved if there is political stability and peace among citizens. In the years of relative  peace, the country experiences growth and development due to increased investments, calm and focus among  citizens.  Delay in the implementation of these initiatives was experienced when the ministry was involved in lengthy ten- dering and negotiation process, particularly on the privatisation of Telkom Kenya and the awarding of tender to  implement the TEAMS project. Competition has been observed to be a good element for development, especially  in the growth of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Diaspora Direct Investment (DDI). In telecommunication, for  instance, the cellular market has grown and spread all over the country, allowing Kenyans to communicate easily  and carry out economic activities. Competition has also lowered the cost of communication.  For Kenya to have a fully ICT induced economy, the ICT users must be literate enough rather than only having ICT  systems and content alone. Education and training curricular reviews have not been carried out to ensure this is  done. Population awareness of ICT should be championed countrywide to spread the use and importance of ICT,  and also educate the illiterate on some basic facts of ICT. For Kenya to fully utilise ICT as an economic driver, there  is need to address other support sectors such as energy whose cost and availability of energy has hindered the  development of ICT.  Kenya has a population with different talents as far as innovations in ICT application in mobile technologies is con- cerned. This, therefore, calls for the country to start programmes that recognise talents and start growing them.  The current state of ICT infrastructure is still a major hindrance to the country’s full exploitation of the economic  and commercial potential of the sector. To develop this infrastructure, private sector participation will be needed.  Public sector communications must be well managed and coordinated by State entities to project a positive image  of the Government. Managing communications is essential in meeting the high expectations of the citizenry for quality public service  delivery. Poor management of public communications reduce Government visibility, accessibility and acceptability.  This subsequently results in reduced public trust and confidence in the integrity, reliability and impartiality in the  Public Service.  The ongoing modernisation of equipment has improved the information gathering and delivery to the citizenry.  Budgetary constraints delayed the implementation and extension of information resource centres. Freezing of  recruitment and blocking of staff promotions affected effective delivery of services to the public. Expansion of the  media space saw the growth of social media, which has improved uptake of information.  The successful implementation of TEAMS as a PPP indicates that the Government can effectively collaborate with  the private sector to implement key programmes which require huge capital investment through a structured PPP  framework.  Introduction    7  2.0 SitUationaL anaLySiS  2.1 introdUCtion    Currently Kenya is one of Africa’s fastest growing ICT markets where ICTs have increased productivity in all spheres  of production process and have enabled expansion of skills, contributing to improved standards of living for Ken- yans. The First Strategic plan of 2008-12 aimed at addressing the key foundation components in ICT in order to  achieve the goal of becoming a knowledge-based economy. The second Strategic Plan 2013-17 will build on the  areas identified in the first plan, which consists of the following: Development of national ICTs policies and legal  frameworks, infrastructure development, capacity development, content and application development, employ- ment and wealth creation, and public private partnerships.  2.2 enVironMentaL SCan  The environmental scan will be analysed from the perspectives of opportunities and threats at three levels namely:  Global, regional and local.

The aim of the Vision is to make  Kenya “a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life by 2030”. It aims at transform- ing Kenya into “a newly-industrialised, middle income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens  in a clean and secure environment”. Simultaneously, the Vision aspires to meet the MDGs for Kenyans. The Vi- sion is anchored on economic, social and political pillars.   The economic pillar aims to achieve an economic growth rate of 10 per cent annually and sustaining the same  till 2030 in order to generate more resources to address the MDGs. A number of flagship projects have been  identified in every sector. These are to be implemented over the vision period to facilitate the desired growth  that can support the implementation of the MDGs on a sustainable basis. The key sectors identified under this  pillar are shown in Table 3 below:   table 3:  economic pillar sectors   Sector objective   tourism To be one of the top ten long-haul tourist destinations in the world,  offering high-end, diverse and distinctive visitor experience.  agriculture To promote an innovative, commercially-oriented and modern  agriculture sector.   Manufacturing To have a robust, diversified and competitive manufacturing sector.   wholesale and retail trade To move towards raising earnings by giving our large informal sector  opportunities to transform itself into a part of the formal sector that is  efficient, multi-tiered, innovative and diverse in product range.  business process outsourcing To become the top off-shoring destination in Africa.  Financial services To create a vibrant and globally competitive financial sector promoting  high levels of savings and financing for Kenya’s investment needs. To  become a regional financial services sector.   The social pillar seeks to create a just, cohesive and equitable social development in a clean and secure  environment. The specific sectors included are as shown in Table 4:   table 4: Social pillar sectors  Sector objective   education and training To provide globally competitive and quality education, training and  research.   health To improve the overall livelihood of Kenyans by providing an  efficient, integrated, high quality, affordable health care system.   water and sanitation To ensure improved water and sanitation are available and accessible  to all.    environment To be a nation with a clean, secure and sustainable environment by  2030.   housing and urbanisation To provide an adequately and decently housed nation in a sustainable  environment.  Gender, youth and vulnerable groups Gender equity in power and resource distribution, improved  livelihoods for all vulnerable groups, and responsible globally  competitive and prosperous youth.   Kenya’s Development Agenda   ChaPter three    14  The political pillar aims to realise an issue-based, people-centred, result-oriented and accountable  democratic system. The specific areas covered include:    table 5: Political Pillar Sectors  Sector objective   rule of law Adherence to the rule of law as applicable to a modern market-based economy  in a human rights respecting state.   electoral and political processes To cultivate genuinely competitive and issue-based politics.   democracy and public service delivery To create a people-centred and politically-engaged open society.   transparency and accountability To create transparent, accountable, ethical, results-oriented government  institutions.

The Second MTP outlines policies designed to implement devolution, accelerate growth, reduce poverty, trans- form the structure of the economy and create more quality jobs, as the country prepares to achieve middle  income status by 2030.  The following are key priority areas that the Government will implement over the Plan period:  Constitution and devolution: The Government is committed to full implementation of the Constitution to  ensure the rapid set-up of all the county institutions. Chapter Two, Article 6 (1) to (3) and the Fourth Schedule  of the Constitution will be implemented without disrupting public service delivery at national and county levels.   Priority will be given to the development of the capacity of all county governments, improve policy coordination  and implementation in order to get the full benefits of devolution.  national cohesion: The government believes in unity with diversity as a principle. It will therefore build peace,  reduce ethnic rivalry and promote issue-based politics by providing a framework for inter-ethnic peace building  founded on mutual respect and resolution of conflicts.  Security: Security in the country will be addressed in order to provide individual safety to Kenyans and to inves- tors. The National Police Service will, therefore, be better trained and equipped and the operational capability  improved. In line with the Constitution, security regulations and behaviour must conform to local and interna- tional human rights standards.  drought emergencies and food security: The Government will prioritise implementation of the Ending  Drought Emergencies (EDE) plan as an integral part of this MTP. Priority will also be given to increasing invest- ment in irrigation to reduce the country’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. Strategies to mechanise agricul- ture, revive cooperatives and farmers unions and subsidise farm inputs will be undertaken. Additionally, empha- sis on value addition in the production and supply chain will be prioritised.  equity in access to opportunities and lower cost of living: The government will lay emphasis on implemen- tation of affirmative action in employment opportunities in public sector, and ensure resource distribution ad- dresses regional imbalances. Another key priority will be to reduce the cost of living through lowering the cost  of food and other basic needs. The Government will, therefore, support expansion of production of food through  irrigation, use of local competitively priced supply chains to deliver food to consumers more cheaply and im-  Kenya’s Development Agenda     15  proved management of the marketing systems.  health: Kenya has made major gains in health care, especially in tackling communicable diseases such as HIV- AIDs, T.B and malaria. However, a lot still needs to be done to improve the overall health care system. The Gov- ernment will put emphasis on universal access to health care, preventive and primary health care, clean water,  management of communicable disease, maternal and child health, and non-communicable diseases. It will also  invest in medical research, pharmaceutical production and health tourism as a means of diversifying external  revenue sources and serve as a regional hub for health services.  education: Significant progress was made under First MTP but several challenges persist and in particular, qual- ity. The Government will, therefore, focus on addressing low enrollment in areas that remain below the national  average, retain students in school up to 18 years, provide education more effectively through a digital platform,  and match education and training with the demand for the skills required in the workplace. In addition, the Gov- ernment will hire additional teachers in order to lower pupil-teacher ratio and improve quality as well as ensure  that teachers devote the required time to teaching and learning.  infrastructure: The Second MTP will build on successes of the First MTP. New investments will include cheaper  and adequate electricity; local and regional rail and road networks that provide safe, efficient and cost effective  transport; adequate water for households and industry; affordable quality housing and sustainable environmen- tal management.  industrialisation: The Kenyan economy is still reliant primarily on agriculture and services. The growing con- sumer demand for manufactured goods has been met mainly by imports. The government will facilitate growth  of the manufacturing sector; make agriculture competitive and diversify the economy for employment creation.  The Government will also support local entrepreneurs to increase their share in local and external markets  through better supply chain and making local enterprises more price-competitive in order to serve a growing  local, regional and continental market.  improved trade: The country will focus on expanding trade to increase its share in the fast expanding regional  and other emerging markets. Trade in the broader region will be backed by joint infrastructural investments with  neighboring countries. During the plan period, the Government will facilitate research in business development  and entrepreneurship under a new entity called “Biashara Kenya” to provide funding and leverage investment  from local banks. This will develop capacity and productivity of local manufacturing geared to competitively  priced quality exports to Africa and the global market.  investment to support growth: The strategies in the Second MTP are designed to increase investment to GDP  ratio by investing prudently in key sectors. Land reforms and registration will be undertaken to make land a pro- ductive asset. In addition, new initiatives will be undertaken to encourage the financial sector mobilize savings  and improve resource allocation to key growth sectors.

The departmental work-plan will detail key activities to be implemented under their man- date and in the Strategic Plan.  7.1.5 PerForManCe aPPraiSaL SySteMS  The heads of departments will cascade the departmental work from the ministerial performance contract and  then set individual targets from the departmental work-plan. Each head of department will appraise the staff on  the targets signed with the Principal Secretary and later signed with the departmental staff.  7.1.6 indiVidUaL work-PLanS  Individual work plans will be based on departmental annual work plan. Every individual staff will contribute to  achievement of the ministry’s strategic goals and objectives.  7.1.7 PreParation oF bUdGet ProPoSaLS  The ministry will prepare its budget proposal to the National Treasury during the Plan period prioritising key  programmes and projects financial requirements to be implemented during the(MTE) period. This will enable the  ministry to mobilise the required resources for the implementation of the Plan.  Co-ordination Framework  ChaPter SeVen    31  7.1.8 MonitorinG & eVaLUation  Periodic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) exercise will also enhance the success of the Plan implementation.  Heads of departments and project coordinators will carry out monthly, quarterly and biannual M&E by giving  quarterly progress reports submitted to the Principal Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary.  7.1.9 bi-MonthLy ProjeCtS rePortinG  The Plan implementation will be conducted through bi-monthly reporting of priority projects using the pre- scribed format.  7.1.10 hUMan reSoUrCe  The ministry will provide an enabling working environment to its employees to ensure maximum output towards  the Plan implementation. It will alsl continue offering capacity building in key areas that requires intervention.  7.1.11 FinanCiaL ConStraintS  The no  commitment by the National Treasury to fund new projects, in addition to provision of inadequate funds,  contributes to untimely implementation and completion of the programmes.  7.2 SoUrCeS oF FUndS  The ministry will prepare its budget proposal to the National Treasury during the Plan period, prioritising finan- cial requirements of key programmes and projects to be implemented during the MTEF period. This will enable  the ministry to acquire the required resources for Plan implementation. In addition, the ministry encourages  public private partnership initiatives in the Plan implementation by engaging the private sector stakeholders,  bilateral and multilateral development donors, support agencies and non-governmental organisations in fund- ing key ICT priority programmes and projects.  Co-ordination Framework    32  8.0 CaPaCity bUiLdinG  8.1 CaPaCity aSSeSSMent  The Ministry is in charge of four technical units, namely departments of Information, Public Communications,  Telephone Services and ICT. The four departments require personnel with professional skills in the field of infor- mation, public communications, telephone operations and ICT operations. The ministry also hasnthe added new  responsibility of ICT development in the country. The creation of the ICT Authority is intended to create a one  stop shop for all ICT related issues. The ministry, therefore, needs to recruit ICT professionals, information and  public communication officers to work in these departments.  ·  A capacity analysis needs to be done in the Department of Information and Public Communications to  facilitate optimal utilisation of personnel in the most efficient and effective way, and help the depart- ments in achieving their set goals and objectives. With the creation of counties and county govern- ments, a new structure needs to be developed to take cognisance ofEestablishment of co-ordination,  collaboration and linkage mechanisms for wider consultations amongst national and county govern- ments.  ·  Employment of information and public communications officers in the devolved units of governmen   and facilitating and equipping the departments for effective service delivery.  The Departments of Public Communications and that of Information are highly affected by shortage of staff,  partly due to non-filling of posts left vacant by retirement, resignations, deaths, transfers and dismissals. As at  June, 2004, the ministry’s establishment was at 2,051 posts with an in post of 715 officers. Due to reorganisation  of the Government, the Ministry has an authorised establishment of 2,051 with an in post of 754 and a variance  of 1,297 officers. This has affected productivity in the said technical departments. Shortage of staff and lack of  essential equipment has also hindered efficient service delivery.    8.2 CaPaCity deVeLoPMent StrateGy  In order to address the human resource capacity constraints, the ministry plans to develop a critical human  resource mass that is capable of delivering the results of Kenya Vision 2030 through appointment, recruitment  and capacity building of new officers to fill the vacant posts. In addition, the ministry should procure additional  modern equipment to facilitate officers in the ministry to discharge their duties. ICT Authority needs to be ad- equately staffed and equipped. The ministry endeavours to offer training to all its officers and develop a sound  succession management plan.  8.3 CoSt oF CaPaCity bUiLdinG and deVeLoPMent StrateGy  The estimated cost of capacity development is Ksh.20M million per annum to cover personnel and training. Ad- ditional resources will be required for personnel emoluments and procurement of plant and equipment.  Capacity Building  ChaPter eiGht    33  9.0 aCCoUntabiLty and riSk ManaGeMent  The following are some of the organisational, financial, technological, political, structural and environmental  changes that could affect implementation of the plan.  9.1 orGanizationaL FaCtor  All departments in the ministry will be required to c-operate and harmonise work plans towards the implemen- tation of planned programmes. Lack of proper co-ordination may derail completion of programmes.  9.2 FinanCiaL FaCtor    Inadequate funds to the ministry’s budget have a negative effect in the implementation of the Plan. Bilateral  and multilateral development partners, and non-governmental organisations should,  therefore, supplement the  National Treasury through(PP) arrangements and Government to Government initiatives.  9.3 teChnoLoGiCaL FaCtor  Trends in technology may affect implementation of the Strategic Plan both positively and negatively. If the na- tion adapts to changes in technology, it will be easierefor a successful implementatio . Conversely, failure will  stagnate the implementation of planned projects.  9.4 PoLitiCaL FaCtor  Political stability will favour implementation but poor governance and political instability will hinder the smooth  running of operations and projects towards implementing the Plan.  9.5 StrUCtUraL FaCtor  Construction of roads may tamper with or damage fibre optic cables that have already been put in place. Build- ings should also be designed to include broadband cabling for easy connections.  9.6 enVironMentaL FaCtor  Some programmes may be affected by vagaries ofeweather. Terrestrial fibre may be washed away by floods  or wind if not well buried in the earth. It is recommended that climatic conditions be considered when such  projects are being implemented.  9.7 exPeCted riSkS and MitiGation aCtionS  The following are expected risks and their action for mitigation:  9.8 Poor GoVernanCe  Increased poor governance may affect implementation of the Plan. The ministry will introduce ICT solutions and  applications at all levels Government.  Accountabilty And Risk Management  ChaPter nine    34  9.9 knowLedGe and SkiLLS  The ministry will initiate training programmes and also ensure transfer of skills and learning from best practices  both locally and internationally. It will also allow skilled ICT workers from foreign countries to work in Kenya so as  to share and transfer knowledge to the local staff.  9.10 Poor inFraStrUCtUre  The ministry will ensure that existing infrastructure gaps are identified and addressed, it will develop modern infra- structure to improve connectivity within and outside the country.  9.11 barrierS to inVeStMent  Counties will be encouraged to open up to ICT investments by offering incentives to both foreign and local inves- tors.  9.12 inCreaSed CoMPetition FroM reGionaL CoMPetitorS  From this kind of risk, the ministry will provide adequate incentives to willing investors and clients both foreign and  local. It will also carry out effective marketing campaigns that promote Kenya as a BPO destination.  9.13 SLow LeGaL reForMS  Slow adoption to legal reforms may affect implementation of the Plan. The ministry will ensure immediate response  to reforms through formulating and implementing policies.  9.14 ConCLUSion   Accountabilty And Risk Management  For successful Implementation of this Plan, it is recommended that:-  1. The government avails the required funds for projects implementation.  2. Restructuring of the Sector be given first priority.  3. Recruitment of the required staff be effected.  4. Necessary legislations and policies be enacted.  5. The Ministry Continues utilizing PPP framework in project implementation.  6. Government appropriately positions ICT as a 21st Century infrastructure.  7. Government embraces a coordinated and harmonized of ICT deployment.  8. Government leverage on Shared Infrastructure Frameworks for Information Sharing and Management  9. The Ministry reviews and adopts a progressive and effective spectrum strategy.  10. The Ministry Utilizes and mitigates against identified opportunities and risks respectively.    35  10.0 annexUre  10.1 StaFF eStabLiShMent   MiniStry oF inForMation, CoMMUniCationS and teChnoLoGy  StaFF eStabLiShMent aS at FebrUary, 2014  Table 8: Staff establishment  DESIGNATION J/G A/E I/POST OPTI- MAL VAR.

It illustrates the Government’s inten- tions in response to the changes and challeng- es that characterize a digital environment in constant change. The strategy has been developed by a task force under the leadership of the High Commissioner for National Protection. The task force is composed of representatives of the State’s Information Technology Centre, the Governmental Computer Emergency Response Centre (GOVCERT), the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), the Media and Communication Unit, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, the Luxembourg Defence, the State Intelligence Services and the Grand Ducal Police Force. It reflects, at national level, the objectives of the cybersecurity package that the European Commission has just published and is part of the continuity of a series of measures recently adopted by the Government, whether at the level of cyber attack management procedures, cybersecurity governance or the promotion of cybersecurity to companies with the inau- guration of the “Cybersecurity Competence Centre”. It is worth mentioning, in this con- text, that as a result of the ambitious digital agenda that the Government has been pur- suing in recent years, the report of the World Economic Forum has ranked Luxembourg number 1 among 137 countries as part of an assessment based on technological skills. This third strategy takes into account the experience gained in the context of the imple- mentation of the second strategy adopted in March 2015, and the conclusions drawn from a general analysis of the cyber threat. It sets the framework within which full advantage is taken of new digital opportunities, while pro- viding a response to the risks associated with ever-growing connectivity. To this end, in line with the “Digital Lëtze- buerg” initiative, the strategy seeks first and foremost to strengthen public confidence in the digital environment, in order to allow citizens to enjoy it to the fullest. It is also aimed at enhancing the security of informa- tion systems, improving the ability to identify cyber attacks, protecting critical digital infra- structure and raising stakeholders’ awareness of resilience. Finally, it does not only focus on security and raising awareness, but also takes into account strategic issues of the dig- ital infrastructure for our economy and turns cybersecurity into an economic attractiveness factor.

Glossary 40 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I IN A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I 6 7 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I IN A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I I N T R O D U C T I O N The evolving nature that characterizes the digital environment in broad terms and in particular information and communication technologies, has a direct impact on our daily lives. Nowadays, we are accustomed to the emergence and the large-scale and especially very fast development of new technologies, as well as the new risk vectors that accom- pany this evolution. The adaptation of our society to the massive transformations that accompany this constantly changing digital landscape remains a complex process. In the run-up to the end of the period covered by the second national cybersecurity strategy, in order to develop a new national cybersecu- rity strategy, the Cybersecurity Board (CSB) commissioned a task force operating under the authority of the High Commissioner for National Protection (HCPN) and composed of representatives of the State’s Information Technology Centre (CTIE), the Governmental Computer Emergency Response Centre (GOVCERT) , the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), the Media and Communication Unit, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the State Intelligence Services and the Grand Ducal Police Force. The aim is to respond to the far-reaching changes referred to above and consolidate public confidence in new technologies, notwithstanding the emergence of more and more cyber attacks of a very var- ied nature, often organized on a transnational level. Another concern which is inherent in the strategy is to create an environment that allows – for the sake of the development of digital economy – to support actively the fact of delving deeper into new topics such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, the technology of advanced algorithms or the ubiquity of potential dual-use technologies. The new national cybersecurity strategy shows that the government is aware of both the opportunities and risks which are inherent in new technologies. It is in this context that the strategy, which covers the 2018-2020 peri- od, is structured around the three following main guidelines: • the strengthening of public trust in the digital environment in order to allow Luxembourg’s digital transition towards a “Smart nation” model, which will be sustainable from an economic, social, envi- ronmental and political point of view, par- ticularly in respect of the UN sustainable development programme targets for 2030; • the protection of digital infrastructure, in order to ensure the availability of essential services, as well as information integrity and confidentiality, and finally • the promotion of the economy, particularly by creating an environment that is condu- cive to the establishment and development of companies which are active in the digital field. · I N T R O D U C T I O N · 8 9 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I N AT I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R AT E G Y I I I N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I 10 11 As a result of the large number of sectors and areas affected by cybersecurity policies, the topic is subject to the accountability and the responsibility of several state bodies. • The Ministry of Economy is responsible, pursuant to the Grand Ducal Decree of 28 January 2015 on the constitution of minis- tries, for computer security, risk awareness and private sector vulnerabilities. In this context, the economic interest grouping “Security Made in Luxembourg” (GIE Smile) – a platform promoting cybersecurity – notably operates initiatives of CASES (pro- motion of information security in compa- nies), C3 (National Centre for Cybersecurity Skills) and the CIRCL (Coordination and Post-Incident Action Unit), the latter also acting as CERT for private and non-govern- mental entities and communes. • The Luxembourg Defence (Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (MAEE) - Defence Management and the Luxembourg army) is in charge of any cybersecurity ele- ments that fall within national responsibilities and obligations generated within NATO and the EU. • The Ministry of State - Media and Communi- cation Unit follows the Telecom Council which discusses at European level, both the European cybersecurity strategy and the “cybersecurity package”. The Media and Communication Unit also coordinates the work of the Cybersecurity Board which, under the Grand-Ducal Decree of 28 January The current and future challenges related to cybersecurity can only be tackled by means of effi- cient and effective national cyber governance. Considering Luxembourg’s cyber defence commit- ments at the level of NATO and the European Union, European and international cooperation and information-sharing agreements at different levels, the impact of the implementation of the EU Directive on the security of networks and information systems, as well as the horizontal character of topics pertaining to cybersecurity, the existing governance model will be strengthened by the setting up of an interministerial cyber prevention and cybersecurity coordination committee. 1 .

The topic of cybersecurity covers a wide range of measures which could be taken to improve the resil- ience and defence of computer systems and networks, on the one hand, and of digital technologies in general terms, on the other hand, against a very wide variety of cyber attacks. The Government has set up an interministerial coordination committee in order to sustain cybersecu- rity governance and facilitate the implementation of the NCSS III objectives. A number of objectives of the second strategy remain relevant and are therefore included herein, but are adapted to the current environment. “Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guide- lines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and tech- nologies can be used to protect the cyber envi- ronment, its organization and its user’s assets. Organization and user’s assets include connect- ed computing devices, personnel, infrastruc- ture, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored information in the cyber environment. Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the security properties of the organization and user’s assets against rel- evant security risks in the cyber environment. The general security objectives comprise the following: • Availability; • Integrity, which may include authenticity and non-repudiation; • Confidentiality.” N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I ( N C S S I I I ) D E F I N I T I O N O F C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y 1 1 Recommendation ITU-T X.1205 in accordance with UN resolution 181 (Guadalajara/2010) 12 13 To this end, the committee’s mission is as follows: • to ensure the consistency of actions and initiatives in the areas of cyber prevention and cybersecurity; • to coordinate the implementation of initi- atives and measures decided at European and international level with respect to cyber prevention and cybersecurity; • to monitor the implementation at national level of policies decided at European and international level; • to advise the Government on cyber preven- tion and cybersecurity by identifying issues and priorities for further investigation in this area, as well as players in charge of their implementation; • to discuss the positions to be adopted by national representatives in European and international forums on cyber prevention and cybersecurity. The committee consists of members of the main state entities involved in national cybersecurity, and the committee is chaired by the High Commissioner for National Protection. The High Commissioner also acts as secretariat.

The committee shall coordinate, alongside the Cybersecurity Board – which plays a rather strategic role –, pragmatic initiatives as part of cyber security. N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I 2015 on the constitution of ministries, is subject to the responsibility of the Ministry of State. • The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs coordinates the work of the hori- zontal “Cyber” work group of the Council of the European Union, which has just developed the “cyber diplomatic toolbox” adopted in June 2017, which is likely to evolve, while the international dimension of threats, as well as the response to any such threats, will be amplified. • The State Information Technology Centre has its mission governed by the amended organic law of 20 April 2009. Its mission is, among other things, to ensure, as part of its responsibilities, computer security, the management of electronic and com- puter equipment and appropriate security, the administration of the state’s compu- ter network, as well as the production of secure administrative documents. • As for the State Intelligence Service, its mission is to search, analyse and process information on cyber threats insofar as they may be related to espionage, intru- sion, terrorism, extremism with a violent tendency and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or defence-related pro- ducts and technologies related thereto. • The High Commissioner for National Protection is involved in the management of a cyber crisis. Its action is established on the basis of the plan for emergency res- ponse in the face of attacks against infor- mation systems, from the moment the cri- sis is likely to have serious consequences for a part of the territory or the popu- lation of the Grand Duchy. It also acts as the National Security Agency for Information Systems, the mission of which is to establish guidelines for information security (ANSSI) . The Governmental Computer Emergency Response Centre (GOVCERT) , which also acts under the responsibility of the High Commissioner for National Protection, is involved in the management of major security incidents affecting networks and communication systems. • The mission of the above entities is, of course, complemented by the actions of judicial authorities and services of the Grand-Ducal Police, which are particularly involved in the fight against cybercrime. 14 15 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I IN A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I The priority objectives are listed in the following three guidelines: • BUILDING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT • PROTECTING DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES • PROMOTING THE ECONOMY. 2 . G U I D E L I N E S O F T H E N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y G U I D E L I N E N O . 1 : S T R E N G T H E N I N G P U B L I C C O N F I D E N C E I N T H E D I G I T A L E N V I R O N M E N T Each citizen must be able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by information and communication technology (ICT). In this context, it is important to maintain the confidence of users in these technologies at a high level, while knowing that this trust is influenced by external factors (e.g. cyber attacks, online sale frauds, etc.) . Digital confidence-building depends on a good perception of risks associated with the use of ICT, while being able to estimate its interest and opportunities. The consolidation of public trust depends on a good command of the digital value chain, which can only be guaranteed by ensuring ICT quality and security. It is important, in this context, to successfully combine respect for privacy and information security with the development of strategic areas such as cloud computing, big data and the Internet of things. It is also with this in mind that it is in Luxembourg’s best interest to follow, or even contribute to the development of the state of the art in the key area of artificial intelligence (AI) . THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 1 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FIVE OBJECTIVES. 16 17 There are too many users – both natural and legal persons – who are victims of the most common computer attacks. In spite of the multiple efforts made to raise awareness in recent years, it will be necessary to further raise users’ awareness of the potential conse- quences of a digital threat. Good practice guides, including behavioural, organizational, and technical measures will be drawn up and published in several languages. A model of “responsible disclosure”, allow- ing the disclosure of a detected computer vulnerability, while giving the parties con- cerned a deadline to correct the vulnerability prior to its disclosure, will be implemented in Luxembourg. This could be of interest, especially in the field of academic and private research: the development of a work envi- ronment with specific rules to increase legal certainty for the benefit of researchers in the field of information security. Public confidence in the digital environment is enhanced in the presence of a successful fight against illegal digital activities. In the face of the continued growth of cybercrime in Europe and across the world, Luxembourg will remain vigilant in its fight against abuse and theft of digital tools, and will continue to implement the necessary measures to protect its digital infrastructure. Strengthening police training and training magistrates specialized in the fight against cybercrime is being envisaged. Cybercrime increasingly takes advantage of organised crime structures and in particular of their networks and financial systems. To limit and put an end to the development of online fraud, collaboration between the world of computer security experts (CERTs, etc.) and the financial sector (banks, CSSF, etc.) will be intensified. Stakeholders will examine the opportunity of setting up a specialized unit aimed at proposing measures to dismantle the financial structures of cybercrime. Since national judicial authorities are com- petent in the event of attacks made through servers located in Luxembourg, even though the victim, respectively the offender, are not established in Luxembourg, there are also plans to strengthen cooperation between technical and legal experts in order to devel- op the necessary expertise in this field. The implementation of enhanced cooperation among technical specialists and legal experts will not only allow more effective analysis to be conducted, but also simplify highly com- plex records. Last but not least, such exchang- es between experts will finally be put to good use to develop new training plans. All interested parties will be informed appro- priately on the level of risk applicable to the specific environment in which they operate. The Government thus intends to disseminate information on websites that users can access and which are adapted to the various target audiences. The purpose is to inform the different catego- ries of users on the latest developments with respect to threats, vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of security measures; informa- tion that is essential for the achievement of objective and comparable risk analysis. Systematic dissemination of information on threats, vulnerabilities and common security measures should allow information security managers to draw conclusions for a given field of activity, in view of identifying meas- ures that are appropriate for a specific threat, while being proportionate compared to the level of safety to be achieved. In addition, such information could be used usefully, for example, by the insurance industry to create new products meeting the needs of citizens and the SME sector. Raising awareness of information security is a process with multiple tasks. Many initiatives and efforts have already been initiated in this context. However, a significant part of the population is still not aware enough of the risks and weaknesses in the digital world. Alongside knowledge sharing and the dissem- ination of information, efforts to raise aware- ness will be intensified, both with regards to young people and adults, both in the private and public sector, with special emphasis on businesses that will be appointed operators of critical infrastructures, in accordance with the law of 23 July 2016 for the establishment of a High Commissioner for National Protection. Efforts to popularise information on informa- tion security will continue, in order for users to grasp the subject more easily. Outreach programs will also be made available through various media: websites, print-outs, presentations, animations, vid- eos and interactive media.

The transformation of Luxembourg into a digital nation speeds up that development and increases the need for security of infrastructure and services, in terms of confi- dentiality, integrity and availability. As a result, digital infrastructures play a quintessential role for the protection of the country’s vital interests, because they replicate computer vulnerabilities in the physical world. That is why the Government pays special attention to the resilience of the digital infrastructure. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 2 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEVEN OBJECTIVES. The Government will be in charge of identi- fying critical IT infrastructures, to ensure the implementation of an adequate level of pro- tection. The specific needs of protection will be, as appropriate, developed in close collabo- ration with operators and users of those infra- structures. The census will be done online with the transposition of the EU Directive on security of networks and information systems (NIS Directive), and pursuant to the provisions of the law of 23 July 2016 establishing a High Commissioner for National Protection. The application of information security poli- cies (PSI-LU), which have been developed under the responsibility of the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), will be recommended to critical IT infrastruc- ture. Performing analysis of specific risks based on the ISO 2700x methodology will also be suggested to them. The CASES optimized method of risk analysis (MONARC methodolo- gy) will be offered to operators who have not yet implemented a risk management process. O B J E C T I V E 1 : C E N S U S O F E S S E N T I A L A N D C R I T I C A L D I G I T A L I N F R A S T R U C T U R E O B J E C T I V E 2 : S E C U R I T Y P O L I C I E S 20 21 The emergency response plan to attacks against the information systems or in the event of vulnerable technical information sys- tems (Cyber ERP) has been tested within the framework of the management of recent dig- ital incidents. The Cyber ERP will continue to be adapted in the light of developments in the digital environment. The new technical procedures and measures included in the emergency response plan will be implemented as a priority. To this end, the High Commissioner for National Protection and the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit will con- tact public and private sector operators that are considered essential for the management of certain types of crisis, in order to develop operational plans per measure (OPMs). The OPM has a contact list of persons involved in crisis management. It then lists a series of predefined measures that need to be activat- ed in the event of a crisis. Finally, it includes a description of the possible impact of activat- ing a measure predefined on other systems. OPMs allow operators to implement prede- fined measures swiftly and efficiently in the event of a crisis associated with them. Standardization determines common techni- cal language, both at European and interna- tional level. If applied to the field of cyber- security, this unifying capability allows us to set definitions and needs, the state of the art in this area as well as reference architec- ture, while establishing by consensus require- ments and specifications required to ensure a suitable level of security. This constantly evolving whole facilitates digital ownership, especially for Smart ICT developments (Cloud Computing, Big Data, the Internet of things, Blockchain, etc.) . National monitori ng and investment in the development pro- cess of standards related to the field of cyberse- curity will be strength- ened, specifically in order to convert it into a strategic tool for the development of national digital confidence. This approach will be carried out for formal technical standardization (ISO, IEC, ETSI, CEN- CENELEC, ITU-T), while taking into account the work developed by relevant fora and consortia identified in the context of cybersecurity. The ILNAS (Luxembourg standardisation body) will unify and develop this strategic monitoring in order to report it at national level, in the interest of the implementation of a “smart nation”. Close collaboration will be continued and strengthened at international level, on the one hand to exchange information on threats, vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of pro- cesses and, on the other hand, for effective prevention, reliable detection and efficient mitigation. At European level, the transposi- tion of the NIS directive in all Member States will lead to harmonisation in the field of cybersecurity. The latter should also be sought regarding the management of risk, norms and stand- ards, accreditation and certification systems, as well as in the field of compliance man- agement. Minimum harmonisation among European systems will be supported to facili- tate free trade in services and products. In July 2017, the Government approved the guidelines of the cyber targets for 2025 and beyond. Further development of skills and abilities in the field of cyber defence has been retained among the objectives. The Luxembourg Defence will continue working on the definition and implementation of ele- ments under its responsibility with respect to national and international cybersecurity strategies. For some time, targeted attacks against State digital infrastructures have been experiencing significant growth in Europe. The Government will ensure a high standard of protection of State digital infrastructure.

It represents a com- petitive advantage. Faced with the professionalism of cybercriminals and the rapid evolution of technology and corollary threats, such intense and efficient collaboration between all public and private stakeholders is a guarantee of security. The Government intends to implement the necessary measures to continue democratizing access to information security, including by pooling certain services and capitalizing on existing synergies. This approach is expected to reduce the complexity and costs associated with cybersecurity and consequently increase the attractiveness of an investment. This new guideline fits perfectly into the Government’s “Digital Luxembourg” ambition, also confirmed in the context of the “TIRLUX”2 strategy, i.e. to turn Luxembourg into a “Smart nation” by transforming digital-related challenges into opportunities for the country. Cybersecurity fits into this ambition through the Cybersecurity Competence Centre, set up and managed by SECURITYMADEIN.LU. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 3 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 10 OBJECTIVES. Luxembourg will continue to invest heavily in information technology infrastructure, clouds, fintech, biotech, spacetech and autonomous driving. The involvement of Luxembourg as a leader in the IPCEI project (“Important Project of Common European Interest”), High Performance Computing and Big Data3 simply underlines Luxembourg’s ambition to further diversify its economy towards digitalisation. Public-private partnerships are strengthened. These partnerships allow us to combine the skills and expertise of stakeholders, in order to create products and services of high added value. They facilitate the creation of security services that comply with principles of pro- portionality and necessity, which are suitable in terms of complexity and the costs involved. Along the same lines, the Government will offer new innovative services. Thus, offers composed of very high quality digital ser- vices and guarantees based on international conventions such as the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations will be created. The deve- lopment of products and services based on cryptographic technology will be promoted. They are essential for trusted third parties in the field of personal data management, as well as for strong authentication systems, electronic signatures and blockchain techno- logy. To pool risks and encourage victims of digital cyber incidents to seek help from experts to manage the incident and restore a system affected by a malicious act, insurance com- O B J E C T I V E 1 : C R E A T I N G N E W P R O D U C T S A N D S E R V I C E S 2 See “Rifkin study” 3 24 25 panies will be encouraged to create specific products for the area of cyber insurance. Probe services and products (intrusion detec- tion systems) will be developed with a view to preparing situational reports on traffic in networks, so as to identify any anomalous or suspicious activity. These products and ser- vices will be developed in a spirit of “privacy by default” and “security by design”. The cybersecurity ecosystem will be federated actively and will address businesses, start- ups, incubators, financial players and regula- tors; the aim being to respond in a nifty and coordinated way to rapidly evolving threats, through qualitative, affordable and innova- tive products and services. Recurring errors made in the design or config- uration of computer systems are the source of many problems related to information secu- rity. The Government will release standard requirement benchmarks for the most widely operated systems. The contractor, or failing that, the buyer, will be encouraged to enforce the requirement benchmarks by the various parties involved. The Ministry of the Economy and the econom- ic interest grouping SECURITYMADEIN have a large reservoir of experiences, operational information and knowledge of threats, vul- nerabilities and the effectiveness of protec- tion measures that are implemented for the benefit of the entire economy through part- nerships with the private sector. The latter should allow the development of innovative products and services in the field of informa- tion security. The Cybersecurity Competence Centre will implement the necessary measures to support the development of three types of services: “Observatory”, “Training” and “Testing”, in close collaboration with private and public partners: • “Observatory” services will focus on ele- ments of a knowledge-driven economy in the field of cybersecurity, bringing together public and private efforts to provide information and trends in this area. Creating such services will greatly reduce the individual efforts and costs of cybersecurity, while increasing the effec- tiveness of protection measures. Thus, the Centre provides, in collaboration with its partners, not only technical information, but also an overview of contextualized and specific trade-specific threats, as well as protection mechanisms, metrics and key figures, which are necessary for good governance. The interpretation of threats in a specific context (ISAC: information sharing and analysis centre) is considered to be a new economic model to be devel- oped with partners specialized in differ- ent areas such as finance, the Internet of things, the health sector or even space. • Training-type services will allow us to go beyond what is currently available in terms of training centres in Luxembourg. Businesses and other players will be able to train their staff in an immersive envi- ronment, simulating computer incidents. This way, participants will be immersed in a concrete context to learn to work in multidisciplinary teams in order to acquire the legal, technical, organizational and behavioural skills necessary to identify and stem digital and business risks asso- ciated therewith. They will also learn to make notifications to respective regula- tors. • Testing-type services will provide clients and partners with new possibilities of digital application testing. Thus, the “hon- eypots” networks of SECURITYMADEIN.LU will be made available to test software. Companies and partners will be able to test security management systems as part of scenario-based exercises. Start-ups will have access to the centre’s testing infra- structure at low cost in order to validate their technology or service via a test environment simulating the real environ- ment in which their product will have to survive, once manufactured.

These attacks require coordinated action from service providers. It is recommended to coordinate detection tools and poo infrastructures to some extent. In order to mitigate a “denial of service” attack, an operator must be able, at the time of an attack, to instruct upstream operators to adapt their routing rules with the help of the Border Gate Protocol. At the same time, it must filter illicit communications belonging to the attack which has reached its network. The State considers, in this context, the pos- sibility of investing in a national scrubbing centre (filtering of illegal communications infrastructure) that will be used when the fil- tering means of local operators are no longer sufficient. O B J E C T I V E 2 : P O O L I N G S E C U R I T Y I N F R A S T R U C T U R E S 26 27 Risk management, as introduced since the second national cybersecurity strategy, is rec- ognized as being the appropriate tool for good governance of cybersecurity. Indeed, it complies with the principles of proportion- ality and necessity, while it offers a risk and security analysis based on different points of view (companies, natural persons, clients) . It allows us to understand and take into account the specific needs of the various stakeholders involved in the development of digital society. This is why the Government will publish objec- tive metrics invaluable to carry out objective risk analysis. This situational awareness will also facilitate the implementation of internal management governance based on metrics adapted to the circumstances. With informed governance, through decisions based on objective and realistic situational reports, Luxembourg will be able to position itself as a modern, open, resilient and trust- worthy digital nation. The Government intends to set up a university course in the field of information security in order to mitigate the risk of having a lack of experts in information security, which would constitute an obstacle to the development of our security’s ecosystem. There are plans to offer aid for specific train- ing in the field of information security. Such aid will be associated with the lifelong train- ing of experts, so as to encourage them to attend, for example, conferences and other relevant events. The development of specialised training aimed at multidisciplinary teams will be considered with a view to addressing the shortage of experts in the security field, while taking into account the interconnectivity of tools. The opportunity of appointing a person in charge of information security within each state entity will be considered. A training plan for these people will be set up if necessary and exchange platforms for these experts will be created. In the private sector, leaders will be encou- raged to provide information security mana- gers with resources to implement effective protection measures. Efforts will have to be made to improve communication and collabo- ration between teams in charge of different missions: information security, compliance, management, customer management, etc. The Government will encourage cooperation between technical security and business pro- cess experts in order to create and exchange contextualized risk reports according to key areas.

The Government will support the strengthening of cooperation between these specialized entities, which will facilitate the management of cross-sector or large- scale incidents. To execute the requirements listed in the new regulations and directives (RGPD, Telecom, NIS), regulators will, in the future, have to become more involved in the management of incidents, which will result in more coop- eration between regulators and specialized teams. This cooperation should increase the confidence of users in existing structures and thus improve the quality of digital incident management. In addition, the Government will contin- ue to promote the exchange of informa- tion between CERTs. The four public CERTs (GOVCERT. LU, circl.lu, HealthNet CSIRT and RESTENA-CSIRT) are known and contacted by their respective audiences. They have a large reservoir of information on existing threats and vulnerabilities, as well as on the actual effectiveness of security measures. The CERTs’ good reputation contributes to the attractive- ness of Luxembourg’s economy. Start-ups offering innovative solutions fea- ture among the needs identified within the Luxembourg digital security ecosystem. It will be taken into account for priorities in the field of research, by promoting the creation of start-ups. It is intended to establish a framework to allow code disassembly (“reverse engineer- ing”) in Luxembourg, as well as penetration tests for the purpose of identifying vulner- abilities. These abilities will be useful to improve the interoperability of systems and to help ensure a higher level of security by identifying malicious software, spyware soft- ware, and so forth. If serious vulnerabilities are published, pub- lic CERTs are allowed – at national level – to identify Internet-connected devices with these vulnerabilities and notify officials (e.g. Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL).

These objectives will be complemented by an action plan outlining concrete measures to be implemented following a definite time frame, as well as the actors called on to contribute to their implementation. The action plan is available upon request to the High Commissioner for National Protection (e-mail: info@hcpn.etat.lu; Subject: #NCSS action plan). The Cybersecurity Board and the interministerial coordination committee for cybersecurity accompanies the execution of the action plan. The national cyber strategy is intended to evolve over time. Thus, the action plan will be periodically revised within the interministerial coordination committee, in order to remain relevant in a digital environment in constant change. 30 31 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I IN A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I I 3 . A P P E N D I X F E E D B A C K O N T H E N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I I The NCSS II had placed emphasis on information security as a challenge faced by society as a whole. Whether it is a company, public services or a citizen; each party bears responsibility for the con- struction of a secure digital society. This appendix gives an update on the progress and implementation of the action points of the NCSS II, while it is clear that some of the actions are recurrent given that cybersecurity represents a continuous and dynamic process with an evolutionary character. Many initiatives have been taken at natio- nal level in order to intensify collaboration – both in terms of organisation and opera- tions – between actors. Regular exchanges took place between the ANSSI, regulators and relevant ministries in order to establish a security policy for information at the level of the public sector and operators of critical infrastructures. Frequent exchanges have been held about the protection of personal data in the field of cybersecurity, two intimately related topics that deserve to be partially addressed together. At the operational level, ongoing exchanges took place between CERTs, thanks to modern and efficient collaboration tools. Incidents reported to the national CERT are managed through the joint efforts of the GOVCERT and CIRCL. Moreover, joint efforts to raise awar- eness have been organized to address deci- sion-makers in the public and private sector about the importance of information security already bear their first fruits. Close collabora- tions to raise the awareness of children, tee- nagers, adults and the elderly, as well as that of supervisors have also been very successful. Since its implementation in 2015, the ANSSI has developed a security policy of General information for the State (PSI-LU) . It also entered into cooperation agreements with various actors at national level. The State Information Technology Centre (CTIE) and the Government’s Communications Centre (CGC) have merged so as to improve O B J E C T I V E 1 : S T R E N G T H E N N A T I O N A L C O O P E R A T I O N 32 33 the provision of services with regards to the management of State secure communications. The information security portal security.lu has been online since July 2017. It introduces the different actors of the sector and their respective sites. Its main purpose is to be the “single window” for information security. Tools such as the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) and the Analysis of Information Leaks (AIL) created by the CIRCL, or the CASES Diagnostics and MONARC risk analysis developed by CASES, contribute to greater collaboration and exchange on digi- tal threats and vulnerabilities between the parties concerned. They also allow to gather information on the different degrees of matu- rity on the ground in the private and public sectors, for informed cybersecurity gover- nance. The use of risk analysis as a basic method for managing information security has now become standard in the Luxembourg. Several tools are available, including the MONARC tool which was released as an open source method. Towards the end of 2017, the ANSSI initiated a broad risk analysis project with State entities. Luxembourg is represented in major infor- mation security groups and associations. Luxembourg entities have established close contacts internationally and entered into key partnerships with their counterparts in part- ner countries. The develop- ment of collaboration agree- ments with the BSI (Germany), the A-SIT (Austria), and the BSI (Switzerland) was possi- ble and the agree- ments will be signed in 2018. O ther agree - ments, including with France and Belgium, will be finalized in the first quarter of the year 2018. In the same vein, the GOVCERT and the CIRCL joined the CSIRT network and are part of the FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams). International cooperation has been successful, which was noticeable on the occasion of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the European Union during which the GOVCERT was given the task to protect – alongside its international partners – the State’s digital infrastructure. Luxembourg entities now have several modern risk analysis tools at their disposal. Since March 2017, the MONARC method has been accessible to all in open source. Some metrics necessary for the implementa- tion of objective risk analysis have been publi- shed. Depending on the degree of maturity and competence of organizations, different models of risk assessment are available. Certain good sector practices have been deve- loped. They were published through MONARC risk management models, respectively via security policies issued by the ANSSI. In addi- tion, sites of state actors such as CASES offer both specific and general practices. For several years, data has been collected on trends of threats, vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of security measures. This data, along with data acquired from diagnostics and risk analysis, provides information on the level of maturity of the various entities. They constitute a solid base to draw up reports of situational awareness. They can be used to contribute to governance (informed gover- nance). The cyber emergency response plan deve- loped by the HCPN is operational. The plan has been updated by the HCPN on a regular basis as a result of the lessons learned from exercises and actual crises. Luxembourg participated in the Cyber Europe 2016 exercise organised by ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency). Luxembourg also contributed to NATO’s 2016 Cyber Coalition exercise as an observer, in close cooperation with Germany, and partici- pated actively in it in 2017.

Stakeholders indicated that they were sat- isfied with such good mutual collaboration, which has led to significant successes of investigation. Stakeholders unanimous- ly agree that existing laws will have to be applied and adapted to the reality of the dig- ital environment, and that cybercrime inves- tigation procedures will have to be improved, especially in the context of electronic evi- dence manipulation, while the sharing of information between actors will have to be facilitated. Thanks to good cooperation between the var- ious actors involved and Europol’s support, police intervention in international cyber- crime has become faster and more efficient. As an extension of measures initiated in the context of the NCSS II, it will be essential to continue strengthening the capacity for action of judicial authorities, notably with respect to transnational cybercrime. In line with their respective mandates and assign- ments, the Prosecutor’s Office, the judicial investigation office and specialist services (investigation and computing expertise) of the judicial police must be able to investigate and prosecute cases of cybercrime, but also any other ICT-related offence. The following measures will be necessary to ensure effec- tive action against acts of cybercrime: • d’adapter les instruments d’entraide judi- ciaire internationale à la volatilité des preuves sur internet, • adapting instruments of international legal assistance to the volatility of evi- dence on the internet, • proceeding, to the extent possible, to a minimum harmonisation of the duration of data retention which varies strongly from one State to another, • taking into account encryption possibili- ties given by appropriate tools and tech- nology that may be used to ensure ano- nymity, making it difficult to identify a suspect (e.g. TOR, DARKNET), • finding a solution with regards to the new means of payment (cryptocurren- cies such as Bitcoin and derivatives) that allow criminals to easily evade authorities and hide transactions, • creating opportunities to deal with the large volume of data to be ana- lysed. O B J E C T I V E 4 : F I G H T A G A I N S T C Y B E R C R I M E 34 35 Since the end of 2015, the CASES training has become mandatory for new government employees and officials, for all careers. This training course includes general methodolo- gical elements, such as the classification of information and risk analysis. In addition to this basic training course, spe- cialized and non-mandatory training courses are available from the INAP upon request. Training courses are compulsory for school- children and high school students. They focus on the “behavioural” aspects of information security and explain current good practices. Together with its partners, CASES offers a wide range of training courses to professional audiences (users, managers, IT staff, trainers, etc.) . Specific training courses for decision-makers are also available. Among the measures that were included in the second strategy and that will be taken up in the new strategy, it is worth mentioning the training programme for operators of criti- cal infrastructures. In Luxembourg, access to information secu- rity is largely facilitated by the State. Free or affordable training courses are offered for a very diverse audience. Much effort has been put into raising citizens’ awareness, for example through workshops at lunchtime on weekdays, in the evening or at the weekend. In line with the government’s “Digital Luxembourg” strategy, notably the objective of raising the awareness of students to the appeal of new technologies and encourage their creativity, the “makerspaces” have been set up in co-curricular and educational ins- titutions in order to spark the interest of young people for new information technolo- gies since 2015. Some of these areas, including the “Base1” at the Geesseknäppchen Forum, can accommodate young people outside their school schedule. A few other projects are worth noting to highlight the Government’s commitment to the development of digital skills in Luxembourg, which is a priority area. “Cryptoparty”, “coder dojo”, “Mak@ons”, “hack4kids” and “Luxembourg Tech School”. These “makerspaces” are grouped in the BEE CREATIVE initiative. The “Kniwwelino” initiative has been launched recently. It is a microprocessor developed in Luxembourg and distributed to children and young people to familiarize them with the concept of programming and code security (for more information, go to: tive.lu) .

MONARC analysis were conduct- ed in various priority sectors and there are plans to have the same exercises again at the pace of three tests per year. The risk manage- ment approach will be gradually generalized and extended to all sectors. Security standards and guidelines for infor- mation systems have been implemented. They are published via the security policies issued by the ANSSI and will be finalized following the conclusions on the pilot project, which was carried out within the CTIE. An inventory of standards and norms of infor- mation security has been developed. As this inventory is a living document, this action item will be incorpo- rated into the new strategy.

Programmes have been created by many Luxembourg actors. The coordination of initiatives in this area will be further strengthened in the coming years. The strengthening of cooperation in the devel- opment of cryptographic protocols and algo- rithms will be included in the new strategy, in order to clarify the means at Luxembourg’s disposal to certify products in this area. In the absence of appropriate certification laborato- ries, partnerships with foreign organizations (neighbouring countries) are being pursued.

These observations allowed the actors to have a global view on the development of attacks over time. This analysis, which is not intended to be exhaustive, allows us to describe current and future cyber threats. • RANSOMWARES At this time, the actors noted a significant increase of attacks with a purely financial goal, including attacks carried out through ransomware, i.e. malware introduced into a system to encrypt the digital files it contains, in order to sell the decryption key to the victim. Such illegal activities are facilitated by the emergence of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. One of the last major attacks by way of ransomware (Notpetya) has also revealed that it is possible to conceal a cyber sab- otage attack by making it appear as ran- somware. • ATTACKS BY DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) VIA THE INTERNET OF THINGS The impact of DDoS attacks is more and more significant. This form of attack has now reached unprecedented significance as a result of the internet of things. Via tools like MIRAI, poorly secured inter- net-connected objects can easily be tracked and manipulated for very large- scale DDoS attacks. These tools are freely available on the internet, and they are often used for blackmail purposes. Such tools also allow to track and jeopardise internet-connected objects to perform mass surveillance or some kind of indus- trial espionage. • “BRICKERBOT” Unlike other attacks such as DDoS attacks that prevent services from working for a while, “BrickerBots” are designed to destroy Internet-connected objects. These attacks can be very stealthy and diffi- cult to detect. They are aimed at objects with poor protection and attempt, after successful authentication, to change the system settings so as to make the object unusable4. • RISKS INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMART CITIES AND HOME AUTOMATION More and more components, which are part of our daily lives and are used to provide high-value services, are using information from real-time digital infra- structure. Smart cities are equipped with sensors collecting data and rely on infor- mation systems to optimize services that are characterized by their high degree of connectivity. The attacks against these infrastructures are likely to multiply in the presence of authentication systems and cryptographic protocols, which often do not meet the highest security level. • FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MINIMUM SECURITY STANDARDS A worrying element, which is currently felt in the cybercrime sphere, is the failure by the publisher of a software or a com- 4 A N A LY S I S O F N A T I O N A L T H R E A T S T O C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y 38 39 puter tool, to comply with standards and better security objectives with regards to development. Computer security is not always a priority in the production of software and IT tools. Often distributed to millions of users such software is likely to be hacked in order to be manipulated and constitutes a real threat to a coun- try’s economy and security. • THREATS TO THE BUSINESS PROCESS Recent attacks have shown that criminals are diversifying their actions and targets. Rather than harming by way of blackmail, exfiltration or data sabotage, they are now also targeting the business process. The shortage of skilled human resources in the field of IT must be considered as a vulnerability in this context. As a result, a vast number of companies have no choice but to outsource their IT systems to major players specialised in the field. It follows that the staff of these companies no longer have the skills necessary to protect business or industrial processes. This vul- nerability can be exploited by the intru- sion of malicious software that is used as a spying tool to provide its author with a company’s internal details. The cyberse- curity package presented by the European Commission in September 2017 seeks to address many of these threats. • REGULATORY THREATS With “WannaCry”, the massive resurgence of computer worms was felt across the entire world. The attack also showed that a risk can come from very strict regulatory obligations, which can give a false sense of security while linking major resources to ensure compliance with process stand- ards. Alternatively, cyberspace is at risk of not being sufficiently regulated in some plac- es because the law is not always able to keep pace with new technol- ogies, which results in legal limbo situa- tions where malicious activities thrive • DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING Nowadays, the use of social networks is ever-increasing. Users disclose ample information on their private lives. The technique of social engineering is designed to access confidential information stored by companies in order to use it for crimi- nal purposes or even espionage or sabo- tage. For example, some “all-cloud” com- panies migrate all data to a cloud, but do not have any secure procedures to contact the cloud service provider. Through social engineering, such flaws can easily be used by criminals, while strong authentication systems that would prevent this are not really common in cloud environments. • THREATS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF INTERNET ACCESS TOOLS Today, users frequently use their mobile phones to access the internet and carry out online transactions. Some smart- phones are unfortunately difficult to pro- tect and therefore represent an ideal tar- get. • USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS AS A MEANS OF DESTABILIZATION One of the threats that has recently had a great impact is the fact that digital tools are being used as a means of destabili- zation. It is worth mentioning here the group of hackers Shadow-brokers, who managed to steal a large number of com- puter tools from a security authority, tools used by it to access certain systems and networks. The use of such a weapon could have very serious consequences. This new threat aligns with situations that could paralyse the country and even entire regions. The idea of the digital sab- otage and shut-down of an entire country through digital means is becoming more and more realistic. Armed forces around the world are preparing for such sce- narios. The manipulation of elections by revelations from digital attacks or broad- casting false information through social networks has been seen in some coun- tries over the past years, in the context of hybrid attacks, which partly falls within the scope of cybersecurity. • THREATS INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Generally speaking, artificial intelligence will emerge in the context of designing and executing malicious software. It is currently a research subject in the world of academia and will soon be mature enough to be implemented in real mal- ware, which will have the ability to adapt dynamically to security measures put in place by teams defending the networks and infrastructure of organizations.

The  task force is composed of representatives of  the State’s Information Technology Centre, the  Governmental Computer Emergency Response  Centre (GOVCERT), the National Agency for the  Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), the  Media and Communication Unit, the Ministry  of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign and  European Affairs, the Luxembourg Defence,  the State Intelligence Services and the Grand  Ducal Police Force.  It reflects, at national level, the objectives of  the cybersecurity package that the European  Commission has just published and is part of  the continuity of a series of measures recently  adopted by the Government, whether at the  level of cyber attack management procedures,  cybersecurity governance or the promotion  of cybersecurity to companies with the inau- guration of the “Cybersecurity Competence  Centre”. It is worth mentioning, in this con- text, that as a result of the ambitious digital  agenda that the Government has been pur- suing in recent years, the report of the World  Economic Forum has ranked Luxembourg  number 1 among 137 countries as part of an  assessment based on technological skills.   This third strategy takes into account the  experience gained in the context of the imple- mentation of the second strategy adopted in  March 2015, and the conclusions drawn from  a general analysis of the cyber threat. It sets  the framework within which full advantage is  taken of new digital opportunities, while pro- viding a response to the risks associated with  ever-growing connectivity.     To this end, in line with the “Digital Lëtze- buerg”  initiative, the strategy seeks first and  foremost to strengthen public confidence in  the digital environment, in order to allow  citizens to enjoy it to the fullest. It is also  aimed at enhancing the security of informa- tion systems, improving the ability to identify  cyber attacks, protecting critical digital infra- structure and raising stakeholders’ awareness  of resilience. Finally, it does not only focus  on security and raising awareness, but also  takes into account strategic issues of the dig- ital infrastructure for our economy and turns  cybersecurity into an economic attractiveness  factor.

Nowadays, we are accustomed to the  emergence and the large-scale and especially  very fast development of new technologies,  as well as the new risk vectors that accom- pany this evolution. The adaptation of our  society to the massive transformations that  accompany this constantly changing digital  landscape remains a complex process.  In the run-up to the end of the period covered  by the second national cybersecurity strategy,  in order to develop a new national cybersecu- rity strategy, the Cybersecurity Board (CSB)  commissioned a task force operating under  the authority of the High Commissioner for  National Protection (HCPN) and composed  of representatives of the State’s Information  Technology Centre (CTIE), the Governmental  Computer Emergency Response Centre  (GOVCERT) , the National Agency for the  Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), the  Media and Communication Unit, the Ministry  of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign and  European Affairs, the Ministry of Defence,  the State Intelligence Services and the Grand  Ducal Police Force. The aim is to respond to  the far-reaching changes referred to above  and consolidate public confidence in new  technologies, notwithstanding the emergence  of more and more cyber attacks of a very var- ied nature, often organized on a transnational  level. Another concern which is inherent in  the strategy is to create an environment that   allows – for the sake of the development of  digital economy – to support actively the fact  of delving deeper into new topics such as the  internet of things, artificial intelligence, the  technology of advanced algorithms or the  ubiquity of potential dual-use technologies.  The new national cybersecurity strategy  shows that the government is aware of both  the opportunities and risks which are inherent  in new technologies. It is in this context that  the strategy, which covers the 2018-2020 peri- od, is structured around the three following  main guidelines:   • the strengthening of public trust in the  digital environment in order to allow  Luxembourg’s digital transition towards  a “Smart nation” model, which will be  sustainable from an economic, social, envi- ronmental and political point of view, par- ticularly in respect of the UN sustainable  development programme targets for 2030;  • the protection of digital infrastructure, in  order to ensure the availability of essential  services, as well as information integrity  and confidentiality, and finally   • the promotion of the economy, particularly  by creating an environment that is condu- cive to the establishment and development  of companies which are active in the digital  field.   ·  I N T R O D U C T I O N  ·    8 9  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I  N AT I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R AT E G Y I I I  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I    10 11  As a result of the large number of sectors and  areas affected by cybersecurity policies, the  topic is subject to the accountability and the  responsibility of several state bodies.   • The Ministry of Economy is responsible,  pursuant to the Grand Ducal Decree of 28  January 2015 on the constitution of minis- tries, for computer security, risk awareness  and private sector vulnerabilities. In this  context, the economic interest grouping  “Security Made in Luxembourg” (GIE Smile)  – a platform promoting cybersecurity –  notably operates initiatives of CASES (pro- motion of information security in compa- nies), C3 (National Centre for Cybersecurity  Skills) and the CIRCL (Coordination and  Post-Incident Action Unit), the latter also  acting as CERT for private and non-govern- mental entities and communes.  • The Luxembourg Defence (Ministry  of Foreign and European Affairs  (MAEE) - Defence Management  and the Luxembourg army) is in  charge of any cybersecurity ele- ments that fall within national  responsibilities and  obligations generated  within NATO and the  EU.  • The Ministry of State  - Media and Communi- cation Unit follows the Telecom Council  which discusses at European level, both  the European cybersecurity strategy and  the “cybersecurity package”. The Media  and Communication Unit also coordinates  the work of the Cybersecurity Board which,  under the Grand-Ducal Decree of 28 January   The current and future challenges related to cybersecurity can only be tackled by means of effi- cient and effective national cyber governance. Considering Luxembourg’s cyber defence commit- ments at the level of NATO and the European Union, European and international cooperation and  information-sharing agreements at different levels, the impact of the implementation of the EU  Directive on the security of networks and information systems, as well as the horizontal character  of topics pertaining to cybersecurity, the existing governance model will be strengthened by the  setting up of an interministerial cyber prevention and cybersecurity coordination committee.   1 .

The topic of cybersecurity covers a wide range of measures which could be taken to improve the resil- ience and defence of computer systems and networks, on the one hand, and of digital technologies in  general terms, on the other hand, against a very wide variety of cyber attacks.   The Government has set up an interministerial coordination committee in order to sustain cybersecu- rity governance and facilitate the implementation of the NCSS III objectives. A number of objectives of  the second strategy remain relevant and are therefore included herein, but are adapted to the current  environment.   “Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies,  security concepts, security safeguards, guide- lines, risk management approaches, actions,  training, best practices, assurance and tech- nologies can be used to protect the cyber envi- ronment, its organization and its user’s assets.  Organization and user’s assets include connect- ed computing devices, personnel, infrastruc- ture, applications, services, telecommunications  systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or  stored information in the cyber environment.  Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment  and maintenance of the security properties of  the organization and user’s assets against rel-  evant security risks in the cyber environment.  The general security objectives comprise the  following:  • Availability;  • Integrity, which may include authenticity  and non-repudiation;  • Confidentiality.”  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I  ( N C S S  I I I )  D E F I N I T I O N  O F  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y 1  1  Recommendation ITU-T X.1205 in accordance with     UN resolution 181 (Guadalajara/2010)    12 13  To this end, the committee’s mission is as  follows:      • to ensure the consistency of actions and   initiatives in the areas of cyber prevention  and cybersecurity;  • to coordinate the implementation of initi- atives and measures decided at European  and international level with respect to  cyber prevention and cybersecurity;  • to monitor the implementation at national  level of policies decided at European and  international level;  • to advise the Government on cyber preven- tion and cybersecurity by identifying issues  and priorities for further investigation in  this area, as well as players in charge of  their implementation;  • to discuss the positions to be adopted by  national representatives in European and  international forums on cyber prevention  and cybersecurity.   The committee consists of members of the  main state entities involved in national   cybersecurity, and the committee is chaired  by the High Commissioner for National  Protection. The High Commissioner also acts  as secretariat.

The committee shall coordinate, alongside the Cybersecurity Board – which plays a rather  strategic role –, pragmatic initiatives as part of cyber security.  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I  2015 on the constitution of ministries, is  subject to the responsibility of the Ministry  of State.  • The Ministry of Foreign and European  Affairs coordinates the work of the hori- zontal “Cyber” work group of the Council  of the European Union, which has just  developed the “cyber diplomatic toolbox”  adopted in June 2017, which is likely to  evolve, while the international dimension  of threats, as well as the response to any  such threats, will be amplified.   • The State Information Technology Centre  has its mission governed by the amended  organic law of 20 April 2009. Its mission  is, among other things, to ensure, as part  of its responsibilities, computer security,  the management of electronic and com- puter equipment and appropriate security,  the administration of the state’s compu- ter network, as well as the production of  secure administrative documents.  • As for the State Intelligence Service, its  mission is to search, analyse and process  information on cyber threats insofar as  they may be related to espionage, intru- sion, terrorism, extremism with a violent  tendency and the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction or defence-related pro- ducts and technologies related thereto.  • The High Commissioner for National  Protection is involved in the management  of a cyber crisis. Its action is established  on the basis of the plan for emergency res- ponse in the face of attacks against infor- mation systems, from the moment the cri-  sis is likely to  have serious  consequences  for a part of  the territory  or the popu- lation of the Grand Duchy. It also  acts as the National Security Agency  for Information Systems, the mission  of which is to establish guidelines  for information security (ANSSI) . The  Governmental Computer Emergency  Response Centre (GOVCERT) , which  also acts under the responsibility of the  High Commissioner for National Protection,  is involved in the management of major  security incidents affecting networks and  communication systems.  • The mission of the above entities is, of  course, complemented by the actions of  judicial authorities and services of the  Grand-Ducal Police, which are particularly  involved in the fight against cybercrime.     14 15  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I IN A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I  The priority objectives are listed in the following three guidelines:    • BUILDING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT    • PROTECTING DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES    • PROMOTING THE ECONOMY.  2 .

In this context, it is important to maintain the confidence of  users in these technologies at a high level, while knowing that this trust is influenced by external  factors (e.g. cyber attacks, online sale frauds, etc.) .   Digital confidence-building depends on a good perception of risks associated with the use of  ICT, while being able to estimate its interest and opportunities. The consolidation of public trust  depends on a good command of the digital value chain, which can only be guaranteed by ensuring  ICT quality and security. It is important, in this context, to successfully combine respect for privacy  and information security with the development of strategic areas such as cloud computing, big  data and the Internet of things. It is also with this in mind that it is in Luxembourg’s best interest  to follow, or even contribute to the development of the state of the art in the key area of artificial  intelligence (AI) .  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 1 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FIVE OBJECTIVES.    16 17  There are too many users – both natural and  legal persons – who are victims of the most  common computer attacks. In spite of the  multiple efforts made to raise awareness in  recent years, it will be necessary to further  raise users’ awareness of the potential conse- quences of a digital threat.   Good practice guides, including behavioural,  organizational, and technical measures will be  drawn up and published in several languages.  A model of “responsible disclosure”, allow- ing the disclosure of a detected computer  vulnerability, while giving the parties con- cerned a deadline to correct the vulnerability  prior to its disclosure, will be implemented  in Luxembourg. This could be of interest,  especially in the field of academic and private   research: the development of a work envi- ronment with specific rules to increase legal  certainty for the benefit of researchers in the  field of information security.   Public confidence in the digital environment  is enhanced in the presence of a successful  fight against illegal digital activities.  In the face of the continued growth of  cybercrime in Europe and across the world,  Luxembourg will remain vigilant in its fight  against abuse and theft of digital tools, and  will continue to implement the necessary  measures to protect its digital infrastructure.  Strengthening police training and training  magistrates specialized in the fight against  cybercrime is being envisaged.   Cybercrime increasingly takes advantage of  organised crime structures and in particular  of their networks and financial systems. To  limit and put an end to the development of  online fraud, collaboration between the world  of computer security experts (CERTs, etc.) and  the financial sector (banks, CSSF, etc.) will be  intensified. Stakeholders will examine the  opportunity of setting up a specialized unit  aimed at proposing measures to dismantle the  financial structures of cybercrime.  Since national judicial authorities are com- petent in the event of attacks made through  servers located in Luxembourg, even though   the victim, respectively the offender, are not  established in Luxembourg, there are also  plans to strengthen cooperation between  technical and legal experts in order to devel- op the necessary expertise in this field. The  implementation of enhanced cooperation  among technical specialists and legal experts  will not only allow more effective analysis to  be conducted, but also simplify highly com- plex records. Last but not least, such exchang- es between experts will finally be put to good  use to develop new training plans.  All interested parties will be informed appro- priately on the level of risk applicable to the  specific environment in which they operate.  The Government thus intends to disseminate  information on websites that users can access  and which are adapted to the various target  audiences.  The purpose is to inform the different catego- ries of users on the latest developments with  respect to threats, vulnerabilities and the  effectiveness of security measures; informa- tion that is essential for the achievement of  objective and comparable risk analysis.   Systematic dissemination of information on  threats, vulnerabilities and common security  measures should allow information security  managers to draw conclusions for a given  field of activity, in view of identifying meas- ures that are appropriate for a specific threat,  while being proportionate compared to the  level of safety to be achieved. In addition,  such information could be used usefully, for  example, by the insurance industry to create  new products meeting the needs of citizens  and the SME sector.  Raising awareness of information security is a  process with multiple tasks. Many initiatives  and efforts have already been initiated in this  context. However, a significant part of the  population is still not aware enough of the  risks and weaknesses in the digital world.   Alongside knowledge sharing and the dissem- ination of information, efforts to raise aware- ness will be intensified, both with regards to  young people and adults, both in the private  and public sector, with special emphasis on  businesses that will be appointed operators of  critical infrastructures, in accordance with the  law of 23 July 2016 for the establishment of a  High Commissioner for National Protection. Efforts to popularise information on informa- tion security will continue, in order for users  to grasp the subject more easily.  Outreach programs will also be  made available through various  media: websites, print-outs,  presentations, animations, vid- eos and interactive media.

The transformation of Luxembourg into a digital nation speeds up that  development and increases the need for security of infrastructure and services, in terms of confi- dentiality, integrity and availability. As a result, digital infrastructures play a quintessential role  for the protection of the country’s vital interests, because they replicate computer vulnerabilities  in the physical world. That is why the Government pays special attention to the resilience of the  digital infrastructure.   THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 2 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEVEN OBJECTIVES.  The Government will be in charge of identi- fying critical IT infrastructures, to ensure the  implementation of an adequate level of pro- tection. The specific needs of protection will  be, as appropriate, developed in close collabo- ration with operators and users of those infra- structures. The census will be done online   with the transposition of the EU Directive on  security of networks and information systems  (NIS Directive), and pursuant to the provisions  of the law of 23 July 2016 establishing a High  Commissioner for National Protection.  The application of information security poli- cies (PSI-LU), which have been developed under  the responsibility of the National Agency for  the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI),  will be recommended to critical IT infrastruc- ture. Performing analysis of specific risks   based on the ISO 2700x methodology will also  be suggested to them. The CASES optimized  method of risk analysis (MONARC methodolo- gy) will be offered to operators who have not  yet implemented a risk management process.   O B J E C T I V E  1  :   C E N S U S  O F  E S S E N T I A L  A N D  C R I T I C A L   D I G I T A L  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  O B J E C T I V E  2  :   S E C U R I T Y   P O L I C I E S    20 21  The emergency response plan to attacks  against the information systems or in the  event of vulnerable technical information sys- tems (Cyber ERP) has been tested within the  framework of the management of recent dig- ital incidents. The Cyber ERP will continue to  be adapted in the light of developments in the  digital environment.   The new technical procedures and measures  included in the emergency response plan will  be implemented as a priority. To this end, the  High Commissioner for National Protection  and the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit will con- tact public and private sector operators that   are considered essential for the management  of certain types of crisis, in order to develop  operational plans per measure (OPMs). The  OPM has a contact list of persons involved  in crisis management. It then lists a series of  predefined measures that need to be activat- ed in the event of a crisis. Finally, it includes a  description of the possible impact of activat- ing a measure predefined on other systems.  OPMs allow operators to implement prede- fined measures swiftly and efficiently in the  event of a crisis associated with them.  Standardization determines common techni- cal language, both at European and interna- tional level. If applied to the field of cyber- security, this unifying capability allows us  to set definitions and needs, the state of the  art in this area as well as reference architec- ture, while establishing by consensus require- ments and specifications required to ensure  a suitable level of security. This constantly  evolving whole facilitates digital ownership,  especially for Smart ICT developments (Cloud  Computing, Big Data, the Internet of things,  Blockchain, etc.) . National monitori ng and investment in the development pro-  cess of standards related  to the field of cyberse- curity will be strength-  ened, specifically in order to convert it into a  strategic tool for the development of national  digital confidence.   This approach will be carried out for formal  technical standardization (ISO, IEC, ETSI, CEN- CENELEC, ITU-T), while taking into account the  work developed by relevant fora and consortia  identified in the context of cybersecurity.  The ILNAS (Luxembourg standardisation  body) will unify and develop this strategic  monitoring in order to report it at national  level, in the interest of the implementation of  a “smart nation”.  Close collaboration will be continued and  strengthened at international level, on the  one hand to exchange information on threats,  vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of pro- cesses and, on the other hand, for effective  prevention, reliable detection and efficient  mitigation. At European level, the transposi- tion of the NIS directive in all Member States  will lead to harmonisation in the field of  cybersecurity.  The latter should also be sought regarding  the management of risk, norms and stand- ards, accreditation and certification systems,  as well as in the field of compliance man- agement. Minimum harmonisation among  European systems will be supported to facili- tate free trade in services and products.  In July 2017, the Government approved the  guidelines of the cyber targets for 2025 and  beyond. Further development of skills and  abilities in the field of cyber defence has  been retained among the objectives. The  Luxembourg Defence will continue working   on the definition and implementation of ele- ments under its responsibility with respect  to national and international cybersecurity  strategies.   For some time, targeted attacks against State  digital infrastructures have been experiencing  significant growth in Europe. The Government  will ensure a high standard of protection of  State digital infrastructure.

Faced with the professionalism of cybercriminals and the rapid evolution of  technology and corollary threats, such intense and efficient collaboration between all public and  private stakeholders is a guarantee of security.   The Government intends to implement the necessary measures to continue democratizing access to  information security, including by pooling certain services and capitalizing on existing synergies.  This approach is expected to reduce the complexity and costs associated with cybersecurity and  consequently increase the attractiveness of an investment. This new guideline fits perfectly into  the Government’s “Digital Luxembourg” ambition, also confirmed in the context of the “TIRLUX”2  strategy, i.e. to turn Luxembourg into a “Smart nation” by transforming digital-related challenges  into opportunities for the country. Cybersecurity fits into this ambition through the Cybersecurity  Competence Centre, set up and managed by SECURITYMADEIN.LU.   THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINE NO. 3 DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 10 OBJECTIVES.  Luxembourg will continue to invest heavily in  information technology infrastructure, clouds,  fintech, biotech, spacetech and autonomous  driving. The involvement of Luxembourg as  a leader in the IPCEI project (“Important  Project of Common European Interest”), High  Performance Computing and Big Data3 simply  underlines Luxembourg’s ambition to further  diversify its economy towards digitalisation.   Public-private partnerships are strengthened.  These partnerships allow us to combine the  skills and expertise of stakeholders, in order  to create products and services of high added  value. They facilitate the creation of security  services that comply with principles of pro- portionality and necessity, which are suitable  in terms of complexity and the costs involved.  Along the same lines, the Government will  offer new innovative services. Thus, offers  composed of very high quality digital ser- vices and guarantees based on international  conventions such as the Vienna Convention on  diplomatic relations will be created. The deve- lopment of products and services based on  cryptographic technology will be promoted.  They are essential for trusted third parties  in the field of personal data management,  as well as for strong authentication systems,  electronic signatures and blockchain techno- logy.   To pool risks and encourage victims of digital  cyber incidents to seek help from experts to  manage the incident and restore a system  affected by a malicious act, insurance com-  O B J E C T I V E  1  :   C R E A T I N G  N E W  P R O D U C T S   A N D  S E R V I C E S  2  See “Rifkin study” 3  https://portail-qualite.public.lu/fr/publications/normes-normalisation/etudes/white-paper-big-data-1-2.html    24 25  panies will be encouraged to create specific  products for the area of cyber insurance.   Probe services and products (intrusion detec- tion systems) will be developed with a view  to preparing situational reports on traffic in  networks, so as to identify any anomalous or  suspicious activity. These products and ser- vices will be developed in a spirit of “privacy  by default” and “security by design”.   The cybersecurity ecosystem will be federated  actively and will address businesses, start- ups, incubators, financial players and regula- tors; the aim being to respond in a nifty and  coordinated way to rapidly evolving threats,  through qualitative, affordable and innova- tive products and services.  Recurring errors made in the design or config- uration of computer systems are the source of  many problems related to information secu- rity. The Government will release standard  requirement benchmarks for the most widely   operated systems. The contractor, or failing  that, the buyer, will be encouraged to enforce  the requirement benchmarks by the various  parties involved.  The Ministry of the Economy and the econom- ic interest grouping SECURITYMADEIN have  a large reservoir of experiences, operational  information and knowledge of threats, vul- nerabilities and the effectiveness of protec- tion measures that are implemented for the  benefit of the entire economy through part- nerships with the private sector. The latter  should allow the development of innovative  products and services in the field of informa- tion security.  The Cybersecurity Competence Centre will  implement the necessary measures to support  the development of three types of services:  “Observatory”, “Training” and “Testing”, in  close collaboration with private and public  partners:  • “Observatory” services will focus on ele- ments of a knowledge-driven economy  in the field of cybersecurity, bringing  together public and private efforts to  provide information and trends in this  area. Creating such services will greatly  reduce the individual efforts and costs of  cybersecurity, while increasing the effec- tiveness of protection measures. Thus, the  Centre provides, in collaboration with its  partners, not only technical information,  but also an overview of contextualized  and specific trade-specific threats, as well  as protection mechanisms, metrics and  key figures, which are necessary for good  governance. The interpretation of threats  in a specific context (ISAC: information  sharing and analysis centre) is considered  to be a new economic model to be devel- oped with partners specialized in differ- ent areas such as finance, the Internet of  things, the health sector or even space.  • Training-type services will allow us to  go beyond what is currently available in  terms of training centres in Luxembourg.  Businesses and other players will be able  to train their staff in an immersive envi- ronment, simulating computer incidents.  This way, participants will be immersed  in a concrete context to learn to work in  multidisciplinary teams in order to acquire  the legal, technical, organizational and   behavioural skills necessary to identify  and stem digital and business risks asso- ciated therewith. They will also learn to  make notifications to respective regula- tors.  • Testing-type services will provide clients  and partners with new possibilities of  digital application testing. Thus, the “hon- eypots” networks of SECURITYMADEIN.LU  will be made available to test software.  Companies and partners will be able to  test security management systems as part  of scenario-based exercises. Start-ups will  have access to the centre’s testing infra- structure at low cost in order to validate  their technology or service via a test  environment simulating the real environ- ment in which their product will have to  survive, once manufactured.

These attacks require  coordinated action from service providers. It  is recommended to coordinate detection tools  and poo infrastructures to some extent.  In order to mitigate a “denial of service”  attack, an operator must be able, at the time  of an attack, to instruct upstream operators  to adapt their routing rules with the help of   the Border Gate Protocol. At the same time, it  must filter illicit communications belonging  to the attack which has reached its network.  The State considers, in this context, the pos- sibility of investing in a national scrubbing  centre (filtering of illegal communications  infrastructure) that will be used when the fil- tering means of local operators are no longer  sufficient.  O B J E C T I V E  2  :   P O O L I N G  S E C U R I T Y   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E S    26 27  Risk management, as introduced since the  second national cybersecurity strategy, is rec- ognized as being the appropriate tool for  good governance of cybersecurity. Indeed, it  complies with the principles of proportion- ality and necessity, while it offers a risk and  security analysis based on different points of  view (companies, natural persons, clients) . It  allows us to understand and take into account  the specific needs of the various stakeholders  involved in the development of digital society.  This is why the Government will publish objec- tive metrics invaluable to carry out objective   risk analysis. This situational awareness will  also facilitate the implementation of internal  management governance based on metrics  adapted to the circumstances.   With informed governance, through decisions  based on objective and realistic situational  reports, Luxembourg will be able to position  itself as a modern, open, resilient and trust- worthy digital nation.  The Government intends to set up a university  course in the field of information security in  order to mitigate the risk of having a lack of  experts in information security, which would  constitute an obstacle to the development of  our security’s ecosystem.  There are plans to offer aid for specific train- ing in the field of information security. Such  aid will be associated with the lifelong train-  ing of experts, so as to encourage them to  attend, for example, conferences and other  relevant events.   The development of specialised training aimed  at multidisciplinary teams will be considered  with a view to addressing the shortage of  experts in the security field, while taking into  account the interconnectivity of tools.   The opportunity of appointing a person in  charge of information security within each  state entity will be considered. A training plan  for these people will be set up if necessary  and exchange platforms for these experts will  be created.  In the private sector, leaders will be encou- raged to provide information security mana- gers with resources to implement effective  protection measures. Efforts will have to be  made to improve communication and collabo-  ration between teams in charge of different  missions: information security, compliance,  management, customer management, etc.   The Government will encourage cooperation  between technical security and business pro- cess experts in order to create and exchange  contextualized risk reports according to key  areas.

The Government will support  the strengthening of cooperation between  these specialized entities, which will facilitate  the management of cross-sector or large- scale incidents.   To execute the requirements listed in the new  regulations and directives (RGPD, Telecom,  NIS), regulators will, in the future, have to  become more involved in the management  of incidents, which will result in more coop- eration between regulators and specialized  teams. This cooperation should increase the  confidence of users in existing structures and   thus improve the quality of digital incident  management.   In addition, the Government will contin- ue to promote the exchange of informa- tion between CERTs. The four public CERTs  (GOVCERT. LU, circl.lu, HealthNet CSIRT and  RESTENA-CSIRT) are known and contacted by  their respective audiences. They have a large  reservoir of information on existing threats  and vulnerabilities, as well as on the actual  effectiveness of security measures. The CERTs’  good reputation contributes to the attractive- ness of Luxembourg’s economy.  Start-ups offering innovative solutions fea- ture among the needs identified within the  Luxembourg digital security ecosystem. It   will be taken into account for priorities in the  field of research, by promoting the creation of  start-ups.   It is intended to establish a framework to  allow code disassembly (“reverse engineer- ing”) in Luxembourg, as well as penetration  tests for the purpose of identifying vulner- abilities. These abilities will be useful to  improve the interoperability of systems and  to help ensure a higher level of security by  identifying malicious software, spyware soft- ware, and so forth.  If serious vulnerabilities are published, pub- lic CERTs are allowed – at national level –  to identify Internet-connected devices with  these vulnerabilities and notify officials (e.g.  Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL).

These objectives will be complemented by an action plan outlining concrete measures to be  implemented following a definite time frame, as well as the actors called on to contribute to their  implementation.   The action plan is available upon request to the High Commissioner for National Protection (e-mail:  info@hcpn.etat.lu; Subject: #NCSS action plan).   The Cybersecurity Board and the interministerial coordination committee for cybersecurity  accompanies the execution of the action plan.  The national cyber strategy is intended to evolve over time. Thus, the action plan will be periodically  revised within the interministerial coordination committee, in order to remain relevant in a digital  environment in constant change.    30 31  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I IN A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I I I  3 .

Whether it is a company, public services or a citizen; each party bears responsibility for the con- struction of a secure digital society.  This appendix gives an update on the progress and implementation of the action points of the  NCSS II, while it is clear that some of the actions are recurrent given that cybersecurity represents  a continuous and dynamic process with an evolutionary character.  Many initiatives have been taken at natio- nal level in order to intensify collaboration  – both in terms of organisation and opera- tions – between actors. Regular exchanges  took place between the ANSSI, regulators  and relevant ministries in order to establish  a security policy for information at the level  of the public sector and operators of critical  infrastructures.  Frequent exchanges have been held about  the protection of personal data in the field  of cybersecurity, two intimately related  topics that deserve to be partially addressed  together.   At the operational level, ongoing exchanges  took place between CERTs, thanks to modern  and efficient collaboration tools. Incidents   reported to the national CERT are managed  through the joint efforts of the GOVCERT and  CIRCL. Moreover, joint efforts to raise awar- eness have been organized to address deci- sion-makers in the public and private sector  about the importance of information security  already bear their first fruits. Close collabora- tions to raise the awareness of children, tee- nagers, adults and the elderly, as well as that  of supervisors have also been very successful. Since its implementation in 2015, the ANSSI  has developed a security policy of General  information for the State (PSI-LU) . It also  entered into cooperation agreements with  various actors at national level.  The State Information Technology Centre  (CTIE) and the Government’s Communications  Centre (CGC) have merged so as to improve   O B J E C T I V E  1  :   S T R E N G T H E N  N A T I O N A L   C O O P E R A T I O N    32 33  the provision of services with regards to the  management of State secure communications. The information security portal www.cyber- security.lu has been online since July 2017. It  introduces the different actors of the sector  and their respective sites. Its main purpose  is to be the “single window” for information  security.  Tools such as the Malware Information  Sharing Platform (MISP) and the Analysis of  Information Leaks (AIL) created by the CIRCL,  or the CASES Diagnostics and MONARC risk  analysis developed by CASES, contribute to  greater collaboration and exchange on digi- tal threats and vulnerabilities between the  parties concerned. They also allow to gather   information on the different degrees of matu- rity on the ground in the private and public  sectors, for informed cybersecurity gover- nance.  The use of risk analysis as a basic method  for managing information security has now  become standard in the Luxembourg. Several  tools are available, including the MONARC  tool which was released as an open source  method. Towards the end of 2017, the ANSSI  initiated a broad risk analysis project with  State entities.  Luxembourg is represented in major infor- mation security groups and associations.  Luxembourg entities have established close  contacts internationally and entered into key  partnerships with their counterparts in part-  ner countries. The develop- ment of collaboration agree- ments with the BSI (Germany),  the A-SIT (Austria), and the  BSI (Switzerland) was possi-  ble and the agree- ments will be  signed in 2018.  O ther  agree - ments, including  with France and  Belgium, will be   finalized in the first quarter of the year 2018.  In the same vein, the GOVCERT and the CIRCL  joined the CSIRT network and are part of  the FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and  Security Teams).   International cooperation has been successful,  which was noticeable on the occasion of the  Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the  European Union during which the GOVCERT  was given the task to protect – alongside its  international partners – the State’s digital  infrastructure.   Luxembourg entities now have  several modern risk analysis tools   at their disposal.   Since March 2017, the MONARC method  has been accessible to all in open source.  Some metrics necessary for the implementa- tion of objective risk analysis have been publi- shed. Depending on the degree of maturity   and competence of organizations, different  models of risk assessment are available.  Certain good sector practices have been deve- loped. They were published through MONARC  risk management models, respectively via  security policies issued by the ANSSI. In addi- tion, sites of state actors such as CASES offer  both specific and general practices.  For several years, data has been collected  on trends of threats, vulnerabilities and the  effectiveness of security measures. This data,  along with data acquired from diagnostics  and risk analysis, provides information on the  level of maturity of the various entities. They  constitute a solid base to draw up reports of  situational awareness. They can be used to  contribute to governance (informed gover- nance).  The cyber emergency response plan deve- loped by the HCPN is operational. The plan   has been updated by the HCPN on a regular  basis as a result of the lessons learned from  exercises and actual crises.   Luxembourg participated in the Cyber Europe  2016 exercise organised by ENISA (European  Network and Information Security Agency).  Luxembourg also contributed to NATO’s 2016  Cyber Coalition exercise as an observer, in  close cooperation with Germany, and partici- pated actively in it in 2017.

Stakeholders indicated that they were sat- isfied with such good mutual collaboration,  which has led to significant successes of  investigation. Stakeholders unanimous- ly agree that existing laws will have to be  applied and adapted to the reality of the dig- ital environment, and that cybercrime inves- tigation procedures will have to be improved,  especially in the context of electronic evi- dence manipulation, while the sharing of  information between actors will have to be  facilitated.  Thanks to good cooperation between the var- ious actors involved and Europol’s support,  police intervention in international cyber- crime has become faster and more efficient. As an extension of measures initiated in the  context of the NCSS II, it will be essential  to continue strengthening the capacity for  action of judicial authorities, notably with  respect to transnational cybercrime. In line  with their respective mandates and assign- ments, the Prosecutor’s Office, the judicial  investigation office and specialist services  (investigation and computing expertise) of  the judicial police must be able to investigate  and prosecute cases of cybercrime, but also  any other ICT-related offence. The following  measures will be necessary to ensure effec- tive action against acts of cybercrime:  • d’adapter les instruments d’entraide judi- ciaire internationale à la volatilité des  preuves sur internet,  • adapting instruments of international  legal assistance to the volatility of evi- dence on the internet,  • proceeding, to the extent possible, to a  minimum harmonisation of the duration  of data retention which varies strongly  from one State to another,   • taking into account encryption possibili- ties given by appropriate tools and tech- nology that may be used to ensure ano- nymity, making it difficult to identify a  suspect (e.g. TOR, DARKNET),  • finding a solution with regards to the  new means of payment (cryptocurren- cies such as Bitcoin and derivatives)  that allow criminals to easily evade  authorities and hide transactions,   • creating opportunities to deal with  the large volume of data to be ana- lysed.  O B J E C T I V E  4  :   F I G H T  A G A I N S T   C Y B E R C R I M E    34 35  Since the end of 2015, the CASES training  has become mandatory for new government  employees and officials, for all careers. This  training course includes general methodolo- gical elements, such as the classification of  information and risk analysis.  In addition to this basic training course, spe- cialized and non-mandatory training courses  are available from the INAP upon request.  Training courses are compulsory for school- children and high school students. They focus  on the “behavioural” aspects of information  security and explain current good practices.  Together with its partners, CASES offers a  wide range of training courses to professional  audiences (users, managers, IT staff, trainers,  etc.) .  Specific training courses for decision-makers  are also available.   Among the measures that were included in  the second strategy and that will be taken up  in the new strategy, it is worth mentioning  the training programme for operators of criti- cal infrastructures.   In Luxembourg, access to information secu- rity is largely facilitated by the State. Free  or affordable training courses are offered  for a very diverse audience. Much effort has   been put into raising citizens’ awareness, for  example through workshops at lunchtime on  weekdays, in the evening or at the weekend.   In line with the government’s “Digital  Luxembourg” strategy, notably the objective  of raising the awareness of students to the  appeal of new technologies and encourage  their creativity, the “makerspaces” have been  set up in co-curricular and educational ins- titutions in order to spark the interest of  young people for new information technolo- gies since 2015. Some of these areas, including  the “Base1” at the Geesseknäppchen Forum,  can accommodate young people outside their  school schedule. A few other projects are  worth noting to highlight the Government’s  commitment to the development of digital  skills in Luxembourg, which is a priority area.  “Cryptoparty”, “coder dojo”, “Mak@ons”,  “hack4kids” and “Luxembourg Tech School”.  These “makerspaces” are grouped in the BEE  CREATIVE initiative.   The “Kniwwelino” initiative has been launched  recently. It is a microprocessor developed in  Luxembourg and distributed to children and  young people to familiarize them with the  concept of programming and code security  (for more information, go to: www.bee-crea- tive.lu) .

MONARC analysis were conduct- ed in various priority sectors and there are  plans to have the same exercises again at the  pace of three tests per year. The risk manage- ment approach will be gradually generalized  and extended to all sectors.  Security standards and guidelines for infor- mation systems have been implemented. They  are published via the security policies issued  by the ANSSI and will be finalized following  the conclusions on the pilot project, which  was carried out within the CTIE.  An inventory of standards and norms of infor- mation security has been developed. As this  inventory is a living document, this action  item will be incorpo- rated into the new  strategy.

Programmes have been created by  many Luxembourg actors. The coordination  of initiatives in this area will be further  strengthened in the coming years.  The strengthening of cooperation in the devel- opment of cryptographic protocols and algo-  rithms will be included in the new strategy,  in order to clarify the means at Luxembourg’s  disposal to certify products in this area. In the  absence of appropriate certification laborato- ries, partnerships with foreign organizations  (neighbouring countries) are being pursued.

These observations  allowed the actors to have a global view on the development of attacks over time. This analysis,  which is not intended to be exhaustive, allows us to describe current and future cyber threats.  • RANSOMWARES   At this time, the actors noted a significant  increase of attacks with a purely financial  goal, including attacks carried out through  ransomware, i.e. malware introduced into  a system to encrypt the digital files it  contains, in order to sell the decryption  key to the victim. Such illegal activities  are facilitated by the emergence of virtual  currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.  One of the last major attacks by way of  ransomware (Notpetya) has also revealed  that it is possible to conceal a cyber sab- otage attack by making it appear as ran- somware.   • ATTACKS BY DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF  SERVICE (DDOS) VIA THE INTERNET OF  THINGS     The impact of DDoS attacks is more and   more significant. This form of attack has  now reached unprecedented significance  as a result of the internet of things. Via  tools like MIRAI, poorly secured inter- net-connected objects can easily be  tracked and manipulated for very large- scale DDoS attacks. These tools are freely  available on the internet, and they are  often used for blackmail purposes. Such  tools also allow to track and jeopardise  internet-connected objects to perform  mass surveillance or some kind of indus- trial espionage.    • “BRICKERBOT”   Unlike other attacks such as DDoS attacks  that prevent services from working for  a while, “BrickerBots” are designed to  destroy Internet-connected objects. These  attacks can be very stealthy and diffi- cult to detect. They are aimed at objects  with poor protection and attempt, after  successful authentication, to change the  system settings so as to make the object  unusable4.  • RISKS INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF  SMART CITIES AND HOME AUTOMATION   More and more components, which are  part of our daily lives and are used to  provide high-value services, are using  information from real-time digital infra- structure. Smart cities are equipped with  sensors collecting data and rely on infor- mation systems to optimize services that  are characterized by their high degree of  connectivity. The attacks against these  infrastructures are likely to multiply in the  presence of authentication systems and  cryptographic protocols, which often do  not meet the highest security level.   • FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MINIMUM  SECURITY STANDARDS   A worrying element, which is currently  felt in the cybercrime sphere, is the failure  by the publisher of a software or a com-  4  https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/      A N A LY S I S  O F  N A T I O N A L   T H R E A T S  T O  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y    38 39  puter tool, to comply with standards and  better security objectives with regards to  development. Computer security is not  always a priority in the production of  software and IT tools. Often distributed  to millions of users such software is likely  to be hacked in order to be manipulated  and constitutes a real threat to a coun- try’s economy and security.  • THREATS TO THE BUSINESS PROCESS     Recent attacks have shown that criminals  are diversifying their actions and targets.  Rather than harming by way of blackmail,  exfiltration or data sabotage, they are  now also targeting the business process.  The shortage of skilled human resources  in the field of IT must be considered as a  vulnerability in this context. As a result, a  vast number of companies have no choice  but to outsource their IT systems to major  players specialised in the field. It follows  that the staff of these companies no  longer have the skills necessary to protect  business or industrial processes. This vul- nerability can be exploited by the intru- sion of malicious software that is used as  a spying tool to provide its author with a  company’s internal details. The cyberse- curity package presented by the European  Commission in September 2017 seeks to  address many of these threats.  • REGULATORY THREATS   With “WannaCry”, the massive resurgence  of computer worms was felt across the  entire world. The attack also showed that  a risk can come from very strict regulatory  obligations, which can give a false sense  of security while linking major resources  to ensure compliance with process stand- ards.   Alternatively, cyberspace is at risk of not  being sufficiently regulated in some plac-  es because the  law is not always  able to keep pace  with new technol-  ogies, which results in legal limbo situa- tions where malicious activities thrive  • DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON SOCIAL  NETWORKS AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING   Nowadays, the use of social networks  is ever-increasing. Users disclose ample  information on their private lives. The  technique of social engineering is designed  to access confidential information stored  by companies in order to use it for crimi- nal purposes or even espionage or sabo- tage. For example, some “all-cloud” com- panies migrate all data to a cloud, but do  not have any secure procedures to contact  the cloud service provider. Through social  engineering, such flaws can easily be used  by criminals, while strong authentication  systems that would prevent this are not  really common in cloud environments.  • THREATS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF  INTERNET ACCESS TOOLS   Today, users frequently use their mobile  phones to access the internet and carry  out online transactions. Some smart- phones are unfortunately difficult to pro- tect and therefore represent an ideal tar- get.   • USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS AS A MEANS OF  DESTABILIZATION   One of the threats that has recently had a  great impact is the fact that digital tools  are being used as a means of destabili- zation. It is worth mentioning here the  group of hackers Shadow-brokers, who  managed to steal a large number of com- puter tools from a security authority,  tools used by it to access certain systems  and networks.  The use of such a weapon  could have very serious consequences.  This new threat aligns with situations  that could paralyse the country and even  entire regions. The idea of the digital sab- otage and shut-down of an entire country  through digital means is becoming more  and more realistic. Armed forces around  the world are preparing for such sce- narios. The manipulation of elections by  revelations from digital attacks or broad- casting false information through social  networks has been seen in some coun- tries over the past years, in the context of  hybrid attacks, which partly falls within  the scope of cybersecurity.  • THREATS INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT  OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE   Generally speaking, artificial intelligence  will emerge in the context of designing  and executing malicious software. It is  currently a research subject in the world  of academia and will soon be mature  enough to be implemented in real mal- ware, which will have the ability to adapt  dynamically to security measures put in  place by teams defending the networks  and infrastructure of organizations.

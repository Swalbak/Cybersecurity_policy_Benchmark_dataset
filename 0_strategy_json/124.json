Ensuring the security of cyberspace is fundamental to both endeavors. Cyberspace is an integral component of all facets of American life, including our economy and defense. Yet, our private and public entities still struggle to secure their systems, and adver- saries have increased the frequency and sophistication of their malicious cyber activities. America created the Internet and shared it with the world. Now, we must make sure to secure and preserve cyberspace for future generations. In the last 18 months, my Administration has taken action to address cyber threats. We have sanctioned malign cyber actors. We have indicted those that committed cybercrimes. We have publicly attributed malicious activity to the adversaries responsible and released details about the tools they employed. We have required departments and agencies to remove software vulnerable to various security risks. We have taken action to hold department and agency heads accountable for managing cybersecurity risks to the systems they control, while empowering them to provide adequate security. In addition, last year, I signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The work performed and reports created in response to that Executive Order laid the groundwork for this National Cyber Strategy. With the release of this National Cyber Strategy, the United States now has its first fully articu- lated cyber strategy in 15 years. This strategy explains how my Administration will: • Defend the homeland by protecting networks, systems, functions, and data; • Promote American prosperity by nurturing a secure, thriving digital economy and fostering strong domestic innovation; • Preserve peace and security by strengthening the ability of the United States — in concert with allies and partners — to deter and, if necessary, punish those who use cyber tools for malicious purposes; and • Expand American influence abroad to extend the key tenets of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.

The rise of the Internet and the growing centrality of cyberspace to all facets of the modern world corresponded with the rise of the United States as the world’s lone superpower. For the past quarter century, the ingenuity of the American people drove the evolution of cyberspace, and in turn, cyberspace has become fundamental to American wealth creation and innovation. Cyberspace is an inseparable component of America’s financial, social, government, and political life. Meanwhile, Americans sometimes took for granted that the supremacy of the United States in the cyber domain would remain unchallenged, and that America’s vision for an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet would inevitably become a reality. Americans believed the growth of the Internet would carry the universal aspirations for free expression and individual liberty around the world. Americans assumed the opportunities to expand commu- nication, commerce, and free exchange of ideas would be self-evident. Large parts of the world have embraced America’s vision of a shared and open cyberspace for the mutual benefit of all. Our competitors and adversaries, however, have taken an opposite approach. They benefit from the open Internet, while constricting and controlling their own people’s access to it, and actively undermine the principles of an open Internet in international forums. They hide behind notions of sovereignty while recklessly violating the laws of other states by engaging in pernicious economic espionage and malicious cyber activities, causing significant economic disruption and harm to individuals, commercial and non-commercial interests, and governments across the world. They view cyberspace as an arena where the United States’ overwhelming military, economic, and political power could be neutralized and where the United States and its allies and partners are vulnerable. Russia, Iran, and North Korea conducted reckless cyber attacks that harmed American and inter- 1 Introduction America’s prosperity and security depend on how we respond to the opportu- nities and challenges in cyberspace. Critical infrastructure, national defense, and the daily lives of Americans rely on computer-driven and interconnected infor- mation technologies. As all facets of American life have become more dependent on a secure cyberspace, new vulnerabilities have been revealed and new threats continue to emerge. Building on the National Security Strategy and the Admin- istration’s progress over its first 18 months, the National Cyber Strategy outlines how the United States will ensure the American people continue to reap the benefits of a secure cyberspace that reflects our principles, protects our security, and promotes our prosperity. national businesses and our allies and partners without paying costs likely to deter future cyber aggression. China engaged in cyber-enabled economic espionage and trillions of dollars of intellectual property theft. Non-state actors — including terrorists and criminals — exploited cyber- space to profit, recruit, propa- gandize, and attack the United States and its allies and partners, with their actions often shielded by hostile states. Public and private entities have struggled to secure their systems as adversaries increase the frequency and sophistication of their malicious cyber activities. Entities across the United States have faced cybersecurity challenges in effectively identifying, protecting, and ensuring resilience of their networks, systems, functions, and data as well as detecting, responding to, and recovering from incidents. The Way Forward New threats and a new era of strategic compe- tition demand a new cyber strategy that responds to new realities, reduces vulnerabilities, deters adversaries, and safeguards opportunities for the American people to thrive. Securing cyber- space is fundamental to our strategy and requires technical advancements and administrative efficiency across the Federal Government and the private sector. The Administration also recognizes that a purely technocratic approach to cyberspace is insufficient to address the nature of the new problems we confront. The United States must also have policy choices to impose costs if it hopes to deter malicious cyber actors and prevent further escalation. The Administration is already taking action to aggressively address these threats and adjust to new realities. The United States has sanctioned malign cyber actors and indicted those that have committed cybercrimes. We have publicly attributed malicious activity to the responsible adversaries and released details of the tools and infrastructure they employed. We have required depart- ments and agencies to remove software vulnerable to various security risks. We have taken action to hold department and agency heads accountable for managing the cybersecurity risks to systems they control, while empowering them to provide adequate security. The Administration’s approach to cyberspace is anchored by enduring American values, such as the belief in the power of individual liberty, free expression, free markets, and privacy. We retain our commitment to the promise of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet to strengthen and extend our values and protect and ensure economic security for American workers and companies. The future we desire will not come without a renewed American commitment to advance our interests across cyberspace. The Administration recognizes that the United States is engaged in a continuous competition against strategic adversaries, rogue states, and terrorist and criminal networks. Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea all use cyberspace as a means to challenge the United States, its allies, and partners, often with a recklessness they would never consider in other domains. These adver- saries use cyber tools to undermine our economy and democracy, steal our intellectual property, 2 I N T R O D U C T I O N DONALD J . TRUMP SEPTEMBER 2018 “We will continue to lead the world in securing a prosperous cyber future.” N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y and sow discord in our democratic processes. We are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure, and the risk is growing that these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war. These adversaries are continually devel- oping new and more effective cyber weapons. This National Cyber Strategy outlines how we will (1) defend the homeland by protecting networks, systems, functions, and data; (2) promote American prosperity by nurturing a secure, thriving digital economy and fostering strong domestic innovation; (3) preserve peace and security by strengthening the United States’ ability — in concert with allies and partners — to deter and if necessary punish those who use cyber tools for malicious purposes; and (4) expand American influence abroad to extend the key tenets of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. The Strategy’s success will be realized when cybersecurity vulnerabilities are effectively managed through identification and protection of networks, systems, functions, and data as well as detection of, resilience against, response to, and recovery from incidents; destructive, disruptive, or otherwise destabilizing malicious cyber activities directed against United States interests are reduced or prevented; activity that is contrary to responsible behavior in cyber- space is deterred through the imposition of costs through cyber and non-cyber means; and the United States is positioned to use cyber capabil- ities to achieve national security objectives. The articulation of the National Cyber Strategy is organized according to the pillars of the National Security Strategy. The National Security Council staff will coordinate with departments, agencies, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on an appropriate resource plan to implement this Strategy. Depart- ments and agencies will execute their missions informed by the following strategic guidance. 3 rotecting the American people, the American way of life, and American interests is at the forefront of the National Security Strategy. Protecting American infor- mation networks, whether government or private, is vital to fulfilling this objective. It will require a series of coordinated actions focused on protecting government networks, protecting critical infrastructure, and combating cybercrime. The United States Government, private industry, and the public must each take immediate and decisive actions to strengthen cybersecurity, with each working on securing the networks under their control and supporting each other as appropriate. OBJECTIVE: Manage cybersecurity risks to increase the security and resilience of the Nation’s information and information systems. Secure Federal Networks and Information The responsibility to secure Federal networks — including Federal information systems and national security systems — falls squarely on the Federal Government. The Administration will clarify the relevant authorities, responsi- bilities, and accountability within and across departments and agencies for securing Federal information systems, while setting the standard for effective cybersecurity risk management. As part of this effort, the Administration will centralize some authorities within the Federal Government, enable greater cross-agency visibility, improve management of our Federal supply chain, and strengthen the security of United States Government contractor systems. Priority Actions FURTHER CENTRALIZE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF FEDERAL CIVILIAN CYBERSECURITY: The Administration will act to further enable the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to secure Federal department and agency networks, with the exception of national security systems and Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC) systems. This includes ensuring DHS has appropriate access to agency infor- mation systems for cybersecurity purposes and can take and direct action to safeguard systems from the spectrum of risks. Under the oversight of the OMB, the Administration will expand on work begun under Executive Order (E.O.) 13800 to prior- itize the transition of agencies to shared services Protect the American People, the Homeland, and the American Way of Life PILLAR I P 6 and infrastructure. DHS will have appropriate visibility into those services and infrastructure to improve United States cybersecurity posture. We will continue to deploy centralized capabil- ities, tools, and services through DHS where appropriate, and improve oversight and compliance with applicable laws, policies, standards, and directives. This will likely require new policies and architectures that enable the government to better leverage innovation. DOD and the IC will consider these activities as they work to better secure national security systems, DOD systems, and IC systems, as appropriate. ALIGN RISK MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITIES: E.O. 13833, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers, empowers Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to more effectively leverage technology to accomplish agency missions, cut down on duplication, and make information technology (IT) investment more efficient. Department and agency leaders will empower and hold their CIOs accountable to align cybersecurity risk management decisions and IT budgeting and procurement decisions. The Administration, through OMB and DHS, will continue to guide and direct risk management actions across Federal civilian departments and agencies, and CIOs will be empowered to take a proactive leadership role in assuring IT procurement decisions assign the proper priority to securing networks and data. IMPROVE FEDERAL SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT: The Administration will integrate supply chain risk management into agency procurement and risk management processes in accordance with federal requirements that are consistent with industry best practices to better ensure the technology that the Federal Government deploys is secure and reliable. This includes ensuring better information sharing among departments and agencies to improve awareness of supply chain threats and reduce duplicative supply chain activities within the United States Government, including by creating a supply chain risk assessment shared service. It also includes addressing deficiencies in the Federal acqui- sition system, such as providing more stream- lined authorities to exclude risky vendors, products, and services when justified. This effort will be synchronized with efforts to manage supply chain risk in the Nation’s infrastructure. STRENGTHEN FEDERAL CONTRACTOR CYBER- SECURITY: The United States cannot afford to have sensitive government information or systems inadequately secured by contractors. Federal contractors provide important services to the United States Government and must properly secure the systems through which they provide those services. Going forward, the Federal Government will be able to assess the security of its data by reviewing contractor risk management practices and adequately testing, hunting, sensoring, and responding to incidents on contractor systems. Contracts with Federal departments and agencies will be drafted to authorize such activities for the purpose of improving cybersecurity. Among the acute concerns in this area are those contractors within the defense industrial base responsible for researching and developing key systems fielded by the DOD. Further, as recommended in the E.O. 13800 Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization, the Administration will support 7 P I L L A R I : P R O T E C T T H E A M E R I C A N P E O P L E , T H E H O M E L A N D , A N D T H E A M E R I C A N W A Y O F L I F E N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y adoption of consolidated acquisition strategies to improve cybersecurity and reduce overhead costs associated with using inconsistent contract provisions across the Federal Government. It will also act to ensure, where appropriate, that Federal contractors receive and use all relevant and shareable threat and vulnerability information to improve their security posture. ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT LEADS IN BEST AND INNOVATIVE PRACTICES: The Federal Government will ensure the systems it owns and operates meet the standards and cybersecurity best practices it recommends to industry. Projects that receive Federal funding must meet these standards as well. The Federal Government will use its purchasing power to drive sector-wide improvement in products and services. The Federal Government will also be a leader in developing and implementing standards and best practices in new and emerging areas. For example, public key cryptography is founda- tional to the secure operation of our infra- structure. To protect against the potential threat of quantum computers being able to break modern public key cryptography, the Department of Commerce, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will continue to solicit, evaluate, and standardize quantum-resistant, public key cryptographic algorithms. The United States must be at the forefront of protecting communications by supporting rapid adoption of these forthcoming NIST standards across government infrastructure and by encouraging the Nation to do the same. Secure Critical Infrastructure The responsibility to secure the Nation’s critical infrastructure and manage its cybersecurity risk is shared by the private sector and the Federal Government. In partnership with the private sector, we will collectively use a risk-management approach to mitigating vulnerabilities to raise the base level of cybersecurity across critical infra- structure. We will simultaneously use a conse- quence-driven approach to prioritize actions that reduce the potential that the most advanced adversaries could cause large-scale or long-du- ration disruptions to critical infrastructure. We will also deter malicious cyber actors by imposing costs on them and their sponsors by leveraging a range of tools, including but not limited to prose- cutions and economic sanctions, as part of a broader deterrence strategy. Priority Actions REFINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: The Admin- istration will clarify the roles and responsibil- ities of Federal agencies and the expectations on the private sector related to cybersecurity risk management and incident response. Clarity will enable proactive risk management that comprehensively addresses threats, vulnera- bilities, and consequences. It will also identify and bridge existing gaps in responsibilities and coordination among Federal and non-Federal incident response efforts and promote more routine training, exercises, and coordination. PRIORITIZE ACTIONS ACCORDING TO IDENTIFIED NATIONAL RISKS: The Federal Government will work with the private sector to manage risks to critical infrastructure at the greatest risk. The Administration will develop a comprehensive understanding of national risk by identifying national critical functions and will mature our cybersecurity offerings and engagements to better manage those national risks. The Administration will prioritize risk-reduction activities across seven key areas: national security, energy and power, banking and 8 finance, health and safety, communications, information technology, and transportation. LEVERAGE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS AS CYBERSECURITY ENABLERS: Information and communications technology (ICT) underlies every sector in America. ICT providers are in a unique position to detect, prevent, and mitigate risk before it impacts their customers, and the Federal Government must work with these providers to improve ICT security and resilience in a targeted and efficient manner while protecting privacy and civil liberties. The United States Government will strengthen efforts to share information with ICT providers to enable them to respond to and remediate known malicious cyber activity at the network level. This will include sharing classified threat and vulnerability information with cleared ICT operators and downgrading information to the unclassified level as much as possible. We will promote an adaptable, sustainable, and secure technology supply chain that supports security based on best practices and standards. The United States Government will convene stakeholders to devise cross-sector solutions to challenges at the network, device, and gateway layers, and we will encourage industry-driven certification regimes that ensure solutions can adapt in a rapidly evolving market and threat landscape. PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY: Securing our democratic processes is of paramount impor- tance to the United States and our democratic allies. State and local government officials own and operate diverse election infrastructure within the United States. Therefore, when requested we will provide technical and risk management services, support training and exercising, maintain situational awareness of threats to this sector, and improve the sharing of threat intelli- gence with those officials to better prepare and protect the election infrastructure. The Federal Government will continue to coordinate the development of cybersecurity standards and guidance to safeguard the electoral process and the tools that deliver a secure system. In the event of a significant cyber incident, the Federal Government is poised to provide threat and asset response to recover election infrastructure. INCENTIVIZE CYBERSECURITY INVESTMENTS: Most cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure stem from the exploitation of known vulnerabilities. The United States Government will work with private and public sector entities to promote understanding of cybersecurity risk so they make more informed risk-management decisions, invest in appropriate security measures, and realize benefits from those investments. PRIORITIZE NATIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVEL- OPMENT INVESTMENTS: The Federal Government will update the National Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Research and Devel- opment Plan to set priorities for addressing cyber- security risks to critical infrastructure. Depart- ments and agencies will align their investments to the priorities, which will focus on building new cybersecurity approaches that use emerging technologies, improving information-sharing and risk management related to cross-sector interdependencies, and building resilience to large-scale or long-duration disruptions. IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION AND MARITIME CYBER- SECURITY: America’s economic and national security is built on global trade and transpor- tation. Our ability to guarantee free and timely movement of goods, open sea and air lines of communications, access to oil and natural gas, and availability of associated critical infra- structures is vital to our economic and national security. As these sectors have modernized, 9 P I L L A R I : P R O T E C T T H E A M E R I C A N P E O P L E , T H E H O M E L A N D , A N D T H E A M E R I C A N W A Y O F L I F E N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y they have also become more vulnerable to cyber exploitation or attack. Maritime cybersecurity is of particular concern because lost or delayed shipments can result in strategic economic disruptions and potential spillover effects on downstream industries. Given the criticality of maritime transportation to the United States and global economy and the minimal risk-reduction investments to protect against cyber exploitation made thus far, the United States will move quickly to clarify maritime cybersecurity roles and responsibilities; promote enhanced mecha- nisms for international coordination and infor- mation sharing; and accelerate the development of next-generation cyber-resilient maritime infrastructure. The United States will assure the uninterrupted transport of goods in the face of all threats that can hold this inherently interna- tional infrastructure at risk through cyber means. IMPROVE SPACE CYBERSECURITY: The United States considers unfettered access to and freedom to operate in space vital to advancing the security, economic prosperity, and scientific knowledge of the Nation. The Administration is concerned about the growing cyber-related threats to space assets and supporting infra- structure because these assets are critical to functions such as positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); satellite communications; and weather monitoring. The Administration will enhance efforts to protect our space assets and support infrastructure from evolving cyber threats, and we will work with industry and international partners to strengthen the cyber resilience of existing and future space systems. Combat Cybercrime and Improve Incident Reporting Federal departments and agencies, in cooper- ation with state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities, play a critical role in detecting, preventing, disrupting, and investi- gating cyber threats to our Nation. The United States is regularly the victim of malicious cyber activity perpetrated by criminal actors, including state and non-state actors and their proxies and terrorists using network infrastructure in the United States and abroad. Federal law enforcement works to apprehend and prosecute offenders, disable criminal infrastructure, limit the spread and use of nefarious cyber capabil- ities, prevent cyber criminals and their state sponsors from profiting from their illicit activity, and seize their assets. The Administration will push to ensure that our Federal departments and agencies have the necessary legal author- ities and resources to combat transnational cybercriminal activity, including identifying and dismantling botnets, dark markets, and other infrastructure used to enable cybercrime, and combatting economic espionage. To effectively deter, disrupt, and prevent cyber threats, law enforcement will work with private industry to confront challenges presented by technological barriers, such as anonymization and encryption technologies, to obtain time-sensitive evidence pursuant to appropriate legal process. Law enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities. Priority Actions IMPROVE INCIDENT REPORTING AND RESPONSE: The United States Government will continue to encourage reporting of intrusions and theft of data by all victims, especially critical infra- structure partners. The prompt reporting of cyber incidents to the Federal Government is essential to an effective response, linking of 10 related incidents, identification of the perpe- trators, and prevention of future incidents. MODERNIZE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND COMPUTER CRIME LAWS: The Administration will work with the Congress to update electronic surveillance and computer crime statutes to enhance law enforcement’s capabilities to lawfully gather necessary evidence of criminal activity, disrupt criminal infrastructure through civil injunctions, and impose appropriate consequences upon malicious cyber actors. REDUCE THREATS FROM TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS IN CYBERSPACE: Computer hacking conducted by transnational criminal groups poses a significant threat to our national security. Equipped with sizeable funds, organized criminal groups operating abroad employ sophisticated malicious software, spear- phishing campaigns, and other hacking tools — some of which rival those of nation states in sophistication — to hack into sensitive financial systems, conduct massive data breaches, spread ransomware, attack critical infrastructure, and steal intellectual property. The Administration will advocate for law enforcement to have effective legal tools to investigate and prosecute such groups and modernized organized crime statutes for use against this threat. IMPROVE APPREHENSION OF CRIMINALS LOCATED ABROAD: Deterring cybercrime requires a credible threat that perpetrators will be identified, appre- hended, and brought to justice. However, some foreign nations choose not to cooperate with extradition requests, impose unreasonable limitations, or actively interfere in these efforts. The United States will continue to identify gaps and potential mechanisms for bringing foreign- based cyber criminals to justice. The United States Government will also increase diplomatic and other efforts with countries to promote cooperation with legitimate extradition requests. We will push other nations to expedite their assis- tance in investigations and to comply with any bilateral or multilateral agreements or obligations. STRENGTHEN PARTNER NATIONS’ LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY TO COMBAT CRIMINAL CYBER ACTIVITY: The United States should also aid willing partner nations to build their capacity to address criminal cyber activity. The borderless nature of cybercrime, including state-sponsored and terrorist activities, requires strong inter- national law enforcement partnerships. This cooperation requires foreign law enforcement agencies to have the technical capability to assist United States law enforcement effectively when requested. It is therefore in the interest of United States national security to continue building cybercrime-fighting capacity that facilitates stronger international law enforcement cooperation. The United States will strive to improve inter- national cooperation in investigating malicious cyber activity, including developing solutions to potential barriers to gathering and sharing evidence. The United States will also lead in developing interoperable and mutually beneficial systems to encourage efficient cross-border information exchange for law enforcement purposes and reduce barriers to coordination. The Administration will urge effective use of existing international tools like the United Nations Convention Against Trans- national Organized Crime and the G7 24/7 Network Points of Contact. Finally, we will work to expand the international consensus favoring the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe (Budapest Convention), including by supporting greater adoption of the convention. 11 P I L L A R I : P R O T E C T T H E A M E R I C A N P E O P L E , T H E H O M E L A N D , A N D T H E A M E R I C A N W A Y O F L I F E he Internet has generated tremendous benefits domestically and abroad, and it helps to advance American values of freedom, security, and prosperity. Along with its expansion have come challenges that threaten our national security. The United States will demonstrate a coherent and compre- hensive approach to address these and other challenges to defend American national interests in this increasingly digitized world. OBJECTIVE: Preserve United States influence in the technological ecosystem and the devel- opment of cyberspace as an open engine of economic growth, innovation, and efficiency. Foster a Vibrant and Resilient Digital Economy Economic security is inherently tied to our national security. As the foundations of our economy are becoming increasingly rooted in digital technologies, the United States Government will model and promote standards that protect our economic security and reinforce the vitality of the American marketplace and American innovation. Priority Actions INCENTIVIZE AN ADAPTABLE AND SECURE TECHNOLOGY MARKETPLACE: To enhance the resil- ience of cyberspace, the Administration expects the technology marketplace to support and reward the continuous development, adoption, and evolution of innovative security technologies and processes. The Administration will work across stakeholder groups, including the private sector and civil society, to promote best practices and develop strategies to overcome market barriers to the adoption of secure technologies. The Administration will improve awareness and transparency of cybersecurity practices to build market demand for more secure products and services. Finally, the Administration will collab- orate with international partners to promote open, industry-driven standards with government support, as appropriate, and risk-based approaches to address cybersecurity challenges to include platform and managed service approaches that lower barriers to secure practice adoption across the breadth of the ecosystem. PRIORITIZE INNOVATION: The United States Government will promote implementation and Promote American Prosperity PILLAR II T 14 continuous updating of standards and best practices that deter and prevent current and evolving threats and hazards in all domains of the cyber ecosystem. These standards and practices should be outcome-oriented and based on sound technological principles rather than point-in-time company specifica- tions. The Administration will eliminate policy barriers that inhibit a robust cybersecurity industry from developing, sharing, and building innovative capabilities to reduce cyber threats. INVEST IN NEXT GENERATION INFRASTRUCTURE: The Administration will facilitate the accelerated development and rollout of next-generation telecommunications and information communi- cations infrastructure here in the United States, while using the buying power of the Federal Government to incentivize the move towards more secure supply chains. The United States Government will work with the private sector to facil- itate the evolution and security of 5G, examine technological and spectrum-based solutions, and lay the groundwork for innovation beyond next-generation advancements. The United States Government will examine the use of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelli- gence and quantum computing, while addressing risks inherent in their use and application. We will collaborate with the private sector and civil society to understand trends in technology advancement to maintain the United States technological edge in connected technologies and to ensure secure practices are adopted from the outset. PROMOTE THE FREE FLOW OF DATA ACROSS BORDERS: Countries are increasingly looking towards restrictive data localization and regula- tions as pretexts for digital protectionism under the rubric of national security. Those actions negatively impact the competitiveness of United States companies. The United States will continue to lead by example and push back against unjus- tifiable barriers to the free flow of data and digital trade. The Administration will continue to work with international counterparts to promote open, industry driven standards, innovative products, and risk-based approaches that permit global innovation and the free flow of data while meeting the legitimate security needs of the United States. MAINTAIN UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: The United States’ influence in cyberspace is linked to our techno- logical leadership. Accordingly, the United States Government will make a concerted effort to protect cutting edge technol- ogies, including from theft by our adversaries, support those technologies’ maturation, and, where possible, reduce United States companies’ barriers to market entry. The United States will promote United States cybersecurity innovation worldwide through trade-related engagement, raising awareness of innovative American cybersecurity tools and services, exposing and countering repressive regimes use of such tools and services to undermine human rights, and reducing barriers to a robust global cybersecurity market. PROMOTE FULL-LIFECYCLE CYBERSECURITY: The United States Government will promote full-life- cycle cybersecurity, pressing for strong, default security settings, adaptable, upgradeable products, and other best practices built in at the time of product delivery. We will identify a clear pathway toward an adaptable, sustainable, and secure technology marketplace, encour- 15 DONALD J .

The United States Government will promote foundational engineering practices to reduce systemic fragility and develop designs that degrade and recover effectively when success- fully attacked. The United States Government will also promote regular testing and exercising of the cybersecurity and resilience of products and systems during development using best practices from forward-leaning industries. This includes promotion and use of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, crowd-sourced testing, and other innovative assessments that improve resiliency ahead of exploitation or attack. The United States Government will also evaluate how to improve the end-to-end lifecycle for digital identity management, including over-reliance on Social Security numbers. Foster and Protect United States Ingenuity Fostering and protecting American invention and innovation is critical to maintaining the United States’ strategic advantage in cyberspace. The United States Government will nurture innovation by promoting institutions and programs that drive United States competitiveness. The United States Government will counter predatory mergers and acquisitions and counter intellectual property theft. We will also catalyze United States leadership in emerging technologies and promote government identification and support to these technologies, which include artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and next-gener- ation telecommunication infrastructure. Priority Actions UPDATE MECHANISMS TO REVIEW FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND OPERATION IN THE UNITED STATES: The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of United States telecommunica- tions networks are essential to our economy and national security. We must be vigilant to safeguard the telecommunications networks we depend on in our everyday lives so they cannot be used or compromised by a foreign adversary to harm the United States. The United States Government will balance these objectives by formalizing and streamlining the review of Federal Communications Commission referrals for telecommunications licenses. The United States Government will facilitate a transparent process to increase the efficiency of this review. MAINTAIN A STRONG AND BALANCED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION SYSTEM: Strong intel- lectual property protections ensure continued economic growth and innovation in the digital age. The United States Government has fostered and will continue to help foster a global intel- lectual property rights system that provides incentives for innovation through the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The United States Government will also promote protection of sensitive emerging technologies and trade secrets, and we will work to prevent adversarial nation states from gaining unfair advantage at the expense of American research and development. PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY OF AMERICAN IDEAS: For more than a decade, malicious actors have conducted cyber intru- sions into United States commercial networks, targeting confidential business information held by American firms. Malicious cyber actors from other nations have stolen troves of trade secrets, technical data, and sensitive proprietary internal communications. The United States Government will work against the illicit appro- 16 priation of public and private sector technology and technical knowledge by foreign competitors, while maintaining an investor-friendly climate. Develop a Superior Cybersecurity Workforce A highly skilled cybersecurity workforce is a strategic national security advantage. The United States will fully develop the vast American talent pool, while at the same time attracting the best and brightest among those abroad who share our values. Priority Actions BUILD AND SUSTAIN THE TALENT PIPELINE: Our peer competitors are implementing workforce development programs that have the potential to harm long-term United States cybersecurity competitiveness. The United States Government will continue to invest in and enhance programs that build the domestic talent pipeline, from primary through postsec- ondary education. The Administration will leverage the President’s proposed merit-based immigration reforms to ensure that the United States has the most competitive technology sector. This effort may require additional legislation to achieve the sought after goals. EXPAND RE-SKILLING AND EDUCATIONAL OPPOR- TUNITIES FOR AMERICA’S WORKERS: The Admin- istration will work with the Congress to promote and reinvigorate educational and training opportunities to develop a robust cybersecurity workforce. This includes expanding Federal recruitment, training, re-skilling people from a broad range of backgrounds, and giving them opportunities to re-train into cybersecurity careers. ENHANCE THE FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE: To improve recruitment and retention of highly qualified cybersecurity profes- sionals to the Federal Government, the Adminis- tration will continue to use the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework to support policies allowing for a standardized approach for identifying, hiring, developing, and retaining a talented cybersecurity workforce. Additionally, the Administration will explore appropriate options to establish distributed cybersecurity personnel under the management of DHS to oversee the development, management, and deployment of cybersecurity personnel across Federal departments and agencies with the exception of DOD and the IC. The Admin- istration will promote appropriate financial compensation for the United States Government workforce, as well as unique training and opera- tional opportunities to effectively recruit and retain critical cybersecurity talent in light of the competitive private sector environment. USE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO HIGHLIGHT AND REWARD TALENT: The United States Government will promote and magnify excel- lence by highlighting cybersecurity educators and cybersecurity professionals. The United States Government will also leverage public- private collaboration to develop and circulate the NICE Framework, which provides a standardized approach for identifying cyber- security workforce gaps, while also imple- menting actions to prepare, grow, and sustain a workforce that can defend and bolster America’s critical infrastructure and innovation base. 17 P I L L A R I I : P R O M O T E A M E R I C A N P R O S P E R I T Y hallenges to United States security and economic interests, from nation states and other groups, which have long existed in the offline world are now increasingly occurring in cyberspace. This now-persistent engagement in cyberspace is already altering the strategic balance of power. This Administration will issue transformative policies that reflect today’s new reality and guide the United States Government towards strategic outcomes that protect the American people and our way of life. Cyberspace will no longer be treated as a separate category of policy or activity disjointed from other elements of national power. The United States will integrate the employment of cyber options across every element of national power. OBJECTIVE: Identify, counter, disrupt, degrade, and deter behavior in cyberspace that is desta- bilizing and contrary to national interests, while preserving United States overmatch in and through cyberspace. Enhance Cyber Stability through Norms of Responsible State Behavior The United States will promote a framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace built upon international law, adherence to voluntary non-binding norms of responsible state behavior that apply during peacetime, and the consider- ation of practical confidence building measures to reduce the risk of conflict stemming from malicious cyber activity. These principles should form a basis for cooperative responses to counter irresponsible state actions inconsistent with this framework. Priority Action ENCOURAGE UNIVERSAL ADHERENCE TO CYBER NORMS: International law and voluntary non-binding norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace provide stabilizing, security-en- hancing standards that define acceptable behavior to all states and promote greater predictability and stability in cyberspace. The United States will encourage other nations to publicly affirm these principles and views through enhanced outreach and engagement in multilateral fora. Increased public affir- mation by the United States and other govern- ments will lead to accepted expectations of state behavior and thus contribute to greater predictability and stability in cyberspace. Preserve Peace through Strength PILLAR III C 20 Attribute and Deter Unacceptable Behavior in Cyberspace As the United States continues to promote consensus on what constitutes responsible state behavior in cyberspace, we must also work to ensure that there are consequences for irrespon- sible behavior that harms the United States and our partners. All instruments of national power are available to prevent, respond to, and deter malicious cyber activity against the United States. This includes diplomatic, information, military (both kinetic and cyber), financial, intelligence, public attribution, and law enforcement capabil- ities. The United States will formalize and make routine how we work with like-minded partners to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States or our partners. Priority Actions LEAD WITH OBJECTIVE, COLLABORATIVE INTELLI- GENCE: The IC will continue to lead the world in the use of all-source cyber intelligence to drive the identification and attribution of malicious cyber activity that threatens United States national interests. Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states, and non-nation state cyber programs, intentions, capabilities, research and development efforts, tactics, and operational activities that will inform whole-of-government responses to protect American interests at home and abroad. IMPOSE CONSEQUENCES: The United States will develop swift and transparent consequences, which we will impose consistent with our obliga- tions and commitments to deter future bad behavior. The Administration will conduct inter- agency policy planning for the time periods leading up to, during, and after the imposition of consequences to ensure a timely and consistent process for responding to and deterring malicious cyber activities. The United States will work with partners when appropriate to impose consequences against malicious cyber actors in response to their activities against our nation and interests. BUILD A CYBER DETERRENCE INITIATIVE: The imposition of consequences will be more impactful and send a stronger message if it is carried out in concert with a broader coalition of like-minded states. The United States will launch an international Cyber Deterrence Initiative to build such a coalition and develop tailored strat- egies to ensure adversaries understand the conse- quences of their malicious cyber behavior. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attri- bution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors. COUNTER MALIGN CYBER INFLUENCE AND INFOR- MATION OPERATIONS: The United States will use all appropriate tools of national power to expose and counter the flood of online malign influence and information campaigns and non-state propa- ganda and disinformation. This includes working with foreign government partners as well as the private sector, academia, and civil society to identify, counter, and prevent the use of digital platforms for malign foreign influence opera- tions while respecting civil rights and liberties. 21 P I L L A R I I I : P R E S E R V E P E A C E T H R O U G H S T R E N G T H he world looks to the United States, where much of the innovation for today’s Internet originated, for leadership on a vast range of transnational cyber issues. The United States will maintain an active interna- tional leadership posture to advance American influence and to address an expanding array of threats and challenges to its interests in cyber- space. Collaboration with allies and partners is also essential to ensure we can continue to benefit from the cross-border communications, content creation, and commerce generated by the open, interoperable architecture of the Internet. OBJECTIVE: Preserve the long-term openness, interoperability, security, and reliability of the Internet, which supports and is reinforced by United States interests. Promote an Open, Interoperable, Reliable, and Secure Internet The global Internet has prompted some of the greatest advancements since the indus- trial revolution, enabling great advances in commerce, health, communications, and other national infrastructure. At the same time, centu- ries-old battles over human rights and funda- mental freedoms are now playing out online. Freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association, as well as privacy rights, are under threat. Despite unprecedented growth, the Inter- net’s economic and social potential continues to be undermined by online censorship and repression. The United States stands firm on its principles to protect and promote an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. We will work to ensure that our approach to an open Internet is the international standard. We will also work to prevent authoritarian states that view the open Internet as a political threat from transforming the free and open Internet into an authoritarian web under their control, under the guise of security or countering terrorism. Priority Actions PROTECT AND PROMOTE INTERNET FREEDOM: The United States Government conceptualizes Internet freedom as the online exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms — such as the freedoms of expression, association, peaceful assembly, religion or belief, and privacy rights online — regardless of frontiers or medium. By extension, Internet freedom also supports the free PILLAR IV Advance American Influence T 24 flow of information online that enhances interna- tional trade and commerce, fosters innovation, and strengthens both national and interna- tional security. As such, United States Internet freedom principles are inextricably linked to our national security. Internet freedom is also a key guiding principle with respect to other United States foreign policy issues, such as cybercrime and counterterrorism efforts. Given its impor- tance, the United States will encourage other countries to advance Internet freedom through venues such as the Freedom Online Coalition, of which the United States is a founding member. WORK WITH LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES, INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA, AND CIVIL SOCIETY: The United States will continue to work with like-minded countries, industry, civil society, and other stakeholders to advance human rights and Internet freedom globally and to counter author- itarian efforts to censor and influence Internet development. The United States Government will continue to support civil society through integrated support for technology development, digital safety training, policy advocacy, and research. These programs aim to enhance the ability of individual citizens, activists, human rights defenders, independent journalists, civil society organizations, and marginalized popula- tions to safely access the uncensored Internet and promote Internet freedom at the local, regional, national, and international levels. PROMOTE A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MODEL OF INTERNET GOVERNANCE: The United States will continue to actively participate in global efforts to ensure that the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance prevails against attempts to create state-centric frameworks that would undermine openness and freedom, hinder innovation, and jeopardize the functionality of the Internet. The multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance is characterized by trans- parent, bottom-up, consensus-driven processes and enables governments, the private sector, civil society, academia, and the technical community to participate on equal footing. The United States Government will defend the open, interoperable nature of the Internet in multilateral and inter- national fora through active engagement in key organizations, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Governance Forum, the United Nations, and the International Telecommunication Union. PROMOTE INTEROPERABLE AND RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY: The United States will promote communications infrastructure and Internet connectivity that is open, interop- erable, reliable, and secure. Such investment will provide greater opportunities for American firms to compete while countering the influence of statist, top-down government interventions in areas of strategic competition. It will also protect America’s security and commercial interests by strengthening United States indus- try’s competitive position in the global digital economy. The Administration will also support and promote open, industry-led standards activ- ities based on sound technological principles. PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN MARKETS FOR UNITED STATES INGENUITY WORLDWIDE: American innovators and security professionals have contributed significantly in designing products and services that improve our ability to commu- nicate and interact globally and that protect communications infrastructure, data, and devices worldwide. The United States will continue to promote markets for American ingenuity overseas, including for emerging technologies that can lower the cost of security. The United States will also advise on infrastructure deploy- 25 P I L L A R I V : A D V A N C E A M E R I C A N I N F L U E N C E N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y ments, innovation, risk management, policy, and standards to further the global Internet’s reach and to ensure interoperability, security, and stability. Finally, the United States will work with international partners, government, industry, civil society, technologists, and academics to improve the adoption and awareness of cyberse- curity best practices worldwide. Build International Cyber Capacity Capacity building equips partners to protect themselves and assist the United States in addressing threats that target mutual interests, while serving broader diplomatic, economic, and security goals. Through cyber capacity building initiatives, the United States builds strategic partnerships that promote cyberse- curity best practices through a common vision of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet that encourages investment and opens new economic markets. In addition, capacity building allows for additional opportunities to share cyber threat information, enabling the United States Government and our partners to better defend domestic critical infrastructure and global supply chains, as well as focus whole-of- government cyber engagements. Our leadership in building partner cybersecurity capacity is critical to maintaining American influence against global competitors. Building partner cyber capacity will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative. Priority Action ENHANCE CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS: Many United States allies and partners possess unique cyber capabilities that can complement our own. The United States will work to strengthen the capacity and interoperability of those allies and partners to improve our ability to optimize our combined skills, resources, capabil- ities, and perspectives against shared threats. Partners can also help detect, deter, and defeat those shared threats in cyberspace. In order for international partners to effectively protect their digital infrastructure and combat shared threats, while realizing the economic and social gains derived from the Internet and ICTs, the United States will continue to address the building blocks for organizing national efforts on cyber- security. We will also aggressively expand efforts to share automated and actionable cyber threat information, enhance cybersecurity coordi- nation, and promote analytical and technical exchanges. In addition, the United States will work to reduce the impact and influence of transnational cybercrime and terrorist activ- ities by partnering with and strengthening the security and law enforcement capabilities of our partners to build their cyber capacity. 26 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y 28 Notes 29 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S T R A T E G Y Notes",

Ensuring the security of cyberspace is fundamental to both endeavors.  Cyberspace is an integral component of all facets of American life, including our economy and  defense. Yet, our private and public entities still struggle to secure their systems, and adver- saries have increased the frequency and sophistication of their malicious cyber activities.  America created the Internet and shared it with the world. Now, we must make sure to secure  and preserve cyberspace for future generations.   In the last 18 months, my Administration has taken action to address cyber threats. We have  sanctioned malign cyber actors. We have indicted those that committed cybercrimes. We  have publicly attributed malicious activity to the adversaries responsible and released details  about the tools they employed. We have required departments and agencies to remove  software vulnerable to various security risks. We have taken action to hold department and  agency heads accountable for managing cybersecurity risks to the systems they control, while  empowering them to provide adequate security. In addition, last year, I signed Executive Order  13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The work  performed and reports created in response to that Executive Order laid the groundwork for this  National Cyber Strategy.  With the release of this National Cyber Strategy, the United States now has its first fully articu- lated cyber strategy in 15 years. This strategy explains how my Administration will:  • Defend the homeland by protecting networks, systems, functions, and data;   • Promote American prosperity by nurturing a secure, thriving digital economy and fostering  strong domestic innovation;  • Preserve peace and security by strengthening the ability of the United States — in concert  with allies and partners — to deter and, if necessary, punish those who use cyber tools for  malicious purposes; and  • Expand American influence abroad to extend the key tenets of an open, interoperable,  reliable, and secure Internet.

The rise of the Internet and the growing centrality  of cyberspace to all facets of the modern world  corresponded with the rise of the United States  as the world’s lone superpower.  For the past  quarter century, the ingenuity of the American  people drove the evolution of cyberspace, and  in turn, cyberspace has become fundamental  to American wealth creation and innovation.   Cyberspace is an inseparable component of  America’s financial, social, government, and  political life.  Meanwhile, Americans sometimes  took for granted that the supremacy of the  United States in the cyber domain would remain  unchallenged, and that America’s vision for an  open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet  would inevitably become a reality.  Americans  believed the growth of the Internet would carry  the universal aspirations for free expression and  individual liberty around the world.  Americans  assumed the opportunities to expand commu- nication, commerce, and free exchange of ideas   would be self-evident.  Large parts of the world  have embraced America’s vision of a shared and  open cyberspace for the mutual benefit of all.  Our competitors and adversaries, however,  have taken an opposite approach.  They benefit  from the open Internet, while constricting and  controlling their own people’s access to it, and  actively undermine the principles of an open  Internet in international forums.  They hide  behind notions of sovereignty while recklessly  violating the laws of other states by engaging in  pernicious economic espionage and malicious  cyber activities, causing significant economic  disruption and harm to individuals, commercial  and non-commercial interests, and governments  across the world.  They view cyberspace as an  arena where the United States’ overwhelming  military, economic, and political power could  be neutralized and where the United States  and its allies and partners are vulnerable.  Russia, Iran, and North Korea conducted reckless  cyber attacks that harmed American and inter-  1  Introduction  America’s prosperity and security depend on how we respond to the opportu- nities and challenges in cyberspace.  Critical infrastructure, national defense, and  the daily lives of Americans rely on computer-driven and interconnected infor- mation technologies.  As all facets of American life have become more dependent  on a secure cyberspace, new vulnerabilities have been revealed and new threats  continue to emerge.  Building on the National Security Strategy and the Admin- istration’s progress over its first 18 months, the National Cyber Strategy outlines  how the United States will ensure the American people continue to reap the  benefits of a secure cyberspace that reflects our principles, protects our security,  and promotes our prosperity.    national businesses and our allies and partners  without paying costs likely to deter future cyber  aggression.  China engaged in cyber-enabled  economic espionage and trillions of dollars of  intellectual property theft.  Non-state actors  — including terrorists and  criminals — exploited cyber- space to profit, recruit, propa- gandize, and attack the United  States and its allies and  partners, with their actions  often shielded by hostile  states.  Public and private  entities have struggled to  secure their systems as adversaries increase the  frequency and sophistication of their malicious  cyber activities.  Entities across the United  States have faced cybersecurity challenges  in effectively identifying, protecting, and  ensuring resilience of their networks, systems,  functions, and data as well as detecting,  responding to, and recovering from incidents.  The Way Forward New threats and a new era of strategic compe- tition demand a new cyber strategy that responds  to new realities, reduces vulnerabilities, deters  adversaries, and safeguards opportunities for  the American people to thrive.  Securing cyber- space is fundamental to our strategy and requires  technical advancements and administrative  efficiency across the Federal Government and  the private sector.  The Administration also  recognizes that a purely technocratic approach  to cyberspace is insufficient to address the  nature of the new problems we confront.  The  United States must also have policy choices  to impose costs if it hopes to deter malicious  cyber actors and prevent further escalation.  The Administration is already taking action to  aggressively address these threats and adjust to  new realities.  The United States has sanctioned  malign cyber actors and indicted those that  have committed cybercrimes.  We have publicly   attributed malicious activity to  the responsible adversaries and  released details of the tools and  infrastructure they employed.   We have required depart- ments and agencies to remove  software vulnerable to various  security risks.  We have taken  action to hold department   and agency heads accountable for managing the  cybersecurity risks to systems they control, while  empowering them to provide adequate security.  The Administration’s approach to cyberspace is  anchored by enduring American values, such as  the belief in the power of individual liberty, free  expression, free markets, and privacy.  We retain  our commitment to the promise of an open,  interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet to  strengthen and extend our values and protect and  ensure economic security for American workers  and companies.  The future we desire will not  come without a renewed American commitment  to advance our interests across cyberspace.  The Administration recognizes that the United  States is engaged in a continuous competition  against strategic adversaries, rogue states, and  terrorist and criminal networks.  Russia, China,  Iran, and North Korea all use cyberspace as a  means to challenge the United States, its allies,  and partners, often with a recklessness they would  never consider in other domains.  These adver- saries use cyber tools to undermine our economy  and democracy, steal our intellectual property,   2  I N T R O D U C T I O N  DONALD J .  TRUMP SEPTEMBER 2018  “We will  continue  to lead the world in  securing a prosperous cyber future.”    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  and sow discord in our democratic processes.  We  are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against  critical infrastructure, and the risk is growing  that these countries will conduct cyber attacks  against the United States during a crisis short  of war.  These adversaries are continually devel- oping new and more effective cyber weapons.  This National Cyber Strategy outlines how we will  (1) defend the homeland by protecting networks,  systems, functions, and data; (2) promote  American prosperity by nurturing a secure,  thriving digital economy and fostering strong  domestic innovation; (3) preserve peace and  security by strengthening the United States’ ability  — in concert with allies and partners — to deter  and if necessary punish those who use cyber tools  for malicious purposes; and (4) expand American  influence abroad to extend the key tenets of an  open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.  The Strategy’s success will be realized when  cybersecurity vulnerabilities are effectively  managed through identification and protection  of networks, systems, functions, and data as   well as detection of, resilience against, response  to, and recovery from incidents; destructive,  disruptive, or otherwise destabilizing malicious  cyber activities directed against United States  interests are reduced or prevented; activity that  is contrary to responsible behavior in cyber- space is deterred through the imposition of costs  through cyber and non-cyber means; and the  United States is positioned to use cyber capabil- ities to achieve national security objectives.  The articulation of the National Cyber Strategy  is organized according to the pillars of the  National Security Strategy.  The National Security  Council staff will coordinate with departments,  agencies, and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) on an appropriate resource  plan to implement this Strategy.  Depart- ments and agencies will execute their missions  informed by the following strategic guidance.  3      rotecting the American people, the      American way of life, and American                interests is at the forefront of the National  Security Strategy.  Protecting American infor- mation networks, whether government or  private, is vital to fulfilling this objective.  It will  require a series of coordinated actions focused  on protecting government networks, protecting  critical infrastructure, and combating cybercrime.   The United States Government, private industry,  and the public must each take immediate and  decisive actions to strengthen cybersecurity,  with each working on securing the networks  under their control and supporting each other as  appropriate.  OBJECTIVE:  Manage cybersecurity risks to  increase the security and resilience of the  Nation’s information and information systems.  Secure Federal Networks and  Information  The responsibility to secure Federal networks  — including Federal information systems and  national security systems — falls squarely on  the Federal Government.  The Administration  will clarify the relevant authorities, responsi-  bilities, and accountability within and across  departments and agencies for securing Federal  information systems, while setting the standard  for effective cybersecurity risk management.   As part of this effort, the Administration will  centralize some authorities within the Federal  Government, enable greater cross-agency  visibility, improve management of our Federal  supply chain, and strengthen the security of  United States Government contractor systems.  Priority Actions  FURTHER CENTRALIZE MANAGEMENT AND   OVERSIGHT OF FEDERAL CIVILIAN CYBERSECURITY:  The Administration will act to further enable the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to secure  Federal department and agency networks, with  the exception of national security systems and  Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence  Community (IC) systems.  This includes ensuring  DHS has appropriate access to agency infor- mation systems for cybersecurity purposes and  can take and direct action to safeguard systems  from the spectrum of risks.  Under the oversight of  the OMB, the Administration will expand on work  begun under Executive Order (E.O.) 13800 to prior- itize the transition of agencies to shared services   Protect the American People,  the Homeland, and the  American Way of Life  PILLAR I  P  6    and infrastructure.  DHS will have appropriate  visibility into those services and infrastructure  to improve United States cybersecurity posture.   We will continue to deploy centralized capabil- ities, tools, and services through DHS where  appropriate, and improve  oversight and compliance  with applicable laws,  policies, standards, and  directives.  This will likely  require new policies and  architectures that enable  the government to better leverage innovation.   DOD and the IC will consider these activities as they  work to better secure national security systems,  DOD systems, and IC systems, as appropriate.  ALIGN RISK MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION   TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITIES:  E.O. 13833, Enhancing  the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information  Officers, empowers Chief Information Officers  (CIOs) to more effectively leverage technology  to accomplish agency missions, cut down on  duplication, and make information technology  (IT) investment more efficient.  Department and  agency leaders will empower and hold their  CIOs accountable to align cybersecurity risk  management decisions and IT budgeting and  procurement decisions.  The Administration,  through OMB and DHS, will continue to guide and  direct risk management actions across Federal  civilian departments and agencies, and CIOs will  be empowered to take a proactive leadership role  in assuring IT procurement decisions assign the  proper priority to securing networks and data.    IMPROVE FEDERAL SUPPLY CHAIN RISK   MANAGEMENT: The Administration will integrate  supply chain risk management into agency  procurement and risk management processes  in accordance with federal requirements that  are consistent with industry best practices to   better ensure the technology that the Federal  Government deploys is secure and reliable.   This includes ensuring better information  sharing among departments and agencies to  improve awareness of supply chain threats   and reduce duplicative  supply chain activities  within the United States  Government, including by  creating a supply chain  risk assessment shared  service.  It also includes   addressing deficiencies in the Federal acqui- sition system, such as providing more stream- lined authorities to exclude risky vendors,  products, and services when justified.  This effort  will be synchronized with efforts to manage  supply chain risk in the Nation’s infrastructure.    STRENGTHEN FEDERAL CONTRACTOR CYBER-  SECURITY: The United States cannot afford  to have sensitive government information or  systems inadequately secured by contractors.   Federal contractors provide important services  to the United States Government and must  properly secure the systems through which  they provide those services.  Going forward,  the Federal Government will be able to assess  the security of its data by reviewing contractor  risk management practices and adequately  testing, hunting, sensoring, and responding  to incidents on contractor systems.  Contracts  with Federal departments and agencies will  be drafted to authorize such activities for the  purpose of improving cybersecurity.  Among the  acute concerns in this area are those contractors  within the defense industrial base responsible for  researching and developing key systems fielded  by the DOD.  Further, as recommended in the  E.O. 13800 Report to the President on Federal IT  Modernization, the Administration will support   7  P I L L A R  I :  P R O T E C T  T H E  A M E R I C A N  P E O P L E ,  T H E  H O M E L A N D ,  A N D  T H E  A M E R I C A N  W A Y  O F  L I F E    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  adoption of consolidated acquisition strategies  to improve cybersecurity and reduce overhead  costs associated with using inconsistent contract  provisions across the Federal Government.  It  will also act to ensure, where appropriate,  that Federal contractors receive and use all  relevant and shareable threat and vulnerability  information to improve their security posture.  ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT LEADS IN BEST AND   INNOVATIVE PRACTICES: The Federal Government  will ensure the systems it owns and operates  meet the standards and cybersecurity best  practices it recommends to industry.  Projects  that receive Federal funding must meet these  standards as well.  The Federal Government will  use its purchasing power to drive sector-wide  improvement in products and services.  The  Federal Government will also be a leader in  developing and implementing standards and  best practices in new and emerging areas.  For  example, public key cryptography is founda- tional to the secure operation of our infra- structure.  To protect against the potential  threat of quantum computers being able to  break modern public key cryptography, the  Department of Commerce, through the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),  will continue to solicit, evaluate, and standardize  quantum-resistant, public key cryptographic  algorithms.  The United States must be at the  forefront of protecting communications by  supporting rapid adoption of these forthcoming  NIST standards across government infrastructure  and by encouraging the Nation to do the same.    Secure Critical Infrastructure The responsibility to secure the Nation’s critical  infrastructure and manage its cybersecurity risk  is shared by the private sector and the Federal  Government.  In partnership with the private   sector, we will collectively use a risk-management  approach to mitigating vulnerabilities to raise the  base level of cybersecurity across critical infra- structure.  We will simultaneously use a conse- quence-driven approach to prioritize actions  that reduce the potential that the most advanced  adversaries could cause large-scale or long-du- ration disruptions to critical infrastructure.  We  will also deter malicious cyber actors by imposing  costs on them and their sponsors by leveraging a  range of tools, including but not limited to prose- cutions and economic sanctions, as part of a  broader deterrence strategy.  Priority Actions  REFINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: The Admin- istration will clarify the roles and responsibil- ities of Federal agencies and the expectations  on the private sector related to cybersecurity  risk management and incident response.  Clarity  will enable proactive risk management that  comprehensively addresses threats, vulnera- bilities, and consequences.  It will also identify  and bridge existing gaps in responsibilities and  coordination among Federal and non-Federal  incident response efforts and promote more  routine training, exercises, and coordination.   PRIORITIZE ACTIONS ACCORDING TO IDENTIFIED   NATIONAL RISKS: The Federal Government will  work with the private sector to manage risks to  critical infrastructure at the greatest risk.  The  Administration will develop a comprehensive  understanding of national risk by identifying  national critical functions and will mature  our cybersecurity offerings and engagements  to better manage those national risks.  The  Administration will prioritize risk-reduction  activities across seven key areas:  national  security, energy and power, banking and   8    finance, health and safety, communications,  information technology, and transportation.    LEVERAGE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS   TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS AS CYBERSECURITY   ENABLERS: Information and communications  technology (ICT) underlies every sector in  America.  ICT providers are in a unique position  to detect, prevent, and mitigate risk before  it impacts their customers, and the Federal  Government must work with these providers to  improve ICT security and resilience in a targeted  and efficient manner while protecting privacy  and civil liberties.  The United States Government  will strengthen efforts to share information with  ICT providers to enable them to respond to and  remediate known malicious cyber activity at the  network level.  This will include sharing classified  threat and vulnerability information with cleared  ICT operators and downgrading information to  the unclassified level as much as possible.  We will  promote an adaptable, sustainable, and secure  technology supply chain that supports security  based on best practices and standards.  The United  States Government will convene stakeholders  to devise cross-sector solutions to challenges  at the network, device, and gateway layers, and  we will encourage industry-driven certification  regimes that ensure solutions can adapt in a  rapidly evolving market and threat landscape.     PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY: Securing our  democratic processes is of paramount impor- tance to the United States and our democratic  allies.  State and local government officials own  and operate diverse election infrastructure within  the United States.  Therefore, when requested  we will provide technical and risk management  services, support training and exercising,  maintain situational awareness of threats to this  sector, and improve the sharing of threat intelli- gence with those officials to better prepare and   protect the election infrastructure.  The Federal  Government will continue to coordinate the  development of cybersecurity standards and  guidance to safeguard the electoral process and  the tools that deliver a secure system.  In the  event of a significant cyber incident, the Federal  Government is poised to provide threat and  asset response to recover election infrastructure.  INCENTIVIZE CYBERSECURITY INVESTMENTS: Most  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure stem  from the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.   The United States Government will work with  private and public sector entities to promote  understanding of cybersecurity risk so they make  more informed risk-management decisions,  invest in appropriate security measures, and  realize benefits from those investments.   PRIORITIZE NATIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVEL-  OPMENT INVESTMENTS: The Federal Government  will update the National Critical Infrastructure  Security and Resilience Research and Devel- opment Plan to set priorities for addressing cyber- security risks to critical infrastructure.  Depart- ments and agencies will align their investments  to the priorities, which will focus on building new  cybersecurity approaches that use emerging  technologies, improving information-sharing  and risk management related to cross-sector  interdependencies, and building resilience  to large-scale or long-duration disruptions.  IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION AND MARITIME CYBER-  SECURITY: America’s economic and national  security is built on global trade and transpor- tation.  Our ability to guarantee free and timely  movement of goods, open sea and air lines  of communications, access to oil and natural  gas, and availability of associated critical infra- structures is vital to our economic and national  security.  As these sectors have modernized,   9  P I L L A R  I :  P R O T E C T  T H E  A M E R I C A N  P E O P L E ,  T H E  H O M E L A N D ,  A N D  T H E  A M E R I C A N  W A Y  O F  L I F E    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  they have also become more vulnerable to cyber  exploitation or attack.  Maritime cybersecurity  is of particular concern because lost or delayed  shipments can result in strategic economic  disruptions and potential spillover effects on  downstream industries.  Given the criticality of  maritime transportation to the United States and  global economy and the minimal risk-reduction  investments to protect against cyber exploitation  made thus far, the United States will move  quickly to clarify maritime cybersecurity roles  and responsibilities; promote enhanced mecha- nisms for international coordination and infor- mation sharing; and accelerate the development  of next-generation cyber-resilient maritime  infrastructure.  The United States will assure the  uninterrupted transport of goods in the face of  all threats that can hold this inherently interna- tional infrastructure at risk through cyber means.   IMPROVE SPACE CYBERSECURITY: The United  States considers unfettered access to and  freedom to operate in space vital to advancing  the security, economic prosperity, and scientific  knowledge of the Nation.  The Administration  is concerned about the growing cyber-related  threats to space assets and supporting infra- structure because these assets are critical to  functions such as positioning, navigation, and  timing (PNT); intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance (ISR); satellite communications;  and weather monitoring.  The Administration  will enhance efforts to protect our space assets  and support infrastructure from evolving cyber  threats, and we will work with industry and  international partners to strengthen the cyber  resilience of existing and future space systems.  Combat Cybercrime and  Improve Incident Reporting Federal departments and agencies, in cooper-  ation with state, local, tribal, and territorial  government entities, play a critical role in  detecting, preventing, disrupting, and investi- gating cyber threats to our Nation.  The United  States is regularly the victim of malicious cyber  activity perpetrated by criminal actors, including  state and non-state actors and their proxies  and terrorists using network infrastructure  in the United States and abroad.  Federal law  enforcement works to apprehend and prosecute  offenders, disable criminal infrastructure, limit  the spread and use of nefarious cyber capabil- ities, prevent cyber criminals and their state  sponsors from profiting from their illicit activity,  and seize their assets.  The Administration will  push to ensure that our Federal departments  and agencies have the necessary legal author- ities and resources to combat transnational  cybercriminal activity, including identifying and  dismantling botnets, dark markets, and other  infrastructure used to enable cybercrime, and  combatting economic espionage.  To effectively  deter, disrupt, and prevent cyber threats, law  enforcement will work with private industry to  confront challenges presented by technological  barriers, such as anonymization and encryption  technologies, to obtain time-sensitive evidence  pursuant to appropriate legal process.  Law  enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber  activity serve as an instrument of national power  by, among other things, deterring those activities.       Priority Actions  IMPROVE INCIDENT REPORTING AND RESPONSE:   The United States Government will continue  to encourage reporting of intrusions and theft  of data by all victims, especially critical infra- structure partners.  The prompt reporting of  cyber incidents to the Federal Government is  essential to an effective response, linking of   10    related incidents, identification of the perpe- trators, and prevention of future incidents.  MODERNIZE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND   COMPUTER CRIME LAWS: The Administration will  work with the Congress to update electronic  surveillance and computer crime statutes to  enhance law enforcement’s capabilities to  lawfully gather necessary evidence of criminal  activity, disrupt criminal infrastructure through  civil injunctions, and impose appropriate  consequences upon malicious cyber actors.    REDUCE THREATS FROM TRANSNATIONAL   CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS IN CYBERSPACE:  Computer hacking conducted by transnational  criminal groups poses a significant threat to our  national security.  Equipped with sizeable funds,  organized criminal groups operating abroad  employ sophisticated malicious software, spear- phishing campaigns, and other hacking tools  — some of which rival those of nation states in  sophistication — to hack into sensitive financial  systems, conduct massive data breaches, spread  ransomware, attack critical infrastructure, and  steal intellectual property.  The Administration  will advocate for law enforcement to have  effective legal tools to investigate and prosecute  such groups and modernized organized crime  statutes for use against this threat.   IMPROVE APPREHENSION OF CRIMINALS LOCATED   ABROAD: Deterring cybercrime requires a credible  threat that perpetrators will be identified, appre- hended, and brought to justice.  However, some  foreign nations choose not to cooperate with  extradition requests, impose unreasonable  limitations, or actively interfere in these efforts.   The United States will continue to identify gaps  and potential mechanisms for bringing foreign- based cyber criminals to justice.  The United  States Government will also increase diplomatic   and other efforts with countries to promote  cooperation with legitimate extradition requests.   We will push other nations to expedite their assis- tance in investigations and to comply with any  bilateral or multilateral agreements or obligations.    STRENGTHEN PARTNER NATIONS’ LAW   ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY TO COMBAT CRIMINAL   CYBER ACTIVITY: The United States should also  aid willing partner nations to build their capacity  to address criminal cyber activity.  The borderless  nature of cybercrime, including state-sponsored  and terrorist activities, requires strong inter- national law enforcement partnerships.  This  cooperation requires foreign law enforcement  agencies to have the technical capability to  assist United States law enforcement effectively  when requested.  It is therefore in the interest of  United States national security to continue  building cybercrime-fighting capacity that  facilitates stronger international law  enforcement cooperation.  The United States will strive to improve inter- national cooperation in investigating malicious  cyber activity, including developing solutions  to potential barriers to gathering and sharing  evidence.  The United States will also lead  in developing interoperable and mutually  beneficial systems to encourage efficient  cross-border information exchange for law  enforcement purposes and reduce barriers  to coordination.  The Administration will urge  effective use of existing international tools like  the United Nations Convention Against Trans- national Organized Crime and the G7 24/7  Network Points of Contact.  Finally, we will work  to expand the international consensus favoring  the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council  of Europe (Budapest Convention), including by  supporting greater adoption of the convention.   11  P I L L A R  I :  P R O T E C T  T H E  A M E R I C A N  P E O P L E ,  T H E  H O M E L A N D ,  A N D  T H E  A M E R I C A N  W A Y  O F  L I F E        he Internet has generated tremendous        benefits domestically and abroad, and       it helps to advance American values  of freedom, security, and prosperity.  Along  with its expansion have come challenges that  threaten our national security.  The United  States will demonstrate a coherent and compre- hensive approach to address these and other  challenges to defend American national  interests in this increasingly digitized world.    OBJECTIVE:  Preserve United States influence  in the technological ecosystem and the devel- opment of cyberspace as an open engine of  economic growth, innovation, and efficiency.  Foster a Vibrant and  Resilient Digital Economy  Economic security is inherently tied to our  national security.  As the foundations of our  economy are becoming increasingly rooted  in digital technologies, the United States  Government will model and promote standards  that protect our economic security and reinforce  the vitality of the American marketplace and  American innovation.    Priority Actions  INCENTIVIZE AN ADAPTABLE AND SECURE   TECHNOLOGY MARKETPLACE: To enhance the resil- ience of cyberspace, the Administration expects  the technology marketplace to support and  reward the continuous development, adoption,  and evolution of innovative security technologies  and processes.  The Administration will work  across stakeholder groups, including the private  sector and civil society, to promote best practices  and develop strategies to overcome market  barriers to the adoption of secure technologies.   The Administration will improve awareness and  transparency of cybersecurity practices to build  market demand for more secure products and  services.  Finally, the Administration will collab- orate with international partners to promote  open, industry-driven standards with government  support, as appropriate, and risk-based  approaches to address cybersecurity challenges  to include platform and managed service  approaches that lower barriers to secure practice  adoption across the breadth of the ecosystem.   PRIORITIZE INNOVATION: The United States  Government will promote implementation and   Promote American Prosperity  PILLAR II  T  14    continuous updating of standards and best  practices that deter and prevent current and  evolving threats and hazards in all domains  of the cyber ecosystem.  These standards  and practices should be outcome-oriented  and based on sound technological principles  rather than point-in-time company specifica- tions.  The Administration will eliminate policy  barriers that inhibit a robust cybersecurity  industry from developing, sharing, and building  innovative capabilities to reduce cyber threats.   INVEST IN NEXT GENERATION INFRASTRUCTURE:   The Administration will facilitate the accelerated  development and rollout of next-generation  telecommunications and information communi- cations infrastructure here in the United States,  while using the buying power of the Federal  Government to incentivize the  move towards more secure  supply chains.  The United  States Government will work  with the private sector to facil- itate the evolution and security  of 5G, examine technological  and spectrum-based solutions,  and lay the groundwork for innovation beyond  next-generation advancements.  The United  States Government will examine the use of  emerging technologies, such as artificial intelli- gence and quantum computing, while addressing  risks inherent in their use and application.  We  will collaborate with the private sector and civil  society to understand trends in technology  advancement to maintain the United States  technological edge in connected technologies  and to ensure secure practices are adopted from  the outset.  PROMOTE THE FREE FLOW OF DATA ACROSS   BORDERS: Countries are increasingly looking  towards restrictive data localization and regula-  tions as pretexts for digital protectionism under  the rubric of national security.  Those actions  negatively impact the competitiveness of United  States companies.  The United States will continue  to lead by example and push back against unjus- tifiable barriers to the free flow of data and digital  trade.  The Administration will continue to work  with international counterparts to promote open,  industry driven standards, innovative products,  and risk-based approaches that permit global  innovation and the free flow of data while meeting  the legitimate security needs of the United States.     MAINTAIN UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP IN   EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: The United States’  influence in cyberspace is linked to our techno- logical leadership.  Accordingly, the United States  Government will make a concerted effort to   protect cutting edge technol- ogies, including from theft by  our adversaries, support those  technologies’ maturation, and,  where possible, reduce United  States companies’ barriers  to market entry.  The United  States will promote United   States cybersecurity innovation worldwide  through trade-related engagement, raising  awareness of innovative American cybersecurity  tools and services, exposing and countering  repressive regimes use of such tools and services  to undermine human rights, and reducing  barriers to a robust global cybersecurity market.     PROMOTE FULL-LIFECYCLE CYBERSECURITY:  The  United States Government will promote full-life- cycle cybersecurity, pressing for strong, default  security settings, adaptable, upgradeable  products, and other best practices built in at  the time of product delivery.  We will identify a  clear pathway toward an adaptable, sustainable,  and secure technology marketplace, encour-  15  DONALD J .  TRUMP SEPTEMBER 2018  “The National Cyber Strategy is a call to action for all  Americans and our great companies to take the  necessary steps to enhance our national cybersecurity.”  P I L L A R  I I :  P R O M O T E  A M E R I C A N  P R O S P E R I T Y    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  aging manufacturers to differentiate products  based on the quality of their security features.   The United States Government will promote  foundational engineering practices to reduce  systemic fragility and develop designs that  degrade and recover effectively when success- fully attacked.  The United States Government  will also promote regular testing and exercising  of the cybersecurity and resilience of products  and systems during development using best  practices from forward-leaning industries.  This  includes promotion and use of coordinated  vulnerability disclosure, crowd-sourced testing,  and other innovative assessments that improve  resiliency ahead of exploitation or attack.  The  United States Government will also evaluate how  to improve the end-to-end lifecycle for digital  identity management, including over-reliance on  Social Security numbers.  Foster and Protect United  States Ingenuity Fostering and protecting American invention and  innovation is critical to maintaining the United  States’ strategic advantage in cyberspace.  The  United States Government will nurture innovation  by promoting institutions and programs that  drive United States competitiveness.  The United  States Government will counter predatory  mergers and acquisitions and counter intellectual  property theft.  We will also catalyze United States  leadership in emerging technologies and promote  government identification and support to these  technologies, which include artificial intelligence,  quantum information science, and next-gener- ation telecommunication infrastructure.  Priority Actions UPDATE MECHANISMS TO REVIEW FOREIGN   INVESTMENT AND OPERATION IN THE UNITED   STATES: The confidentiality, integrity, and   availability of United States telecommunica- tions networks are essential to our economy  and national security.  We must be vigilant to  safeguard the telecommunications networks we  depend on in our everyday lives so they cannot  be used or compromised by a foreign adversary  to harm the United States.  The United States  Government will balance these objectives by  formalizing and streamlining the review of  Federal Communications Commission referrals  for telecommunications licenses.  The United  States Government will facilitate a transparent  process to increase the efficiency of this review.  MAINTAIN A STRONG AND BALANCED INTELLECTUAL   PROPERTY PROTECTION SYSTEM: Strong intel- lectual property protections ensure continued  economic growth and innovation in the digital  age.  The United States Government has fostered  and will continue to help foster a global intel- lectual property rights system that provides  incentives for innovation through the protection  and enforcement of intellectual property rights  such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.   The United States Government will also promote  protection of sensitive emerging technologies  and trade secrets, and we will work to prevent  adversarial nation states from gaining unfair  advantage at the expense of American research  and development.  PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY   OF AMERICAN IDEAS: For more than a decade,  malicious actors have conducted cyber intru- sions into United States commercial networks,  targeting confidential business information  held by American firms.  Malicious cyber actors  from other nations have stolen troves of trade  secrets, technical data, and sensitive proprietary  internal communications.  The United States  Government will work against the illicit appro-  16    priation of public and private sector technology  and technical knowledge by foreign competitors,  while maintaining an investor-friendly climate.    Develop a Superior  Cybersecurity Workforce  A highly skilled cybersecurity workforce is a  strategic national security advantage.  The United  States will fully develop the vast American talent  pool, while at the same time attracting the best  and brightest among those abroad who share our  values.   Priority Actions  BUILD AND SUSTAIN THE TALENT PIPELINE:  Our peer competitors are implementing  workforce development programs that have  the potential to harm long-term United States  cybersecurity competitiveness.  The United  States Government will continue to invest in  and enhance programs that build the domestic  talent pipeline, from primary through postsec- ondary education.  The Administration will  leverage the President’s proposed merit-based  immigration reforms to ensure that the United  States has the most competitive technology  sector.  This effort may require additional  legislation to achieve the sought after goals.  EXPAND RE-SKILLING AND EDUCATIONAL OPPOR-  TUNITIES FOR AMERICA’S WORKERS: The Admin- istration will work with the Congress to promote  and reinvigorate educational and training  opportunities to develop a robust cybersecurity  workforce.  This includes expanding Federal  recruitment, training, re-skilling people from a  broad range of backgrounds, and giving them   opportunities to re-train into cybersecurity  careers.    ENHANCE THE FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY   WORKFORCE: To improve recruitment and  retention of highly qualified cybersecurity profes- sionals to the Federal Government, the Adminis- tration will continue to use the National Initiative  for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework  to support policies allowing for a standardized  approach for identifying, hiring, developing, and  retaining a talented cybersecurity workforce.   Additionally, the Administration will explore  appropriate options to establish distributed  cybersecurity personnel under the management  of DHS to oversee the development, management,  and deployment of cybersecurity personnel  across Federal departments and agencies with  the exception of DOD and the IC.  The Admin- istration will promote appropriate financial  compensation for the United States Government  workforce, as well as unique training and opera- tional opportunities to effectively recruit and  retain critical cybersecurity talent in light of the  competitive private sector environment.  USE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO HIGHLIGHT   AND REWARD TALENT:  The United States  Government will promote and magnify excel- lence by highlighting cybersecurity educators  and cybersecurity professionals.  The United  States Government will also leverage public- private collaboration to develop and circulate  the NICE Framework, which provides a  standardized approach for identifying cyber- security workforce gaps, while also imple- menting actions to prepare, grow, and sustain a  workforce that can defend and bolster America’s  critical infrastructure and innovation base.  17  P I L L A R  I I :  P R O M O T E  A M E R I C A N  P R O S P E R I T Y        hallenges to United States security and        economic interests, from nation states      and other groups, which have long  existed in the offline world are now increasingly  occurring in cyberspace.  This now-persistent  engagement in cyberspace is already altering the  strategic balance of power.  This Administration  will issue transformative policies that reflect  today’s new reality and guide the United States  Government towards strategic outcomes that  protect the American people and our way of life.   Cyberspace will no longer be treated as a separate  category of policy or activity disjointed from  other elements of national power.  The United  States will integrate the employment of cyber  options across every element of national power.    OBJECTIVE:  Identify, counter, disrupt, degrade,  and deter behavior in cyberspace that is desta- bilizing and contrary to national interests, while  preserving United States overmatch in and  through cyberspace.  Enhance Cyber Stability  through Norms of Responsible  State Behavior  The United States will promote a framework of   responsible state behavior in cyberspace built  upon international law, adherence to voluntary  non-binding norms of responsible state behavior  that apply during peacetime, and the consider- ation of practical confidence building measures  to reduce the risk of conflict stemming from  malicious cyber activity.  These principles should  form a basis for cooperative responses to counter  irresponsible state actions inconsistent with this  framework.    Priority Action  ENCOURAGE UNIVERSAL ADHERENCE TO CYBER   NORMS: International law and voluntary  non-binding norms of responsible state behavior  in cyberspace provide stabilizing, security-en- hancing  standards that define acceptable   behavior to all states and promote greater  predictability and stability in cyberspace.  The  United States will encourage other nations  to publicly affirm these principles and views  through enhanced outreach and engagement  in multilateral fora.  Increased public affir- mation by the United States and other govern- ments will lead to accepted expectations of  state behavior and thus contribute to greater  predictability and stability in cyberspace.  Preserve Peace through Strength  PILLAR III  C  20    Attribute and Deter  Unacceptable Behavior  in Cyberspace  As the United States continues to promote  consensus on what constitutes responsible state  behavior in cyberspace, we must also work to  ensure that there are consequences for irrespon- sible behavior that harms the United States and  our partners.  All instruments of national power  are available to prevent, respond to, and deter  malicious cyber activity against the United States.   This includes diplomatic, information, military  (both kinetic and cyber), financial, intelligence,  public attribution, and law enforcement capabil- ities.  The United States will formalize and make  routine how we work with like-minded partners to  attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with  integrated strategies that impose swift, costly,  and transparent consequences when malicious  actors harm the United States or our partners.      Priority Actions  LEAD WITH OBJECTIVE, COLLABORATIVE INTELLI-  GENCE: The IC will continue to lead the world in  the use of all-source cyber intelligence to drive  the identification and attribution of malicious  cyber activity that threatens United States  national interests.  Objective and actionable  intelligence will be shared across the United  States Government and with key partners  to identify hostile foreign nation states, and  non-nation state cyber programs, intentions,  capabilities, research and development efforts,  tactics, and operational activities that will  inform whole-of-government responses to  protect American interests at home and abroad.  IMPOSE CONSEQUENCES: The United States will  develop swift and transparent consequences,   which we will impose consistent with our obliga- tions and commitments to deter future bad  behavior.  The Administration will conduct inter- agency policy planning for the time periods  leading up to, during, and after the imposition of  consequences to ensure a timely and consistent  process for responding to and deterring malicious  cyber activities.  The United States will work  with partners when appropriate to impose  consequences against malicious cyber actors in  response to their activities against our nation and  interests.     BUILD A CYBER DETERRENCE INITIATIVE: The  imposition of consequences will be more  impactful and send a stronger message if it is  carried out in concert with a broader coalition of  like-minded states.  The United States will launch  an international Cyber Deterrence Initiative to  build such a coalition and develop tailored strat- egies to ensure adversaries understand the conse- quences of their malicious cyber behavior.  The  United States will work with like-minded states  to coordinate and support each other’s responses  to significant malicious cyber incidents, including  through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attri- bution claims, public statements of support for  responsive actions taken, and joint imposition  of consequences against malign actors.    COUNTER MALIGN CYBER INFLUENCE AND INFOR-  MATION OPERATIONS: The United States will use  all appropriate tools of national power to expose  and counter the flood of online malign influence  and information campaigns and non-state propa- ganda and disinformation.  This includes working  with foreign government partners as well as the  private sector, academia, and civil society to  identify, counter, and prevent the use of digital  platforms for malign foreign influence opera- tions while respecting civil rights and liberties.  21  P I L L A R  I I I :  P R E S E R V E  P E A C E  T H R O U G H  S T R E N G T H        he world looks to the United States,              where much of the innovation for today’s         Internet originated, for leadership on a  vast range of transnational cyber issues.  The  United States will maintain an active interna- tional leadership posture to advance American  influence and to address an expanding array of  threats and challenges to its interests in cyber- space.  Collaboration with allies and partners  is also essential to ensure we can continue to  benefit from the cross-border communications,  content creation, and commerce generated by the  open, interoperable architecture of the Internet.  OBJECTIVE:  Preserve the long-term openness,  interoperability, security, and reliability of the  Internet, which supports and is reinforced by  United States interests.   Promote an Open,  Interoperable, Reliable, and  Secure Internet  The global Internet has prompted some of  the greatest advancements since the indus- trial revolution, enabling great advances in  commerce, health, communications, and other  national infrastructure.  At the same time, centu-  ries-old battles over human rights and funda- mental freedoms are now playing out online.   Freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and  association, as well as privacy rights, are under  threat.  Despite unprecedented growth, the Inter- net’s economic and social potential continues  to be undermined by online censorship and  repression.  The United States stands firm on  its principles to protect and promote an open,  interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.  We  will work to ensure that our approach to an open  Internet is the international standard.  We will  also work to prevent authoritarian states that  view the open Internet as a political threat from  transforming the free and open Internet into an  authoritarian web under their control, under  the guise of security or countering terrorism.   Priority Actions  PROTECT AND PROMOTE INTERNET FREEDOM:    The United States Government conceptualizes  Internet freedom as the online exercise of human  rights and fundamental freedoms — such as the  freedoms of expression, association, peaceful  assembly, religion or belief, and privacy rights  online — regardless of frontiers or medium.  By  extension, Internet freedom also supports the free   PILLAR IV  Advance American  Influence  T  24    flow of information online that enhances interna- tional trade and commerce, fosters innovation,  and strengthens both national and interna- tional security.  As such, United States Internet  freedom principles are inextricably linked to our  national security.  Internet freedom is also a key  guiding principle with respect to other United  States foreign policy issues, such as cybercrime  and counterterrorism efforts.  Given its impor- tance, the United States will encourage other  countries to advance Internet freedom through  venues such as the Freedom Online Coalition, of  which the United States is a founding member.    WORK WITH LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES, INDUSTRY,   ACADEMIA, AND CIVIL SOCIETY: The United  States will continue to work with like-minded  countries, industry, civil society, and other  stakeholders to advance human rights and  Internet freedom globally and to counter author- itarian efforts to censor and influence Internet  development.  The United States Government  will continue to support civil society through  integrated support for technology development,  digital safety training, policy advocacy, and  research.  These programs aim to enhance the  ability of individual citizens, activists, human  rights defenders, independent journalists, civil  society organizations, and marginalized popula- tions to safely access the uncensored Internet  and promote Internet freedom at the local,  regional, national, and international levels.    PROMOTE A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MODEL OF   INTERNET GOVERNANCE: The United States will  continue to actively participate in global efforts  to ensure that the multi-stakeholder model of  Internet governance prevails against attempts  to create state-centric frameworks that would  undermine openness and freedom, hinder  innovation, and jeopardize the functionality of  the Internet.  The multi-stakeholder model of   Internet governance is characterized by trans- parent, bottom-up, consensus-driven processes  and enables governments, the private sector, civil  society, academia, and the technical community  to participate on equal footing.  The United States  Government will defend the open, interoperable  nature of the Internet in multilateral and inter- national fora through active engagement in key  organizations, such as the Internet Corporation  for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet  Governance Forum, the United Nations, and  the International Telecommunication Union.  PROMOTE INTEROPERABLE AND RELIABLE   COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND   INTERNET CONNECTIVITY: The United States  will promote communications infrastructure  and Internet connectivity that is open, interop- erable, reliable, and secure.  Such investment  will provide greater opportunities for American  firms to compete while countering the influence  of statist, top-down government interventions  in areas of strategic competition.  It will also  protect America’s security and commercial  interests by strengthening United States indus- try’s competitive position in the global digital  economy.  The Administration will also support  and promote open, industry-led standards activ- ities based on sound technological principles.  PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN MARKETS FOR   UNITED STATES INGENUITY WORLDWIDE: American  innovators and security professionals have  contributed significantly in designing products  and services that improve our ability to commu- nicate and interact globally and that protect  communications infrastructure, data, and devices  worldwide.  The United States will continue  to promote markets for American ingenuity  overseas, including for emerging technologies  that can lower the cost of security.  The United  States will also advise on infrastructure deploy-  25  P I L L A R  I V :  A D V A N C E  A M E R I C A N  I N F L U E N C E    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  ments, innovation, risk management, policy, and  standards to further the global Internet’s reach  and to ensure interoperability, security, and  stability.  Finally, the United States will work with  international partners, government, industry,  civil society, technologists, and academics to  improve the adoption and awareness of cyberse- curity best practices worldwide.    Build International  Cyber Capacity  Capacity building equips partners to protect  themselves and assist the United States in  addressing threats that target mutual interests,  while serving broader diplomatic, economic,  and security goals.  Through cyber capacity  building initiatives, the United States builds  strategic partnerships that promote cyberse- curity best practices through a common vision  of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure  Internet that encourages investment and opens  new economic markets.  In addition, capacity  building allows for additional opportunities to  share cyber threat information, enabling the  United States Government and our partners to  better defend domestic critical infrastructure and  global supply chains, as well as focus whole-of- government cyber engagements.  Our leadership  in building partner cybersecurity capacity  is critical to maintaining American influence  against global competitors.  Building partner  cyber capacity will empower international   partners to implement policies and practices  which allow them to be effective partners in the  United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative.   Priority Action  ENHANCE CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS:    Many United States allies and partners possess  unique cyber capabilities that can complement  our own.  The United States will work to  strengthen the capacity and interoperability of  those allies and partners to improve our ability to  optimize our combined skills, resources, capabil- ities, and perspectives against shared threats.   Partners can also help detect, deter, and defeat  those shared threats in cyberspace.  In order for  international partners to effectively protect their  digital infrastructure and combat shared threats,  while realizing the economic and social gains  derived from the Internet and ICTs, the United  States will continue to address the building  blocks for organizing national efforts on cyber- security.  We will also aggressively expand efforts  to share automated and actionable cyber threat  information, enhance cybersecurity coordi- nation, and promote analytical and technical  exchanges.  In addition, the United States will  work to reduce the impact and influence of  transnational cybercrime and terrorist activ- ities by partnering with and strengthening  the security and law enforcement capabilities  of our partners to build their cyber capacity.  26      N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  28  Notes    29  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S T R A T E G Y  Notes",

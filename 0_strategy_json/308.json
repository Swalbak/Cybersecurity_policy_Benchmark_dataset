With regard to information security, the Strategy is harmonised with the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), which provides for the adoption of a national Information Security Strategy setting out the strategic objectives and priorities with regard to network and information security. The importance of information society development was recognised in the Republic of Serbia more than a decade ago, when the first Information Society Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia by 2020 was passed (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 5/10, hereinafter referred to as the “Information Society Development Strategy), which covered all priority areas contributing to the development of information society, including: electronic communications, e-government, e-health and e-justice, ICT in education, science and culture, e- commerce, the ICT business sector, information security. Information security, which was addressed as a topic in the Information Society Development Strategy, has gained prominence in recent years, as the use of new technologies gave rise and continues to contribute to the ensuing risks. Accordingly, in 2017the Government adopted the Information Security Development Strategy for the period 2017-2020 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 53/17, hereinafter referred to as the “Information Security Development Strategy”), which set forth the principles of information security, the priority areas and the strategic objectives with regard to the safety of citizens, the economy and the state. As these Strategies expired in 2020, the development of the next Draft of the Strategy for the period 2021-2026 commenced pursuant to an initiative of the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications. The new Strategy was intended to address both information society and information security, with a view to ensuring continuity in their development and adapting to the new circumstances stemming from rapid digitalisation and development of new technologies across all segments of the society. Members of the following institutions took part in the development of the Strategy: the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, the Ministry of Culture and Media, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign 2 Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self- Government, the IT and e-Government Office and the Public Policy Secretariat.

This background section draws on the following sources: - Publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of Information and Communication Technologies in Serbia, 2020;1 - Publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of Information and Communication Technologies in Serbia, 2019;2 - Cybersecurity Capacity Review Serbia by the World Bank and the Global Centre for Capacity Building, based on the Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM) Assessment; - A questionnaire of the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications sent to all ministries, which included questions concerning electronic communications, e- services, application of the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions and projects in the field of digitalisation. - E-Bulletin, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, Electronic Communications and Information Society Association. - Development of the Information Technology Industry, August 2019; Milovan Matijević, Mineco Computers. 1 Upotreba informaciono-komunikacionih tehnologija u Srbiji, 2020, Republički zavod za statistiku 2 Upotreba informaciono-komunikacionih tehnologija u Srbiji, 2019, Republički zavod za statistiku 6 - UNOPS project “Assessment of the cyber security ecosystem in the Republic of Serbia” 1.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY The Information Society Development Strategy adopted in 2010 aimed at developing an information society focused on harnessing the potential of information and communication technologies (hereinafter referred to as “ICT”) for increased work efficiency, economic growth, higher employment and improved quality of life for all citizens of the Republic of Serbia. It identified the following as the drivers of information society development: - Open, universally accessible and high-quality Internet access; - Developed e-transactions, including: e-government, e-commerce, e-justice, e-health and е-education. In addition to the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, implementing bodies for that Strategy were: the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Culture and Media, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Interior, the IT and e-Government Office, the National Bank of Serbia, the Academic Network of the Republic of Serbia and Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia. Implementation of the Information Society Development Strategy through the Action Plan for the period 2018-2019 achieved the following results: 1) The area of e-government, e-health and e-justice: - Laws and secondary legislation adopted in the field of e-Government and electronic documents, electronic identification and trust services; - Improved functionalities, services and service gateway of the e-Government Portal; - Improved Health Information System; - A system for electronic data exchange in the judiciary and between the judiciary and other government authorities. 2) ICT in education, science and culture: - Improved ICT infrastructure in primary and secondary schools; - Improved ICT competences of teachers and employees in public administration; - Raised awareness of children, parents and teachers in the field of online safety for children; - Improved digital services in the field of culture; - Improved e-Education services; - Introduction of information technology and computer science in primary schools. 3) e-commerce: - Legislation in the field of e-commerce adopted; - A public list of qualified trust services formed and published; - Instant payment system – IPS NBS system. 7 An analysis of the implemented Action Plan seems to indicate that progress has been made in these three key areas, primarily with regard to e-government. Prerequisites have been established for future development of this field through the passing of relevant legislation, including the Law on e-Government and the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions, together with the accompanying secondary legislation. These laws introduce legal concepts which will facilitate future development of e-government and e- transactions. Furthermore, in the field of health care and the judiciary, information systems have been developed to expedite the work processes, facilitate data exchange and cut red tape expenses. A major achievement is the improvement of ICT infrastructure in the field of education, specifically in primary and secondary schools, as well as in the fields of science and culture, as a precondition for modernisation of education processes through the employment of new technologies which will drive the development of digital services. In the field of e-commerce, normative obstacles to the development of e-commerce have been eliminated through legislative amendments, followed by activities to raise awareness, educate on and promote e-commerce to ensure its further progress. While improvements in the field of information society have been notable, future efforts in this field will have to be stepped up, especially with regard to further improvement of infrastructure, development of electronic services and raising citizens’ awareness and digital skill levels. 1.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY The Information Security Development Strategy adopted in 2017 aimed to develop and improve information security in the Republic of Serbia and maintain an appropriate level of standards in this field through increased security of information and communication systems, fight against cybercrime and improvement of information security of national importance. Implementation of the Information Security Development Strategy through the relevant Action Plan for 2018-2019 achieved the following results: 1) Area – safety of information and communication systems - A data exchange system for incident reporting and response established; - Information security staff recruited and trained; - Awareness-raising campaign on risks and incident response implemented; - Annual analysis of the National CERT on cyberspace threats in the Republic of Serbia conducted. 2) Area – safety of citizens when using technology - Activities of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for Children conducted, annual IT Caravan campaigns, ICT Girls’ Day, Digital Class and other similar activities implemented - The Law on Personal Data Protection passed; 3) Area – fight against cybercrime: - Judges and public prosecutors trained on acting in cybercrime cases 8 4) Area - information security of the Republic of Serbia: - Information security system relevant for national security defined; - CERTs for independent ICT system operators established. The development of information security gained momentum with the passing of the Law on Information Security, which introduced, first and foremost, the main institutional prerequisites for the development of this field, as well as other prerequisites for a country to establish sound information security arrangements. A key achievement of Action Plan implementation is certainly the establishment of an incident reporting and response data exchange system, as a mechanism to monitor the state of play in this field. As awareness raising and improved knowledge of information security, coupled with capacity building of the relevant staff, were identified as paramount, numerous activities have taken place (including seminars, conferences, trainings and panels) to raise awareness of incident risks and incident responses. Major progress has been achieved with regard to information security of children through the operation of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for Children. Implementation of activities under the Action Plan marked the beginning of efforts to build the capacities of ICT systems of special importance, although it should be noted that there is much room for improvement in this regard, which will require investment in infrastructure, staff capacity building and improving the level of knowledge in this field. Based on the implementation of these Strategies in recent years, the activities and measures foreseen therein have been identified as appropriate and it is therefore recommended that the current Strategy build on them and continue with the same efforts towards achieving the stated objectives. 1.3 USAGE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA Details of the use of ICT in the Republic of Serbia, as the fundamental indicators of information society development, are provided in the publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia entitled Usage of Information and Communication Technologies in Serbia, 2020. 1.3.1 Computer Use Computer use by households – Based on the main findings of this survey, 74.3% of households in the Republic of Serbia own a computer, which is an increase of 1.2% relative to 2019 and 2.2% relative to 2018.

It is claimed that 1,415,000 persons use a public administration website/application to obtain information. As part of the SORS survey, the section “Use of e-Government” provides data on e- government services, with an overview of e-government services used by respondents and reasons why they did not submit completed forms online. e-skills •12.5% of respondents stated lack of skills as the reason why they did not have a home internet connection •6.8% of respondents stated lack of skills as the reason why respondents did not submit completed forms online to public administration •12.0% of respondents stated lack of skills as the reason why a person has not bought/ordered goods or services online for private purposes, and •5.3% of respondents stated they had another person do it for them.

What were the reasons for not submitting completed forms online to public administration? Based on the survey data, it appears that, while the share of persons obtaining information from websites of public institutions is high (34.0%), online communication with public administration is evidently less common (23.9%) since the availability of this service is relatively modest, given that 76.6% of respondents replied they had no need to submit completed forms. The Republic of Serbia has created preconditions for the development of e-government by passing legislation to regulate this area, as well as by forming the IT and e-Government Office, as the authority responsible for providing the services of the e-Government Portal. The e-Government Portal is the gateway for e-services for all citizens, businesses and public administration employees and enables users to perform from their home, without physically coming to a service desk, certain public administration tasks that have hitherto required them to come to public administration offices. The e-Government offers numerous services provided by various institutions, including: IT and e-Government Office “Welcome to the world, baby!” Local tax administration Ministry of the Interior Vehicle registration renewal at authorised inspection garages (service intended for individuals) Temporary residence registration for foreign nationals Application for a certificate of (no) criminal convictions e-Appointment – qualified electronic certificate, available in 57 municipalities in Serbia Renewal of firearm registration certificates/firearm surrender (natural persons) e-Appointment – identity card of passport, available in 80 municipalities in Serbia 23,9% 25,2% 34,0% Submission of completed forms Downloads Obtaining information from public institution websites 1,2% 2,8% 4,7% 7,2% 8,1% 76,6% Concerns about security and personal data… No online services available on website Another person did it on my behalf Other reasons Lack of skills No need to submit completed forms 23 Renewal of firearm registration certificates/firearm surrender (natural persons) Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development e-Gradebook e-Enrolment – Electronic enrolment of first-graders National Health Insurance Fund Application for issuance of a medical insurance card and replacement of a medical insurance booklet with a medical insurance card Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia Browsing of medicinal products approved for human use for which the Agency issued a marketing authorisation Browsing of medicinal products approved for veterinary use for which the Agency issued a marketing authorisation Browsing of medical devices Browsing of certificates for batches of medicinal products approved for human use Browsing of certificates for batches of medicinal products approved for veterinary use Downloading open data on approved clinical trials Downloading open data on generic names of medical devices City of Loznica City of Valjevo City of Sremska Mitrovica City of Niš Registers of Births To ensure further development in this field, e-Government Development Programme of the Republic of Serbia for the period 2020-2022 and the Action Plan for its implementation were adopted pursuant to a proposal by the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self- Government, as the ministry responsible for the development of e-government. The Programme envisages public policy measures which will have a major impact both on the operation of the entire public administration, which is required to act in in accordance with the Law on e- Government, and on all citizens and businesses. The e-Government Development Programme states that a key challenge for successful digital transformation of Serbian public administration is laying the foundations to ensure activities remain on track and to ensure implementation of the planned measures across all segments of public administration, in a way which will enable efficient and coordinated functioning of that system. 1.4.1 e-Justice, е-Education, e-Health and е-Culture E-JUSTICE – The importance of е-judiciary is also recognised in the Judicial Development Strategy for the Period 2020–2025 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 101/20), through the specific objective “Development of е-judiciary”, which envisages further 24 improvements of judiciary e-services to ensure access to justice, improved quality of acting and decision-making, efficient resource management, statistical monitoring and reporting on the work of the judiciary and transparency in the work of judicial authorities. The draft Strategy also states that the use of modern ICTs, standardised software and centralised case management systems at courts and public prosecutors’ offices is necessary in order to implement the key principles of an effective judiciary: independence, impartiality, accountability, professionalism, efficiency and transparency. This calls for continual development of the е-judiciary system, as a mechanism that facilitates the attainment of all strategic objectives. In accordance with the Guidelines on ICT System Development in the Judiciary, by implementing the measures and activities set out in various action plans (including those pertaining to the Government’s priority objectives, Chapter 23 of EU access negotiation, reform of the Judicial Development Strategy and the fight against the shadow economy), the Ministry of Justice strives to apply state-of-the-art information and communication technologies in judicial authorities and the judicial professions through the implementation of various projects. Significant progress has been achieved in recent past regarding judicial ICT systems improvement through projects implemented by the e-Justice Division of the Ministry of Justice, which enable the provision of various e-services. Judicial Information System – The Judicial Information System was commissioned in late 2017, enabling electronic data exchange between judicial authorities, the judicial professions and other state institutions. The Judicial Information System gives all courts, public prosecutors’ offices, notaries public and bailiffs access to data contained in various registers and records maintained by the competent institutions (Central Register of Compulsory Social Insurance, Misdemeanours Records, Administration for the Enforcement of Penal Sanctions, Ministry of the Interior, Civil Registries, Business Registries Agency, Republic Geodetic Authority, courts of general jurisdiction, Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, Property Transactions Register, National Bank of Serbia and Tax Administration. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Justice, since the commissioning of the system, users have submitted 4,000,000 electronic inquiries. This expedites the average judicial proceeding by approximately 3 to 6 months. ProNep application – The ProNep application has been used since 2018 for the submission of data and documents by notaries public to the Cadastre, with the functionality of submitting data and documents to the competent tax authorities was introduced in 2020, making this a “one-stop shop” for procedures involving property transactions. The ProNep information system has been established to simplify the procedure and save time and money in administrative procedures conducted in connection with the transfer of title, including in particular through purchase, sale and gifting of real estate, as well as probate proceedings etc. System of electronic communication with the Administrative Court – e-Court – The e-Court system, commissioned in 2018 and accessible online, enables all parties – both attorneys and citizens – to fully conduct an administrative dispute electronically. It is planned to include commercial courts in the e-Court system in the near future, followed by courts of general jurisdiction. For citizens and attorneys, this system effectively means the court operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they no longer have to physically come to the court’s building to deliver a submission or examine a case file, as everything is available online. 25 Electronic notice board – e-Board – The electronic notice board was commissioned on 1 January 2020 for enforcement proceedings and gives citizens swift and simple online access to an integrated notice board used in enforcement proceedings. The e-Bord now gives citizens and legal entities access to all writs in enforcement proceedings which were not successfully served on them in person by a court or a bailiff. e-Auction in property foreclosures – The e-Auction system for public online auctioning of foreclosed property, which is scheduled to be commissioned in 2020, ensures a transparent procedure for the online sale of foreclosed properties and availability of information to all who are interested in participating in such procedures. Central case management system – SAPO (Standard Application for Prosecution Offices) and SAPA (Standard Application for Prison Administration) – The SAPO case management information system was implemented to increase the efficiency and transparency of public prosecutors’ offices and penal and correctional facilities in the Republic of Serbia. While the system has not yet been implemented at all prosecutors’ offices, the Ministry of Justice, with the support of EU funds under IPA 2015, is currently implementing the SAPO software in the remaining public prosecutors’ offices. The SAPO software allows case management throughout the entire lifecycle of a case, from the initial submission to the passing of a final decision and its archiving. Furthermore, the same system is also used to implement the SAPA (Standard Application for Prison Administration) system in all penal and correctional facilities. e-Payment+ - The Ministry of Justice, in collaboration with the IT and e-Government Office, has established a system that gives citizens and legal entities, as well as foreign natural persons, the option of paying electronically, i.e. online, their misdemeanour fines included in the Register of Outstanding Fines and Other Pecuniary Amounts. Case and content management software – LURIS – Luris is a case management application for international assistance which provides case management functionalities and covers the entire course and lifecycle of a case, from the receipt of a petition to the preparation of a final outgoing document and archiving. With a view to further improving e-services in the judiciary sector, which would ensure access to justice, improve the quality of proceedings and decision-making and enable efficient case management, statistical monitoring and reporting on the work of the judiciary and transparency in the operations of judiciary authorities, reform measures have been envisaged which are implemented under the Judicial Development Strategy. Е-EDUCATION – The importance of digitalisation in the field of education is witnessed by the fact that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development has a Department for Digitalisation in Education and Science and has been working to facilitate digitalisation, primarily by purchasing ICT equipment for primary and secondary schools to use electronic education systems, which has resulted in the establishment of 10,000 digital classrooms. “Connected Classrooms” project – the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications has equipped 550 primary and secondary school with WLANs and this activity continues within the framework of the “Connected Classrooms” project, which will provide reliable and safe internet access in all teaching and administration rooms at schools, for each pupil in the education system. 26 e-Gradebook – The e-Gradebook has been designed for and implemented in all primary and secondary schools in the Republic of Serbia, after appropriate staff trainings necessary for proper and secure use of the e-Gradebook, which also gives parents/other legal representatives of pupils electronic access to pupils’ achievements via the “my.e-Gradebook” module. e-Learning service – The e-Learning service currently offers 13 online courses, with available expert literature, as teaching support for 53 IT classes for pupils with special needs learning computer science and information technology at general secondary schools in the Republic of Serbia. The courses are available on the online platform of the Institute for the Advancement of Education, which is publicly available, and the material includes syllabuses taught in the 1st, 2ndand 3rd grade of general secondary schools. e-Enrolment – Services enabling electronic enrolment of pupils in the first year of primary school and the first year of secondary school have been established in cooperation with the IT and e-Government Office. EMIS – To lay the foundations for more efficient resource planning and management and monitoring of activities in the education system across all levels, activities have been initiated to establish an Education Management Information System (EMIS). In the coming period, numerous activities aimed at digitalisation in the field of education will be continued, as elaborated and specified in the Education and Science Development Strategy by 2030 and the Action Plan for implementing the programme of the Government of the Republic of Serbia pertaining to the development and application of the Education Management Information System, improvement of ICT infrastructure of education institutions, digital capacity building of all education levels below university, improved digital competences of employees in the education sector, implementation and promotion of innovative pedagogical approaches involving ICT integration in the teaching and learning processes, establishment of a system for continual monitoring of digital education development, building of pupils’ digital competences and establishment of a digital environment for the development of open education resources, digital services and teaching and learning support materials. E-HEALTH – A key priority for the Serbian government is digitalisation of the health care system, given that is has been recognised as one of the most complex and vital systems, as corroborated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous activities aimed at digitalisation in this field have been implemented recently, including: e-Prescription – e-Prescription was implemented in March 2019 in all primary health care institutions, in secondary and tertiary health care institutions where the competences of the chosen physician are assigned by the law to a specialist physician, as well as in social welfare institutions. Together with e-Prescription, the e-Therapy service was also implemented to allow chronic patients to obtain medication for 2 to 6 months, depending on their health status, which reduced the number of required visits to physicians and pharmacies. National Prevention and Diagnostics Medical Platform (e-Radiology) – Through the project of the National Prevention and Diagnostics Medical Platform, the Ministry of Health has ensured the implementation of a central information system in radiology, which connects all diagnostic devices, where possible, and gives the radiologist, the chosen physician and the patient access to images in the form of an electronic medical record, which contributes to cost savings on image development and increases work productivity. 27 e-Health portal for patients – The e-Health portal of the Ministry of Health is designed to give patients access to their medical information (reports, prescriptions, radiology images etc.), the possibility of scheduling appointments, communication with a physician (via video call), information on PCR tests and information on COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, activities which are already underway and are scheduled to be completed include: Electronic Medical Record – The Electronic Medical Record will enable the exchange of all medical information relating to patients vertically across the health care network and will give physicians access to all medical documentation of a patient. The system is expected to be put into production in June 2021. e-POS – A system for electronic registration of deaths, which will enable the submission of data to a registrar for entry in the Register of Deaths, as well as to the Public Health Institute “Batut” and the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. e-SickLeave Extension of the e-Prescription to include medical aids A platform for phone consultations between physicians and patients The Government of Serbia has also formed the Coordination Body for Health Case System Digitalisation, with the aim of ensuring a strategic approach to e-health development. This body is tasked with developing a National e-Health Development Programme with an Action Plan, improving the legislative framework and implementing state-of-the-art technology in this sector. Е-CULTURE – The Draft Culture Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia 2020- 2029 recognises the importance of digitalisation in culture and, accordingly, sets “Digitalisation in Culture” as a specific objective, which should systemically regulate the process of digitalisation of cultural heritage and build the capacities of cultural institutions for implementing this process. The focus will in particular be on digitalisation of archives and development of e-archives, improved operation of integrated software solutions in the field of culture for the protection of cultural assets, as well as contemporary artworks. The following digitalisation activities have recently been implemented: - All four areas of culture – libraries, museums (galleries), archives and institutes for the protection of monuments – use integrated software solutions for keeping documentation on their inventories and cultural assets; - The Cultural Heritage Browser has been developed, which aggregates data from all four databases of the integrated software solutions and presents them to the general public; - In cooperation with the Republic Geodetic Authority, a map of cultural institutions and cultural monuments visible on the Serbian Geoportal has been developed; - In cooperation with the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications and the Academic Network of the Republic of Serbia (AMRES), connecting of cultural institutions to AMRES is implemented as an ongoing activity; - Development of an information system for keeping integrated field archaeology documentation is at the final stage; - The first dataset in the map of archaeological sites of the Republic of Serbia has been developed and posted; 28 - In cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, efforts are underway to develop an electronic database on stolen and disappeared artwork and historic items; - Draft Decree on Uniform Technical and Technological Requirements and Procedures for the Keeping and Protection of Archival and Documentary Material in Electronic Form is currently being prepared; - The e-Museum application has been developed to help modernise content presentation and connect schools and museums. It can also be used in education and in teaching courses. The objective of the Strategic Priorities for the Development of Culture of the Republic of Serbia 2021-2025 in the digitalisation sphere is to close the existing gap in the purchase and use of modern information and communication technologies, train the staff of cultural institutions and identify the actual needs for digitalisation of cultural heritage and contemporary artworks. This objective is implemented through: 1) Normative bylaws governing the digitalisation process, which set out the responsibilities and competences of cultural institutions and stakeholders in the digitalisation process: - The Decree on Uniform Technical and Technological Requirements and Procedures for the Keeping and Protection of Archival and Documentary Material in Electronic Form, which will set forth the procedures for e-archiving and permanent keeping of electronic documents, creation of e-archives and harmonisation of the process of digitalisation of archival material and the existing Integrated Archiving Software Solution (ARHIS) with the e-archive. - Guidelines on digitalisation of cultural heritage of the Republic of Serbia aim to define the technical standards and metadata for uniform and interoperable implementation of the process of digitalisation of cultural heritage in the Republic of Serbia. Adoption and implementation of the Guidelines will ensure uniformity in the work of conservation institutions the digitalisation process. - The Bylaw on Security of ICT Systems in Cultural Institutions, which is planned to be adopted, would include all security measures provided for in the Law on Information Security. It is necessary to adapt the model to reflect the specific nature The model needs to be adapted to reflect the specific nature of the systems and the actual state of play regarding system security needs to be determined; furthermore, the current state needs to be brought in compliance with the recommendations and standards set forth in the Law and the Decrees. 2) Implementation and development of new services on an artificial intelligence platform, which would be applied to datasets available in the databases of the Integrated Software Solutions in the field of culture; 3) Networking of existing integrated software solutions for museums, archives, libraries and institutes for the protection of cultural monuments and development and upgrading of new ones; 4) Capacity building of cultural institutions in the digitalisation process through purchase of modern technology and hiring of digitalisation staff. 29 1.4.2 e-Transactions, e-Commerce and e-Tourism E-TRANSACTIONS – The cornerstone for developing a more comprehensive and widespread e-transactions in the Republic of Serbia was laid down with the passing of the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions, as well as the Law on e-Government. These two laws set forth the main legal concepts that enable e- transactions between public authorities, citizens and businesses. Electronic document – The Law that the validity, evidentiary power and written form of a document cannot be contested just because it is in electronic form. This is a crucial provision, since it reflects the applicable principle and ensures that electronic documents are recognised on an equal footing with paper-based ones. The provision is also important because it implies that both paper-based and electronic forms of documents are considered to be made in writing. The Law also provides for digitalisation of paper-based documents and grants such documents equal evidentiary power as the original, by providing that documents may be digitalised by the body passing the document, a notary public or a person designated for digitalisation and provides for digitalisation in a procedure before a public authority. These legal arrangements enable the conduct of procedures before public authorities electronically instead of using paper-based documents, which cuts the use of hard-copy documents, increases document accessibility and facilitates document searches and use, which ultimately results in lower costs of hard copies and archiving. However, while legal prerequisites for wider use of electronic documents and e-transactions have been provided, replies to a questionnaire which was distributed to all ministries and which 11 ministries answered, have shown that the level of electronic communications with parties remains relatively low. Namely, 7 ministries have electronic addresses for the receipt of electronic submissions, while 4 ministries have no such address; also, seven ministries provide electronic services, while three ministries do not. It was also found that two ministries applied Articles 11 and 12 of the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions, which provide for the digitalisation of paper-based documents and almost full transition to electronic communication and transactions with electronic documents. Electronic identification – The Law also provides for electronic communication, i.e. the procedure of using personal identification data which enable natural persons or legal entities to access electronic services. The Register of Electronic Identification Schemes has been established pursuant to the Law, with two such schemes registered thus far by the IT and e-Government Office. The Law provides for three levels of confidence of electronic identification schemes and it is paramount to have as many such schemes included in the Register as possible, given that such schemes may be used in communication with public authorities, since an electronic identification scheme with a high degree of confidence replaces a party’s signature on a submission, although this does not preclude the application of other levels of confidence in cases where the law allows public authorities to use lower confidence levels. Qualified trust services – Before the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions came into force, the Republic of Serbia used qualified electronic signature and qualified electronic timestamp services. The new Law 30 regulates also the use of other trust services which may be applied and guarantee the authenticity and integrity of data in a far wider range of e-transactions, including electronic stamp, electronic delivery, electronic archives, website authentication, cloud signature etc. Namely, there are seven providers of trust services in the Republic of Serbia, although it should be noted that most of them have been issuing qualified electronic signatures and qualified electronic timestamps. The underlying concept of qualified trust services is that the service provider guarantees the authenticity and integrity of individual pieces of data created in various legal affairs and transactions conducted electronically. In electronic transactions, confidence in the authenticity of data is paramount, to minimise the risks of abuse and data integrity breaches, which is why qualified trust services have been introduced and granted the highest level of legal guarantees, based on the high-level technical, security and organisational conditions under which they are provided. As these services currently include mostly electronic signatures and timestamps, it is crucial that new trust services gain traction in practice, especially cloud signatures and qualified electronic delivery services. As of February 2021, more than 650 thousand valid qualified electronic certificates have been issued, with approx. 850 thousand certificates issued in total. For this number to increase, it is necessary on the one hand to popularise the use of certificate, while also enabling the use of an increasing number of services accessible through qualified electronic certificates. It is expected that the use of cloud signatures will boost mass acceptance of signatures, as it facilitates access to services from mobile phones, unlike the previous means of generating electronic signatures, which many users found to demanding to install and use. E-COMMERCE – The legislative framework regulating e-commerce comprises the Law on Commerce (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, number 52/19), the Law on e-Commerce (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 41/09, 95/13 and 52/19) and the Law on Consumer Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 62/14, 6/16- new law, and 44/18 – new law). The new Law on Commerce, passed in 2019, regulates e-commerce in the Republic of Serbia. This Law introduces for the first time the concepts of “e-shop”, whereby a retailer sells its goods directly to the consumer, and “online platform”, which connects sellers with buyers. Furthermore, the Law also recognises for the first time the business model of “dropshipping” (which has been used in practice for quite some time), whereby the goods do not physically reach the retailer and are instead shipped directly from the manufacturer/importer to the consumer. A major legislative novelty is the introduction of the concept of “mystery shopper”, whereby an inspector is authorised, in the event of reasonable suspicion that a retailer is unregistered, to carry out mystery shopping and thus obtain evidence. The Law also provides for the possibility of granting incentives to e-retailers, which is to be regulated in detail by a bylaw passed by the Government, with a view to boosting e-commerce development and combating the shadow economy in the online market. To promote the development of digital economy and eliminate obstacles to e-commerce development in the Republic of Serbia, the Government has passed the e-Commerce Development Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the Period 2019-2020 with the Action Plan. it is the first 31 public policy document in the field of e-commerce development in the Republic of Serbia for the period 2019-2020. The e-Commerce Development Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the Period 2019-2020 sets out the specific objectives of improving e-commerce in the domestic market, as well as programme measures and activities designed to contribute to an improvement across all segments in the process of online ordering of goods/services, such as payment, logistics, customs, e-consumer rights etc., which are essential for continued growth and development of this form of commerce. The set of measures and activities included in this programme document will provide a boost to all stakeholders in the ecosystem. Specifically, these measures and activities include: strengthening customers’ trust in e-commerce (media campaigns, consumer guide, improved non- litigious dispute resolution in e-commerce), strengthening the position of e-retailers (development of guides for retailers, support to female entrepreneurship, educational courses for retailers), media education, improved operation of courier services, promotion of electronic payments, improved work of inspection authorities and greater involvement of the academic community through stronger cooperation in this field. The adoption of this Programme was preceded by a comprehensive survey conducted within the framework of the project “Strengthening e-Commerce in the Republic of Serbia”, the results of which have identified the key barriers, both on the supply side and on the demand side (the survey results are incorporated in the section of the Programme providing the background on e-commerce – the ex ante analysis). The measures and activities set out in the Programme have been defined to respond to the key challenges and barriers identified by the survey. E-TOURISM – The Tourism Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia for the Period 2016-2025 (hereinafter referred to as the “Tourism Development Strategy”) was adopted in 2016. The section providing the background states that implementation of previous Strategies die not make sufficient use of the possibilities and advantages of information and communication technologies, the Internet, social networks and platforms to promote Serbia’s tourism offer, as well platforms for the development of new SMEs and their services. Accordingly, the Tourism Development Strategy sets out the following objective: improvement and harmonisation of statistical data collection and processing methodology and procedures with the international standards and practices, building on the relevant legislative grounds. In accordance with the Tourism Development Strategy and taking into consideration the priorities of digitalisation of Serbian economy and continued development of e-government, the Law on Hospitality (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 17/2019) provides for the implementation of a central information system in the field of hospitality and tourism (e-Tourist), as an integrated and centralised electronic information system containing all relevant data on accommodation providers and accommodation facilities, which will be used for their recording and for entry of other data resulting from hospitality, nautical tourism hunting tourism and general tourism activities. The primary goals of e-Tourist implementation are to integrate all data on accommodation providers, accommodation facilities and hospitality establishments, to shorten and cut the number and costs of administrative procedures, to improve cooperation and data exchange between the competent state institutions, to increase efficiency of the accommodation charge collection and 32 payment control system and consequential increase in revenues for local self-government budgets and the national budget, to reduce shadow economy and illegal work (especially by natural persons providing accommodation services), to improve statistical monitoring of the movement of tourists, to implement an active marketing policy and to increase competitiveness of Serbia’s tourism offer. These activities will result in digitalisation of tourism and hospitality through implementation of modern technologies in the operations of both economic operators and the public sector. 1.4.3 e-Construction, е-Agriculture E-CONSTRUCTION – As regards e-construction, significant progress has been made recently with regard to electronic building permits. Implementation of an electronic building permit issuance system is based on the new Law on Planning and Construction, and as such poses a key reform challenge. The key effects of implementation of the electronic building permit issuance software include faster and cheaper obtaining of permits and a one-stop shop for all permit-related procedures. Activities are underway to improve the software and enable faster and easier obtaining of electronic building documents by adding new functionalities and upgrading the existing ones, based on needs stated by system users and an analysis of e-document issuance. Numerous activities are also underway within the mandate of the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure to digitalise processes and procedures concerning Energy Performance Certificates, spatial and urban planning, inland waterway transport and navigation safety. Е-AGRICULTURE – The Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia for the period 2014-2024 identifies, as an activity aimed at achieving the strategic objectives, the development of all types of analytical information systems supporting agriculture, including any missing parts of agricultural statistics, the public reporting and forecasting service system, market information, registers etc. The Directorate for Agrarian Payments plans to digitalise the procedure for granting subsidies to farmers by implementing an IACS. Subsidies will be granted according to the procedures and in the manner set forth in the IACS (Integrated Administrative and Control System), which is used for granting, controlling and monitoring agricultural subsidies (all direct payments and rural development payments linked to the surface area of agricultural land). The Directorate for Agricultural Land operates an information system comprising three web-based applications and one desktop (client-server) application. The two web-based applications are used in the development and implementation of the Annual Protection Programme and regulation and use of agricultural land by all local self-government units in the territory of the Republic of Serbia and the Directorate for Agricultural Land, while one application provides public access and services, as well as viewing of information on state-owned agricultural land. Plans are underway to upgrade the existing information system, in order to complete the full set of affairs and processes within the purview of the Directorate for Agricultural Land. 33 The SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) project, financed from a World Bank loan, has also been planned. In 2020, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management also began implementing the PHRD Grant project “Building Agricultural Sector Capacity for Data-Based Decision-Making, which will be implemented over the course of 3 years, during which period software will be purchased to facilitate management of collected data and the process of reporting on agricultural policy and rural development. 1.4.4 e-Mining and e-Energy E-MINING – The field of mining in the Republic of Serbia falls within the mandate of the Ministry of Mining and Energy. The following information systems containing data in this field have been developed in recent years: Geological Information System of Serbia (GeolISS) – In the past ten years, the line ministry has worked on the development of the Geological Information System of Serbia (GeolISS) as a strategic project, built as an extension on the GIS software platform that is fully user-friendly, both in terms of system updating with new data and in terms of timely obtaining of necessary information on Serbia’s geological resources. The aim of GeolISS establishment is to enable digital archiving of digital data and information and provide a modern and efficient information basis for all activities involved in planning, designing and decision-making in the field of geology. Users of this system include the Serbian Geological Institute, the Ministry of Mining and Energy and the Faculty od Mining and Geology, while the web-based application makes it available to all interested institutions and citizens of the Republic of Serbia. The web-based application is scheduled to be further developed and made publicly available online, whether on a commercial basis or with unlimited access; while this will commercialise the service, the benefits of this move will be reflected in increased usability of the system. Central Information System for Geological Exploration and Mining (CIS GEM) – Under the project “IMIS - Integrated Management Information System”, the Ministry of Mining and Energy has developed and implemented the Central Information System for Geological Eploration and Mining (CIS GEM). The project has been developed on the GIS software platform, as a modern information system used for maintaining a cadastre of exploration and mining fields in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The CIS GEM provides for the generation, classification, maintenance, presentation and distribution of numeric, descriptive and spatial databases on: approved geological explorations; certificates of reserves; mining approvals; cadastre of exploration and mining fields; cadastre of ore deposits and balance of mineral raw materials; cadastre of mining works and facilities; cadastre of mining waste and disused, rehabilitated and closed mines; archival documentation and approvals, licences and certificates etc. The web-based GIS application found on the Ministry’s website enables access and searching by public users, as a testament to transparency of the Ministry’s operations. 34 E-ENERGY – In addition to mining, the Ministry of Mining and Energy is also responsible for public administration affairs pertaining to the energy sector, energy policy and energy development planning. Information systems have been developed in this field as well, including: Central Register of Pressure Equipment (CROPP) – Development of the Central Register of Pressure Equipment began in 2012 under the auspices of the Ministry of Mining and Energy. It is a database of pressure equipment and includes data on inspections and tests of pressure equipment carried out by designated bodies. in this way, the Ministry of Mining and Energy, which incorporates the Pressure Equipment Inspectorate, has complete access to information on the state of pressure equipment in the entire country, with the exact characteristics and location of each item of pressure equipment and with the possibility of searching pressure equipment data based on any criterion (e.g. municipality, equipment manufacturer, year of manufacture, equipment owner, type of pressure equipment or any other criterion). Last year, the CROPP was linked to the Business Register Agency’s system. Energy Management Monitoring and Implementation Information System (SEMIS) – The SEMIS is an information system used for monitoring energy management system implementation operated by the line ministry, which comprises data on the obligations of obligors in accordance with the Law on Energy Efficiency and Rational Energy Use. Furthermore, the system also collects and stores excerpts from energy inspection reports, as well as information on licensed energy managers and licensed energy advisors. In parallel with this, the SEMIS enables the Ministry to compile analytical reports on energy consumption and other parameters of the energy management system. Information System for Energy and Water Consumption Monitoring and Analysis (ISEM) – The ISEM is an information system for energy and water consumption monitoring and analysis in public buildings. It is used for energy management purposes and is administered by the line ministry. The ISEM is intended primarily for monitoring and analysis of data on consumption and costs of energy, fuel and water in public buildings under the responsibility of local self- governments, provinces and the central government and is also used for the establishment of a national database on energy, fuel and water consumption in public buildings. Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) – The IMIS is a database used for collecting and obtaining energy data relating to the production, imports, exports and consumption of energy and fuel in the territory of the Republic of Serbia and serves as the basis for the development of the Energy Balance of the Republic of Serbia. Data are collected electronically on a monthly and annual basis from energy operators in the fields of electricity, heating, renewables, coal, oil, oil products and natural gas. It is also used in the compiling of monthly Reports submitted by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia to Eurostat in compliance with the EU Regulation 1099/2008 on Energy Statistics. Information system for monitoring and verification of realized final energy savings – MVP (monitoring and verification platform) is an information system for systematic monitoring of energy savings as a result of implementation of plans and programs in the field of energy efficiency in accordance with the Law on Energy Efficiency and Rational Energy Use. The application is intended for online data entry from projects on energy efficiency measures and automatic calculation of energy savings, CO2 emissions and investments by local governments and public institutions and companies. 35 1.5 ICT SECTOR A key distinguishing feature of the ICT industry, apart from the fact that it has been the fastest-growing sector in the past 10 years, is its applicability across all other sectors. The main characteristics of this sector are described in the “E-Bulletin” of the Electronic Communications and Information Society Association of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia4, which covers employment, salaries, foreign trade and foreign direct investment. Trends concerning the number of IT companies, the capital of the Serbian IT industry, exports of computer services and the state of play and outlook for start-ups in this field have been adapted from the survey Development of the Information Technology Industry.5 Employment – The total number of employees in electronic communication and information society industries in Q3 2020 according to SORS figures was 94,105, which was a 9.5% increase relative to the same quarter of 2019. Employees in the electronic communication and information society account for 4.4% of total employment. In terms of industrial activities, the highest share of employment was reported in computer programming, consulting and related activities (36,430), with a 13.7% increase. High numbers of employed persons were also reported in postal activities (18,239) and telecommunications (16,017). The lowest number of employees was reported in information services (4,470), where year-on-year employment growth was 20.3%. (source: e-Bulletin of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia). Salaries – Between January and October 2020, the highest average monthly salary was reported in computer programming, consultancy and related activities – RSD 212,093 (158.5% above the national average) and in the field of telecommunications – RSD 126,226 (53.8% above the national average). The lowest average monthly salary was reported in gambling and bookmaking – RSD 63,703, which was 22.4% below the national average; this activity also had the lowest year-on-year salary growth at 3.1%, with a 1.5% salary increase in real terms during the same period (source: e-Bulletin of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia). Foreign trade – According to the NBS figures, income generated from exports of computer, information and postal services in 2020 reached approx. EUR 1.5 billion (identical to the figure for the same period of 2019), of which 91.4% was generated from exports of computer services (approx. EUR 1.3 billion), while 6.7% was generated from exports of telecommunications services (EUR 96.7 million). Imports were also comprised mainly of computer services (75.7%, or EUR 409.0 million), with the total value of imports of telecommunications, computer, information nand postal services reaching EUR 540.6 million in the same period. A surplus of EUR 909.4 million was reported (up 14.2% from 2019). According to the SORS figures, exports of computers, communication equipment and software in 2020 reached EUR 108.9 million, while imports stood at EUR 648.4 million, with an export-to-import ratio of 16.8%. Foreign direct investment – According to the preliminary NBS figures, total net FDI inflow into Serbia from investment by non-residents in 2020 reached EUR 3,014.2 million. In 2020, the Information and Communications Sector generated net FDI inflow from investment by 4 E-bilten IV kvartal 2020, Privredna komora Srbije, Udruženje za elektronske komunikacije i informaciono društvo; 5 Razvoj industrije informacionih tehnologija, avgust 2019; Milovan Matijević, Mineco Computers 36 non-residents of EUR 41.8 million, while the Manufacture of Computers, Electronic and Optical Products received EUR 10.8 million in investment. (source: National Bank of Serbia). Number of IT companies – In 2018 there were 2,349 active companies in Serbia with an individual annual income of more than one million dinars. In terms of business activities, the highest number was that of programming companies (1,483), which accounted for 63% of the total number. In terms of size, a majority of IT companies are micro businesses (with fewer than 10 employees), which accounted for 77.9%. On the other hand, only 11 companies were categorised as large (with more than 250 employees). Relative to 2011, the total number of active IT companies in 2018 increased by nearly 700. Of more than 200 new companies registered each year, half of them (about 100) begin operating, while some 50 will either withdraw from the IT sector or file for liquidation due to bankruptcy or merger. New companies will emerge from new ideas, innovation, in incubators etc. Effectively, it can be said that programming companies are the sole drivers of IT industry’s vitality. Following year after year of growth, the number of active companies currently stands at 1,483, which accounts for 63% of the total number – far more than 32% of the total number as reported in 2011 (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Capital of Serbian IT industry – In 2018, the IT industry had EUR 674 million of own capital, with an annual growth of 16.0%. For the second consecutive year, IT industry’s capital has seen double-digit growth. Furthermore, relative to 2006, when own capital amounted to approx. EUR 150 million, Serbian IT industry is now worth 4 times more. This trend is spurred by foreign capital, which is already highly represented in the Serbian IT scene (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Structure of IT industry’s capital by activities 2018 Programming companies have the highest capital – more than EUR 376 million – accounting for 56% of IT industry’s total capital. A distant second (EUR 173 million; 26%) is the IT services sector. Of the 100 largest IT companies, nearly half are foreign-owned. Foreign companies bring international standards to the Serbian IT sector; however, this also requires adaptation and, in some Wholesale and retail; 11% IT services; 26% Programming; 56% PC equipment; 7% Wholesale and retail IT services Programming PC equipment 37 ways, localisation of foreign IT companies, if they wish to be successful in the Serbian IT market (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Exports of computer services – Computer services are used globally as an indicator for international comparison between countries and their respective levels of technological development. Serbia’s domestic IT services market has been growing at an annual rate slightly higher than 10%, while on the other hand exports of computer services have grown at a rate of more than 30% per annum. This improves Serbia international image, from a country of cheap labour to a country with high-quality human capital (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Exports of computer services from 2010 to 2020 According to WTO figures, global exports of computer services between 2014 and 2017 increased at an annual rate of 10%, reaching EUR 300 billion in 2017. In 2014 Serbia ranked 40th, while 2016 figures ranked it 38th, and estimates for 2017 indicate it progressed further by one or two places. In comparison with the neighbouring countries, measured by the value of exports of computer services, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria rank higher, while all other neighbouring countries rank below Serbia. Serbia accounts for approx. 0.3% of global IT services exports and there is room for further growth; however, this will require IT experts, who are in short supply. For example, to reach EUR 2 billion in IT services exports, assuming the existing operating model, the sector will need to hire 30,000 additional IT experts (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Start-ups: state of play and outlook – As regards start-ups, it can be said that the “start- up virus” is beginning to spread across Serbia, as evident from the fact that 188 programming companies had been registered in 2015, while 2017 already saw a significantly higher number of start-ups (253), followed by 281 in 2018; thus, it can be expected with a high degree of certainty that 2019 will set an all-time record with more than 300 programming start-ups. A majority of new companies are oriented towards the global market. However, starting a business is not all plain sailing, as evident from the fact that, out of the 749 programming companies formed from 2016 and 2018, 311 still have no employees and no income. In terms of conditions for growth, an even 127 166 225 296 344 455 590 760 1016 1270 1326 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Exports 38 more significant indicator is the fact that most Serbian IT enterprises take more than a decade to develop from a start-up to a large company. On average, every year about ten micro enterprises grow to become small enterprises, three small enterprises become medium-sized, while only one enterprise succeeds in becoming a large company with 250 or more employees (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). Challenges – It would appear that Serbia provides a sound foundation for starting a business in the IT industry, as it boasts a high-quality workforce; however, local workforce is capable of driving the growth of domestic companies only up to a certain level. On the other hand, foreigners come to this market primarily for the high-quality IT human resources, while all other sources of their growth are found outside of Serbia. For these reasons, the largest battle between IT companies in the local market is for attracting appropriate workforce: until a year or two ago, they competed for the best experts, while currently they compete for the best interns, as labour demand exceeds by far the supply. In such a situation, salary figures become the main “competitive edge” of an employer, and in this regard capacity takes precedence over quality, with international companies still offering more attractive packages. This, in turn, answers the question why domestic IT companies grow at a slower rate than the foreign-owned ones, which also bring access to international markets and finished or semi- finished solutions. Foreign employers tend to aim for maximum productivity at a minimum cost, while the value added chain of their operations is usually located outside of Serbia (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry). 1.6 INFORMATION SECURITY With the development of new technologies and services, which are increasingly provided electronically, there is an increased demand for stepping up the level of information security. In Serbian legislation, the concept of information security was primarily associated with the information security of ICT systems of special importance in accordance with the Law on Information Security; however, it is increasingly becoming an important segment for both citizens and businesses, coupled with growing awareness of its importance. However, information security risks affect both the government, specifically the ICT systems of special importance, and citizens and businesses, who bear the brunt of cybercrime attacks. 1.6.1 Information security of citizens The module “Trust, Security and Privacy” in the SORS survey provides data on information security of citizens and the risks and threats to which they have been exposed.6 The survey asked the following four questions: 6 The source of data on e-skills is the publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of information and communication technologies in the Republic of Serbia, 2019 39 84,8% 8,1% 7,0% 3,8% 1,7% 0,5% 0,4% 0,3% 0,3% None of the above Receiving fraudulent messages (phishing) Being redirected to fake website asking for personal information (Pharming) Your social network or e‐mail account being hacked and content being posted or sent without your knowledge Loss of documents, pictures or other data due to a virus or other threats Online identity theft (somebody stealing your personal data and impersonating you) Children accessing inappropriate websites Misuse of your personal information available on the Internet Fraudulent credit or debit card use Have you experienced any of the following security-related issues when using the Internet for private purposes in the past 12 months? 93,5% 6,5% NO YES Have you experienced financial loss in the past 12 months resulting from identity theft, receiving fraudulent messages or being redirectred to fake websites? 56,9% 42,3% 0,8% No Yes, automatically or manually Don't know Do you make backup copies of you files on any external storage device or online (cloud services) for private purposes? 40 An analysis of survey results reveals that very few persons have experienced security- related issues online and, among those who did, the most common cases involved receiving fraudulent messages (8.1%) and being redirected to fake websites. Among the victims of identity theft, those who received fraudulent messages and those who were redirected to fake websites, 6.5% stated they had suffered financial loss as a result. Furthermore, due to security concerns, 17.5% of respondents did not order goods or services online, 16.8% did not use online banking, and 16.6% did not provide personal information to social or professional networks. As regards creating backup copies of files, 56.9% of respondents do not make backup copies, while 42.3% make backup copies, either automatically or manually. Judging by the data presented above, it would appear that there is a strong case for raising citizens’ awareness of information security. Namely, raising awareness of the risks and the ways to protect oneself online is essential to improve knowledge and promote the use of ICT, electronic services, online banking, e-commerce etc. In addition, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a clear correlation between digital competences and information security, corroborating the need to raise awareness and knowledge of these matters. Information security of children – Information security of children in the Republic of Serbia was originally regulated by the Decree on Safety and Protection of Children when Using Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as the “Decree”), while amendments and supplements to the Law on Information Security expanded its application to include also this subject matter. The Law and the Decree set forth measures for the online safety and protection of children, which are implemented through the activities of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for Children (hereinafter referred to as the “National Contact Centre”). 75,0% 17,5% 16,8% 16,6% 7,6% 5,4% 3,8% Other Ordering goods or services online Online banking Providing personal information to social or professional networking services Communication with public services or administrations Downloading software or applications, music, video files, games or other data files Internet access via a public WiFi Have security concerns limited or prevented you from doing any of the following activities online for private purposes in the past 12 months? 41 The National Contact Centre plays a key role primarily in the prevention and raising of awareness and knowledge of the advantages and risks of using the Internet and ways of using the Internet safely. Preventive measures for the online safety and protection of children are implemented through education and provision of information to children, parents and teachers by the National Contact Centre, as well as jointly with the competent authorities and institutions, schools, the media, civil and private sectors, academia, prominent individuals in modern art and creative industries and other stakeholders. As of 31 December 2020, educators at the National Contact Centre held 394 presentations in primary schools for children and parents, which were attended by 14,667 pupils and 5,074 parents, and 12 education workshops in secondary schools for first- and second-year pupils. Since October 2020, they have also held 5 webinars/trainings for teachers, which were attended by 190 teachers. A highly effective way of raising awareness of the risks involved in using the internet has been proven to be the media campaign implemented continually by the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications in collaboration with the public broadcasting service, which brings the subject matter of security closer to children, as well as their parents, in a way that is both entertaining and instructive. Apart from prevention, the National Contact Centre is also the central point for reporting online security threats, which are then forwarded, depending on the type of threat to the child’s rights and interests, to one of the relevant institutions: the Ministry of the Interior, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Cybercrime, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, social work centres and medical centres. As of December 2020, the total number of communications registered at the National Contact Centre since its formation via phone calls, e-mail, online reporting on the site and social networks is 20,050. In 2016, the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications launched the school campaign “IT Caravan”, which promotes the benefits of using the Internet and new technologies in education and warns against threats arising from their incorrect and unsupervised use. The “IT Caravan” was launched as part of the information society development platform entitled “Smart and Safe”. The campaign has been implemented for three consecutive years and has comprised lectures, presentations, plays and competitions for fifth- and sixth-year pupils from 83 primary schools from all Serbian cities. It also featured programming and robotics workshops, with educational materials such as brochures and leaflets containing information and warnings against online threats distributed to pupils. More than 13,000 pupils participated in the programmes directly, while live online broadcasts were watched in 2018 by pupils from 800 schools, plus another 1,135 pupils competing in the pre-selection quiz in 2019. The campaign also included lectures for parents and, in addition to the events held at schools and cultural and sports centres, in technology hubs and at the Petnica Research Station, there were also promotional actions in city squares and in other communal areas. The comprehensive approach to the issue of information security of children taken in the Republic of Serbia, including the regulation of this area by laws and regulations, the establishment of preventive action mechanisms and identification of key stakeholders in this area, has proven itself as highly satisfactory, although it should be noted that further improvement in this area will 42 require additional capacity building of the National Contact Centre staff, improved cooperation between relevant institutions and provision of training to the staff of those institutions. 1.6.2 Information security of businesses As regards information security of businesses, it should be noted that this group includes the so-called ICT systems of special importance, which are required under the Law on Information Security to implement security measures to maintain the information security of their systems at an appropriate level and reduce the risk of incidents, as well as those that are not subject to that Law, which means that the issue of information security is to them an issue of their awareness of the significance and importance of information security, especially in terms of consequences that may arise. The “ICT Security” module in the SORS survey pertains to the application of certain security measures by enterprises to protect from incidents. 82,3% 73,6% 72,0% 63,2% 35,9% 34,3% 31,6% 22,9% 21,6% 10,1% Keeping the software (including operating systems) up‐to‐date Strong password authentification, minimum length of 8 mixed characters, changed periodically Data backup to a separate location (inlcuding backup to the cloud) Network access control (management of access by devices and users to the enterprise's network) Maintaining log files for analysis after security incidents VPN (Virtual Private Network extends a private network across a public network to enable secure exchange of data… Encryption techniques for data, documents or e‐mails ICT risk assessment, i.e. periodical assessment of probability and consequences of ICT secruity incidents ICT security tests (e.g. performing penetration tests, testing security alert system, review of security measures, testing … User identification and authentification via biometric methods implemented by the enterprise (e.g. based on… Does your enterprise use any of the following ICT security measures? 43 Does your enterprise make employees aware of their obligations in ICT security related issues in the following ways? How are ICT security-related activities (security testing, ICT training on security, resolving ICT security incidents) performed in your enterprise? When were your enterprise's document(s) on measures, practices or procedures on ICT security defined or most recently reviewed? 37,9% 23,0% 15,0% Voluntary training or internally available information (e.g. information on the intranet) By contract (contract of employment) Compulsory training courses or viewing compulsory material Compulsory training courses or viewing compulsory material By contract (contract of employment) Voluntary training or internally available information (e.g. information on the… 13,3% 20,1% 34,2% 18,5% 32,8% 44,1% 30,8% 32,5% 65,8% Large Medium-sized Small 54,3% 41,5% Outsourced In-house Outsourced In-house 56,6% 35,8% 48,4% 56,5% 39,7% 79,0% Large Medium-sized Small 58,8% 25,0% 16,2% In the past 12 months More than 12 months ago, but less than 24 months ago More than 24 months ago More than 24 months ago More than 12 months ago, but less than 24 months… In the past 12 months 20,3% 30,8% 48,0% 8,8% 12,9% 78,3% 5,2% 12,5% 82,3% Large Medium-sized Small 44 An analysis of data on whether enterprises employ any security measures reveals that a large percentage of companies employ measures relating to software maintenance (82.3%), strong password authentication (73.6%) and data backup to a remote site (72.0%). On the other hand, very few enterprises use biometric methods for user identification (10.1%), run ICT security tests (21.6%) and conduct assessments of ICT risk and consequences of ICT security incidents (22.9%). It is also noticeable that, in terms of enterprise size (small with 10-49 employees, medium-sized with 50-249 employees and large with 200 or more employees), ICT security measures are most commonly employed by large enterprises, while the share of small enterprises that do so is the lowest. This is probably due to the fact that large companies have greater technological and human resources capacities and are mostly categorised as ICT systems of special importance, which is why they have a duty to apply security measures in accordance with the law. As regards making employees aware of ICT security issues, only 15.0% of enterprises require compulsory courses or compulsory view of material for employees, while 37.9% provide voluntary trainings or internally available information. The survey results indicate that 23.0% learn of ICT security issues through contract. Once again, in terms of enterprises size, most large enterprises provide compulsory and voluntary trainings, while most medium-sized enterprises make their employees aware of ICT security issues through their contract. ICT system security activities are outsourced at 54.3% of all respondents, although it should be noted that, out of that percentage, small companies tend to outsource these activities more commonly than others, while outsourcing is the least common among small enterprises, which is understandable given that small, as well as medium-sized enterprises usually do not have employees hired specifically to ICT posts. From the survey results it is evident that there is significant room for improving information security for small businesses. It is necessary in particular to focus the measures on small and medium-sized enterprises, especially with regard to staff capacity building and raising awareness f the fact that information security must be an indispensable part of everyone’s business, regardless of the size of their enterprise or their industrial activity, to ensure incident prevention and protection. 1.6.3 Information security of ICT systems of special importance Legislative framework – The Law on Information Security in the Republic of Serbia was first passed in 2016 in accordance with the then Draft Network and Information Security Directive, hereinafter referred to as the “NIS Directive”). The Law defines the term “information security” as a set of measures enabling the protection of data managed in an ICT system from unauthorised access and protecting the integrity, availability, authenticity and indisputability of such data so the system could operate as intended, when intended and under the control of authorised officers. 26,7%YES Does your enterprise have document(s) on measures, practices or procedures on ICT security? 45 Thus, the Law regulates the information security of those information systems that have been recognised as ICT systems of special importance and must therefore be appropriately protected, which implies the employment of technical, organisational and human resources-related measures, as well as compliance with other statutory obligations regarding incident reporting, submission of statistical data, regular ICT system audits etc The Law, and also the accompanying secondary legislation passed the same year, regulates the following areas: - Defining ICT systems of special importance; - Defining security measures applicable to ICT systems of special importance; - Establishment of the Information Security Coordination Body; - Establishment of the National CERT, the CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs of independent ICT system operators; - Defining of a list of incidents posing significant threats to information security and mandatory incident reporting, - Establishment of the information security directorate, - Cryptosecurity and protection from compromising electromagnetic radiation performed, and - A possibility of establishing and recording special CERTs. Application of the Law and secondary legislation – Given that the field of information security was first regulated by the law passed in 2016 and the accompanying secondary legislation, its application will require an extended period of time and has not yet been fully achieved. Although application of the Law began immediately after its passing, it was found that legislative amendments and supplements would have to be made to ensure compliance with the NIS Directive which had been adopted in the meantime, as well as to improve some of the existing solutions with a view to more effective implementation of the Law in practice. The amendments and supplements to the Law on Information Security adopted in October 2019 introduce novelties concerning the following: - The National CERT, its powers and required capacities; - Involvement of the National Bank of Serbia in the work of the Information Security Coordination Body; - Establishment of the Record of Operators of ICT Systems of Special Importance; - Introduction of the duty to submit statistical data on incidents occurring in the ICT systems of special importance on an annual basis; - Cooperation of CERTs in the Republic of Serbia; - Protection of children in the use of information and communication technologies; - Classification of incidents and responses by the competent authorities depending on the threat level of each incident. Challenges for information security – Regarding ICT systems and their protection, certain challenges still remain, including: 1) Application of security measures by ICT systems of special importance; 2) Capacities of the National CERT, the CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs of independent ICT system operators; 3) Capacities of the information security inspectorate; 46 4) Incidents posing significant threats to information security; 5) Public-private partnership; 6) International cooperation. 1) Application of security measures by ICT systems of special importance The Law specifies which ICT systems are considered to be ICT systems of special importance, namely those system which, if severely compromised, could have consequences both for the functioning of the organisations that manage them and for the rights and interests of citizens and businesses, as well as for national and public safety. ICT systems of special importance, in particular those operated by public authorities, face issues in the employment of security measures for various reasons, including: - Lack of staff; - Lack of staff with appropriate levels of knowledge; - High employee turnover; - Inadequate equipment; - Insufficient management awareness of the importance of information security. The same challenges are also faced by the ICT systems of special importance falling within the group of ICT systems performing activities of general interest that are mainly owned by the private sector (finance, energy, telecommunications etc.); however, the risks they face are certainly far less severe, as the risks of incidents in these systems can have consequences both in financial terms and in terms of inability to provide services to a large portion of the population, which is why the level of awareness in the case of these systems is much higher and they also enjoy greater management support in the application of security measures. The World Bank report also states that “up-to-date technical security controls are deployed in all sectors of Serbia, although the level of implementation can vary depending on the sector or size of the establishment.” It is noted that in the public sector it is common practice to apply controls such as automatic software patching and anti-virus updating, firewall management, offsite storage of backups and physical security controls, as well as some limited use of intrusion detection systems. It is also noted that the networks are monitored for unapproved devices and workstations are secured so that users are unable to install unapproved software. “A similar environment exists in the private sector, although the variation in deployment is much greater. Financial, telecommunications and larger institutions deploy a much broader range of controls and exhibit a much deeper knowledge not only of the importance of these controls, but also have the skills and financial resources to deploy them. It was noted that mid-sized, and some smaller, enterprises outsource their ICT operations, and therefore depend on their provider to ensure the security of the environment.” 2) Capacities of the National CERT, the CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs of independent ICT system operators The National CERT was established in 2017 and its capacities have since been increased in terms of staffing level, equipment and premises. This is witnessed by the fact that the National 47 CERT has become a full member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), as the world’s largest organisation in this field, with 520 members from 95 countries, aiming to connect the CERT teams worldwide and establish information exchange channels. In addition, the National CERT is also accredited on the Trusted Introducer list of CERTs from all over the world. Investment in the capacities of the National CERT is still needed and it is expected that the newly-adopted provisions of the Law on Information Security pertaining to the capacity of the National CERT will drive further improvement of its operations. In addition, it is paramount to build the capacities of the public authority CERT tasked with incident protection in the ICT systems of public authorities. A significant number of public authorities are considered to have ICT systems of special importance and are included in the Single e-Government Information and Communication Network and, in this context, it is crucial to establish information exchange mechanisms with the public authority CERT, as well as to improve its incident response capacities. Independent ICT system operators are required under the Law to form a CERT to manage incidents in their systems. Recently, the CERT of the Ministry of the Interior achieved significant results in terms of international cooperation, becoming a full member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) and receiving accreditation on the Trusted Introducer list of CERTs worldwide. Since not all ICT system operators have formed their CERTs, it is necessary to provide optimum conditions and support their formation, including through support to the teams that have already been formed, such as the CERT of the Ministry of the Interior. Since the Law provides that the National CERT, the CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs of independent ICT system operators are to maintain continual cooperation, this cooperation mechanism needs to be implemented to enable sharing of experiences and knowledge, as well responding to certain incidents. This includes in particular incidents of national importance, which is why it is necessary to establish cooperation protocols, designate contact persons, develop incident response procedures at all levels and hold regular exercises in this segment. 3) Capacities of the information security inspectorate The Law on Information Security provides that the information security inspectorate shall be tasked with inspecting the application of the Law and the activities of operators of ICT systems of special importance. The Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications hired an information security inspector in 2018; however, inspection activities did not begin until 2019. As of December 2020, 34 inspections have been inspected in total. Given the number of ICT systems of special importance, it is clear that a single inspector is not sufficient to conduct the inspections, which is why it is impossible to verify whether the number of ICT systems compliant with the Law and the statutory security measures has increased. 4) Incidents posing significant threats to information security The operators of ICT systems of special importance are require to report any ICT system incidents that can have significant impact in terms of information security breaches. These are effectively incidents that may cause disruptions in operations or in the provision of services or that 48 may affect a large number of services, a large number of users or a substantial part of the territory or that may affect public safety etc. However, although incident reporting applies only to incidents that significantly breach information security, very few incidents have been reported in recent years. One of the reasons for the low number of reported incidents is the fact that ICT systems of special importance avoid reporting incidents for fear that their reputation may be harmed, or do not know where incidents should be reported, or manage to recover from the incidents without assistance and thus decide not to report them at all. To ensure proper incident reporting, it is necessary to first make the ICT systems of special importance aware of the importance of incident reporting, while also establishing trust between the ICT systems of special importance and the competent institutions, so the ICT systems of special importance could be certain that the incident data which they submit will not harm their operations. 5) Public-private partnership Public-private partnership in the field of information security in Serbia exists in the form of an informal group which refers to itself as the Petnica Group. Namely, in mid-2015, the OSCE Mission to Serbia, the DiploFoundation and the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance (DCAF) established a strategic partnership with the Petnica Research Station and held a coordination meeting attended by key public and private stakeholders in the field of cybersecurity. The so-called “Petnica Group” emerged from this meeting and developed, through several stages, into an informal multi-stakeholder group on public-private cooperation, comprised of key national public and private sector stakeholders in the field of cybersecurity, academia and the civil society. From its very start, the Group focused on strengthening cooperation between public and private sectors and developing appropriate policies and strategic frameworks in the field of cybersecurity in the Republic of Serbia7. As regards public-private partnership, the key challenge is finding an appropriate coopderation mechanism, which will link all relevant stakeholders, while enabling operational functioning. Namely, while the Petnica Group operated successfully in the past, its future functioning required a mechanism that would formalise this cooperation and include in it certain acters that have hitherto been excluded, but would make the group operational, as opposed to its largely advisory role in the past, and enable information exchange. The existing form of cooperation within the Petnica Group did not enable the execution of projects that required finance, which limited its performance and rendered it insufficiently operational. For these reasons, in 2020 the Petnica Group transformed itself into the Cybersecurity Network Foundation, and it is expected that, as a registered foundation, it will have access to funding for project implementation in the field of information security. 7 Vodič kroz informacionu bezbednost u Republici Srbiji 2.0 (A Guide to Information Security in the Republic of Serbia 2.0); 49 6) International cooperation Institutions of the Republic of Serbia have had an active role in international activities in the field of information security, whether through bilateral cooperation or cooperation within the framework of international organisations, including the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Telecommunication Union, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance etc. The Republic of Serbia has served a full term on the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) in its composition for 2016-2017. The Republic of Serbia has been a member of the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG) since its establishment in 2018 and actively participates in the Group’s activities. Since 2019, the Republic of Serbia has been a member of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE). In addition to the country’s active role through membership in the above bodies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as one of the authorities responsible for performing activities in the context of development of international cooperation on information security matters, plans and holds bilateral contacts to promote and improve cooperation with other countries in this field and examines all initiatives relevant for information security at national and global levels. in this context, Serbia has also recognised the importance of the French initiative “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”, which we have supported and in whose working groups we intend to actively participate (at present we are only a member of the first working group). Serbia actively participates in the work of the Informal Working Group on cyber security formed under OSCE Decision No. 1039 and has designated its political and technical focal point for cooperation in case of cross-border incidents in accordance with Confidence Building Measure No. 8. The efforts made and the progress achieved in the field of cybersecurity have contributed to Serbia’s acceptance, upon consultations with management of the Informal Working Group and the competent national institutions, of sponsorship of Confidence Building Measure No. 9, which concerns the development of a list of national terminology and definitions of terms in the field of information security. As a result of this activity, Serbia has developed a platform with more than 1000 terms and definitions taken from the legislation of Member States. the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, the Ministry of the Interior and the National CERT take part in implementation of the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance project “Improvement of Cybersecurity Governance in the Western Balkans”, launched in July 2018, which aims to contribute to a more efficient and more responsible governance of cybersecurity in the Western Balkans and improve regional cooperation in this field. The Ministry of Defence continually takes part in international military exercises aimed at establishing and developing information security and cyber defence. An example of such cooperation is the international cyberspace exercise “Cyber Tesla”, which is implemented in cooperation with the public and private sectors of the Republic of Serbia with powers in the field of information security and with members of the National Guard of Ohio. In 2019, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications of the Republic of Serbia, the Regulatory Agency for Electronic, 50 Communications and Postal Services (RATEL) and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, represented by the Embassy of the Kingdom of Norway in Belgrade, signed the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation and strengthening of information security in the Republic of Serbia. The project is being implemented in 2020 and 2021 and encompasses support to the strategic and regulatory frameworks in the field of information security and development of recommendations for Serbia’s critical information infrastructure and purchase and installation of a platform for information security exercises at RATEL. 2. CHANGE ACHIEVED BY THE STRATEGY 2.1 VISION AND DESIRED CHANGE The use of information and communication technologies has become indispensable for all - citizens, public administration and businesses – and largely affects both our daily lives and the economy and the overall business environment. In this context, it is necessary to adapt to the changes stemming from the use of ICT and focus on harnessing it to achieve maximum benefits. With this Strategy we aim to achieve the following: 1. A digitalised public administration capable of efficiently and transparently providing services to citizens and businesses. 2. Improved digital skills of all citizens, who are able to freely use ICT both in their daily lives and in communication with public administration. 3. A transformation of the economy through digitalisation and support for the employment of information technologies towards modernising business operations across all industries. 4. An information security environment with a sufficient level of awareness of both risks and advantages of new technologies for citizens, public administration and businesses. 3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STRATEGY 3.1 OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE STRATEGY The fields of information society and information security are comprehensive and are applied in almost all fields and activities on which development of an economy and a society are based, and which at the same time relate to citizens, the public administration and businesses of a country. The use of information systems in operations of the public administration and businesses is unavoidable, and it is necessary to protect devices, networks, data and also organisations and individuals in order to ensure appropriate security level for such systems. The Overarching Objective of the Strategy is a developed information society and citizen- and business-oriented electronic government, with improved information security for citizens, public administration and businesses. 51 The Overarching Objective of the Strategy will be achieved through the following Specific Objectives: - Specific Objective 1: Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills, strengthening the capacities of public and private sector employees to use new technologies and improvement of digital infrastructure in education institutions. - Specific Objective 2: Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and private sectors. - Specific Objective 3: Improved information security of citizens, public administration and businesses.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 1 Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills, strengthening capacities of public and private sector employees to use new technologies and improvement of digital infrastructure in education institutions An important precondition for development of the information society and eGovernment is improvement of digital knowledge and skills of all citizens, strengthening the capacities of both public and private sector employees for the use of new technologies and improvement of the digital infrastructure in education institutions. Development of digital skills is defined by the Strategy of Digital Skills Development in the Republic of Serbia for the period 2020-2024 (hereinafter referred to as the “Strategy of Digital Skills Development”), and is implemented through Specific Objectives, including: 1) Improvement of digital competencies in the education system, 2) Improvement of basic and advanced digital skills for all citizens, 3) Development of digital skills in accordance with the needs of the labour market, and 4) Lifelong learning for ICT experts To achieve the objectives regarding development of digital skills it is, thus, necessary to start from the education system and ensure conditions for learning and acquiring digital competencies in the education system and to improve curricula and syllabuses accordingly for the purpose of acquiring digital competencies in pre-university education. It is also necessary to accredit digital skills development programmes for citizens, particularly taking into account vulnerable categories such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, poor citizens and persons in rural areas, with continual citizens’ awareness-rising of the need to adopt digital skills. Digital skills are necessary for the majority of jobs and it is necessary to develop employees’ digital skills, including employees in the public administration, and to recognise digital skills linked with specific features of each job. 54 Due to dynamic development of the ICT sector, it is necessary to keep up with the needs of this sector and the entire economy in terms of necessary digital skills, and also to continually work on the improvement of ICT experts and promotion of lifelong learning. The aim of implementation of Specific Objectives and measures of the Strategy of Digital Skills Development is to improve the system which ensures higher citizens’ digital skills through development of computational thinking, provision of skills necessary for everyday life and development of a successful career in the digital economy and ensuring conditions for further improvement of knowledge and skills of ICT experts. Since the above Strategy includes the period from 2020 to 2024, upon expiry of that period a new programme will be passed, which will define objectives and measures in the field of digital skills development until 2026. Until a new programme is passed, measures set under the Strategy and additional measures indicated and set within this Specific Objective will be implemented.

Specific Objective 1. “Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills, strengthening the capacities of public and private sector employees to use new technologies and improvement of digital infrastructure in education institutions” is implemented through measures, including: - Measure 1.1: Improvement of digital knowledge, skills and capacities of citizens and employees through trainings aimed at increased usage of ICT. - Measure 1.2: Promotion of useful, creative and secure usage of information technologies through organisation of educational and media campaigns and prize competitions. - Measure 1.3: Improvement and promotion of the work of the National Contact Centre for Child Safety on the Internet. - Measure 1.4: Improvement of the digital infrastructure in educational institutions. 55 Measure 1.1. Improvement of digital knowledge, skills and capacities of citizens and employees through trainings aimed at increased usage of ICT One of preconditions for popularisation and increased use of ICT in citizens’ everyday life and communication with the public sector is education aimed at improvement of digital knowledge, skills and capacities of citizens and employees. In addition to formal education where digital competencies are acquired, it is necessary to increase the level of digital knowledge through trainings and support programmes, particularly for citizens in vulnerable categories and public servants. Measure 1.1. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 1.1.1: Support programmes for associations through award of funds for implementation of programmes in the field of development of the information society - Activity 1.1.2: Trainings aimed at improving teachers’ competencies in the field of information and communication technologies - Activity 1.1.3: Development and implementation of trainings aimed at improving digital competencies of employees in the public administration - Activity 1.1.4: Popularisation and promotion of the use of ICT through the Serbian- Korean Information Access Centre Measure 1.1.

The second stage of the “Connected Schools” project which will be implemented in the period from 2019 to 2021 will include comprehensive improvement of the information and communication infrastructure in all primary and secondary schools in Serbia. Also, in addition to the needs of primary and secondary schools, it is necessary to work quickly on understanding and providing the necessary digital infrastructure and services that would be purposefully used for the needs of higher education and scientific research activities. Regular cycles of infrastructure improvement are not enough to neutralize the existing digital divide for developed European countries. Given that these needs require significant financial resources, a proactive approach is needed to provide them, which would contribute not only to preserving the value of previous investments, but also to preventing the creation of new technological differences between the Republic of Serbia and developed European countries in relations to national research and education networks. The importance of rapid action lies is the fact that by the end of 2021 in the Republic of Serbia a GEANT hub will be formed with a capacity of several terabytes per second with AMRES access link of 100 gigabytes per second, making the Republic of Serbia an important point on the map. In order to take full advantage of this opportunity, it is necessary to work intensively not only on further development of the computer network, but also on the implementation of high-tech solutions in the field of cloud infrastructure and high-performance data processing (so-called supercomputing) as soon as possible. Measure 1.4. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 1.4.1: Continuation of connection of all central primary and secondary school facilities, cultural institutions and public libraries in Serbia to the AMRES network - Activity 1.4.2: Development of the information and communication infrastructure in primary and secondary schools within the “Connected Schools” project. 58 Measure 1.4.

Training the majority of the population to use ICT ensures shift from classic to e-business and faster acting of the public administration and other electronic service providers. On the other hand, development of the digital infrastructure, particularly in educational institutions, will ensure reliable and safe internet access in all teaching and administrative rooms and for all participants in the education system, which will largely affect the quality of work and the possibility for unobstructed work in the digital environment. The analysis of management capacities – Implementation of the measures requires further improvement of administrative and technical capacities at the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, to ensure that educational programmes intended for improvement of digital knowledge and competencies are at the appropriate level and that they meet the needs in this field, as well as to ensure unobstructed implementation of digitalisation of the infrastructure in educational institutions. The analysis of economic effects – Implementation of the measures contributes to improvement of productivity of the workforce in the Republic of Serbia and to ensuring adjustment to changes in the society and business operations conditioned by the use of new technologies in all segments of the society. The risk analysis – Improvement of digital knowledge and skills is implemented through educational and promotional activities carried out by employees in competent institutions and the main risk for their implementation are capabilities of such human resources. To prevent the risk, it is necessary to plan activities which will support continual advancement of employees, particularly if upgrading of their knowledge is required for the use of new technologies and transfer of new knowledge to target groups included in the Specific Objective 1. 59 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 2 Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and private sectors To ensure the shift from classic to e-commerce, it is necessary to digitalize the entire society, i.e. both public and private sector, through digitalisation of services and business operations. The importance of digitalisation of all segments of the society was best seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to which those parts of the society that did not previously shift to electronic operations suffered and are still suffering consequences, while on the other hand digitalisation and electronic operations proved to be able to fully or partially replace traditional manners of work or schooling. As regards the public administration, the generally accepted principle of public administration development in modern systems is development of the efficient government, as the citizens’ service, through introduction of electronic services, which is defined in the eGovernment Development Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the period from 2020 to 2022, and is implemented through Specific Objectives, including: 1) Development of infrastructure in eGovernment and provision of interoperability 2) Improvement of legal certainty in the use of eGovernment 3) Increasing availability of eGovernment for citizens and businesses through improvement of customer services 4) Opening data in public administration. In addition to the above, digitalisation and provision of public administration electronic services are planned under a number of strategic enactments relating to е-judiciary, е-education, е- health, е-culture, e-business, е-commerce, е-tourism, е-construction and е-agriculture.

Solutions which should be developed in the field of information and communication technologies to improve the work of state authorities and passing of strategic decisions are crucial. In the field of information and communication technologies, the entrepreneurial discovery process highlighted a need for providing the state-of-the-art technologies to capacities for education of human resources and forming additional innovation and research business parks for ICT companies and starts-ups. The implementation of the above priorities is expected to result in establishing the Republic of Serbia as a source of sophisticated high technology products and services for the global market. The Industrial Policy Development Strategy in the Republic of Serbia from 2021 to 2030 defined the Specific Objective “Improvement of Digitalisation of Industrial Production Business Models” and through implementation of planned measures aims to achieve digitally transformed industry of the Republic of Serbia which, together with other measures under the Industrial Policy Development Strategy, strongly supports economic growth and improves the quality of life of its citizens. A Specific Objective of the Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the Republic of Serbia for the period from 2020 to 2025 titled “Development of Economy Based on Artificial Intelligence” includes implementation of measures aimed at successful adjustment of the economy to new business models and new market expectations with marked development of economic operators whose business operations are based on application of artificial intelligence. It can be concluded that development of the ICT sector in accordance with the existing strategic documents is based on several pillars, including: 1) Development of companies and products in the field of information technologies; 64 2) Digitalisation of business operations in all economic activities using ICT; 3) Development of economy based on the use of artificial intelligence; 4) Development of digital skills for the needs of the labour market and strengthening the human resource potential of ICT experts.

Specific Objective 2 “Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and private sectors “ is implemented through measures, including: - Measure 2.1: Development of the information society - Measure 2.2: Support to entry in foreign markets - Measure 2.3: Digital transformation of MSMEs - Measure 2.4: Development of e-business - Measure 2.5: Strengthening capacities for usage of ICT in cultural institutions with the aim of developing and improving the IS and the basis for development of entrepreneurship in culture / creative industries (gaming, applications, multimedia guides) Measure 2.1. Development of the information society Taking into account that the concept of the information society is comprehensive and relates to various segments, it is necessary to continually cooperate with all relevant actors through organisation of expert and other meetings, domestic or international, to keep up with new trends and exchange experts’ opinions on topics in the field of the information society. One of the topis which is becoming increasingly relevant relates to data, or more specifically to data management. Many countries are starting to recognise the importance of data and their value in the economic sense, and, for example, Hungary founded the National Data 65 Management Agency to address this issue systematically. Thus, in order to keep up with the world, it is necessary not only to recognise Serbia’s approach in this field, i.e. to assess the needs, possibilities and risks for various data management models in our country; instead, it is also necessary to identify data of relevance for increasing transparency and citizens’ trust in services based on new technological solutions. Measure 2.1. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 2.1.1: Organisation of expert and other meetings in the field of information society within the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) - Activity 2.1.2: Needs assessment for introduction of the data management system in the Republic of Serbia - Activity 2.1.3: Analysis of readiness and needs of businesses for application of new technologies in business operations Measure 2.2. Support to entry in foreign markets The domestic ICT sector undoubtedly has a large potential, but it is important that domestic economic operators are also presented in foreign markets and to ensure the increase of export of their products and services on those markets. The Centre for Organisation of Fairs, Performances and Events of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia organizes international fairs in foreign countries, which are always used as an instrument of business and development policy and constitute the specific framework for promotional, expert and commercial meetings of economic operators in Serbia. With the aim of promoting and internationalising business operations of economic operators, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, in cooperation with the Development Agency of Serbia and other partners, organizes joint exhibitions of domestic companies in international fairs abroad. One of the manners to promote the ICT sector is organisation of joint bodies for bilateral cooperation, which constitute a mechanism for promotion of export of Serbian products and services, including IT products and services.

Digital transformation of MSMEs To ensure the existing economic operators can develop and remain competitive in the market, it is necessary for them to continually develop and keep up with development of information technologies and recognise the importance of the use of new technologies in their business operations. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia founded the Centre for Digital Transformation (CDT) – a national hub of innovative practices targeted primarily towards micro, small and medium-sised enterprises. The Centre for Digital Transformation ensures efficient and transparent digital transformation of the Serbian economy – through educations, counselling and creation of strategic partnerships with technology providers, on the one hand, and companies which would apply these solutions in their business operations, on the other hand. The CDT has so far implemented three programmes aimed at enabling companies in the SME sector in Serbia and Republic of Srpska to improve their business operations according to the available digital trends (“Digital Transformation Support Programme for MSMEs-2019-2020”) and also to efficiently respond to new challenges in business operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (SPEED 1.0 and SPEED 2.0) One of the conditions for development of innovation of small and medium-sised enterprises in the field of ICT is access to sources of financing necessary for research and development which will eventually result in development of products with a potential for placement on the global market.

Programmes of the Innovation Fund are intended for small and medium-sised enterprises, specifically those at early stages of development and at growth stages, as well as for cooperation with research and development organisations. In addition, by awarding innovation vouchers, the Innovation Fund supports small and medium-sised enterprises in using technical services of research and development organisations. Measure 2.3. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 2.3.1: Digital transformation support programme for MSMEs - Activity 2.3.2: Support to small and medium-sised enterprises for development of innovation in the field of ICT Measure 2.4. Development of e-business The conditions for development of e-business were ensured when the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions and the Law on eGovernment entered into force; however, full implementation of the law requires promotion of institutes and mechanisms laid down by it. It is necessary to increase the use of qualified trust services, particularly qualified electronic certificates, and electronic identification schemes used in electronic services. It should also be noted that unobstructed implementation of the digitalisation process requires significant financial investment in solutions which enable electronic services important for many segments of the society, including economic and production activities. It is necessary to develop modern telecommunication solutions which ensure connection between remote rural areas and remote production plants (factories, farms etc.), and thus enable development of Industry 4.0, i.e. development of precision agriculture. Measure 2.4. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 2.4.1: Promoting the use of qualified trust services - Activity 2.4.2: Support to formation of the Conformity Assessment Body Measure 2.3.

This ensures faster and more efficient business operations and cost reduction for operations of economic operators, public authorities and citizens, modernisation and efficient work of public authorities, easier and safer access to services of public authorities and other entities which are provided electronically, as well as access to more such services. The analysis of management capacities – Implementation of these measures requires further improvement of administrative and expert capacities at the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia and the Innovation Fund, particularly in terms of grant award administration process, with the aim of promoting development of entrepreneurship and start-ups, the education process, counselling aimed at digitalisation of small and medium-sised enterprises and activities aimed at developing e-business, particularly qualified trust services. The analysis of economic effects – Implementation of measures to achieve Specific Objective 2 contributes to reduction of costs of business operations, particularly in the private sector, because the number of electronically available services is increasing, thus reducing certain costs. Digitalisation enables operations to be carried out electronically, without the need to go to windows, to certain institutions and without physical contact, which saves material resources (costs of transport, paper etc.) and time required in classic business operations. The risk analysis – Risks in implementation of these measures exist for the public administration and for the private sector, first in terms of awareness rising on the importance of digitalisation and its advantages and then in provision of necessary infrastructure for its implementation. It is thus necessary to mitigate risks through planned and gradual digitalisation, to ensure appropriate infrastructure, expertise of those who implement it, and also by continual awareness rising of its importance. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 3 Improved information security of citizens, public administration and businesses As new technologies develop, the risks they imply also increase and those risks exist for both citizens and public administration and for businesses. To minimise the risks, it is necessary to undertake steps for awareness rising and improvement of knowledge in this field in order to stimulate citizens to use new technologies and to ensure their use is secure and protected. In addition, it is important to appropriately protect ICT systems, not only those covered by the protection under the Law on Information Security, but also those ICT systems that exist in businesses and are also exposed to attacks and the risk of jeopardising information security. Appropriate implementation of measures and improvement of knowledge and awareness- rising in this field depend also on the capacities of competent institutions in this field, and it is 70 necessary to strengthen those capacities accordingly through training for employees, through more intensive inspection and through development of various forms of cooperation, both within the country and regional and international. Priority areas of the Strategy for the Development of Information Security in the Republic of Serbia for the period from 2017 to 2020 inter alia include the fight against cybercrime and information security in Serbia. However, three new strategies were passed in 2019 which address these fields in more details, including: - The Strategy for the Fight against Cybercrime for the period from 2019 to 2023; - The Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia; - The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia. The Strategy for the Fight against Cybercrime recognised though the Overarching Objective the need for better connecting of all entities covered by the Strategy in the fight against cybercrime through improvement of the legislative framework, capacities, prevention and improvement of national, international and regional cooperation. The Strategy inter alia includes a Specific Objective which relates to improvement of organisational, human resource, technical and operational capacities of authorities responsible for the fight against cybercrime, through activities that include trainings for employees for acting in case of incidents and improvement of their digital competences. Under the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia, security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens is also planned to be protected, inter alia through improvement of cyber security, and includes: - Improvement of abilities and capacities for coordination of tasks directed at achieving cyber security and protection against security risks in information and communication systems, - Formulation of a clear and coherent policy in order to increase resistance of information and communication systems to incidents, - Introduction of a network of entities competent for the fight against cyber attacks and crime, - Development of the general security culture for all citizens in order to raise awareness on the need to increase security of individuals and the society. In addition, the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia states that improvement of abilities and capacities of processing, transfer and protection of information and information and communication systems and defence against hybrid and information warfare techniques in information and cyber space will be continued in the field of cyber security. In view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that Serbia has a comprehensive approach to the field of information security, which includes both information security of ICT systems of special importance and security of the Republic of Serbia, and security of citizens and businesses, which is particularly reflected through the fight against cybercrime. 71 Specific Objective 3 Improved information security of citizens, public administration and businesses Indicator Baseline value in 2019 Target value in 2026 Verification source Global information security index 58 30 International Telecommunication Union report Global Cybersecurity Index - ITU Measures for Implementation of Specific Objective 3 Specific Objective 3 “Improved information security of citizens, public administration and businesses” is implemented through measures, including: - Measure 3.1: Awareness rising and improvement of knowledge of information security for citizens, public servants and businesses. - Measure 3.2: Strengthening capacities of the ICT systems of particular importance for application of safeguards. - Measure 3.3: Measure 3.3: Strengthening capacities of the National CERT, govCERT and CERT of independent ICT system operators. - Measure 3.4: Strengthening capacities of the information security inspectorate. - Measure 3.5: Promoting public-private partnership in the field of information security. - Measure 3.6: Improvement of regional and international cooperation. Measure 3.1. Awareness rising and improvement of knowledge of information security for citizens, public servants and businesses As regards promotion of the topic of information security, findings of the World Bank report state that “in Serbia there appears to be some media coverage of cybersecurity topics, but only in an ad hoc manner and that there is very little presence of the issue of information security in the social media. As regards civil servants, cybersecurity awareness in Serbia can vary considerably, depending on the individual’s environment, but it should be noted many government employees are increasing their level of awareness, in part due to the growth of awareness training in the government. However, a cybersecurity mindset remains uneven across government entities.” The report further states that “in the private sector the mindset depends on the industry and size of the company. The cybersecurity mindset is highest within the larger companies, particularly those with a more international presence, and most if not all the financial services and technology companies.” The fact that a significant percentage of citizens who indicated lack of skills, or even the fact that they do not have Internet access, as a reason why they do not use public administration or e-commerce services, as well as that they did not take some activities on the Internet because they were worried about security, shows the importance of improvement of citizens’ digital competence, and also that in such process, focus should also be the segment of information security. It is 72 necessary to find the right balance between promoting the use of ICT on one hand and awareness rising and improvement of knowledge on the protection against possible risks, abuse or fraud. Improving digital competences on one hand and awareness rising and improvement of knowledge on risks in the use of ICT on the other hand will ensure that a higher percentage of the population use digital services in various fields, which will consequently lead to higher digitalisation of the society and also to significant reduction of costs, both for the citizens and for businesses. The advantages for businesses, particularly small and medium-sised enterprises, from implementation of safeguards for ICT systems are undoubtable, particularly having in mind consequences that enterprises may suffer in case of possible attacks, which in drastic circumstances may even lead to bankruptcy. It is necessary to raise awareness of risks for business operations of companies, and also to raise awareness and improve knowledge of the manners to minimalize these risks. In addition to the obvious need for application of safeguards, awareness of continual strengthening of employees’ capacities is also necessary. This does not include only employees working as ICT experts; instead, this includes all other employees who can, by their inappropriate acting, out of ignorance, contribute to exposure of the system to ICT risk and to occurrence incidents which can significantly jeopardise security of ICT systems and cause severe consequences. Measure 3.1. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.1.1: Organisation and coordination of awareness-raising media campaigns for citizens, public servants and small and medium-sised enterprises on the importance of information security, on risks and safeguards. - Activity 3.1.2: Educations for citizens for awareness rising of information security. - Activity 3.1.3: Development and implementation of compulsory continual training for public servants in information security. - Activity 3.1.4: Trainings for small and medium-sised enterprises on the need and the manner of application of safeguards and the importance of continual strengthening of employees’ capacities, in accordance with national and international standards. - Activity 3.1.5: Development of guidelines on the basic level of safeguards for small and medium-sised enterprises - Activity 3.1.6: Development, harmonisation and expansion of specialised information security courses and programmes on universities and other higher education institutions. - Activity 3.1.7: Creating courses, seminars and lectures on the topic of information security for students in non-technical study programmes such as law, management etc. - Activity 3.1.8: Setting up a platform for awareness-rising and improvement of knowledge on information security through interactive programmes (Cybersecurity Awareness Platform) 73 Measure 3.1.

Improvement of cooperation and strengthening capacities of the ICT systems of particular importance for application of safeguards ICT systems of particular importance, or the so-called critical information infrastructure, are identified by the Law as special and vital because their unobstructed functioning must be maintained, since any obstruction, downtime or destruction of these systems may have significant consequences when they cover a large number of users, a large part of the territory or public security. It is therefore necessary for ICT systems to apply safeguards which provide prevention of incidents, i.e. prevent incidents and reduce damage from incidents which jeopardise exercise of powers and performance of activities. Preconditions for application of safeguards in ICT systems of particular importance include equipment, trained employees, awareness of the importance of application of measures and statutory procedures (security instrument) defining safeguards and responsibilities of employees and the management. 74 A major segment of development of this field is also cooperation between ICT systems of particular importance, in particular those who have similar structure, such as financial, energy and health systems, systems of public authorities etc. One of important novelties introduced by amendments of the Law on Information Security is establishing of the Records of ICT Systems of Particular Importance. To fully implement the Law, it is necessary to establish cooperation between relevant institutions responsible for information security, МТТТ, NCERT and govCERT one hand, and ICT of particular importance on the other hand. This cooperation is important for reporting of incidents which significantly jeopardize information security and which ICT must report, but which rarely occur in practice. It is necessary to inform ICT systems of particular importance through joint meetings on the importance of reporting the incidents, to explain reporting mechanisms and to create mutual trust which will result in mutual benefits. The second novelty of the Law on Information Security relates to submission of all statistics on all incidents that occurred in one ICT system of particular importance. Thus, statistics do not include only data that significantly jeopardize information security and which must be reported; instead, it includes all incidents which occurred, so that comprehensive overview of the situation in this field would be obtained based on their analysis and that measures and activities could be defined for improvement. Measure 3.2. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.2.1: Trainings for employees in ICT systems of particular importance on application of safeguards and acting in case of an incident in an ICT system. - Activity 3.2.2: Organisation of meetings of ICT systems of particular importance according to the sectors to which they belong with the aim of encouraging cooperation and promoting formation of special sectoral CERTs. - Activity 3.2.3: Organisation of international and national meetings, round tables and conferences with the aim of raising awareness of the importance of information security. - Activity 3.2.4: Determining manners and mechanisms for strengthening the capacities of ICT systems of particular importance to achieve the necessary level of compliance with information security requirements (common criteria) within management of all stages of the lifecycle of ICT systems or parts of the systems - Activity 3.2.5: Preparation of brochures, recommendations and other materials with the aim of rising awareness of the importance of safeguards. - Activity 3.2.6: Development of a platform for information exchange between the National CERT and ICT systems of particular importance with the aim of providing information on current risks and threats in the field of information security and promoting good practice examples. - Activity 3.2.7. – Development of an overview of threats based on submitted statistics on incidents and reported incidents. - Activity 3.2.8. – Harmonisation of legislation with EU regulations in the field of information security - Activity 3.2.9. – Development of a self-evaluation form for ICT systems of particular importance 75 - Activity 3.2.10. – Development of a form to assess the level of development of information security in Serbia Measure 3.2.

Strengthening capacities of the National CERT, govCERT and CERT of independent ICT system operators The role of the National CERT, govCERT and CERTs of independent ICT system operators is important from the aspect of cooperation, coordination and monitoring the situation with information security in the country. 76 It is particularly important for the National CERT to be able and has capacities to collect information on risks for security of ICT systems and to timely provide support, warns and give advice to ICT systems of particular importance and also the public. It is also necessary to develop mechanism for cooperation and data exchange between ICT systems of public authorities within the Single Information and Communication Network of eGovernment and govCERT, because those systems have similar structure and the level of development and information exchange could therefore could contribute to their improvement. From the aspect of national security, it is important for independent ICT system operators to have developed capacities and that they are able to defend both their systems and other independent ICT system operators affected by an incident. Measure 3.3. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.3.1: Training for employees in the National CERT with the aim of strengthening capacities for acting in case of incidents. - Activity 3.3.2: Training for employees in govCERT and in independent ICT system operators. - Activity 3.3.3:Establishing of CERT of independent ICT system operators. - Activity 3.3.4: Development of guidelines for acting in case of high and very high risk incidents. - Activity 3.3.5: Establishing a mechanism for information exchange and cooperation between individual CERTs and the National CERT. - Activity 3.3.6: Establishing cooperation between the National CERT, the МТТТ and the Emergency Management Team of the MoI (Emergency Management Sector) for the purpose of recognising a cooperation mechanism in case of high and very high risk incidents. - Activity 3.3.7: Organisation of civil and military exercises - Activity 3.3.8: Setting up of a system for detection of cyber threats Measure 3.3.

Strengthening capacities of the information security inspectorate In addition to promotion and provision of information on legislative provisions, the Law on Information Security is also implemented through inspection which implies control of application of safeguards and verification whether annual assessment of the security situation in ICT systems of particular importance was performed. To increase the coverage of ICT systems of particular importance by inspection, it is necessary to strengthen the capacities of the inspection, namely, to hire new employees and to increase expert capacities of employed inspectors. Measure 3.4. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.4.1: Training for information security inspectors based on prepared needs assessments for trainings with the aim of strengthening capacities for implementation of the Law on Information Security - Activity 3.4.2: Employment of information security inspectors.

Promoting public-private partnership in the field of information security Cooperation between the public and the private sectors is one of the key elements of information security of every country. Namely, limitations which exist on both sides in responses to challenges of information security impose the need to establish partnerships, particularly in case when incidents significantly jeopardise information security. In public-private partnership, finding the appropriate cooperation mechanism is not the only issue; instead, there is also the issue of creating trust between them that will contribute to strengthening of capacities and increasing the level of information security. Measure 3.5. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.5.1: Formation of an expert working group named Information Security Coordination Body. - Activity 3.5.2: Organisation of meetings of the “Cyber Security Network” foundation with the aim of promoting public-private partnership. - Activity 3.5.3: Concluding cooperation agreements between public authorities and private and non-governmental sectors with the aim of implementing projects in the field of information security.

Improvement of regional and international cooperation Just as the field of information security requires cooperation between the public and the private sectors, it also requires both regional and international cooperation because all countries face risks and threats in this field which in some cases can also jeopardise national security. International and regional cooperation mechanisms have been developed to a high extent through activities of various institutions and agencies (ITU, OSCE, DCAF), as well as through various project activities and should be upgraded by concluding bilateral and multilateral agreements which would define joint objectives and activities for improvement of information security. 79 It is also important to continue the already initiated practice of organising international and civil exercises which efficiently strengthen the capacities of institutions and employees for response in case of incidents, with exchange of experiences and practical presentation of the manner of responding. Measure 3.6. is implemented through the following key activities: - Activity 3.6.1: Conclusion of bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements in the field of information security. - Activity 3.6.2: Participation of representatives of competent authorities in international forums and meetings dedicated to information security within the UN, OSCE, GFCE and other international organisations. - Activity 3.6.3: Cooperation with EU institutions and organisations competent for the field of information security (FIRST, ENISA, EU CERT Network etc.) Measure 3.6.

Having in mind the consequences which may occur for citizens and businesses due to inappropriate development of information security, such as identity theft, financial frauds, disabling the functioning of key institutions and ICT systems, it is clear that awareness rising and improvement of knowledge of the protection against risks, application of safeguards for ICT systems of particular importance and strengthening employees’ capacities significantly increase the level of information security and reduce risks. This comprehensively protects citizens, public administration and businesses. 80 Analysis of management capacities – In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to invest significantly in management capacities, particularly in those institutions that are responsible for information security in accordance with the law. Investment in capacities implies continual development of employees and improvement of their knowledge through various educational programmes, participation in conferences and exchange of experiences with other countries. The dynamic nature of this field means that staff adaptation to new challenges that are always present also has to be dynamic; however, these challenges are always new, which makes them even higher and more demanding for acting. Strengthening the capacities of public administration authorities will also be achieved through strengthening of the existing and establishing of new partnerships with the expert and academic sectors and civil society organisations. Analysis of economic effects – On one hand, implementation of these measures increases the costs for the public and the private sectors, which must implement safeguards against potential incidents in their ICT systems, but, on the other hand, potential damage which can result from incidents fully justifies investment and is a kind of saving. Risk analysis – Risks in implementation of the measures exist for education of employees, procurement of appropriate equipment, awareness of the importance of information security and its impact on all segments of life. In order to reduce risks, implementation of campaigns on the importance of this topic is necessary, as well as commitment of competent institutions to plan investment and systematically invest in employees, equipment and protection of their systems, and to continue development of cooperation between all relevant actors in this field, as an important mechanism which is particularly relevant when incidents occur which significantly jeopardise information security. 4. MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGY AND REPORTING ON RESULTS OF IMPLEMENTATION The Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications is responsible for reporting on the implementation of this Strategy through monitoring of the implementation and coordination of public policies in cooperation with competent ministries. The report on implementation of the Strategy is prepared upon expiry of every third calendar year from the date of adoption of the Strategy, in accordance with deadlines laid down by the Law of Planning System.

	"original document": "1      Pursuant to Article 38 paragraph 1 of the Law on Planning System of the Republic of Serbia   (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 30/18),      the Government passes this      INFORMATION SOCIETY AND INFORMATION SECURITY DEVELOPMENT   STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA FOR THE PERIOD 2021-2026      INTRODUCTION      The Information Society and Information Security Development Strategy for the Period   2021–2026 (hereinafter referred to as the “Strategy”) is a cross-sectoral strategy setting out the   objectives of and measures for the development of information society and information security.    With regard to information security, the Strategy is harmonised with the Network and   Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), which provides for the adoption of a national   Information Security Strategy setting out the strategic objectives and priorities with regard to   network and information security.    The importance of information society development was recognised in the Republic of   Serbia more than a decade ago, when the first Information Society Development Strategy of the   Republic of Serbia by 2020 was passed (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 5/10,   hereinafter referred to as the “Information Society Development Strategy), which covered all   priority areas contributing to the development of information society, including: electronic   communications, e-government, e-health and e-justice, ICT in education, science and culture, e-  commerce, the ICT business sector, information security.   Information security, which was addressed as a topic in the Information Society   Development Strategy, has gained prominence in recent years, as the use of new technologies gave   rise and continues to contribute to the ensuing risks. Accordingly, in 2017the Government adopted   the Information Security Development Strategy for the period 2017-2020 (Official Gazette of the   Republic of Serbia No. 53/17, hereinafter referred to as the “Information Security Development   Strategy”), which set forth the principles of information security, the priority areas and the strategic   objectives with regard to the safety of citizens, the economy and the state.    As these Strategies expired in 2020, the development of the next Draft of the Strategy for   the period 2021-2026 commenced pursuant to an initiative of the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and   Telecommunications. The new Strategy was intended to address both information society and   information security, with a view to ensuring continuity in their development and adapting to the   new circumstances stemming from rapid digitalisation and development of new technologies   across all segments of the society.

This background section draws on the following sources:   - Publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of Information   and Communication Technologies in Serbia, 2020;1   - Publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of Information   and Communication Technologies in Serbia, 2019;2   - Cybersecurity Capacity Review Serbia by the World Bank and the Global Centre   for Capacity Building, based on the Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM)   Assessment;   - A questionnaire of the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications sent to   all ministries, which included questions concerning electronic communications, e-  services, application of the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification   and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions and projects in the field of   digitalisation.    - E-Bulletin, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, Electronic   Communications and Information Society Association.    - Development of the Information Technology Industry, August 2019; Milovan   Matijević, Mineco Computers.                                                               1 Upotreba informaciono-komunikacionih tehnologija u Srbiji, 2020, Republički zavod za statistiku  https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G202016015.pdf   2 Upotreba informaciono-komunikacionih tehnologija u Srbiji, 2019, Republički zavod za statistiku  https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2019/Pdf/G201916014.pdf     6      - UNOPS project “Assessment of the cyber security ecosystem in the Republic of   Serbia”      1.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT   STRATEGY      The Information Society Development Strategy adopted in 2010 aimed at developing an   information society focused on harnessing the potential of information and communication   technologies (hereinafter referred to as “ICT”) for increased work efficiency, economic growth,   higher employment and improved quality of life for all citizens of the Republic of Serbia. It   identified the following as the drivers of information society development:   - Open, universally accessible and high-quality Internet access;   - Developed e-transactions, including: e-government, e-commerce, e-justice, e-health and   е-education.   In addition to the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, implementing   bodies for that Strategy were: the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development,   the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, the Ministry of Justice, the   Ministry of Culture and Media, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological   Development, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Interior, the IT and e-Government Office,   the National Bank of Serbia, the Academic Network of the Republic of Serbia and Chamber of   Commerce and Industry of Serbia.   Implementation of the Information Society Development Strategy through the Action Plan   for the period 2018-2019 achieved the following results:   1) The area of e-government, e-health and e-justice:   - Laws and secondary legislation adopted in the field of e-Government and electronic   documents, electronic identification and trust services;   - Improved functionalities, services and service gateway of the e-Government Portal;   - Improved Health Information System;   - A system for electronic data exchange in the judiciary and between the judiciary   and other government authorities.   2) ICT in education, science and culture:   - Improved ICT infrastructure in primary and secondary schools;   - Improved ICT competences of  teachers and employees in public administration;   - Raised awareness of children, parents and teachers in the field of online safety for   children;   - Improved digital services in the field of culture;   - Improved e-Education services;   - Introduction of information technology and computer science in primary schools.   3) e-commerce:   - Legislation in the field of e-commerce adopted;   - A public list of qualified trust services formed and published;   - Instant payment system – IPS NBS system.     7      An analysis of the implemented Action Plan seems to indicate that progress has been made   in these three key areas, primarily with regard to e-government. Prerequisites have been established   for future development of this field through the passing of relevant legislation, including the Law   on e-Government and the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust   Services in Electronic Transactions, together with the accompanying secondary legislation. These   laws introduce legal concepts which will facilitate future development of e-government and e-  transactions.   Furthermore, in the field of health care and the judiciary, information systems have been   developed to expedite the work processes, facilitate data exchange and cut red tape expenses.    A major achievement is the improvement of ICT infrastructure in the field of education,   specifically in primary and secondary schools, as well as in the fields of science and culture, as a   precondition for modernisation of education processes through the employment of new   technologies which will drive the development of digital services.   In the field of e-commerce, normative obstacles to the development of e-commerce have   been eliminated through legislative amendments, followed by activities to raise awareness, educate   on and promote e-commerce to ensure its further progress.    While improvements in the field of information society have been notable, future efforts in   this field will have to be stepped up, especially with regard to further improvement of   infrastructure, development of electronic services and raising citizens’ awareness and digital skill   levels.         1.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY DEVELOPMENT   STRATEGY      The Information Security Development Strategy adopted in 2017 aimed to develop and   improve information security in the Republic of Serbia and maintain an appropriate level of   standards in this field through increased security of information and communication systems, fight   against cybercrime and improvement of information security of national importance.   Implementation of the Information Security Development Strategy through the relevant   Action Plan for 2018-2019 achieved the following results:   1) Area – safety of information and communication systems   - A data exchange system for incident reporting and response established;   - Information security staff recruited and trained;   - Awareness-raising campaign on risks and incident response implemented;   - Annual analysis of the National CERT on cyberspace threats in the Republic of   Serbia conducted.   2) Area – safety of citizens when using technology   - Activities of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for Children conducted,   annual IT Caravan campaigns, ICT Girls’ Day, Digital Class and other similar   activities implemented   - The Law on Personal Data Protection passed;   3) Area – fight against cybercrime:   - Judges and public prosecutors trained on acting in cybercrime cases      8      4) Area - information security of the Republic of Serbia:   - Information security system relevant for national security defined;   - CERTs for independent ICT system operators established.   The development of information security gained momentum with the passing of the Law   on Information Security, which introduced, first and foremost, the main institutional prerequisites   for the development of this field, as well as other prerequisites for a country to establish sound   information security arrangements.   A key achievement of Action Plan implementation is certainly the establishment of an   incident reporting and response data exchange system, as a mechanism to monitor the state of play   in this field.     As awareness raising and improved knowledge of information security, coupled with   capacity building of the relevant staff, were identified as paramount, numerous activities have taken   place (including seminars, conferences, trainings and panels) to raise awareness of incident risks   and incident responses.   Major progress has been achieved with regard to information security of children through   the operation of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for Children.   Implementation of activities under the Action Plan marked the beginning of efforts to build   the capacities of ICT systems of special importance, although it should be noted that there is much   room for improvement in this regard, which will require investment in infrastructure, staff capacity   building and improving the level of knowledge in this field.    Based on the implementation of these Strategies in recent years, the activities and measures   foreseen therein have been identified as appropriate and it is therefore recommended that the   current Strategy build on them and continue with the same efforts towards achieving the stated   objectives.       1.3 USAGE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE   REPUBLIC OF SERBIA      Details of the use of ICT in the Republic of Serbia, as the fundamental indicators of   information society development, are provided in the publication of the Statistical Office of the   Republic of Serbia entitled Usage of Information and Communication Technologies in Serbia,   2020.      1.3.1 Computer Use      Computer use by households – Based on the main findings of this survey, 74.3% of   households in the Republic of Serbia own a computer, which is an increase of 1.2% relative to 2019   and  2.2% relative to 2018.

What were the reasons for not submitting   completed forms online to public   administration?           Based on the survey data, it appears that, while the share of persons obtaining information   from websites of public institutions is high (34.0%), online communication with public   administration is evidently less common (23.9%) since the availability of this service is relatively   modest, given that 76.6% of respondents replied they had no need to submit completed forms.    The Republic of Serbia has created preconditions for the development of e-government by   passing legislation to regulate this area, as well as by forming the IT and e-Government Office, as   the authority responsible for providing the services of the e-Government Portal. The e-Government   Portal is the gateway for e-services for all citizens, businesses and public administration employees   and enables users to perform from their home, without physically coming to a service desk, certain   public administration tasks that have hitherto required them to come to public administration   offices.   The e-Government offers numerous services provided by various institutions, including:      IT and e-Government Office  “Welcome to the world, baby!”   Local tax administration   Ministry of the Interior   Vehicle registration renewal at authorised inspection   garages (service intended for individuals)   Temporary residence registration for foreign nationals   Application for a certificate of (no) criminal convictions   e-Appointment – qualified electronic certificate,   available in 57 municipalities in Serbia   Renewal of firearm registration certificates/firearm   surrender (natural persons)   e-Appointment – identity card of passport, available in   80 municipalities in Serbia   23,9%  25,2%  34,0%  Submission of completed forms  Downloads  Obtaining information from public institution  websites  1,2%  2,8%  4,7%  7,2%  8,1%  76,6%  Concerns about security and personal data…  No online services available on website  Another person did it on my behalf  Other reasons  Lack of skills  No need to submit completed forms    23      Renewal of firearm registration certificates/firearm   surrender (natural persons)   Ministry of Education, Science and   Technological Development   e-Gradebook   e-Enrolment – Electronic enrolment of first-graders   National Health Insurance Fund   Application for issuance of a medical insurance card and   replacement of a medical insurance booklet with a   medical insurance card   Medicines and Medical Devices   Agency of Serbia   Browsing of medicinal products approved for human   use for which the Agency issued a marketing   authorisation   Browsing of medicinal products approved for veterinary   use for which the Agency issued a marketing   authorisation   Browsing of medical devices   Browsing of certificates for batches of medicinal   products approved for human use   Browsing of certificates for batches of medicinal   products approved for veterinary use   Downloading open data on approved clinical trials   Downloading open data on generic names of medical   devices   City of Loznica   City of Valjevo   City of Sremska Mitrovica   City of Niš   Registers of Births      To ensure further development in this field, e-Government Development Programme of the   Republic of Serbia for the period 2020-2022 and the Action Plan for its implementation were   adopted pursuant to a proposal by the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-  Government, as the ministry responsible for the development of e-government. The Programme   envisages public policy measures which will have a major impact both on the operation of the   entire public administration, which is required to act in in accordance with the Law on e-  Government, and on all citizens and businesses.   The e-Government Development Programme states that a key challenge for successful   digital transformation of Serbian public administration is laying the foundations to ensure activities   remain on track and to ensure implementation of the planned measures across all segments of   public administration, in a way which will enable efficient and coordinated functioning of that   system.      1.4.1 e-Justice, е-Education, e-Health and е-Culture      E-JUSTICE – The importance of е-judiciary is also recognised in the Judicial   Development Strategy for the Period 2020–2025 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.   101/20), through the specific objective “Development of е-judiciary”, which envisages further     24      improvements of judiciary e-services to ensure access to justice, improved quality of acting and   decision-making, efficient resource management, statistical monitoring and reporting on the work   of the judiciary and transparency in the work of judicial authorities. The draft Strategy also states   that the use of modern ICTs, standardised software and centralised case management systems at   courts and public prosecutors’ offices is necessary in order to implement the key principles of an   effective judiciary: independence, impartiality, accountability, professionalism, efficiency and   transparency. This calls for continual development of the е-judiciary system, as a mechanism that   facilitates the attainment of all strategic objectives.   In accordance with the Guidelines on ICT System Development in the Judiciary, by   implementing the measures and activities set out in various action plans (including those pertaining   to the Government’s priority objectives, Chapter 23 of EU access negotiation, reform of the Judicial   Development Strategy and the fight against the shadow economy), the Ministry of Justice strives   to apply state-of-the-art information and communication technologies in judicial authorities and   the judicial professions through the implementation of various projects.   Significant progress has been achieved in recent past regarding judicial ICT systems   improvement through projects implemented by the e-Justice Division of the Ministry of Justice,   which enable the provision of various e-services.   Judicial Information System – The Judicial Information System was commissioned in   late 2017, enabling electronic data exchange between judicial authorities, the judicial professions   and other state institutions. The Judicial Information System gives all courts, public prosecutors’   offices, notaries public and bailiffs access to data contained in various registers and records   maintained by the competent institutions (Central Register of Compulsory Social Insurance,   Misdemeanours Records, Administration for the Enforcement of Penal Sanctions, Ministry of the   Interior, Civil Registries, Business Registries Agency, Republic Geodetic Authority, courts of   general jurisdiction, Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, Property Transactions Register,   National Bank of Serbia and Tax Administration.    According to the statistics of the Ministry of Justice, since the commissioning of the system,   users have submitted 4,000,000 electronic inquiries. This expedites the average judicial proceeding   by approximately 3 to 6 months.    ProNep application – The ProNep application has been used since 2018 for the submission   of data and documents by notaries public to the Cadastre, with the functionality of submitting data   and documents to the competent tax authorities was introduced in 2020, making this a “one-stop   shop” for procedures involving property transactions. The ProNep information system has been   established to simplify the procedure and save time and money in administrative procedures   conducted in connection with the transfer of title, including in particular through purchase, sale and   gifting of real estate, as well as probate proceedings etc.   System of electronic communication with the Administrative Court – e-Court – The   e-Court system, commissioned in 2018 and accessible online, enables all parties – both attorneys   and citizens – to fully conduct an administrative dispute electronically. It is planned to include   commercial courts in the e-Court system in the near future, followed by courts of general   jurisdiction. For citizens and attorneys, this system effectively means the court operates 24 hours   a day, 7 days a week, and they no longer have to physically come to the court’s building to deliver   a submission or examine a case file, as everything is available online.     25      Electronic notice board – e-Board – The electronic notice board was commissioned on 1   January 2020 for enforcement proceedings and gives citizens swift and simple online access to an   integrated notice board used in enforcement proceedings. The e-Bord now gives citizens and legal   entities access to all writs in enforcement proceedings which were not successfully served on them   in person by a court or a bailiff.   e-Auction in property foreclosures – The e-Auction system for public online auctioning   of foreclosed property, which is scheduled to be commissioned in 2020, ensures a transparent   procedure for the online sale of foreclosed properties and availability of information to all who are   interested in participating in such procedures.   Central case management system – SAPO (Standard Application for Prosecution   Offices) and SAPA (Standard Application for Prison Administration) – The SAPO case   management information system was implemented to increase the efficiency and transparency of   public prosecutors’ offices and penal and correctional facilities in the Republic of Serbia. While   the system has not yet been implemented at all prosecutors’ offices, the Ministry of Justice, with   the support of EU funds under IPA 2015, is currently implementing the SAPO software in the   remaining public prosecutors’ offices. The SAPO software allows case management throughout   the entire lifecycle of a case, from the initial submission to the passing of a final decision and its   archiving. Furthermore, the same system is also used to implement the SAPA (Standard   Application for Prison Administration) system in all penal and correctional facilities.   e-Payment+ - The Ministry of Justice,  in collaboration with the IT and e-Government   Office, has established a system that gives citizens and legal entities, as well as foreign natural   persons, the option of paying electronically, i.e. online, their misdemeanour fines included in the   Register of Outstanding Fines and Other Pecuniary Amounts.   Case and content management software – LURIS – Luris is a case management   application for international assistance which provides case management functionalities and covers   the entire course and lifecycle of a case, from the receipt of a petition to the preparation of a final   outgoing document and archiving.   With a view to further improving e-services in the judiciary sector, which would ensure   access to justice, improve the quality of proceedings and decision-making and enable efficient case   management, statistical monitoring and reporting on the work of the judiciary and transparency in   the operations of judiciary authorities, reform measures have been envisaged which are   implemented under the Judicial Development Strategy.       Е-EDUCATION – The importance of digitalisation in the field of education is witnessed   by the fact that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development has a   Department for Digitalisation in Education and Science and has been working to facilitate   digitalisation, primarily by purchasing ICT equipment for primary and secondary schools to use   electronic education systems, which has resulted in the establishment of 10,000 digital classrooms.   “Connected Classrooms” project – the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and   Telecommunications has equipped 550 primary and secondary school with WLANs and this   activity continues within the framework of the “Connected Classrooms” project, which will   provide reliable and safe internet access in all teaching and administration rooms at schools, for   each pupil in the education system.      26      e-Gradebook – The e-Gradebook has been designed for and implemented in all primary   and secondary schools in the Republic of Serbia, after appropriate staff trainings necessary for   proper and secure use of the e-Gradebook, which also gives parents/other legal representatives of   pupils electronic access to pupils’ achievements via the “my.e-Gradebook” module.   e-Learning service – The e-Learning service currently offers 13 online courses, with   available expert literature, as teaching support for 53 IT classes for pupils with special needs   learning computer science and information technology at general secondary schools in the Republic   of Serbia. The courses are available on the online platform of the Institute for the Advancement of   Education, which is publicly available, and the material includes syllabuses taught in the 1st,   2ndand 3rd grade of general secondary schools.   e-Enrolment – Services enabling electronic enrolment of pupils in the first year of primary   school and the first year of secondary school have been established in cooperation with the IT and   e-Government Office.   EMIS – To lay the foundations for more efficient resource planning and management and   monitoring of activities in the education system across all levels, activities have been initiated to   establish an Education Management Information System (EMIS).   In the coming period, numerous activities aimed at digitalisation in the field of education   will be continued, as elaborated and specified in the Education and Science Development Strategy   by 2030 and the Action Plan for implementing the programme of the Government of the Republic   of Serbia pertaining to the development and application of the Education Management Information   System, improvement of ICT infrastructure of education institutions, digital capacity building of   all education levels below university, improved digital competences of employees in the education   sector, implementation and promotion of innovative pedagogical approaches involving ICT   integration in the teaching and learning processes, establishment of a system for continual   monitoring of digital education development, building of pupils’ digital competences and   establishment of a digital environment for the development of open education resources, digital   services and teaching and learning support materials.      E-HEALTH – A key priority for the Serbian government is digitalisation of the health care   system, given that is has been recognised as one of the most complex and vital systems, as   corroborated during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Numerous activities aimed at digitalisation in this field have been implemented recently,   including:    e-Prescription – e-Prescription was implemented in March 2019 in all primary health care   institutions, in secondary and tertiary health care institutions where the competences of the chosen   physician are assigned by the law to a specialist physician, as well as in social welfare institutions.    Together with e-Prescription, the e-Therapy service was also implemented to allow chronic patients   to obtain medication for 2 to 6 months, depending on their health status, which reduced the number   of required visits to physicians and pharmacies.    National Prevention and Diagnostics Medical Platform (e-Radiology) – Through the   project of the National Prevention and Diagnostics Medical Platform, the Ministry of Health has   ensured the implementation of a central information system in radiology, which connects all   diagnostic devices, where possible, and gives the radiologist, the chosen physician and the patient   access to images in the form of an electronic medical record, which contributes to cost savings on   image development and increases work productivity.      27      e-Health portal for patients – The e-Health portal of the Ministry of Health is designed to   give patients access to their medical information (reports, prescriptions, radiology images etc.), the   possibility of scheduling appointments, communication with a physician (via video call),   information on PCR tests and information on COVID-19 vaccination.   In addition, activities which are already underway and are scheduled to be completed   include:   Electronic Medical Record – The Electronic Medical Record will enable the exchange of   all medical information relating to patients vertically across the health care network and will give   physicians access to all medical documentation of a patient. The system is expected to be put into   production in June 2021.   e-POS – A system for electronic registration of deaths, which will enable the submission   of data to a registrar for entry in the Register of Deaths, as well as to the Public Health Institute   “Batut” and the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.    e-SickLeave   Extension of the e-Prescription to include medical aids    A platform for phone consultations between physicians and patients   The Government of Serbia has also formed the Coordination Body for Health Case System   Digitalisation, with the aim of ensuring a strategic approach to e-health development. This body is   tasked with developing a National e-Health Development Programme with an Action Plan,   improving the legislative framework and implementing state-of-the-art technology in this sector.       Е-CULTURE – The Draft Culture Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia 2020-  2029 recognises the importance of digitalisation in culture and, accordingly, sets “Digitalisation in   Culture” as a specific objective, which should systemically regulate the process of digitalisation of   cultural heritage and build the capacities of cultural institutions for implementing this process. The   focus will in particular be on digitalisation of archives and development of e-archives, improved   operation of integrated software solutions in the field of culture for the protection of cultural assets,   as well as contemporary artworks.   The following digitalisation activities have recently been implemented:    - All four areas of culture – libraries, museums (galleries), archives and institutes for the   protection of monuments – use integrated software solutions for keeping documentation   on their inventories and cultural assets;   - The Cultural Heritage Browser has been developed, which aggregates data from all four   databases of the integrated software solutions and presents them to the general public;   - In cooperation with the Republic Geodetic Authority, a map of cultural institutions and   cultural monuments visible on the Serbian Geoportal has been developed;   - In cooperation with the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications and the   Academic Network of the Republic of Serbia (AMRES), connecting of cultural   institutions to AMRES is implemented as an ongoing activity;   - Development of an information system for keeping integrated field archaeology   documentation is at the final stage;   - The first dataset in the map of archaeological sites of the Republic of Serbia has been   developed and posted;     28      - In cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and the Customs   Administration of the Ministry of Finance, efforts are underway to develop an electronic   database on stolen and disappeared artwork and historic items;   - Draft Decree on Uniform Technical and Technological Requirements and Procedures   for the Keeping and Protection of Archival and Documentary Material in Electronic   Form is currently being prepared;   - The e-Museum application has been developed to help modernise content presentation   and connect schools and museums. It can also be used in education and in teaching   courses.   The objective of the Strategic Priorities for the Development of Culture of the Republic of   Serbia 2021-2025 in the digitalisation sphere is to close the existing gap in the purchase and use of   modern information and communication technologies, train the staff of cultural institutions and   identify the actual needs for digitalisation of cultural heritage and contemporary artworks.    This objective is implemented through:  1) Normative bylaws governing the digitalisation process, which set out the responsibilities   and competences of cultural institutions and stakeholders in the digitalisation process:   - The Decree on Uniform Technical and Technological Requirements and Procedures for   the Keeping and Protection of Archival and Documentary Material in Electronic Form,   which will set forth the procedures for e-archiving and permanent keeping of electronic   documents, creation of e-archives and harmonisation of the process of digitalisation of   archival material and the existing Integrated Archiving Software Solution (ARHIS)   with the e-archive.   - Guidelines on digitalisation of cultural heritage of the Republic of Serbia aim to define   the technical standards and metadata for uniform and interoperable implementation of   the process of digitalisation of cultural heritage in the Republic of Serbia. Adoption and   implementation of the Guidelines will ensure uniformity in the work of conservation   institutions the digitalisation process.   - The Bylaw on Security of ICT Systems in Cultural Institutions, which is planned to be   adopted, would include all security measures provided for in the Law on Information   Security. It is necessary to adapt the model to reflect the specific nature The model   needs to be adapted to reflect the specific nature of the systems and the actual state of   play regarding system security needs to be determined; furthermore, the current state   needs to be brought in compliance with the recommendations and standards set forth in   the Law and the Decrees.   2) Implementation and development of new services on an artificial intelligence platform,   which would be applied to datasets available in the databases of the Integrated Software Solutions   in the field of culture;   3) Networking of existing integrated software solutions for museums, archives, libraries   and institutes for the protection of cultural monuments and development and upgrading of new   ones;   4) Capacity building of cultural institutions in the digitalisation process through purchase   of modern technology and hiring of digitalisation staff.        29      1.4.2 e-Transactions, e-Commerce and e-Tourism       E-TRANSACTIONS – The cornerstone for developing a more comprehensive and   widespread e-transactions in the Republic of Serbia was laid down with the passing of the Law on   Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions, as   well as the Law on e-Government. These two laws set forth the main legal concepts that enable e-  transactions between public authorities, citizens and businesses.    Electronic document – The Law that the validity, evidentiary power and written form of   a document cannot be contested just because it is in electronic form. This is a crucial provision,   since it reflects the applicable principle and ensures that electronic documents are recognised on   an equal footing with paper-based ones. The provision is also important because it implies that both   paper-based and electronic forms of documents are considered to be made in writing.    The Law also provides for digitalisation of paper-based documents and grants such   documents equal evidentiary power as the original, by providing that documents may be digitalised   by the body passing the document, a notary public or a person designated for digitalisation and   provides for digitalisation in a procedure before a public authority.    These legal arrangements enable the conduct of procedures before public authorities   electronically instead of using paper-based documents, which cuts the use of hard-copy documents,   increases document accessibility and facilitates document searches and use, which ultimately   results in lower costs of hard copies and archiving.    However, while legal prerequisites for wider use of electronic documents and e-transactions   have been provided, replies to a questionnaire which was distributed to all ministries and which 11   ministries answered, have shown that the level of electronic communications with parties remains   relatively low. Namely, 7 ministries have electronic addresses for the receipt of electronic   submissions, while 4 ministries have no such address; also, seven ministries provide electronic   services, while three ministries do not. It was also found that two ministries applied Articles 11 and   12 of the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic   Transactions, which provide for the digitalisation of paper-based documents and almost full   transition to electronic communication and transactions with electronic documents.    Electronic identification – The Law also provides for electronic communication, i.e. the   procedure of using personal identification data which enable natural persons or legal entities to   access electronic services.   The Register of Electronic Identification Schemes has been established pursuant to the Law,   with two such schemes registered thus far by the IT and e-Government Office.    The Law provides for three levels of confidence of electronic identification schemes and it   is paramount to have as many such schemes included in the Register as possible, given that such   schemes may be used in communication with public authorities, since an electronic identification   scheme with a high degree of confidence replaces a party’s signature on a submission, although   this does not preclude the application of other levels of confidence in cases where the law allows   public authorities to use lower confidence levels.   Qualified trust services – Before the Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic   Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions came into force, the Republic of Serbia   used qualified electronic signature and qualified electronic timestamp services. The new Law     30      regulates also the use of other trust services which may be applied and guarantee the authenticity   and integrity of data in a far wider range of e-transactions, including electronic stamp, electronic   delivery, electronic archives, website authentication, cloud signature etc.     Namely, there are seven providers of trust services in the Republic of Serbia, although it   should be noted that most of them have been issuing qualified electronic signatures and qualified   electronic timestamps.    The underlying concept of qualified trust services is that the service provider guarantees   the authenticity and integrity of individual pieces of data created in various legal affairs and   transactions conducted electronically. In electronic transactions, confidence in the authenticity of   data is paramount, to minimise the risks of abuse and data integrity breaches, which is why   qualified trust services have been introduced and granted the highest level of legal guarantees,   based on the high-level technical, security and organisational conditions under which they are   provided. As these services currently include mostly electronic signatures and timestamps, it is   crucial that new trust services gain traction in practice, especially cloud signatures and qualified   electronic delivery services.    As of February 2021, more than 650 thousand valid qualified electronic certificates have   been issued, with approx. 850 thousand certificates issued in total. For this number to increase, it   is necessary on the one hand to popularise the use of certificate, while also enabling the use of an   increasing number of services accessible through qualified electronic certificates. It is expected   that the use of cloud signatures will boost mass acceptance of signatures, as it facilitates access to   services from mobile phones, unlike the previous means of generating electronic signatures, which   many users found to demanding to install and use.      E-COMMERCE – The legislative framework regulating e-commerce comprises the Law   on Commerce (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, number 52/19), the Law on e-Commerce    (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 41/09, 95/13 and 52/19) and the Law on Consumer   Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 62/14, 6/16- new law, and 44/18 – new   law).   The new Law on Commerce, passed in 2019, regulates e-commerce in the Republic of   Serbia. This Law introduces for the first time the concepts of “e-shop”, whereby a retailer sells its   goods directly to the consumer, and “online platform”, which connects sellers with buyers.   Furthermore, the Law also recognises for the first time the business model of “dropshipping”   (which has been used in practice for quite some time), whereby the goods do not physically reach   the retailer and are instead shipped directly from the manufacturer/importer to the consumer. A   major legislative novelty is the introduction of the concept of “mystery shopper”, whereby an   inspector is authorised, in the event of reasonable suspicion that a retailer is unregistered, to carry   out mystery shopping and thus obtain evidence. The Law also provides for the possibility of   granting incentives to e-retailers, which is to be regulated in detail by a bylaw passed by the   Government, with a view to boosting e-commerce development and combating the shadow   economy in the online market.   To promote the development of digital economy and eliminate obstacles to e-commerce   development in the Republic of Serbia, the Government has passed the e-Commerce Development   Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the Period 2019-2020 with the Action Plan. it is the first     31      public policy document in the field of e-commerce development in the Republic of Serbia for the   period 2019-2020. The e-Commerce Development Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the   Period 2019-2020 sets out the specific objectives of improving e-commerce in the domestic market,   as well as programme measures and activities designed to contribute to an improvement across all   segments in the process of online ordering of goods/services, such as payment, logistics, customs,   e-consumer rights etc., which are essential for continued growth and development of this form of   commerce. The set of measures and activities included in this programme document will provide   a boost to all stakeholders in the ecosystem. Specifically, these measures and activities include:   strengthening customers’ trust in e-commerce (media campaigns, consumer guide, improved non-  litigious dispute resolution in e-commerce), strengthening the position of e-retailers (development   of guides for retailers, support to female entrepreneurship, educational courses for retailers), media   education, improved operation of courier services, promotion of electronic payments, improved   work of inspection authorities and greater involvement of the academic community through   stronger cooperation in this field.    The adoption of this Programme was preceded by a comprehensive survey conducted   within the framework of the project “Strengthening e-Commerce in the Republic of Serbia”, the   results of which have identified the key barriers, both on the supply side and on the demand side   (the survey results are incorporated in the section of the Programme providing the background on   e-commerce – the ex ante analysis). The measures and activities set out in the Programme have   been defined to respond to the key challenges and barriers identified by the survey.      E-TOURISM – The Tourism Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia for the   Period 2016-2025 (hereinafter referred to as the “Tourism Development Strategy”) was adopted in   2016. The section providing the background states that implementation of previous Strategies die   not make sufficient use of the possibilities and advantages of information and communication   technologies, the Internet, social networks and platforms to promote Serbia’s tourism offer, as well   platforms for the development of new SMEs and their services.   Accordingly, the Tourism Development Strategy sets out the following objective:   improvement and harmonisation of statistical data collection and processing methodology and   procedures with the international standards and practices, building on the relevant legislative   grounds.    In accordance with the Tourism Development Strategy and taking into consideration the   priorities of digitalisation of Serbian economy and continued development of e-government, the   Law on Hospitality (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 17/2019) provides for the   implementation of a central information system in the field of hospitality and tourism (e-Tourist),   as an integrated and centralised electronic information system containing all relevant data on   accommodation providers and accommodation facilities, which will be used for their recording and   for entry of other data resulting from hospitality, nautical tourism hunting tourism and general   tourism activities.    The primary goals of e-Tourist implementation are to integrate all data on accommodation   providers, accommodation facilities and hospitality establishments, to shorten and cut the number   and costs of administrative procedures, to improve cooperation and data exchange between the   competent state institutions, to increase efficiency of the accommodation charge collection and     32      payment control system and consequential increase in revenues for local self-government budgets   and the national budget, to reduce shadow economy and illegal work (especially by natural persons   providing accommodation services), to improve statistical monitoring of the movement of tourists,   to implement an active marketing policy and to increase competitiveness of Serbia’s tourism offer.    These activities will result in digitalisation of tourism and hospitality through   implementation of modern technologies in the operations of both economic operators and the   public sector.        1.4.3 e-Construction, е-Agriculture      E-CONSTRUCTION – As regards e-construction, significant progress has been made   recently with regard to electronic building permits. Implementation of an electronic building permit   issuance system is based on the new Law on Planning and Construction, and as such poses a key   reform challenge. The key effects of implementation of the electronic building permit issuance   software include faster and cheaper obtaining of permits and a one-stop shop for all permit-related   procedures.   Activities are underway to improve the software and enable faster and easier obtaining of   electronic building documents by adding new functionalities and upgrading the existing ones,   based on needs stated by system users and an analysis of e-document issuance.   Numerous activities are also underway within the mandate of the Ministry of Construction,   Transport and Infrastructure to digitalise processes and procedures concerning Energy   Performance Certificates, spatial and urban planning, inland waterway transport and navigation   safety.      Е-AGRICULTURE – The Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy of the Republic   of Serbia for the period 2014-2024 identifies, as an activity aimed at achieving the strategic   objectives, the development of all types of analytical information systems supporting agriculture,   including any missing parts of agricultural statistics, the public reporting and forecasting service   system, market information, registers etc.   The Directorate for Agrarian Payments plans to digitalise the procedure for granting   subsidies to farmers by implementing an IACS. Subsidies will be granted according to the   procedures and in the manner set forth in the IACS (Integrated Administrative and Control   System), which is used for granting, controlling and monitoring agricultural subsidies (all direct   payments and rural development payments linked to the surface area of agricultural land).   The Directorate for Agricultural Land operates an information system comprising three   web-based applications and one desktop (client-server) application. The two web-based   applications are used in the development and implementation of the Annual Protection Programme   and regulation and use of agricultural land by all local self-government units in the territory of the   Republic of Serbia and the Directorate for Agricultural Land, while one application provides public   access and services, as well as viewing of information on state-owned agricultural land. Plans are   underway to upgrade the existing information system, in order to complete the full set of affairs   and processes within the purview of the Directorate for Agricultural Land.      33      The SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) project, financed from a World Bank   loan, has also been planned.   In 2020, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management also began   implementing the PHRD Grant project “Building Agricultural Sector Capacity for Data-Based   Decision-Making, which will be implemented over the course of 3 years, during which period   software will be purchased to facilitate management of collected data and the process of reporting   on agricultural policy and rural development.      1.4.4 e-Mining and e-Energy      E-MINING – The field of mining in the Republic of Serbia falls within the mandate of the   Ministry of Mining and Energy. The following information systems containing data in this field   have been developed in recent years:   Geological Information System of Serbia (GeolISS) – In the past ten years, the line   ministry has worked on the development of the Geological Information System of Serbia (GeolISS)   as a strategic project, built as an extension on the GIS software platform that is fully user-friendly,   both in terms of system updating with new data and in terms of timely obtaining of necessary   information on Serbia’s geological resources. The aim of GeolISS establishment is to enable digital   archiving of digital data and information and provide a modern and efficient information basis for   all activities involved in planning, designing and decision-making in the field of geology. Users of   this system include the Serbian Geological Institute, the Ministry of Mining and Energy and the   Faculty od Mining and Geology, while the web-based application makes it available to all   interested institutions and citizens of the Republic of Serbia.   The web-based application is scheduled to be further developed and made publicly   available online, whether on a commercial basis or with unlimited access; while this will   commercialise the service, the benefits of this move will be reflected in increased usability of the   system.    Central Information System for Geological Exploration and Mining (CIS GEM) –   Under the project “IMIS - Integrated Management Information System”, the Ministry of Mining   and Energy has developed and implemented the Central Information System for Geological   Eploration and Mining (CIS GEM). The project has been developed on the GIS software platform,   as a modern information system used for maintaining a cadastre of exploration and mining fields   in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The CIS GEM provides for the generation, classification,   maintenance, presentation and distribution of numeric, descriptive and spatial databases on:   approved geological explorations; certificates of reserves; mining approvals; cadastre of   exploration and mining fields; cadastre of ore deposits and balance of mineral raw materials;   cadastre of mining works and facilities; cadastre of mining waste and disused, rehabilitated and   closed mines; archival documentation and approvals, licences and certificates etc. The web-based   GIS application found on the Ministry’s website enables access and searching by public users, as   a testament to transparency of the Ministry’s operations.         34      E-ENERGY – In addition to mining, the Ministry of Mining and Energy is also responsible   for public administration affairs pertaining to the energy sector, energy policy and energy   development planning. Information systems have been developed in this field as well, including:   Central Register of Pressure Equipment (CROPP) – Development of the Central   Register of Pressure Equipment began in 2012 under the auspices of the Ministry of Mining and   Energy. It is a database of pressure equipment and includes data on inspections and tests of pressure   equipment carried out by designated bodies. in this way, the Ministry of Mining and Energy, which   incorporates the Pressure Equipment Inspectorate, has complete access to information on the state   of pressure equipment in the entire country, with the exact characteristics and location of each item   of pressure equipment and with the possibility of searching pressure equipment data based on any   criterion (e.g. municipality, equipment manufacturer, year of manufacture, equipment owner, type   of pressure equipment or any other criterion). Last year, the CROPP was linked to the Business   Register Agency’s system.    Energy Management Monitoring and Implementation Information System (SEMIS)   – The SEMIS is an information system used for monitoring energy management system   implementation operated by the line ministry, which comprises data on the obligations of obligors   in accordance with the Law on Energy Efficiency and Rational Energy Use. Furthermore, the   system also collects and stores excerpts from energy inspection reports, as well as information on   licensed energy managers and licensed energy advisors. In parallel with this, the SEMIS enables   the Ministry to compile analytical reports on energy consumption and other parameters of the   energy management system.    Information System for Energy and Water Consumption Monitoring and Analysis   (ISEM) – The ISEM is an information system for energy and water consumption monitoring and   analysis in public buildings. It is used for energy management purposes and is administered by the   line ministry. The ISEM is intended primarily for monitoring and analysis of data on consumption   and costs of energy, fuel and water in public buildings under the responsibility of local self-  governments, provinces and the central government and is also used for the establishment of a   national database on energy, fuel and water consumption in public buildings.    Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) – The IMIS is a database used for   collecting and obtaining energy data relating to the production, imports, exports and consumption   of energy and fuel in the territory of the Republic of Serbia and serves as the basis for the   development of the Energy Balance of the Republic of Serbia. Data are collected electronically on   a monthly and annual basis from energy operators in the fields of electricity, heating, renewables,   coal, oil, oil products and natural gas. It is also used in the compiling of monthly Reports submitted   by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia to Eurostat in compliance with the EU Regulation   1099/2008 on Energy Statistics.    Information system for monitoring and verification of realized final energy savings –   MVP (monitoring and verification platform) is an information system for systematic monitoring   of energy savings as a result of implementation of plans and programs in the field of energy   efficiency in accordance with the Law on Energy Efficiency and Rational Energy Use. The   application is intended for online data entry from projects on energy efficiency measures and   automatic calculation of energy savings, CO2 emissions and investments by local governments and   public institutions and companies.     35         1.5 ICT SECTOR      A key distinguishing feature of the ICT industry, apart from the fact that it has been the   fastest-growing sector in the past 10 years, is its applicability across all other sectors.    The main characteristics of this sector are described in the “E-Bulletin” of the Electronic   Communications and Information Society Association of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry   of Serbia4, which covers employment, salaries, foreign trade and foreign direct investment.    Trends concerning the number of IT companies, the capital of the Serbian IT industry,   exports of computer services and the state of play and outlook for start-ups in this field have been   adapted from the survey Development of the Information Technology Industry.5   Employment – The total number of employees in electronic communication and   information society industries in Q3 2020 according to SORS figures was 94,105, which was a   9.5% increase relative to the same quarter of 2019. Employees in the electronic communication   and information society account for 4.4% of total employment. In terms of industrial activities, the   highest share of employment was reported in computer programming, consulting and related   activities (36,430), with a 13.7% increase. High numbers of employed persons were also reported   in postal activities (18,239) and telecommunications (16,017). The lowest number of employees   was reported in information services (4,470), where year-on-year employment growth was 20.3%.   (source: e-Bulletin of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia).   Salaries – Between January and October 2020, the highest average monthly salary was   reported in computer programming, consultancy and related activities – RSD 212,093 (158.5%   above the national average) and in the field of telecommunications – RSD 126,226 (53.8% above   the national average). The lowest average monthly salary was reported in gambling and   bookmaking – RSD 63,703, which was 22.4% below the national average; this activity also had   the lowest year-on-year salary growth at 3.1%, with a 1.5% salary increase in real terms during the   same period (source: e-Bulletin of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia).   Foreign trade – According to the NBS figures, income generated from exports of   computer, information and postal services in 2020 reached approx. EUR 1.5 billion (identical to   the figure for the same period of 2019), of which 91.4% was generated from exports of computer   services (approx. EUR 1.3 billion), while 6.7% was generated from exports of telecommunications   services (EUR 96.7 million). Imports were also comprised mainly of computer services (75.7%, or   EUR 409.0 million), with the total value of imports of telecommunications, computer, information   nand postal services reaching EUR 540.6 million in the same period. A surplus of EUR 909.4   million was reported (up 14.2% from 2019). According to the SORS figures, exports of computers,   communication equipment and software in 2020 reached EUR 108.9 million, while imports stood   at EUR 648.4 million, with an export-to-import ratio of 16.8%.     Foreign direct investment – According to the preliminary NBS figures, total net FDI   inflow into Serbia from investment by non-residents in 2020 reached EUR 3,014.2  million. In   2020, the Information and Communications Sector generated net FDI inflow from investment by                                                               4 E-bilten IV kvartal 2020, Privredna komora Srbije, Udruženje za elektronske komunikacije i informaciono društvo;   5 Razvoj industrije informacionih tehnologija, avgust 2019; Milovan Matijević, Mineco Computers     36      non-residents of EUR 41.8 million, while the Manufacture of Computers, Electronic and Optical   Products received EUR 10.8 million in investment. (source: National Bank of Serbia).   Number of IT companies – In 2018 there were 2,349 active companies in Serbia with an   individual annual income of more than one million dinars. In terms of business activities, the   highest number was that of programming companies (1,483), which accounted for 63% of the total   number. In terms of size, a majority of IT companies are micro businesses (with fewer than 10   employees), which accounted for 77.9%. On the other hand, only 11 companies were categorised   as large (with more than 250 employees).   Relative to 2011, the total number of active IT companies in 2018 increased by nearly 700.   Of more than 200 new companies registered each year, half of them (about 100) begin operating,   while some 50 will either withdraw from the IT sector or file for liquidation due to bankruptcy or   merger. New companies will emerge from new ideas, innovation, in incubators etc.   Effectively, it can be said that programming companies are the sole drivers of IT industry’s   vitality. Following year after year of growth, the number of active companies currently stands at   1,483, which accounts for 63% of the total number – far more than 32% of the total number as   reported in 2011 (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry).   Capital of Serbian IT industry – In 2018, the IT industry had EUR 674 million of own   capital, with an annual growth of 16.0%. For the second consecutive year, IT industry’s capital has   seen double-digit growth. Furthermore, relative to 2006, when own capital amounted to approx.   EUR 150 million, Serbian IT industry is now worth 4 times more. This trend is spurred by foreign   capital, which is already highly represented in the Serbian IT scene (source: survey Development   of the Information Technology Industry).         Structure of IT industry’s capital by activities 2018         Programming companies have the highest capital – more than EUR 376 million –   accounting for 56% of IT industry’s total capital. A distant second (EUR 173 million; 26%) is the   IT services sector.   Of the 100 largest IT companies, nearly half are foreign-owned. Foreign companies bring   international standards to the Serbian IT sector; however, this also requires adaptation and, in some   Wholesale and  retail; 11%  IT services;  26%  Programming; 56%  PC equipment; 7%  Wholesale and retail  IT services  Programming  PC equipment    37      ways, localisation of foreign IT companies, if they wish to be successful in the Serbian IT market   (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry).   Exports of computer services – Computer services are used globally as an indicator for   international comparison between countries and their respective levels of technological   development. Serbia’s domestic IT services market has been growing at an annual rate slightly   higher than 10%, while on the other hand exports of computer services have grown at a rate of   more than 30% per annum. This improves Serbia international image, from a country of cheap   labour to a country with high-quality human capital (source: survey Development of the   Information Technology Industry).         Exports of computer services from 2010 to 2020         According to WTO figures, global exports of computer services between 2014 and 2017   increased at an annual rate of 10%, reaching EUR 300 billion in 2017. In 2014 Serbia ranked 40th,   while 2016 figures ranked it 38th, and estimates for 2017 indicate it progressed further by one or   two places. In comparison with the neighbouring countries, measured by the value of exports of   computer services, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria rank higher, while all other neighbouring   countries rank below Serbia.   Serbia accounts for approx. 0.3% of global IT services exports and there is room for further   growth; however, this will require IT experts, who are in short supply. For example, to reach EUR   2 billion in IT services exports, assuming the existing operating model, the sector will need to hire   30,000 additional IT experts (source: survey Development of the Information Technology Industry).   Start-ups: state of play and outlook – As regards start-ups, it can be said that the “start-  up virus” is beginning to spread across Serbia, as evident from the fact that 188 programming   companies had been registered in 2015, while 2017 already saw a significantly higher number of   start-ups (253), followed by 281 in 2018; thus, it can be expected with a high degree of certainty   that 2019 will set an all-time record with more than 300 programming start-ups. A majority of new   companies are oriented towards the global market. However, starting a business is not all plain   sailing, as evident from the fact that, out of the 749 programming companies formed from 2016   and 2018, 311 still have no employees and no income. In terms of conditions for growth, an even   127 166 225  296 344 455  590  760  1016  1270 1326  0  200  400  600  800  1000  1200  1400  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020  Exports    38      more significant indicator is the fact that most Serbian IT enterprises take more than a decade to   develop from a start-up to a large company. On average, every year about ten micro enterprises   grow to become small enterprises, three small enterprises become medium-sized, while only one   enterprise succeeds in becoming a large company with 250 or more employees (source: survey   Development of the Information Technology Industry).   Challenges – It would appear that Serbia provides a sound foundation for starting a   business in the IT industry, as it boasts a high-quality workforce; however, local workforce is   capable of driving the growth of domestic companies only up to a certain level. On the other hand,   foreigners come to this market primarily for the high-quality IT human resources, while all other   sources of their growth are found outside of Serbia.   For these reasons, the largest battle between IT companies in the local market is for   attracting appropriate  workforce: until a year or two ago, they competed for the best experts, while   currently they compete for the best interns, as labour demand exceeds by far the supply. In such a   situation, salary figures become the main “competitive edge” of an employer, and in this regard   capacity takes precedence over quality, with international companies still offering more attractive   packages. This, in turn, answers the question why domestic IT companies grow at a slower rate   than the foreign-owned ones, which also bring access to international markets and finished or semi-  finished solutions. Foreign employers tend to aim for maximum productivity at a minimum cost,   while the value added chain of their operations is usually located outside of Serbia (source: survey   Development of the Information Technology Industry).         1.6 INFORMATION SECURITY      With the development of new technologies and services, which are increasingly provided   electronically, there is an increased demand for stepping up the level of information security. In   Serbian legislation, the concept of information security was primarily associated with the   information security of ICT systems of special importance in accordance with the Law on   Information Security; however, it is increasingly becoming an important segment for both citizens   and businesses, coupled with growing awareness of its importance. However, information security   risks affect both the government, specifically the ICT systems of special importance, and citizens   and businesses, who bear the brunt of cybercrime attacks.       1.6.1 Information security of citizens      The module “Trust, Security and Privacy” in the SORS survey provides data on information   security of citizens and the risks and threats to which they have been exposed.6   The survey asked the following four questions:                                                                   6 The source of data on e-skills is the publication of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia Usage of information  and communication technologies in the Republic of Serbia, 2019   https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2019/Pdf/G201916014.pdf    https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2019/Pdf/G201916014.pdf   39             84,8%  8,1%  7,0%  3,8%  1,7%  0,5%  0,4%  0,3%  0,3%  None of the above  Receiving fraudulent messages (phishing)  Being redirected to fake website asking for personal information (Pharming)  Your social network or e‐mail account being hacked and  content being posted or sent without your knowledge  Loss of documents, pictures or other data due to a virus or other threats  Online identity theft (somebody stealing your personal data and impersonating you)  Children accessing inappropriate websites  Misuse of your personal information available on the Internet  Fraudulent credit or debit card use  Have you experienced any of the following security-related issues when   using the Internet for private purposes in the past 12 months?  93,5%  6,5%  NO  YES  Have you experienced financial loss in   the past 12 months resulting from   identity theft, receiving fraudulent   messages or being redirectred to fake   websites?  56,9%  42,3%  0,8%  No  Yes, automatically or manually  Don't know  Do you make backup copies of you files   on any external storage device or   online (cloud services) for private   purposes?    40           An analysis of survey results reveals that very few persons have experienced security-  related issues online and, among those who did, the most common cases involved receiving   fraudulent messages (8.1%) and being redirected to fake websites. Among the victims of identity   theft, those who received fraudulent messages and those who were redirected to fake websites,   6.5% stated they had suffered financial loss as a result.    Furthermore, due to security concerns, 17.5% of respondents did not order goods or services   online, 16.8% did not use online banking, and 16.6% did not provide personal information to social   or professional networks.    As regards creating backup copies of files, 56.9% of respondents do not make backup   copies, while 42.3% make backup copies, either automatically or manually.   Judging by the data presented above, it would appear that there is a strong case for raising   citizens’ awareness of information security. Namely, raising awareness of the risks and the ways   to protect oneself online is essential to improve knowledge and promote the use of ICT, electronic   services, online banking, e-commerce etc. In addition, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there   is a clear correlation between digital competences and information security, corroborating the need   to raise awareness and knowledge of these matters.   Information security of children – Information security of children in the Republic of   Serbia was originally regulated by the Decree on Safety and Protection of Children when Using   Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as the “Decree”), while   amendments and supplements to the Law on Information Security expanded its application to   include also this subject matter.   The Law and the Decree set forth measures for the online safety and protection of children,   which are implemented through the activities of the National Contact Centre for Online Safety for   Children (hereinafter referred to as the “National Contact Centre”).   75,0%  17,5%  16,8%  16,6%  7,6%  5,4%  3,8%  Other  Ordering goods or services online  Online banking  Providing personal information to social or professional networking services  Communication with public services or administrations  Downloading software or applications, music, video files, games or other data files  Internet access via a public WiFi  Have security concerns limited or prevented you from doing any of the   following activities online for private purposes in the past 12 months?    41      The National Contact Centre plays a key role primarily in the prevention and raising of   awareness and knowledge of the advantages and risks of using the Internet and ways of using the   Internet safely. Preventive measures for the online safety and protection of children are   implemented through education and provision of information to children, parents and teachers by   the National Contact Centre, as well as jointly with the competent authorities and institutions,   schools, the media, civil and private sectors, academia, prominent individuals in modern art and   creative industries and other stakeholders.   As of 31 December 2020, educators at the National Contact Centre held 394 presentations   in primary schools for children and parents, which were attended by 14,667 pupils and 5,074   parents, and 12 education workshops in secondary schools for first- and second-year pupils. Since   October 2020, they have also held 5 webinars/trainings for teachers, which were attended by 190   teachers.   A highly effective way of raising awareness of the risks involved in using the internet has   been proven to be the media campaign implemented continually by the Ministry of Trade, Tourism   and Telecommunications in collaboration with the public broadcasting service, which brings the   subject matter of security closer to children, as well as their parents, in a way that is both   entertaining and instructive.   Apart from prevention, the National Contact Centre is also the central point for reporting   online security threats, which are then forwarded, depending on the type of threat to the child’s   rights and interests, to one of the relevant institutions: the Ministry of the Interior, the Office of the   Special Prosecutor for Cybercrime, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological   Development, social work centres and medical centres.   As of December 2020, the total number of communications registered at the National   Contact Centre since its formation via phone calls, e-mail, online reporting on the site and social   networks is 20,050.   In 2016, the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications launched the school   campaign “IT Caravan”, which promotes the benefits of using the Internet and new technologies   in education and warns against threats arising from their incorrect and unsupervised use. The “IT   Caravan” was launched as part of the information society development platform entitled “Smart   and Safe”. The campaign has been implemented for three consecutive years and has comprised   lectures, presentations, plays and competitions for fifth- and sixth-year pupils from 83 primary   schools from all Serbian cities. It also featured programming and robotics workshops, with   educational materials such as brochures and leaflets containing information and warnings against   online threats distributed to pupils. More than 13,000 pupils participated in the programmes   directly, while live online broadcasts were watched in 2018 by pupils from 800 schools, plus   another 1,135 pupils competing in the pre-selection quiz in 2019. The campaign also included   lectures for parents and, in addition to the events held at schools and cultural and sports centres, in   technology hubs and at the Petnica Research Station, there were also promotional actions in city   squares and in other communal areas.     The comprehensive approach to the issue of information security of children taken in the   Republic of Serbia, including the regulation of this area by laws and regulations, the establishment   of preventive action mechanisms and identification of key stakeholders in this area, has proven   itself as highly satisfactory, although it should be noted that further improvement in this area will     42      require additional capacity building of the National Contact Centre staff, improved cooperation   between relevant institutions and provision of training to the staff of those institutions.       1.6.2 Information security of businesses      As regards information security of businesses, it should be noted that this group includes   the so-called ICT systems of special importance, which are required under the Law on Information   Security to implement security measures to maintain the information security of their systems at   an appropriate level and reduce the risk of incidents, as well as those that are not subject to that   Law, which means that the issue of information security is to them an issue of their awareness of   the significance and importance of information security, especially in terms of consequences that   may arise.   The “ICT Security” module in the SORS survey pertains to the application of certain   security measures by enterprises to protect from incidents.     82,3%  73,6%  72,0%  63,2%  35,9%  34,3%  31,6%  22,9%  21,6%  10,1%  Keeping the software (including operating systems)  up‐to‐date  Strong password authentification, minimum length of 8 mixed characters, changed periodically  Data backup to a separate location (inlcuding backup to the cloud)  Network access control (management of access by devices and users to the enterprise's network)  Maintaining log files for analysis after security incidents  VPN (Virtual Private Network extends a private network across a public network to enable secure exchange of data…  Encryption techniques for data, documents or e‐mails  ICT risk assessment, i.e. periodical assessment of probability and consequences of ICT secruity incidents  ICT security tests (e.g. performing penetration tests, testing  security alert system, review of security measures, testing …  User identification and authentification via biometric methods implemented by the enterprise (e.g. based on…  Does your enterprise use any of the following ICT security measures?    43      Does your enterprise make employees aware of their obligations in ICT security related   issues in the following ways?

On the other hand, very   few enterprises use biometric methods for user identification (10.1%), run ICT security tests   (21.6%) and conduct assessments of ICT risk and consequences of ICT security incidents (22.9%).   It is also noticeable that, in terms of enterprise size (small with 10-49 employees, medium-sized   with 50-249 employees and large with 200 or more employees), ICT security measures are most   commonly employed by large enterprises, while the share of small enterprises that do so is the   lowest. This is probably due to the fact that large companies have greater technological and human   resources capacities and are mostly categorised as ICT systems of special importance, which is   why they have a duty to apply security measures in accordance with the law.   As regards making employees aware of ICT security issues, only 15.0% of enterprises   require compulsory courses or compulsory view of material for employees, while 37.9% provide   voluntary trainings or internally available information. The survey results indicate that 23.0% learn   of ICT security issues through contract. Once again, in terms of enterprises size, most large   enterprises provide compulsory and voluntary trainings, while most medium-sized enterprises   make their employees aware of ICT security issues through their contract.   ICT system security activities are outsourced at 54.3% of all respondents, although it should   be noted that, out of that percentage, small companies tend to outsource these activities more   commonly than others, while outsourcing is the least common among small enterprises, which is   understandable given that small, as well as medium-sized enterprises usually do not have   employees hired specifically to ICT posts.   From the survey results it is evident that there is significant room for improving information   security for small businesses. It is necessary in particular to focus the measures on small and   medium-sized enterprises, especially with regard to staff capacity building and raising awareness   f the fact that information security must be an indispensable part of everyone’s business, regardless   of the size of their enterprise or their industrial activity, to ensure incident prevention and   protection.      1.6.3 Information security of ICT systems of special importance      Legislative framework – The Law on Information Security in the Republic of Serbia was   first passed in 2016 in accordance with the then Draft Network and Information Security Directive,   hereinafter referred to as the “NIS Directive”). The Law defines the term “information security” as   a set of measures enabling the protection of data managed in an ICT system from unauthorised   access and protecting the integrity, availability, authenticity and indisputability of such data so the   system could operate as intended, when intended and under the control of authorised officers.      26,7%YES  Does your enterprise have document(s) on measures,   practices or procedures on ICT security?    45      Thus, the Law regulates the information security of those information systems that have   been recognised as ICT systems of special importance and must therefore be appropriately   protected,  which implies the employment of technical, organisational and human resources-related   measures, as well as compliance with other statutory obligations regarding incident reporting,   submission of statistical data, regular ICT system audits etc..    The Law, and also the accompanying secondary legislation passed the same year, regulates   the following areas:   - Defining ICT systems of special importance;   - Defining security measures applicable to ICT systems of special importance;   - Establishment of the Information Security Coordination Body;   - Establishment of the National CERT, the  CERT’s of public authorities and the   CERTs of independent ICT system operators;   - Defining of a list of incidents posing significant threats to information security and   mandatory incident reporting,   - Establishment of the information security directorate,   - Cryptosecurity and protection from compromising electromagnetic radiation   performed, and   - A possibility of establishing and recording special CERTs.   Application of the Law and secondary legislation – Given that the field of information   security was first regulated by the law passed in 2016 and the accompanying secondary legislation,   its application will require an extended period of time and has not yet been fully achieved.    Although application of the Law began immediately after its passing, it was found that   legislative amendments and supplements would have to be made to ensure compliance with the   NIS Directive which had been adopted in the meantime, as well as to improve some of the existing   solutions with a view to more effective implementation of the Law in practice.   The amendments and supplements to the Law on Information Security adopted in October   2019 introduce novelties concerning the following:   - The National CERT, its powers and required capacities;   - Involvement of the National Bank of Serbia in the work of the Information Security   Coordination Body;    - Establishment of the Record of Operators of ICT Systems of Special Importance;   - Introduction of the duty to submit statistical data on incidents occurring in the ICT   systems of special importance on an annual basis;     - Cooperation of CERTs in the Republic of Serbia;    - Protection of children in the use of information and communication technologies;   - Classification of incidents and responses by the competent authorities depending on   the threat level of each incident.   Challenges for information security – Regarding ICT systems and their protection,   certain challenges still remain, including:   1) Application of security measures by ICT systems of special importance;   2) Capacities of the National CERT, the  CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs   of independent ICT system operators;   3) Capacities of the information security inspectorate;     46      4) Incidents posing significant threats to information security;    5) Public-private partnership;   6) International cooperation.      1) Application of security measures by ICT systems of special importance      The Law specifies which ICT systems are considered to be ICT systems of special   importance, namely those system which, if severely compromised, could have consequences both   for the functioning of the organisations that manage them and for the rights and interests of citizens   and businesses, as well as for national and public safety.     ICT systems of special importance, in particular those operated by public authorities, face   issues in the employment of security measures for various reasons, including:   - Lack of staff;   - Lack of staff with appropriate levels of knowledge;   - High employee turnover;   - Inadequate equipment;   - Insufficient management awareness of the importance of information security.   The same challenges are also faced by the ICT systems of special importance falling within   the group of ICT systems performing activities of general interest that are mainly owned by the   private sector (finance, energy, telecommunications etc.); however, the risks they face are certainly   far less severe, as the risks of incidents in these systems can have consequences both in financial   terms and in terms of inability to provide services to a large portion of the population, which is   why the level of awareness in the case of these systems is much higher and they also enjoy greater   management support in the application of security measures.    The World Bank report also states that “up-to-date technical security controls are deployed   in all sectors of Serbia, although the level of implementation can vary depending on the sector or   size of the establishment.” It is noted that in the public sector it is common practice to apply controls   such as automatic software patching and anti-virus updating, firewall management, offsite storage   of backups and physical security controls, as well as some limited use of intrusion detection   systems. It is also noted that the networks are monitored for unapproved devices and workstations   are secured so that users are unable to install unapproved software. “A similar environment exists   in the private sector, although the variation in deployment is much greater. Financial,   telecommunications and larger institutions deploy a much broader range of controls and exhibit a   much deeper knowledge not only of the importance of these controls, but also have the skills and   financial resources to deploy them. It was noted that mid-sized, and some smaller, enterprises   outsource their ICT operations, and therefore depend on their provider to ensure the security of the   environment.”       2) Capacities of the National CERT, the  CERT’s of public authorities and the CERTs of   independent ICT system operators      The National CERT was established in 2017 and its capacities have since been increased   in terms of staffing level, equipment and premises. This is witnessed by the fact that the National     47      CERT has become a full member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), as   the world’s largest organisation in this field, with 520 members from 95 countries, aiming to   connect the CERT teams worldwide and establish information exchange channels. In addition, the   National CERT is also accredited on the Trusted Introducer list of CERTs from all over the world.    Investment in the capacities of the National CERT is still needed and it is expected that the   newly-adopted provisions of the Law on Information Security pertaining to the capacity of the   National CERT will drive further improvement of its operations.   In addition, it is paramount to build the capacities of the public authority CERT tasked with   incident protection in the ICT systems of public authorities. A significant number of public   authorities are considered to have ICT systems of special importance and are included in the Single   e-Government Information and Communication Network and, in this context, it is crucial to   establish information exchange mechanisms with the public authority CERT, as well as to improve   its incident response capacities.   Independent ICT system operators are required under the Law to form a CERT to manage   incidents in their systems. Recently, the CERT of the Ministry of the Interior achieved significant   results in terms of international cooperation, becoming a full member of FIRST (Forum of Incident   Response and Security Teams) and receiving accreditation on the Trusted Introducer list of CERTs   worldwide. Since not all ICT system operators have formed their CERTs, it is necessary to provide   optimum conditions and support their formation, including through support to the teams that have   already been formed, such as the CERT of the Ministry of the Interior.   Since the Law provides that the National CERT, the  CERT’s of public authorities and the   CERTs of independent ICT system operators are to maintain continual cooperation, this   cooperation mechanism needs to be implemented to enable sharing of experiences and knowledge,   as well responding to certain incidents. This includes in particular incidents of national importance,   which is why it is necessary to establish cooperation protocols, designate contact persons, develop   incident response procedures at all levels and hold regular exercises in this segment.      3) Capacities of the information security inspectorate      The Law on Information Security provides that the information security inspectorate shall   be tasked with inspecting the application of the Law and the activities of operators of ICT systems   of special importance. The Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications hired an   information security inspector in 2018; however, inspection activities did not begin until 2019. As   of December 2020, 34 inspections have been inspected in total.   Given the number of ICT systems of special importance, it is clear that a single inspector   is not sufficient to conduct the inspections, which is why it is impossible to verify whether the   number of ICT systems compliant with the Law and the statutory security measures has increased.      4) Incidents posing significant threats to information security      The operators of ICT systems of special importance are require to report any ICT system   incidents that can have significant impact in terms of information security breaches. These are   effectively incidents that may cause disruptions in operations or in the provision of services or that     48      may affect a large number of services, a large  number of users or a substantial part of the territory   or that may affect public safety etc.    However, although incident reporting applies only to incidents that significantly breach   information security, very few incidents have been reported in recent years.   One of the reasons for the low number of reported incidents is the fact that ICT systems of   special importance avoid reporting incidents for fear that their reputation may be harmed, or do not   know where incidents should be reported, or manage to recover from the incidents without   assistance and thus decide not to report them at all.   To ensure proper incident reporting, it is necessary to first make the ICT systems of special   importance aware of the importance of incident reporting, while also establishing trust between the   ICT systems of special importance and the competent institutions, so the ICT systems of special   importance could be certain that the incident data which they submit will not harm their operations.       5) Public-private partnership      Public-private partnership in the field of information security in Serbia exists in the form   of an informal group which refers to itself as the Petnica Group. Namely, in mid-2015, the OSCE   Mission to Serbia, the DiploFoundation and the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance   (DCAF) established a strategic partnership with the Petnica Research Station and held a   coordination meeting attended by key public and private stakeholders in the field of cybersecurity.   The so-called “Petnica Group” emerged from this meeting and developed, through several stages,   into an informal multi-stakeholder group on public-private cooperation, comprised of key national   public and private sector stakeholders in the field of cybersecurity, academia and the civil society.   From its very start, the Group focused on strengthening cooperation between public and private   sectors and developing appropriate policies and strategic frameworks in the field of cybersecurity   in the Republic of Serbia7.   As regards public-private partnership, the key challenge is finding an appropriate   coopderation mechanism, which will link all relevant stakeholders, while enabling operational   functioning. Namely, while the Petnica Group operated successfully in the past, its future   functioning required a mechanism that would formalise this cooperation and include in it certain   acters that have hitherto been excluded, but would make the group operational, as opposed to its   largely advisory role in the past, and enable information exchange. The existing form of   cooperation within the Petnica Group did not enable the execution of projects that required finance,   which limited its performance and rendered it insufficiently operational. For these reasons, in 2020   the Petnica Group transformed itself into the Cybersecurity Network Foundation, and it is expected   that, as a registered foundation, it will have access to funding for project implementation in the   field of information security.                                                                         7 Vodič kroz informacionu bezbednost u Republici Srbiji 2.0 (A Guide to Information Security in the Republic of Serbia  2.0);   https://www.osce.org/sr/mission-to-serbia/404258    https://www.osce.org/sr/mission-to-serbia/404258   49      6) International cooperation      Institutions of the Republic of Serbia have had an active role in international activities in   the field of information security, whether through bilateral cooperation or cooperation within the   framework of international organisations, including the United Nations, the Organisation for   Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Telecommunication Union, the Global   Forum on Cyber Expertise, the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance etc.   The Republic of Serbia has served a full term on the UN Group of Governmental Experts   on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security   (UN GGE) in its composition for 2016-2017. The Republic of Serbia has been a member of the   UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and   Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG) since its establishment   in 2018 and actively participates in the Group’s activities.    Since 2019, the Republic of Serbia has been a member of the Global Forum on Cyber   Expertise (GFCE). In addition to the country’s active role through membership in the above bodies,   the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as one of the authorities responsible for performing activities in the   context of development of international cooperation on information security matters, plans and   holds bilateral contacts to promote and improve cooperation with other countries in this field and   examines all initiatives relevant for information security at national and global levels. in this   context, Serbia has also recognised the importance of the French initiative “Paris Call for Trust and   Security in Cyberspace”, which we have supported and in whose working groups we intend to   actively participate (at present we are only a member of the first working group).   Serbia actively participates in the work of the Informal Working Group on cyber security   formed under OSCE Decision No. 1039 and has designated its political and technical focal point   for cooperation in case of cross-border incidents in accordance with Confidence Building Measure   No. 8. The efforts made and the progress achieved in the field of cybersecurity have contributed to   Serbia’s acceptance, upon consultations with management of the Informal Working Group and the   competent national institutions, of sponsorship of Confidence Building Measure No. 9, which   concerns the development of a list of national terminology and definitions of terms in the field of   information security. As a result of this activity, Serbia has developed a platform with more than   1000 terms and definitions taken from the legislation of Member States.    the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, the Ministry of the Interior and   the National CERT take part in implementation of the Geneva Centre for Security Sector   Governance project “Improvement of Cybersecurity Governance in the Western Balkans”,   launched in July 2018, which aims to contribute to a more efficient and more responsible   governance of cybersecurity in the Western Balkans and improve regional cooperation in this field.   The Ministry of Defence continually takes part in international military exercises aimed at   establishing and developing information security and cyber defence. An example of such   cooperation is the international cyberspace exercise “Cyber Tesla”, which is implemented in   cooperation with the public and private sectors of the Republic of Serbia with powers in the field   of information security and with members of the National Guard of Ohio.   In 2019, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), the Ministry of Trade,   Tourism and Telecommunications of the Republic of Serbia, the Regulatory Agency for Electronic,     50      Communications and Postal Services (RATEL) and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,   represented by the Embassy of the Kingdom of Norway in Belgrade, signed the Memorandum of   Understanding on cooperation and strengthening of information security in the Republic of Serbia.   The project is being implemented in 2020 and 2021 and encompasses support to the strategic and   regulatory frameworks in the field of information security and development of recommendations   for Serbia’s critical information infrastructure and purchase and installation of a platform for   information security exercises at RATEL.      2. CHANGE ACHIEVED BY THE STRATEGY      2.1 VISION AND DESIRED CHANGE      The use of information and communication technologies has become indispensable for all    - citizens, public administration and businesses – and largely affects both our daily lives and the   economy and the overall business environment. In this context, it is necessary to adapt to the   changes stemming from the use of ICT and focus on harnessing it to achieve maximum benefits.   With this Strategy we aim to achieve the following:   1. A digitalised public administration capable of efficiently and transparently providing   services to citizens and businesses.   2. Improved digital skills of all citizens, who are able to freely use ICT both in their daily   lives and in communication with public administration.   3. A transformation of the economy through digitalisation and support for the employment   of information technologies towards modernising business operations across all   industries.   4. An information security environment with a sufficient level of awareness of both risks   and advantages of new technologies for citizens, public administration and businesses.             3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STRATEGY      3.1 OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE STRATEGY      The fields of information society and information security are comprehensive and are   applied in almost all fields and activities on which development of an economy and a society are   based, and which at the same time relate to citizens, the public administration and businesses of a   country.    The use of information systems in operations of the public administration and businesses is   unavoidable, and it is necessary to protect devices, networks, data and also organisations and   individuals in order to ensure appropriate security level for such systems.   The Overarching Objective of the Strategy is a developed information society and   citizen- and business-oriented electronic government, with improved information security for   citizens, public administration and businesses.     51      The Overarching Objective of the Strategy will be achieved through the following Specific   Objectives:   - Specific Objective 1: Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills,   strengthening the capacities of public and private sector employees to use new   technologies and improvement of digital infrastructure in education institutions.   - Specific Objective 2: Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and   private sectors.   - Specific Objective 3: Improved information security of citizens, public administration   and businesses.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 1   Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills, strengthening capacities of public   and private sector employees to use new technologies and improvement of digital infrastructure   in education institutions      An important precondition for development of the information society and eGovernment is   improvement of digital knowledge and skills of all citizens, strengthening the capacities of both   public and private sector employees for the use of new technologies and improvement of the digital   infrastructure in education institutions.    Development of digital skills is defined by the Strategy of Digital Skills Development in   the Republic of Serbia for the period 2020-2024 (hereinafter referred to as the “Strategy of Digital   Skills Development”), and is implemented through Specific Objectives, including:   1) Improvement of digital competencies in the education system,    2) Improvement of basic and advanced digital skills for all citizens,    3) Development of digital skills in accordance with the needs of the labour market, and    4) Lifelong learning for ICT experts   To achieve the objectives regarding development of digital skills it is, thus, necessary to   start from the education system and ensure conditions for learning and acquiring digital   competencies in the education system and to improve curricula and syllabuses accordingly for the   purpose of acquiring digital competencies in pre-university education.    It is also necessary to accredit digital skills development programmes for citizens,   particularly taking into account vulnerable categories such as the elderly, persons with disabilities,   poor citizens and persons in rural areas, with continual citizens’ awareness-rising of the need to   adopt digital skills.   Digital skills are necessary for the majority of jobs and it is necessary to develop   employees’ digital skills, including employees in the public administration, and to recognise digital   skills linked with specific features of each job.     54      Due to dynamic development of the ICT sector, it is necessary to keep up with the needs of   this sector and the entire economy in terms of necessary digital skills, and also to continually work   on the improvement of ICT experts and promotion of lifelong learning.    The aim of implementation of Specific Objectives and measures of the Strategy of Digital   Skills Development is to improve the system which ensures higher citizens’ digital skills through   development of computational thinking, provision of skills necessary for everyday life and   development of a successful career in the digital economy and ensuring conditions for further   improvement of knowledge and skills of ICT experts.    Since the above Strategy includes the period from 2020 to 2024, upon expiry of that period   a new programme will be passed, which will define objectives and measures in the field of digital   skills development until 2026. Until a new programme is passed, measures set under the Strategy   and additional measures indicated and set within this Specific Objective will be implemented.

Specific Objective 1. “Improvement of citizens’ digital knowledge and skills,   strengthening the capacities of public and private sector employees to use new technologies and   improvement of digital infrastructure in education institutions” is implemented through measures,   including:   - Measure 1.1: Improvement of  digital knowledge, skills and capacities of citizens and   employees through trainings aimed at increased usage of ICT.   - Measure 1.2: Promotion of useful, creative and secure usage of information   technologies through organisation of educational and media campaigns and prize   competitions.   - Measure 1.3: Improvement and promotion of the work of the National Contact Centre   for Child Safety on the Internet.   - Measure 1.4: Improvement of the digital infrastructure in educational institutions.           55      Measure 1.1.   Improvement of  digital knowledge, skills and capacities of citizens and employees through   trainings aimed at increased usage of ICT      One of preconditions for popularisation and increased use of ICT in citizens’ everyday life   and communication with the public sector is education aimed at improvement of digital knowledge,   skills and capacities of citizens and employees. In addition to formal education where digital   competencies are acquired, it is necessary to increase the level of digital knowledge through   trainings and support programmes, particularly for citizens in vulnerable categories and public   servants.   Measure 1.1. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 1.1.1: Support programmes for associations through award of funds for   implementation of programmes in the field of development of the information society   - Activity 1.1.2: Trainings aimed at improving teachers’ competencies in the field of   information and communication technologies   - Activity 1.1.3: Development and implementation of trainings aimed at improving   digital competencies of employees in the public administration   - Activity 1.1.4: Popularisation and promotion of the use of ICT through the Serbian-  Korean Information Access Centre         Measure 1.1.

Improvement and promotion of the work of the National Contact Centre for Child Safety on the   Internet      With the aim of continuing prevention and awareness-rising and improvement of   knowledge of advantages and risks of the use of the Internet and safe use of the Internet, it is   necessary to continue strengthening the capacities of the National Contact Centre for Child Safety   on the Internet, particularly employees in institutions which apply regulations providing for child   safety on the Internet, and also continual provision of information to and education of children,   parents and teachers in this field.   Measure 1.3. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 1.3.1: Trainings aimed at strengthening the capacities of employees in   institutions of the system for the purpose of applying of the Regulation on Safety and   Protection of Children in the Use of Information and Communication Technologies   - Activity 1.3.2: Provision of information to and education of children, parents and   teachers in child safety on the Internet through organisation of trainings in schools              57      Measure 1.3.

The second stage of the “Connected Schools” project which will be implemented in the period   from 2019 to 2021 will include comprehensive improvement of the information and   communication infrastructure in all primary and secondary schools in Serbia.   Also, in addition to the needs of primary and secondary schools, it is necessary to work   quickly on understanding and providing the necessary digital infrastructure and services that would   be purposefully used for the needs of higher education and scientific research activities. Regular   cycles of infrastructure improvement are not enough to neutralize the existing digital divide for   developed European countries. Given that these needs require significant financial resources, a   proactive approach is needed to provide them, which would contribute not only to preserving the   value of previous investments, but also to preventing the creation of new technological differences   between the Republic of Serbia and developed European countries in relations to  national research   and education networks. The importance of rapid action lies is the fact that by the end of 2021 in   the Republic of Serbia a GEANT hub will be formed with a capacity of several terabytes per second   with AMRES access link of 100 gigabytes per second, making the Republic of Serbia an important   point on the map. In order to take full advantage of this opportunity, it is necessary to work   intensively not only on further development of the computer network, but also on the   implementation of high-tech solutions in the field of cloud infrastructure and high-performance   data processing (so-called supercomputing) as soon as possible.   Measure 1.4. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 1.4.1: Continuation of connection of all central primary and secondary school   facilities, cultural institutions and public libraries in Serbia to the AMRES network   - Activity 1.4.2: Development of the information and communication infrastructure in   primary and secondary schools within the “Connected Schools” project.           58      Measure 1.4.

Training the majority of the population to use ICT ensures shift   from classic to e-business and faster acting of the public administration and other electronic service   providers. On the other hand, development of the digital infrastructure, particularly in educational   institutions, will ensure reliable and safe internet access in all teaching and administrative rooms   and for all participants in the education system, which will largely affect the quality of work and   the possibility for unobstructed work in the digital environment.   The analysis of management capacities – Implementation of the measures requires further   improvement of administrative and technical capacities at the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and   Telecommunications, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and the   Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, to ensure that educational   programmes intended for improvement of digital knowledge and competencies are at the   appropriate level and that they meet the needs in this field, as well as to ensure unobstructed   implementation of digitalisation of the infrastructure in educational institutions.   The analysis of economic effects – Implementation of the measures contributes to   improvement of productivity of the workforce in the Republic of Serbia and to ensuring adjustment   to changes in the society and business operations conditioned by the use of new technologies in all   segments of the society.    The risk analysis – Improvement of digital knowledge and skills is implemented through   educational and promotional activities carried out by employees in competent institutions and the   main risk for their implementation are capabilities of such human resources. To prevent the risk, it   is necessary to plan activities which will support continual advancement of employees, particularly   if upgrading of their knowledge is required for the use of new technologies and transfer of new   knowledge to target groups included in the Specific Objective 1.         59      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 2   Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and private sectors      To ensure the shift from classic to e-commerce, it is necessary to digitalize the entire   society, i.e. both public and private sector, through digitalisation of services and business   operations. The importance of digitalisation of all segments of the society was best seen during the   COVID-19 pandemic, due to which those parts of the society that did not previously shift to   electronic operations suffered and are still suffering consequences, while on the other hand   digitalisation and electronic operations proved to be able to fully or partially replace traditional   manners of work or schooling.    As regards the public administration, the generally accepted principle of public   administration development in modern systems is development of the efficient government, as the   citizens’ service, through introduction of electronic services, which is defined in the eGovernment   Development Programme in the Republic of Serbia for the period from 2020 to 2022, and is   implemented through Specific Objectives, including:   1) Development of infrastructure in eGovernment and provision of interoperability   2) Improvement of legal certainty in the use of eGovernment   3) Increasing availability of eGovernment for citizens and businesses through   improvement of customer services   4) Opening data in public administration.      In addition to the above, digitalisation and provision of public administration electronic   services are planned under a number of strategic enactments relating to е-judiciary, е-education, е-  health, е-culture, e-business, е-commerce, е-tourism, е-construction and е-agriculture.

Solutions which should be developed in the field of information and   communication technologies to improve the work of state authorities and passing of strategic   decisions are crucial. In the field of information and communication technologies, the   entrepreneurial discovery process highlighted a need for providing the state-of-the-art technologies   to capacities for education of human resources and forming additional innovation and research   business parks for ICT companies and starts-ups.    The implementation of the above priorities is expected to result in establishing the Republic   of Serbia as a source of sophisticated high technology products and services for the global market.    The Industrial Policy Development Strategy in the Republic of Serbia from 2021 to 2030   defined the Specific Objective “Improvement of Digitalisation of Industrial Production Business   Models” and through implementation of planned measures aims to achieve digitally transformed   industry of the Republic of Serbia which, together with other measures under the Industrial Policy   Development Strategy, strongly supports economic growth and improves the quality of life of its   citizens.   A Specific Objective of the Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the   Republic of Serbia for the period from 2020 to 2025 titled “Development of Economy Based on   Artificial Intelligence” includes implementation of measures aimed at successful adjustment of the   economy to new business models and new market expectations with marked development of   economic operators whose business operations are based on application of artificial intelligence.   It can be concluded that development of the ICT sector in accordance with the existing   strategic documents is based on several pillars, including:   1) Development of companies and products in the field of information technologies;     64      2) Digitalisation of business operations in all economic activities using ICT;   3) Development of economy based on the use of artificial intelligence;   4) Development of digital skills for the needs of the labour market and strengthening the   human resource potential of ICT experts.

Specific Objective 2 “Digitalisation of services and business operations in public and   private sectors “ is implemented through measures, including:   - Measure 2.1: Development of the information society   - Measure 2.2: Support to entry in foreign markets   - Measure 2.3: Digital transformation of MSMEs   - Measure 2.4: Development of e-business   - Measure 2.5: Strengthening capacities for usage of ICT in cultural institutions with the   aim of developing and improving the IS and the basis for development of   entrepreneurship in culture / creative industries (gaming, applications, multimedia   guides...)      Measure 2.1.   Development of the information society      Taking into account that the concept of the information society is comprehensive and relates   to various segments, it is necessary to continually cooperate with all relevant actors through   organisation of expert and other meetings, domestic or international, to keep up with new trends   and exchange experts’ opinions on topics in the field of the information society.    One of the topis which is becoming increasingly relevant relates to data, or more   specifically to data management. Many countries are starting to recognise the importance of data   and their value in the economic sense, and, for example, Hungary founded the National Data     65      Management Agency to address this issue systematically. Thus, in order to keep up with the world,   it is necessary not only to recognise Serbia’s approach in this field, i.e. to assess the needs,   possibilities and risks for various data management models in our country; instead, it is also   necessary to identify data of relevance for increasing transparency and citizens’ trust in services   based on new technological solutions.   Measure 2.1. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 2.1.1: Organisation of expert and other meetings in the field of information   society within the  Internet Governance Forum (IGF)   - Activity 2.1.2: Needs assessment for introduction of the data management system in   the Republic of Serbia   - Activity 2.1.3: Analysis of readiness and needs of businesses for application of new   technologies in business operations            Measure 2.2.   Support to entry in foreign markets      The domestic ICT sector undoubtedly has a large potential, but it is important that domestic   economic operators are also presented in foreign markets and to ensure the increase of export of   their products and services on those markets.    The Centre for Organisation of Fairs, Performances and Events of the Chamber of   Commerce and Industry of Serbia organizes international fairs in foreign countries, which are   always used as an instrument of business and development policy and constitute the specific   framework for promotional, expert and commercial meetings of economic operators in Serbia.   With the aim of promoting and internationalising business operations of economic   operators, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, in cooperation with the Development   Agency of Serbia and other partners, organizes joint exhibitions of domestic companies in   international fairs abroad.   One of the manners to promote the ICT sector is organisation of joint bodies for bilateral   cooperation, which constitute a mechanism for promotion of export of Serbian products and   services, including IT products and services.

Digital transformation of MSMEs      To ensure the existing economic operators can develop and remain competitive in the   market, it is necessary for them to continually develop and keep up with development of   information technologies and recognise the importance of the use of new technologies in their   business operations.    The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia founded the Centre for Digital   Transformation (CDT) – a national hub of innovative practices targeted primarily towards micro,   small and medium-sised enterprises.   The Centre for Digital Transformation ensures efficient and transparent digital   transformation of the Serbian economy – through educations, counselling and creation of strategic   partnerships with technology providers, on the one hand, and companies which would apply these   solutions in their business operations, on the other hand.   The CDT has so far implemented three programmes aimed at enabling companies in the   SME sector in Serbia and Republic of Srpska to improve their business operations according to the   available digital trends (“Digital Transformation Support Programme for MSMEs-2019-2020”)   and also to efficiently respond to new challenges in business operations caused by the COVID-19   pandemic. (SPEED 1.0 and SPEED 2.0)   One of the conditions for development of innovation of small and medium-sised enterprises   in the field of ICT is access to sources of financing necessary for research and development which   will eventually result in development of products with a potential for placement on the global   market.

Programmes of the Innovation Fund are intended for small and medium-sised enterprises,   specifically those at early stages of development and at growth stages, as well as for cooperation   with research and development organisations. In addition, by awarding innovation vouchers, the   Innovation Fund supports small and medium-sised enterprises in using technical services of   research and development organisations.    Measure 2.3. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 2.3.1: Digital transformation support programme for MSMEs   - Activity 2.3.2: Support to small and medium-sised enterprises for development of   innovation in the field of ICT         Measure 2.4.   Development of e-business      The conditions for development of e-business were ensured when the Law on Electronic   Documents, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions and the Law   on eGovernment entered into force; however, full implementation of the law requires promotion   of institutes and mechanisms laid down by it. It is necessary to increase the use of qualified trust   services, particularly qualified electronic certificates, and electronic identification schemes used in   electronic services.    It should also be noted that unobstructed implementation of the digitalisation process   requires significant financial investment in solutions which enable electronic services important   for many segments of the society, including economic and production activities. It is necessary to   develop modern telecommunication solutions which ensure connection between remote rural areas   and remote production plants (factories, farms etc.), and thus enable development of Industry 4.0,   i.e. development of precision agriculture.   Measure 2.4. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 2.4.1: Promoting the use of qualified trust services   - Activity 2.4.2: Support to formation of the Conformity Assessment Body   Measure 2.3.

Strengthening capacities for usage of ICT in cultural institutions with the aim of developing and   improving the IS and the basis for development of entrepreneurship in culture / creative   industries (gaming, applications, multimedia guides...)      Strengthening capacities for the usage of ICT in cultural institutions requires provision of   support to cultural institutions and projects of economic operators that cooperate with cultural   institutions to increase interest in this field, which would contribute to development of new   products and services.   Measure 2.5. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 2.5.1: Award of funds within the programme to support development of   entrepreneurship though financial support   - Activity 2.5.2: Award of funds within the programme to support cultural institutions   through development programmes       Measure 2.4.

This ensures faster and more efficient business operations and cost   reduction for operations of economic operators, public authorities and citizens, modernisation and   efficient work of public authorities, easier and safer access to services of public authorities and   other entities which are provided electronically, as well as access to more such services.   The analysis of management capacities – Implementation of these measures requires   further improvement of administrative and expert capacities at the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and   Telecommunications, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia and the Innovation Fund,   particularly in terms of grant award administration process, with the aim of promoting development   of entrepreneurship and start-ups, the education process, counselling aimed at digitalisation of   small and medium-sised enterprises and activities aimed at developing e-business, particularly   qualified trust services.    The analysis of economic effects – Implementation of measures to achieve Specific   Objective 2 contributes to reduction of costs of business operations, particularly in the private   sector, because the number of electronically available services is increasing, thus reducing certain   costs. Digitalisation enables operations to be carried out electronically, without the need to go to   windows, to certain institutions and without physical contact, which saves material resources (costs   of transport, paper etc.) and time required in classic business operations.   The risk analysis – Risks in implementation of these measures exist for the public   administration and for the private sector, first in terms of awareness rising on the importance of   digitalisation and its advantages and then in provision of necessary infrastructure for its   implementation. It is thus necessary to mitigate risks through planned and gradual digitalisation, to   ensure appropriate infrastructure, expertise of those who implement it, and also by continual   awareness rising of its importance.       SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 3   Improved information security of citizens, public administration and businesses      As new technologies develop, the risks they imply also increase and those risks exist for   both citizens and public administration and for businesses. To minimise the risks, it is necessary to   undertake steps for awareness rising and improvement of knowledge in this field in order to   stimulate citizens to use new technologies and to ensure their use is secure and protected.    In addition, it is important to appropriately protect ICT systems, not only those covered by   the protection under the Law on Information Security, but also those ICT systems that exist in   businesses and are also exposed to attacks and the risk of jeopardising information security.   Appropriate implementation of measures and improvement of knowledge and awareness-  rising in this field depend also on the capacities of competent institutions in this field, and it is     70      necessary to strengthen those capacities accordingly through training for employees, through more   intensive inspection and through development of various forms of cooperation, both within the   country and regional and international.    Priority areas of the Strategy for the Development of Information Security in the Republic   of Serbia for the period from 2017 to 2020 inter alia include the fight against cybercrime and   information security in Serbia. However, three new strategies were passed in 2019 which address   these fields in more details, including:   - The Strategy for the Fight against Cybercrime for the period from 2019 to 2023;    - The Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia;   - The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia.   The Strategy for the Fight against Cybercrime recognised though the Overarching   Objective the need for better connecting of all entities covered by the Strategy in the fight against   cybercrime through improvement of the legislative framework, capacities, prevention and   improvement of national, international and regional cooperation.    The Strategy inter alia includes a Specific Objective which relates to improvement of   organisational, human resource, technical and operational capacities of authorities responsible for   the fight against cybercrime, through activities that include trainings for employees for acting in   case of incidents and improvement of their digital competences.   Under the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia, security of the Republic of Serbia   and its citizens is also planned to be protected, inter alia through improvement of cyber security,   and includes:   - Improvement of abilities and capacities for coordination of tasks directed at achieving   cyber security and protection against security risks in information and communication   systems,    - Formulation of a clear and coherent policy in order to increase resistance of information   and communication systems to incidents,    - Introduction of a network of entities competent for the fight against cyber attacks and   crime,   - Development of the general security culture for all citizens in order to raise awareness   on the need to increase security of individuals and the society.   In addition, the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia states that   improvement of abilities and capacities of processing, transfer and protection of information and   information and communication systems and defence against hybrid and information warfare   techniques in information and cyber space will be continued in the field of cyber security.   In view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that Serbia has a comprehensive approach to   the field of information security, which includes both information security of ICT systems of   special importance and security of the Republic of Serbia, and security of citizens and businesses,   which is particularly reflected through the fight against cybercrime.                 71      Specific Objective 3  Improved information security of citizens, public administration and   businesses   Indicator Baseline value in 2019 Target value in 2026 Verification source   Global information   security index  58 30   International   Telecommunication   Union report   Global Cybersecurity   Index - ITU      Measures for Implementation of Specific Objective 3      Specific Objective 3 “Improved information security of citizens, public administration and   businesses” is implemented through measures, including:   - Measure 3.1: Awareness rising and improvement of knowledge of information security   for citizens, public servants and businesses.   - Measure 3.2: Strengthening capacities of the ICT systems of particular importance for   application of safeguards.   - Measure 3.3: Measure 3.3: Strengthening capacities of the National CERT, govCERT   and CERT of independent ICT system operators.   - Measure 3.4: Strengthening capacities of the information security inspectorate.   - Measure 3.5: Promoting public-private partnership in the field of information security.   - Measure 3.6: Improvement of regional and international cooperation.      Measure 3.1.   Awareness rising and improvement of knowledge of information security for citizens, public   servants and businesses      As regards promotion of the topic of information security, findings of the World Bank   report state that “in Serbia there appears to be some media coverage of cybersecurity topics, but   only in an ad hoc manner and that there is very little presence of the issue of information security   in the social media. As regards civil servants, cybersecurity awareness in Serbia can vary   considerably, depending on the  individual’s environment, but it should be noted many government   employees are increasing their level of awareness, in part due to the growth of awareness training   in the government. However, a cybersecurity mindset remains uneven across government entities.”   The report further states that “in the private sector the mindset depends on the industry and   size of the company. The cybersecurity mindset is highest within the larger companies, particularly   those with a more international presence, and most if not all the financial services and technology   companies.”   The fact that a significant percentage of citizens who indicated lack of skills, or even the   fact that they do not have Internet access, as a reason why they do not use public administration or   e-commerce services, as well as that they did not take some activities on the Internet because they   were worried about security, shows the importance of improvement of citizens’ digital competence,   and also that in such process, focus should also be the segment of information security. It is     72      necessary to find the right balance between promoting the use of ICT on one hand and awareness   rising and improvement of knowledge on the protection against possible risks, abuse or fraud.   Improving digital competences on one hand and awareness rising and improvement of   knowledge on risks in the use of ICT on the other hand will ensure that a higher percentage of the   population use digital services in various fields, which will consequently lead to higher   digitalisation of the society and also to significant reduction of costs, both for the citizens and for   businesses.    The advantages for businesses, particularly small and medium-sised enterprises, from   implementation of safeguards for ICT systems are undoubtable, particularly having in mind   consequences that enterprises may suffer in case of possible attacks, which in drastic circumstances   may even lead to bankruptcy. It is necessary to raise awareness of risks for business operations of   companies, and also to raise awareness and improve knowledge of the manners to minimalize these   risks. In addition to the obvious need for application of safeguards, awareness of continual   strengthening of employees’ capacities is also necessary. This does not include only employees   working as ICT experts; instead, this includes all other employees who can, by their inappropriate   acting, out of ignorance, contribute to exposure of the system to ICT risk and to occurrence   incidents which can significantly jeopardise security of ICT systems and cause severe   consequences.    Measure 3.1. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.1.1: Organisation and coordination of awareness-raising media campaigns   for citizens, public servants and small and medium-sised enterprises on the importance   of information security, on risks and safeguards.   - Activity 3.1.2: Educations for citizens for awareness rising of information security.   - Activity 3.1.3: Development and implementation of compulsory continual training for   public servants in information security.   - Activity 3.1.4: Trainings for small and medium-sised enterprises on the need and the   manner of application of safeguards and the importance of continual strengthening of   employees’ capacities, in accordance with national and international standards.   - Activity 3.1.5: Development of guidelines on the basic level of safeguards for small   and medium-sised enterprises   - Activity 3.1.6: Development, harmonisation and expansion of specialised information   security courses and programmes on universities and other higher education   institutions.   - Activity 3.1.7: Creating courses, seminars and lectures on the topic of information   security for students in non-technical study programmes such as law, management etc.   - Activity 3.1.8: Setting up a platform for awareness-rising and improvement of   knowledge on information security through interactive programmes (Cybersecurity   Awareness Platform)              73      Measure 3.1.

Improvement of cooperation and strengthening capacities of the ICT systems of particular   importance for application of safeguards      ICT systems of particular importance, or the so-called critical information infrastructure,   are identified by the Law as special and vital because their unobstructed functioning must be   maintained, since any obstruction, downtime or destruction of these systems may have significant   consequences when they cover a large number of users, a large part of the territory or public   security. It is therefore necessary for ICT systems to apply safeguards which provide prevention of   incidents, i.e. prevent incidents and reduce damage from incidents which jeopardise exercise of   powers and performance of activities.   Preconditions for application of safeguards in ICT systems of particular importance include   equipment, trained employees, awareness of the importance of application of measures and   statutory procedures (security instrument) defining safeguards and responsibilities of employees   and the management.      74      A major segment of development of this field is also cooperation between ICT systems of   particular importance, in particular those who have similar structure, such as financial, energy and   health systems, systems of public authorities etc.    One of important novelties introduced by amendments of the Law on Information Security   is establishing of the Records of ICT Systems of Particular Importance. To fully implement the   Law, it is necessary to establish cooperation between relevant institutions responsible for   information security, МТТТ, NCERT and govCERT one hand, and ICT of particular importance   on the other hand. This cooperation is important for reporting of incidents which significantly   jeopardize information security and which ICT must report, but which rarely occur in practice. It   is necessary to inform ICT systems of particular importance through joint meetings on the   importance of reporting the incidents, to explain reporting mechanisms and to create mutual trust   which will result in mutual benefits.   The second novelty of the Law on Information Security relates to submission of all statistics   on all incidents that occurred in one ICT system of particular importance. Thus, statistics do not   include only data that significantly jeopardize information security and which must be reported;   instead, it includes all incidents which occurred, so that comprehensive overview of the situation   in this field would be obtained based on their analysis and that measures and activities could be   defined for improvement.    Measure 3.2. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.2.1: Trainings for employees in ICT systems of particular importance on   application of safeguards and acting in case of an incident in an ICT system.   - Activity 3.2.2: Organisation of meetings of ICT systems of particular importance   according to the sectors to which they belong with the aim of encouraging cooperation   and promoting formation of special sectoral CERTs.   - Activity 3.2.3: Organisation of international and national meetings, round tables and   conferences with the aim of raising awareness of the importance of information   security.    - Activity 3.2.4: Determining manners and mechanisms for strengthening the capacities   of ICT systems of particular importance to achieve the necessary level of compliance   with information  security requirements (common criteria) within management of all   stages of the lifecycle of ICT systems or parts of the systems   - Activity 3.2.5: Preparation of brochures, recommendations and other materials with the   aim of rising awareness of the importance of safeguards.   - Activity 3.2.6: Development of a platform for information exchange between the   National CERT and ICT systems of particular importance with the aim of providing   information on current risks and threats in the field of information security and   promoting good practice examples.   - Activity 3.2.7. – Development of an overview of threats based on submitted statistics   on incidents and reported incidents.   - Activity 3.2.8. – Harmonisation of legislation with EU regulations in the field of   information security   - Activity 3.2.9. – Development of a self-evaluation form for ICT systems of particular   importance     75      - Activity 3.2.10. – Development of a form to assess the level of development of   information security in Serbia      Measure 3.2.

Strengthening capacities of the National CERT, govCERT and CERT of independent ICT system   operators      The role of the National CERT, govCERT and CERTs of independent ICT system operators   is important from the aspect of cooperation, coordination and monitoring the situation with   information security in the country.      76      It is particularly important for the National CERT to be able and has capacities to collect   information on risks for security of  ICT systems and to timely provide support, warns and give   advice to ICT systems of particular importance and also the public.    It is also necessary to develop mechanism for cooperation and data exchange between ICT   systems of public authorities within the Single Information and Communication Network of   eGovernment and govCERT, because those systems have similar structure and the level of   development and information exchange could therefore could contribute to their improvement.   From the aspect of national security, it is important for independent ICT system operators   to have developed capacities and that they are able to defend both their systems and other   independent ICT system operators affected by an incident.   Measure 3.3. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.3.1: Training for employees in the National CERT with the aim of   strengthening capacities for acting in case of incidents.   - Activity 3.3.2: Training for employees in govCERT and in independent ICT system   operators.   - Activity 3.3.3:Establishing of CERT of independent ICT system operators.   - Activity 3.3.4: Development of guidelines for acting in case of high and very high risk   incidents.    - Activity 3.3.5: Establishing a mechanism for information exchange and cooperation   between individual CERTs and the National CERT.   - Activity 3.3.6: Establishing cooperation between the National CERT, the МТТТ and   the Emergency Management Team of the MoI (Emergency Management Sector) for the   purpose of recognising a cooperation mechanism in case of high and very high risk   incidents.   - Activity 3.3.7: Organisation of civil and military exercises   - Activity 3.3.8: Setting up of a system for detection of cyber threats      Measure 3.3.

Strengthening capacities of the information security inspectorate      In addition to promotion and provision of information on legislative provisions, the Law on   Information Security is also implemented through inspection which implies control of application   of safeguards and verification whether annual assessment of the security situation in ICT systems   of particular importance was performed.   To increase the coverage of ICT systems of particular importance by inspection, it is   necessary to strengthen the capacities of the inspection, namely, to hire new employees and to   increase expert capacities of employed inspectors.   Measure 3.4. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.4.1: Training for information security inspectors based on prepared needs   assessments for trainings with the aim of strengthening capacities for implementation   of the Law on Information Security   - Activity 3.4.2: Employment of  information security inspectors.

Promoting public-private partnership in the field of information security      Cooperation between the public and the private sectors is one of the key elements of   information security of every country. Namely, limitations which exist on both sides in responses   to challenges of information security impose the need to establish partnerships, particularly in case   when incidents significantly jeopardise information security. In public-private partnership, finding   the appropriate cooperation mechanism is not the only issue; instead, there is also the issue of   creating trust between them that will contribute to strengthening of capacities and increasing the   level of information security.    Measure 3.5. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.5.1: Formation of an expert working group named Information Security   Coordination Body.   - Activity 3.5.2: Organisation of meetings of the “Cyber Security Network” foundation   with the aim of promoting public-private partnership.   - Activity 3.5.3: Concluding cooperation agreements between public authorities and   private and non-governmental sectors with the aim of implementing projects in the field   of information security.

Improvement of regional and international cooperation      Just as the field of information security requires cooperation between the public and the   private sectors, it also requires both regional and international cooperation because all countries   face risks and threats in this field which in some cases can also jeopardise national security.   International and regional cooperation mechanisms have been developed to a high extent   through activities of various institutions and agencies (ITU, OSCE, DCAF..), as well as through   various project activities and should be upgraded by concluding bilateral and multilateral   agreements which would define joint objectives and activities for improvement of information   security.      79      It is also important to continue the already initiated practice of organising international and   civil exercises which efficiently strengthen the capacities of institutions and employees for   response in case of incidents, with exchange of experiences and practical presentation of the   manner of responding.    Measure 3.6. is implemented through the following key activities:   - Activity 3.6.1: Conclusion of bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements in the   field of information security.   - Activity 3.6.2: Participation of representatives of competent authorities in international   forums and meetings dedicated to information security within the UN, OSCE, GFCE   and other international organisations.   - Activity 3.6.3: Cooperation with EU institutions and organisations competent for the   field of information security (FIRST, ENISA, EU CERT Network etc.)      Measure 3.6.

Having in mind the consequences which may occur for citizens and businesses due to inappropriate   development of information security, such as identity theft, financial frauds, disabling the   functioning of key institutions and ICT systems, it is clear that awareness rising and improvement   of knowledge of the protection against risks, application of safeguards for ICT systems of particular   importance and strengthening employees’ capacities significantly increase the level of information   security and reduce risks. This comprehensively protects citizens, public administration and   businesses.      80       Analysis of management capacities – In order to implement these measures, it is   necessary to invest significantly in management capacities, particularly in those institutions that   are responsible for information security in accordance with the law. Investment in capacities   implies continual development of employees and improvement of their knowledge through various   educational programmes, participation in conferences and exchange of experiences with other   countries. The dynamic nature of this field means that staff adaptation to new challenges that are   always present also has to be dynamic; however, these challenges are always new, which makes   them even higher and more demanding for acting. Strengthening the capacities of public   administration authorities will also be achieved through strengthening of the existing and   establishing of new partnerships with the expert and academic sectors and civil society   organisations.   Analysis of economic effects – On one hand, implementation of these measures increases   the costs for the public and the private sectors, which must implement safeguards against potential   incidents in their ICT systems, but, on the other hand, potential damage which can result from   incidents fully justifies investment and is a kind of saving.   Risk analysis – Risks in implementation of the measures exist for education of employees,   procurement of appropriate equipment, awareness of the importance of information security and   its impact on all segments of life. In order to reduce risks, implementation of campaigns on the   importance of this topic is necessary, as well as commitment of competent institutions to plan   investment and systematically invest in employees, equipment and protection of their systems, and   to continue development of cooperation between all relevant actors in this field, as an important   mechanism which is particularly relevant when incidents occur which significantly jeopardise   information security.       4. MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGY AND REPORTING ON   RESULTS OF IMPLEMENTATION      The Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications is responsible for reporting on   the implementation of this Strategy through monitoring of the implementation and coordination of   public policies in cooperation with competent ministries. The report on implementation of the   Strategy is prepared upon expiry of every third calendar year from the date of adoption of the   Strategy, in accordance with deadlines laid down by the Law of Planning System. The competent   ministries submit to the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications reports on   implemented measures and achieved values of indicators, according to the following schedule:      Specific Objective Competent ministry Reporting schedule   Specific Objective 1   Ministry of Trade, Tourism   and Telecommunications   Ministry of Education,   Science and Technological   Development   November 2023   November 2026     81      Specific Objective 2   Ministry of Public   Administration and Local   Self-Government    Ministry of Education,   Science and Technological   Development   Ministry of Economy   Ministry of Trade, Tourism   and Telecommunications   November 2023   November 2026   Specific Objective 3  Ministry of Trade, Tourism   and Telecommunications   November 2023   November 2026      Reporting on implementation of Action Plans is carried out annually, based on data   submitted on request by other ministries and institutions to the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and   Telecommunications, through the Single Information System for planning, monitoring of   implementation, coordination of public policies and reporting, in accordance with the law.      5.

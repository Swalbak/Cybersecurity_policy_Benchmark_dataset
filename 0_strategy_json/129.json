Guided by this shift, we crafted the National Security Strategy that articulates our roadmap in building a stronger nation. In order to protect our most cherished democratic institutions and way of life, we will create an environment where peace and economic development will complement each other. We will address urgent national security concerns and cope with the rapidly changing regional and global security environment in line with the objectives set forth in the National Security Policy 2017-2022. To defend our sovereignty and the integrity of our national territory, we will continue to develop and improve our defense, intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to enable our troops to end communist insurgency, terrorism and violent extremism. We will also bolster our position in the community of nations by strengthening diplomatic relations with our traditional allies, engaging non-traditional partners and pursuing an independent foreign policy that gives primacy to our national interest. These endeavors will be sustained by a medium-term socio-economic agenda that aims to lessen the tax burden on the poor, reduce income inequality and improve the quality and accessibility of education and healthcare. We have also embarked on an ambitious infrastructure development program that will pave the way for rapid industrialization and modernization, thereby making our country the next top investment destination in the Asia Pacific Region. I call upon our people to stand behind our national security apparatus in carrying out this National Security Strategy that will strengthen the foundations of a secure, peaceful, modern and prosperous Philippines.

CONCLUSION: A CALL FOR UNITY 81 ANNEX A. Threats and Challenges to National Security 85 ANNEX B. List of Strategic Industries for National Security 94 [iii] EXECUTIVE SUMMARY he leadership of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte affirms its commitment to deliver a more s e c u r e , s t a b l e , j u s t a n d prosperous future for the people of the Philippines. To translate this vision into reality, the Duterte Administration promulgated in April 2017 the National Security Policy (NSP) 2017-2022: For Change and Well-Being of the Filipino People. Subsequently, the NSP became the precursor as well as formed the basis for the development of this National Security Strategy (NSS), which in essence articulates in operational terms the policies set forth in the NSP. This NSS is the Philippines’ first such official publication and follows the NSP’s overarching principle that national security and economic development are closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing concepts. As in the NSP, the NSS has the broad theme of bringing about meaningful and lasting socio- economic and political change aimed at building a stronger nation and improving the lives of the majority of the Filipino people. The NSS outlines the ways and means to attain the national security vision, which the NSP states as: ““A safe and secure Philippines, at peace with itself and its neighbors, where its citizens are allowed to reach their full potential through the promotion of social justice and harmony, political stability, sound env i ronmen ta l managemen t , and economic progress.” The NSS integrates the State’s m a j o r s e c u r i t y p o l i c i e s , g o a l s , responsibilities and courses of action into a roadmap or blueprint for the fulfillment of the national security vision. It seeks to foster better coordination, synchronization and cohesion of government functions in order to improve efficiency and maximize the use of limited State resources. The NSS also serves as an important vehicle to articulate the national interest, convey the State’s intentions, and rally public support for government policies and programs. The support of Congress in particular will be crucial to the success of the NSS in terms of enact ing the necessary legislations related to national security a n d a p p r o p r i a t i n g t h e i r f i s c a l requirements. T [iv] The NSS has seven parts. Chapter One introduces the concept of national security and the overarching national security framework in which the NSP and NSS are shown as two inseparable components. Chapter Two provides an overview of the current strategic environment. It highlights the State’s national security priorities in light of the various internal and external threats and challenges it seeks to address. Chapter Three discusses the national security framework, core values and national interests underpinning the NSS. It begins with the definition of national security as “the state or condition wherein the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; the people’s well-being, core values, and way of life; and the State and its institutions; are protected and enhanced.” The Chapter ends with the following 12-point national security goals as basis for the strategic actions of concerned government agencies and departments, namely: • Guarantee public safety and achieve good governance. • Mitigate the impact of health related threats. • Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable economy. • Achieve food and water security. • Safeguard and preserve national sovereignty and territorial integrity. • Heighten consciousness and pride on Filipino heritage, culture and values. • Promote human and ecological security. • Achieve energy security. • Ensure maritime and airspace security. • Strengthen international relations. • Provide strong cyber infrastructure and cyber security. • I m p r o v e v i t a l t r a n s p o r t a t i o n infrastructure and port security. Chapter Four introduces two important components that will guide the strategy’s successful and sustained implementation. First is the combined, balanced and effective use of the instruments of national power, namely: p o l i t i c a l a n d l e g a l , d i p l o m a t i c , informational, intelligence, economic, and military and law enforcement. This c o m p o n e n t a i m s t o p r o m o t e comprehensiveness and shared efforts in addressing current and future threats. Second is wealth creation and resource generation through intensified human [v] capital development, passage of national security legislations, appropriate funding for national security, and development of strategic industries. Meanwhile, the attainment of the 12-point national security agenda hinges on the successful execution of the strategic lines of action enumerated in Chapter Five. The action areas are designed to improve our defences, our capabilities, our technologies, our processes, our partnerships, and our resources. A total of 109 strategic lines of action were identified following a careful analysis of the various threats and challenges as well as opportunities that are commensurate to the strengths and potentials of the nation. The successful execution of these strategic lines of action is largely dependent on the effectiveness and cohesiveness of the national security sector. In this regard, the NSS endeavors to reinvigorate and streamline the existing national security structure to ensure a more effective command and control and a more cost-effective utilization of government resources and manpower. Crucial to this effort is the need to revitalize the organizational structures of the National Security Council and its Secretariat; the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace; the National Intelligence Board and the National Intelligence Committee. The NSS concludes with a call for unity among all sectors of Philippine society --- that we all have a part to play: government, business and the general public. The NSS process is still in its nascent stage and should be treated as a work in progress. But hopefully, this NSS will set the stage for the formation of national consensus and national will toward the achievement of lasting peace and prosperity across the country. To this end, the support and cooperation of the Filipino people are paramount. [vi] [1] “If we are to embrace the vision of a prosperous Philippines, we have to start putting value to our people’s well-being — because the success of every Filipino’s pursuit in life, liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfillment of our aspirations as a Filipino. We will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community. We will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values. We will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign equality, and again, non-interference.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE State of the Nation Address 2017 [2] h e n a t u r e o f s e c u r i t y c h a l l e n g e s f a c i n g t h e Philippines is more complex today than in the past. These challenges include decades old internal insurgencies that have hampered development and kept the nation in a state of low-level but debilitating conflict. The Mindanao conflict, in particular, has assumed a more complex and menacing form in recent years, triggered by the internal splintering in the Moro movement and further fueled by Islamic State-inspired radicalism. The five-month-long siege in Marawi reflected this dangerous mix. While important peace inroads have been forged with the country’s largest non-state armed rebel groups, the quest for enduring peace in Mindanao remains elusive unless the smaller but decidedly more violent remnant and extremist factions are ultimately defeated. T [3] “NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOW EQUATED NOT ONLY TO T H E T R A D I T I O N A L NOTIONS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND REGIME SURVIVAL, BUT ALSO TO THE OVERALL WELL-BEING OF THE CITIZENS, THE PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND THE P R O T E C T I O N O F T H E E N V I R O N M E N T A N D NATURAL RESOURCES.” Similarly, the Philippines’ current external security environment is marked b y i n c r e a s e d u n c e r t a i n t y a n d unpredictability. Rising tensions in the South China Sea, which nestles the West Philippine Sea, have brought to the fore a changing security backdrop in the Asia- Pacific region. This has prompted the Philippines, which has not confronted any external armed threat since it gained full independence in 1946, to suddenly give the same attention to territorial defense as it does to internal security threats. Since the turn of the millennium, the Filipino people’s understanding of the concept of national security itself has changed dramatically. It is now equated not only to the traditional notions of national defense and regime survival, but also to the overall well-being of the citizens, the promotion of economic development, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. More and more, the new outlook links security to broad political and social concerns, from governance issues, such as graft and corruption, to various other problems bese t t ing much of the d e v e lo p in g w o r ld i n c lu d in g t h e Philippines – i.e., poverty and lopsided development, high crime rate, climate change and environmental degradation, spread of infectious diseases, and trans- border threats such as human and drug trafficking, cybercrime, and money laundering. The above challenges call for a robust, dynamic and pro-active national security framework and infrastructure, capable of dealing with these growing threats in real time. The development of a national security framework aims to ensure that the country’s “sovereignty, terri torial integrity, national interests, and the well- being of its people and institutions are preserved, protected and enhanced.” It serves as a roadmap that guides the State working together with civil society and its leaders in setting vital national goals and objectives and the means to achieve these. [4] Central to the national security f r a m e w o r k a r e t w o i n s e p a r a b l e components: the National Security Policy (NSP) and the National Security Strategy (NSS). While the NSP articulates the domestic and global interests of the Philippines that are vital to national security, the NSS lays down the a p p r o a c h e s a n d r e s o u r c e s f o r implementing the NSP with a view to guarantee the security of the State and its people in a dynamic and constantly changing security environment. As an extension of the NSP, the NSS articulates in operational terms the process of pursuing the national security agenda. This document attempts to fill the remaining gap in the country’s national security paradigm – a problem that had often forced our security planners and managers in the past to adopt an ad hoc and short-sighted outlook, rather than a pro-active and forward-looking one. Undeniably, the evolution of a national security framework has been a long and fragmented process in the Philippines. In fact, it was only in 2011 that the first official publication of the N S P c a m e o u t . T h e i n c u m b e n t administration of President Rodrigo R. Duterte published its own NSP report in April 2017. Successive NSP documents reflect progress in terms of defining the country’s policy framework, but still did not address the need for a clear-cut National Security Strategy. In developing this NSS, the views of relevant government and non- government experts, and other key stakeholders and members of civil society were sought . S ince the secur i ty environment is in a constant state of flux, this NSS shall undergo a continuous process of evolution and shall be reviewed, refined and amended as needed.    [5]   “Traditional and non-traditional security issues test our resolve to promote peace, stability, security and prosperity… Geopolitical and strategic developments around the globe also pose a challenge to our shared interests and goals, if not the security of our environment.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE Speech at the Opening of the 30th ASEAN Leaders’ Summit Manila, Philippines / April 2017 [6] [7] u r n a t i o n a l s e c u r i t y i s confronted by challenges on multiple fronts. Aside from decades-old internal armed threats, there are emerging risks that pose an obstacle to the attainment of national unity, peace and stability, economic development, and enhanced ties with our neighbors and allies. The lack of national and sector-specific security strategies to address current and emerging concerns limits the ability of the Philippine government to effectively handle and manage these increasingly complex challenges. Resolving internal armed conflicts remains our top security concern and a key cornerstone of our peace and development strategy. The government is committed to finding a peaceful socio- political solution to the twin threats posed by a lingering communist rebellion and Muslim separatist insurgency. However, it must also be fully prepared to deal with all eventualities, including the possible failure of all peaceful initiatives. Both in peace and in war, addressing the root causes of conflict and bringing the fruits of development closer to conflict-affected communities should go hand-in-hand with peacekeeping efforts on the ground. O RESOLVING INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS REMAINS OUR TOP SECURITY CONCERN AND A KEY CORNERSTONE OF OUR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. [8] Our external environment likewise needs more focused attention. The Philippines’ archipelagic attributes and geographic location are both a source of strength and vulnerability. From most indications, the Philippines can indeed become a great maritime nation. Among archipelagos in the world, the Philippines is a unique one for the contiguity with which its islands, islets and other marine features are clustered together. Apart from its rich natural endowments, the Philippines also boasts of the highest marine biodiversity in the world and the most number of fish species and marine mammals. It is home to some of the globally-adjudged most beautiful beaches in the world – a great push factor for the country’s booming tourism industry. On the other hand, and as history has shown, our strategic geographic location and rich natural resources have also provided a strong temptation to expansionist powers. The Philippines has not faced any direct threat of foreign armed invasion since the end of World War II, but there are newly evolving regional security uncertainties. Strategically straddled between the bitterly contested South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, where competing interests of superpowers and other countries converge, we must be able to chart our role in an increasingly multi- polar global order. Likewise, there are new threats, possibly more destructive than invading armies. We must be fully equipped not only to deter potential aggressors but also to p ro tec t the a rch ipe lago f rom international terrorists, pandemics, transnational crimes and natural disasters. It is a sad fact that despite the lessons of the past our armed forces remain one of the weakest in Asia, putting in doubt our ability to protect and defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity. [9] Developing a credible defense capability would be a key priority of this administration, while at the same time s t r e n g t h e n i n g a n d p u r s u i n g comprehensive and strategic alliances or cooperation with our friends and partners in the international community. Fighting criminality and illegal drugs is very high on the list of priorities of the current administration. The country’s drug problem is a particular concern as this directly influences criminal activity involving drug abuse, heinous and violent crime, gang-related activities, money laundering, and the corruption of the criminal justice system. Apart from destroying society’s moral fiber, drug abuse has led to the widespread disregard for the rule of law, particularly among our youth. P u r s u i n g a n i n c l u s i v e a n d sustainable economic development is the main pillar of the administration’s economic policy. Despite rapid GDP growth in recent years, poverty incidence in the Philippines – at about 21% -- remains one of the highest in Asia due to unmitigated income gaps and lack of job opportunities to sustain a burgeoning population of about 104 million. Corollary to this, demographic challenges can be either a boon or bane, depending on how we would handle it. For the ‘boon’ part, call center jobs in the cities, strong consumer spending and remittances from millions of Filipinos who work overseas are fueling the Philippine economy. In 2017, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7 percent. It is currently one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, after China’s 6.9 percent and Vietnam’s 6.8 percent. And with the implementation of Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, the growth of the Philippine economy is expected to further accelerate this year. [10] O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , r a p i d population growth and industrialization are putting tremendous pressure on the e c o l o g i c a l b a l a n c e , t r i g g e r i n g unprecedented disasters brought by a deteriorating natural environment. The need to prevent man-made disasters, soften the impact of natural calamities, and save lives is imperative. Many of the possible options and solutions to these complex challenges will likely be difficult, even painful, and there will always be debates and divisions over the proper way to deal with national problems. However, over the long haul, we must accept that we have only ourselves to truly rely on, and that with proper planning, preparation and action, there is nothing that the Filipinos as a nation cannot achieve. (Annex A provides the Challenges in the Internal and External Security Environment) [11] “May we all have a renewed sense of commitment to promote the welfare of our people, safeguard our national interest, and assert our sovereign rights over our waters and all other areas within our jurisdiction.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE Speech During the Philippine Rise Commemoration / May 2018  [12] [13] [14] he development of a national security strategy finds its basis in several important tenets of n a t i o n h o o d an d n a t i o n a l identity. A full appreciation of these fundamental precepts is crucial in any effort to put together national-level or sector-specific strategies. They serve as the overarching context against which all planning and decision-making involving matters affecting national security are undertaken.   National Security Defined Globalization and rapid advances in modern technology have substantially altered the definition of national security, from an exclusive or predominant focus on armed threats to sovereignty and territorial integrity, to clearly non- traditional threats such as trafficking of drugs, cyber security, and extreme weather conditions. For many modern states, including the Philippines, the new outlook encompasses all possible challenges to the people’s way of life, including threats to public safety, governance, economic development, social welfare, and the environment. Implici t ly, the expanded concept highlights not just the threats, but also any new opportunities that could enhance security or speed up the attainment of national goals. Based on the above expanded view, the Philippines defines national security as “the state or condition wherein the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the people’s well- being, core values, and way of life, and the State and its institutions, are protected and enhanced.”   T [15] National Values Our national policies and strategies should be a reflection and extension of the Filipinos’ core national values. Patriotism and love of country, the common good, social justice, liberty and democracy are some of the fundamental values our peop le exp l i c i t l y uphe ld i n t he foundational era of our nationhood, and continue to cherish at the present. This is evident from the preambles, declaration of principles and state policies, and Bill of Rights of the 1899, 1935 and 1987 Constitutions. Today, these values are expressed concisely in the spirit of the following traits that Philippine popular culture attributes to good Filipinos: maka- Diyos (God-fearing), makatao (humane), makabayan (patriotic), and maka- kalikasan (pro-environment). We exalt patriotism as a moral duty of every Filipino, who has an obligation to pursue the promotion of the material and moral welfare of the nation and its people. Devotion to the common good is closely related to this principle, with human life as its central value. Combined, these twin values form the very foundation of our national strength and unity, and key to the Filipino’s sense of oneness amidst diversity in religion, language and ethnicity. The right to exercise one’s religious faith is another fundamental building block of our uniqueness as a people and as a nation. Regardless of wide differences in religious faiths, the belief in an all-powerful God has been key to the Filipinos’ sense of fortitude and desire to lead an upright existence. Faith commonly binds the Filipino family together even in the face of hardships. The preservation, protection and free practice of one’s religious faith is therefore an essential part of our journey as a nation. The quest for justice has always been one of our most fervent national aspirations. We are seeking an egalitarian system of justice where all citizens [16] receive equal treatment and protection before the law. In the same vein, we want to give each person and each community a just and equal share of the fruits of progress while at the same time giving preferential attention to the poor and the marginalized. Our commitment to freedom and democracy is enshrined in our history, throughout our long and bitter struggle for independence, and presently as a maturing Republic. Upholding the rule of law and protecting civil liberties and human rights shall remain as essential pillars of our democratic society. In our continuing quest for the most ideal system of government for the Filipino nation, we must not be afraid to effect positive changes. However, any change should continue to harness the most important backbones of Philippine democracy rooted in the principles of governance by deliberation and persuasion, separation of powers, system of checks and balances, and safeguards against authoritarianism and abuse of state power.  National Interests The national interest is an intrinsic component of the national security framework and reflects our national values. In the Philippine setting, the national interest includes those conditions we consider to be desirable or essential to the unity, survival and well-being of the country and its people. Essentially, it embodies our goals and ambitions as a nation. Our national strategy depends on what our national interests are and how we view these interests in the hierarchy of our national priorities. Within this hierarchy of priorities, we identified the conditions below as core national interests of the Philippines. These interests are permanent ones and considered as absolutely necessary for the very survival of the nation and its people. [17] • Protection of the freedom, public safety and welfare of the people. • Ending all internal armed conflicts, i.e., communist insurgency, violent extremism and terrorism. • Preservation of the sovereignty and integrity of the national territory. • Pursuit of independent foreign policy in the exercise of national sovereignty and self-determination. • Pursuit and sustainment of inclusive economic growth and development. • Protection of the Filipino public from criminality, illegal drugs, pandemics, cyber-attack, and weapons of mass destruction. • Freedom from any forms of nuclear weapons within the Philippine territory. • Protection and preservation of ecological balance. • Promotion of social cohesion and national unity. The conditions identified below, although not directly threatening the survival of the nation, are considered as important for the enhancement of national security and the well-being of the Filipinos. If unfulfilled, these will result in damage that could undermine the attainment of our goals, objectives and programs.   • Development of credible armed forces and pursuit of security sector reform. [18] • Improvement of the criminal justice system. • Pursuit of inclusive economic growth. • Protection and promotion of the welfare of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and Filipino immigrants. • Prevention of other transnational crimes in the country, i.e. trafficking in persons, arms smuggling, money laundering, sea piracy, economic and environmental crime. • Deterrence of illegal migration and intrusion of foreign nationals across borders. • Promotion of the rights and welfare of farmers especially agrarian reform beneficiaries. • Promotion of quality education, competitiveness of graduates, and safe employment environment. Other interests that essentially pertain to our role as a responsible and peaceful member of the regional and global community and reflects the kind of nation we want to be and how we want to present ourselves to the world are the following:   • Participation in international efforts to reduce global warming and adapt on the impacts of the changing climate. • Adherence to international agreements specifically those related to counterterrorism, collective security, and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. [19] • Participation of the Philippines in the United Nations and other international fora and adherence to existing United Nations commitments. • Promotion of dialogue and negotiation to solve any issues of mutual interest.  National Security Vision Our national values and national interests find their best expression in the form of a desired end state and broad national vision. Keeping in mind our definition of national security, our desired end state is a community of peace where security as a public good is delivered effectively. The national security vision sets the country’s desired direction, forms the basis of all subsequent policy and strategy planning, and seeks to build a Filipino nation of empowered citizens, living in freedom, dignity, and prosperity as one community regardless of social status, ethnicity, language, and religion. In our National Security Policy, the Government envisions a Philippines that by 2022 shall become “a secure and prosperous nation wherein the people’s welfare, well-being, way of life and core values; government and its institutions; territorial integrity and sovereignty are protected and enhanced and confident of its place in the community of nations.” [20] As such, this National Security Strategy envisages a safe and secure Philippines, at peace with itself and its neighbors, where its citizens are allowed to reach their full potential through social cohesion and the promotion of social justice and harmony, political stability, sound environmental management, and economic progress.  OUR DESIRED END STATE IS: “A SAFE AND SECURE PHILIPPINES, AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND ITS NEIGHBORS, WHERE ITS CITIZENS ARE ALLOWED TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THROUGH SOCIAL COHESION AND THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HARMONY, POLITICAL STABILITY, SOUND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.” [21] Goals of the National Security Strategy Below is a set of action areas, the fulfillment of which will contribute to the attainment of the desired national security end state. These action areas are expressed in terms of strategic goals and objectives, which in turn form the basis for the formulation of agency/institutional courses of actions.   Guarantee public safety and achieve good governance. Mitigate the impact of health related threats. Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable economy. Achieve food and water security. Safeguard and preserve national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Heighten consciousness and pride on Filipino heritage, culture and values. Promote human and ecological security. Achieve energy security. Ensure maritime and airspace security. Strengthen international relations. Provide strong cyber infrastructure and cyber security. Improve vital transportation infrastructure and port security.  [22] [23] [24] “I’ve always believed that there can really no development and progress, irrespective of the population and the hugeness of the territory, if there is no law and order.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE Speech During the 120th Founding Anniversary Celebration of the Department of Foreign Affairs / June 2018 n its very essence, the National Security Strategy lays down a master plan for the attainment of the national vision of creating a safer and more prosperous Philippines, whereby our national values and way of life are protected and enhanced. The NSS integrates the State’s m a j o r s e c u r i t y p o l i c i e s , g o a l s , responsibilities and courses of action into an overall blueprint for the fulfillment of such a vision. It clarifies the institutional framework within which the concerned government and private institutions will coordinate their activities in order to create an integrated and cohesive national security network. There are several important rationales for the development of an NSS. First, developing an NSS is necessary because security issues significantly affect the Philippines’ chances of attaining all its social and economic goals. Since the security environment itself is changing, the government must regularly evaluate the new challenges and threats it is facing. To address these threats, the government must put together a coherent and effective plan of action. Second, there is the need to provide both political and strategic guidance to the implementors of the NSS. A country has a national security vision and that vision is articulated by the political leadership. The leadership captures and communicates that vision in a strategy so that those who are executing the strategy have something clear in front of them to follow. It defines the roles of institutions and stakeholders in order for them to synchronize their policies and strategies. Likewise, private citizens and civil society sectors should be encouraged to scrutinize it and take the necessary steps to contribute to the accomplishment of national programs. [25] I Third, the NSS helps to generate public awareness and create a common understanding and ownership of issues affecting the country’s security. Through t h i s d o c u m e n t t h e g o v e r n m e n t communicates the national vision and how such a vision is to be achieved. Communicating these issues effectively to target audiences is crucial for securing the kind of consensus, ownership and support the government needs to ensure the success of the strategy. The government needs to communicate the NSS to policymakers in order to secure both political and resource backing for the leadership’s security agenda. Similarly, it is important to communicate the NSS to the general public in order to win the citizens’ cooperation and participation. There is nothing that lures investors more than stability, and there is nothing that scares them more than instability. Fourth, the NSS is about the ends, ways and means. The resource aspect is always a contentious and yet unavoidable issue. One cannot have a strategy without touching on the resource aspect because the strategy will have to be implemented, and if it is going to be implemented, one needs to allocate resources and utilize these resources in the most cost-effective way. Avoiding waste should be a key guiding principle. Having a document that instructs NSS implementors on how to efficiently utilize resources is absolutely critical.   EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER The efficacy of our national security strategy is dependent on our capacity – capability, ability and will - to enforce it. The NSS serves as a catalyst to fulfill the national security vision of the Philippines through the combined and coordinated use of all the resources and instruments of national power – political [26] and legal, diplomatic, informational and intelligence, economic and technological, and military and law enforcement. Protecting the national interests and enforcing national policies call for good governance, a patriotic citizenry united by a common purpose, and a credible armed forces. The country faces a formidable array of internal and external threats to its national interests and well-being that require a mix of national instruments capable of mitigating the risks, upholding national sovereignty, preserving territorial integrity, backing foreign policy, supporting its development thrusts, and protecting public safety and natural resources.   Political and Legal The political and legal instrument shall strengthen policy organization, formulation, legislation, implementation, and the most critical, generation and appropriation of funds. It will address several weaknesses pertaining to bureaucratic turfing, uneven-playing field, p o o r g o v e r n a n c e , u n n e c e s s a r y overlapping and multiple inter-agency mechanisms. It will promote transparent, accountable and participatory governance and explore more efficient ways of undertaking government tasks by developing its e-governance capability. It will strengthen the five pillars of the criminal justice system and empower citizen’s organizations to actively participate in governance, in the implementation of public policies, in cultivating a culture of peace, and mainstreaming conflict sensitive and p e a c e p r o m o t i n g a p p r o a c h e s i n safeguarding the safety of the people. It will seek to pursue and communicate the benefits of a federal-parliamentary form of government and identify the need for the creation of “rules-based” governance in defending our sovereignty and territorial integrity and in resolving internal conflicts.  [27] Diplomatic The dip lomat ic ins t rument provides the parameters on the outward- looking position of the Philippines in the comity of nations within the bounds of international laws, norms and standards. It aims to develop good partnerships and improve all forms of foreign relations in order to ensure the protection of our overseas Filipino workers and advance the pursuit of common interests that are mutually beneficial to the Philippines and other countries.   Informational The informational instrument aims to promote effective governance, through strategic communications, while at the same time countering any misinformation and deceitful propaganda being spread by the enemies of the State. This component also aims to promote national consensus, intelligence fusion and shared understanding particularly with regard to addressing conflicts and its root causes.   Intelligence Intelligence is foreknowledge and therefore should be predictive. It is a vital instrument of national power to realize national goals and objectives and promote the well-being of the nation. Intelligence process provides National Intelligence Estimates and other inputs that are essential for planning and execution of desired political actions and national programs. The intelligence instrument includes human intelligence, signals intelligence, image intelligence, and [28] measurement and signatures intelligence. Counterintelligence or the denial of undesirable information collection efforts is also included under the intelligence instrument. Economic and Technological The economic and technological instrument aims to broaden economic ventures, foster cooperation in the area of innovation and technology development, and promote sustainable development. It aims to pursue rapid economic growth, with particular focus on reducing poverty and income gaps through the creation of more jobs and the improvement of the educa t ion sec tor. Fore ign d i rec t investments are a crucial growth engine and should therefore continue to be e n c o u r a g e d t h r o u g h a p e a c e f u l environment, increased infrastructure spending and a stable fiscal and policy milieu. The protection and preservation of the ecological environment and natural resources will remain a key concern.   Military and Law Enforcement The military and law enforcement instrument includes the use of well- equipped, trained, disciplined and motivated armed forces to maintain law and order at the homefront, and to safeguard and defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity from any threat of foreign armed aggression. It aims to build a credible deterrence capability and enhance mutual defense arrangements with other nations. [29] WEALTH CREATION AND RESOURCE GENERATION Over the past three decades at least, the defense budget process appears to have been afflicted by the paralyzing mindset that “we don’t have the money.” Despite the continuously intensifying internal and external threat environment, such negative mindset essentially ignored the wisdom of investing in safety and strategic security to build a credible deterrence to protect and uphold our national interests. Consequently, the country, by defaul t , has become vulnerable to infiltration, sabotage, poaching, insurgency, terrorism and natural catastrophes. However, with more wealth being created at home in recent years, we now have the unique opportunity to reverse this fatalistic outlook in government. It is time to say, “We have the money and we can find more money”; it is high time we think of national defense not as a financial burden, but as a strategic investment for a safer and more secure future. As an investment, it has payback in terms of enabling and supporting economic growth and sustainable development, and boosting the national morale.  Human Capital Development The Philippines is dealing with a massive crop of Filipino men and women on the threshold to adulthood who potentially form the country’s rich talent pool as thinkers, leaders, entrepreneurs, employers, creative artists, innovators, job creators, job collaborators, technical specialists and experts of all kinds. While we continue to deal with the more obvious risks related to the country’s population boom and the negative effects of a very high population density, we shall focus [30] also on the potential opportunities and harness their full advantage. The provision of quality education complemented by sustainable employment or livelihood opportunities and a stable security environment are integral in solving the country’s multifarious national problems. We have a considerable percentage of English-speaking people and deploy about 8 to 10 million overseas workers spread across continents and working in various levels of expertise. Our overseas workers are exposed to foreign cultures and are knowledgeable in management and in communication and technology applications, making them competitive candidates for future employment both here and abroad. Presently, the Philippines is also the world’s business process outsourcing (BPO) leader. Certainly, our talented and industrious work force represents one of our greatest competitive strengths. To sustain these potentials, the Government shall continue to provide global-standard education for its citizens. However, beyond having the “right stuff,” our human resource also needs to develop the kind of mindframe that compels them to look beyond their own personal interests, needs, or circumstances and attune this with the interests and needs of Philippine society as a whole. This kind of patriotic mindset should be nurtured in every institution of learning, where the students can develop an appreciation and understanding of society, governance, multi-dimensional national security, and sustainable development. The National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP), the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), and other military and police training institutions shall be the primary institutions of learning for building up and expanding the pool of national security leaders and practitioners in the country. [31] National Security Legislation The Government must work towards the enactment of appropriate legislations to address the country’s complex national security challenges, and protect and promote the nation’s interests. One such legislation is the expanded National Security Code in order to meet the continuing threats of terrorism, i n s u r g e n c i e s , c r i m i n a l i t i e s a n d transnational crimes. It will also strengthen the Organization for National Security, revitalize the system for unified coordination among the members of the security community, and provide the legal basis for the formulation, integration, and implementation of the NSP and NSS. The Government will work with Congress to attain the passage of this proposed law. The Government shall also work for the passage of pending bills in Congress pertaining to national security concerns. Among these are the proposed b i l l s on Witness Pro tec t ion and Whistleblowers Act, Uniformed Personnel Pension Reform, National Defense Act, Chemical Weapons Convention Act, Amendments to the Immigration Act, PNP Modernization and Reorganization, Mandatory ROTC, Amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act, Creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience, Protection of Children in Situation of Armed Conflict, Defense Acquisition, Archipelagic Sea Lanes, Maritime Zones, and the draft Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL). The BBL is seen as the political solution to the age old conflict and marginalization in the Bangsamoro region. The Government will vigorously pursue amendments to the Philippine Constitution aimed at facilitating the shift to a new form of government and refining key economic provisions. Executive Orders, Memoranda, Directives, Letter of Instruction, etc. will also be issued from time to time to strengthen security legislation. [32] [33] OTHER LEGISLATIONS AIMED AT ADDRESSING TERRORISM AND ILLEGAL DRUGS 1. Amendments to the Human Security Act (HSA) - to strengthen the coordination and authority of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) and the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) in suppressing terrorism. In amending the HSA, the NICA, or its successor organization, shall continue to perform its duty as Secretariat of the ATC. On the other hand, the ATC-Program Management Center, in addition to its other tasks, shall continue to serve as the coordinator of the Council in the performance of the Council’s functions. The institutionalization of this set up will be done by the inclusion of the ATC-PMC in the HSA amendment. Moreover, the objective of the amendatory bill is generally to make the law consistent with the UN Conventions on Anti- Terrorism and the adoption of international best practices, considering that since the enactment of the HSA, no case has prospered in the country. 2. Amendments to the Anti-Wiretapping Law - to judicially authorize the real-time/live monitoring of telecommunications in cases involving pre-identified and confirmed persons or entities linked to terrorism and other grave criminal activities. 3. Enactment of a SIM Card Registration Law - to pre-identify users of SIM cards and facilitate their identification, as well as deter those who plan to use the same for terrorist or other criminal activities. 4. Amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Financing Law - to freeze any account of pre-identified or confirmed terrorist personalities, organizations or other entities engaged in terrorist financing or trafficking in strategic goods (i.e. weapons of mass destruction and items of dual/alternative use that can be applied in, converted to, or otherwise made a part of weapons of mass destruction, pursuant to our obligation under UNSCR 2178) in coordination with the work of AMLC. 5. Enactment of an Official Secrets Act – to: (1) absorb best practices/provisions from laws of various countries that already have such legislation; (2) provide classification and parameters for classifying government secrets, authority for classifying and declassifying; (3) provide funds for required hardware and software for databases, protocol for storage, retrieval, access to, declassification and release to the public, period for storage, and protocol for destruction; (4) proscribe solicitation by foreign user/s; and (5) legislate severe criminal liability for violations. 6. Amendments to the Cybercrime Law – to authorize, without prior judicial intervention/court order, the blocking of any Internet site or source of pre-identified/confirmed terrorists, terrorist organizations, or others propagandizing, inviting, inducing, recruiting for terrorism, including terrorist financing for timely immediate action. In amending the Cybercrime law, include provision of guidelines and detailed description of the crimes. 7. Amendments to the Passport Law – to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ), without prior judicial intervention/court order, to withhold, suspend, cancel/revoke passports or other travel documents of Filipino extremists who have undergone trainings or have fought with/joined UN proscribed terrorist organizations. The DOJ confirmation of the legal basis for these actions will be for the immediate implementation of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Also, this requires synchronization and amendment of the Immigration Law. Funding National Security Central to the shift in government outlook prescribed above is the need to start exploring the possibility that there are potentially other sources and means to generate funds for the tremendous demands of national security. Funding our credible deterrence capability will end the era of strategic drift that failed to effectively manage safety and security risks. Decades of inaction have led to devastating consequences to internal security and have undermined our ability to adequately prepare for external defense in the future. Keeping defense spending low to save money is a spurious conjecture; it simply pushes expenses for maintenance, training, and capital stock into the future, and at the expense of the country’s security and well-being. There is a need to increase the size and deterrent capability of the Navy and the Air Force as quickly as possible to serve as our external defense, protect our national territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and modernize all branches of the armed forces. In addition, necessary procedures should be taken as outlined above to fix the acquisition system, rebalance compensation for service members, and pass legislations that aim to create new wealth and strengthen human and materiel resources. The above requires a dynamic and collaborative mix of executive and legislative actions, with support from our policymakers and economic managers. In support of our defense modernization, the government has to allocate at least 2 percent of the GDP as the minimum annual budget for the defense sector in order to elevate ourselves from the (near) bottom position and quickly catch up with our ASEAN neighbors, and fully exercise our sovereignty. Myanmar, whose GDP per capita is smaller than the Philippines, allocated 4.8% of GDP (2016) for military expenditure (SIPRI). [34 Apart from the budget provided by the General Appropriations Act (GAA), the Executive and Legislative branches can also work together to identify and develop other potential funding sources. The funds generated from such sources will be lodged in an exclusive national account under the Office of the President with congressional oversight. This is to ensure that the GAA for publ ic administration and the delivery of basic services will not be impacted by the requirements for credible deterrence. There are important caveats to ensure smooth program execution to prevent costly delays. The Procurement Law [35] OTHER POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY • Convert portions of selected idle military lands in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao into defense industrial parks and mixed-use residential-commercial zones, especially those bordering on highly developed regions. Conversion of lands will be coordinated with the concerned departments concerning rules and regulations on land use conversion. • Float long-term bonds or Treasury bills for sale to the corporate and sovereign markets here and abroad. Additionally, create affordable, low-denominated bonds for sale to patriotic individual citizens, to include our OFWs abroad. • Legislate a special national security tax applicable to mass air-sea-land transports and passengers; and to telecommunication companies and end-users. • Legislate a revision of the Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCC) charters to set aside at least 3 percent of annual net income for credible deterrence. • Legislate adjustments in the formula providing for the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of local government units (LGUs) that carves out a significant amount of the annual IRA for credible deterrence. LGUs must be harnessed to help fund the effort which will be used to protect their own territories. • Free up cash generated annually from anti-corruption and efficiency improvement measures targeting at least 10 percent of the GAA in ascending rates over time. needs to be rev i sed a long wi th Commission on Audit (COA) rules and regulations, as well as bidding procedures and the rules of engagement among bidders where bidding cannot be dispensed with, to prevent unwarranted legal obstructionism.   Development of Strategic Industries Developing the strategic industries can make this sector a potential element of national power. With its ample natural resources and huge skilled workforce, the Philippines could become another success story in the field of strategic industries, something long overdue. The long-term objectives are: (1) generate resources and wealth for the Filipino people; (2) expand, diversify and transform the economy of the country -- from an agricultural to an industrial/ manufacturing economy; (3) provide sufficient jobs to sustain the Philippines’ growing population; and (4) accelerate nation-building, economic development, and stability of the country. Of critical importance is the nature of technology to be utilized and the types of industry that can support rapid and sustainable economic development. Among the industries we need to develop further are agriculture and aquaculture, aircraft , investment and banking, biotechnology, construction, disaster prevention, electronics, environment, informat ion and communica t ions technology, land combat, manufacturing, robotics, satellite systems and space, shipbuilding, strategic materials and minerals, transportation, weapons, and tourism. (Annex B provides the list of strategic industries that are vital to national security.) [36] [37] [38] “May we all have a renewed sense of commitment to promote the welfare of our people, safeguard our national interest, and assert our sovereign rights over our waters and all other areas within our jurisdiction.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE Speech During the Philippine Rise Commemoration / May 2018 o achieve the national security vision and protect the national interests, the State must address t h e v a r i o u s t h r e a t s a n d challenges that characterize the evolving strategic security environment. The NSS presents the guiding principles in preparing the strategic action plans to address those challenges. The National Security Council (NSC) shall coordinate and oversee the day-to-day execution of the ongoing security agenda. Together with the agencies under the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace (CCSJP) and the National Intelligence Board (NIB), the NSC shall ensure the cohesion of policies and programs for implementing the security agenda. Through the Cabinet and the Executive Committee of the NSC, the National Security Adviser (NSA) shall report to the President the status of their implementation. Below is a set of specific action areas, the fulfillment of which will contribute to the attainment of the above national vision. Similarly, these action areas were identified following a careful analysis of the various threats and challenges to national security and their associated risks. These action areas are expressed in terms of specific goals and objectives aimed at pro-actively countering or reducing the country’s exposure to these threats. T [39] GUARANTEE PUBLIC SAFETY AND ACHIEVE GOOD GOVERNANCE The Strategy begins with the determination to protect the nation against the range of threats that directly impact on the safety and welfare of the Filipino people. These are terrorism, insurgency and subversion; transnational crimes; criminality and illegal drugs; and graft and corruption.   Terrorism, Insurgency and Subversion The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People’s Army/National Democratic Front (CPP/ NPA/NDF) remains as the most enduring and challenging among the l o c a l r e v o l u t i o n a r y forces. Virtually all provinces in the country are affected by CPP/ NPA/NDF terrorism and ex to r t ion ac t iv i t i e s , including areas with strong presence by non- state armed groups. The CPP/NPA/NDF continues to subvert the state through subterfuge and violence. On and off peace talks with the rebels have been on- going for more than two decades, but there has been little progress. The security situation remains problematic in significant parts of the resource-rich but troubled region of Southern Philippines or Mindanao. [40] The CPP/NPA/NDF continues to wage war against the government. Peace talks with the rebels have been on-going for more than two decades, but there has been little progress. Over the past two decades, two peace deals have been forged with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). However, p e a c e e f f o r t s i n Mindanao have remained f r a g i l e d u e t o t h e splintering of the Moro movement which gave rise to the emergence of smaller but decidedly m o r e v i o l e n t a n d e x t r e m i s t I s l a m i s t jihadists. In recent years, t h e s e g r o u p s h a v e pledged allegiance to the Iraq-born Islamic State (IS) terror network and are believed to be seeking to es tab l i sh an I s lamic caliphate encompassing the entire Southeast Asia. The five-month siege in Marawi City in 2017, led by the Maute brothers and a Hapilon-led faction of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) showed the more m e n a c i n g b r a n d o f Islamist extremism that we are currently facing in Mindanao. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Modernize, professionalize and synergize the Philippine Armed Forces and the National Police to be capable of combating terrorism, insurgency and subversion, quickly and decisively. • Work with Congress to allocate greater resources to modernize our police, military, and coast guard and to enable our troops to confront the challenges of terrorism and insurgency. [41] The five-month siege in Marawi City in 2017, led by the Maute brothers and a Hapilon-led faction of the ASG showed the more menacing brand of Islamist extremism that we are currently facing in Mindanao. • Defeat radicalism and prevent recruitment through an effective whole-of- government approach and address the process of radicalization and de- radicalization through information operations and education. • Implement the peace agreement with the MILF toward healing in the Bangsamoro, complete the implementation of remaining commitments under the GPH-MNLF peace agreement, and work for the immediate conclusion of the peace process with the CBA-CPLA and the RPMP-RPA-ABB. • Provide additional security to future and existing infrastructure projects to prevent militant groups from sabotaging and/or interfering with the projects and structures’ purpose. • Address the plight of the Indigenous Peoples and farmers especially agrarian reform beneficiaries to prevent unrest in the countryside and recruitment of insurgents and terrorists. • Implement peace-promoting and catch-up socioeconomic development in conflict- affected areas and empower communities by increasing their capacity to address conflict and reduce their vulnerabilities. • Strengthen government peace and development institutions and mechanisms to increase their responsiveness to peace, conflict, and security issues. • Ensure government rationalization, coordination, and monitoring of the delivery of socioeconomic programs, and other interventions by donor institutions and government agencies in conflict-affected areas, especially in Mindanao. • In addition to the active force, train and expand the strength of the reservists to at least one percent (1%) of the population pursuant to the Philippine Constitution and the AFP Reservist Act (RA 7077). [42] Transnational Organized Crimes Transnational organized crimes (TOC) and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continue to pose numerous challenges to t h e s t a t e ’s o v e r a l l n a t i o n a l s e c u r i t y . O r g a n i z e d c r i m e s prevalent in the country include drug trafficking, trafficking in persons, piracy and armed robbery against ships, smuggling of small arms and light weapons (gunrunning), internet fraud/identity thef t (cybercr imes) , product counterfeiting (Intellectual Property Rights or IPR theft) and environmental crimes such as wildlife trafficking. Transnational organized crime groups operate like multi-national compan ie s and a s such , p ro f i t - maximization is the primary objective. As new trends in the global market emerge, these groups immediately adapt to developments in information and communications technology (ICT) and t r a d e a n d f i n a n c i a l practices, among others. The Philippines’ shift t o w a r d s g r e a t e r integration within the ASEAN framework blurs the physical lines of state borders that make illicit a c t i v i t i e s e a s i e r t o conduct. This context provides TOC syndicates more opportunities to o p e r a t e a n d t h r i v e . Moreover, violence and corruption are inherent elements of TOC. The rule of law enforced by state authorities is met with violent and armed resistance while corruption of government officials further facilitates the illicit activities of transnational organized crimes without fear of arrest or interdiction.  [43] Transnational organized crimes and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continue to pose numerous challenges to the state’s overall national security. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies on equipment, training, mobility, communications and weapons for effective deterrence and interdiction. • Strengthen the anti-money laundering aspect of investigation by integrating financial investigations in all law enforcement operations. • Improve border management and security on land, water and air. • Create a reliable database on transnational organized crime syndicates for information-sharing with foreign counterparts. • Improve international collaboration and cooperation in both the public and the private sector. • Implement the Strategic Trade Management Act of 2015 to address the threats on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Criminalities, Public Safety, Rule of Law and Human Rights Public safety is defined as the overall welfare and protection of the general public. Prevailing public safety concerns are criminality, illegal drugs, and natural and human-induced disasters. The strategic objective is to mainstream the concept of public safety in the national security agenda to build peaceful, safe and resilient communities. This entails the integration of law enforcement, community policing, disaster management and resilience, and local governance in the security sector framework. In times of calamities or terror attacks, there is a need to prioritize securing access to the affected areas. [44] Public safety can be better established if the roads and bridges leading to the distressed areas are secure and passable. Corollary to this is the promotion of the rule o f l a w a n d t h e observance and respect for human rights. The law is a cornerstone of the country’s democratic values which enables the attainment of public s a f e ty and na t i ona l security goals. To this end , t he S t a t e w i l l vigorously pursue the p r o m o t i o n a n d observance of the rule of law, value the dignity of every human being and guarantee full respect for human rights. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Institutionalize reforms within the PNP that will command community and citizen respect, trust, and confidence. • Build resilient communities that are able to deal with and recover from every crisis. • Guarantee the mobility and secure access of aid workers and peace-keeping officers to affected areas in times of calamities or terror attacks. The strategic objective is to mainstream the concept of public safety in the national security agenda to build peaceful, safe and resilient communities. [45] • Step up police-community partnerships on crime prevention and for the protection of critical infrastructures and installations. • Dismantle all private armies. • Integrate human rights approaches to all aspects of State functions. • Build a system that will allow the exchange of information among law enforcement, prosecution, court and corrections agencies for swift intelligence gathering and apprehension of criminal elements. • Strengthen border control to deter the entry of unlawful elements by passing a new immigration law.  Governance Bad governance and structural inequities have impeded economic progress and continue to demand priority attention, efforts and resources from government. In particular, corruption in the public sector has impeded the development goals of the State. It diverts scarce resources f r o m t h e p o o r a n d vulnerable sectors of society. Promoting a c u l t u r e o f g o o d g o v e r n a n c e w i l l , therefore, benefit the long-term security of the country. I t e n t a i l s t h e efficient and effective use o f r e s o u r c e s t o implement the priority programs and projects of the State to end extreme poverty and raise the living standards of every Corruption in the public sector has impeded the development goals of the State and diverts scarce resources from the poor and vulnerable sectors of society. [46] Filipino. The overall strategic priorities are to reduce corruption and increase accountability and transparency in the government. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Instill accountability and transparency in the government and stop corruption. • Empower our people to cope with developments in science and technology, shifts in economic power, and demographic and social change. • Ensure in-city relocation site of communities that will be affected by rapid urbanization and development programs. • Encourage public participation through active 24/7 hotline 8888. • Professionalize the civil service for a more competent and principled government workforce. • Pursue and communicate the benefits of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) and a federal-parliamentary form of government.   [47] MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH-RELATED THREATS Health security today demands greater attention than before. New diseases are emerging and spreading; virus and bacteria are developing drug- resistant strains; and laboratories are working on dangerous bacteria and viruses. The ease of global travel has increased the risk of rapid spread and contamination, as well as challenged existing containment protocols. Moreover, the proliferation of illegal drugs has been another major health problem as it primarily destroys the human brain which impacts mental health. Drug abuse leads to serious crimes, which in turn can destroy lives and families as well as the erosion of social peace. A l t h o u g h t h e g o v e r n m e n t acknowledges that the victims of drug addiction are health patients, it is inclined to treat the issue as a socio-political one requi r ing a more comprehens ive government intervention.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS: Health and Nutrition • Strengthen the nation’s capacity and continue collaboration with other countries particularly the United Nation’s World Health Organization in preventing, detecting, and responding to epidemics/pandemics. • Maintain the high level of 24/7 preparedness and quick response capabilities. • Modernize the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and continue the capability building of its research teams. [48] • Develop or further strengthen facilities for detection (i.e. Laboratories and Toxicology / Poison Centers) and case management for victims / casualties of Chemical, Biological, and Radio-Nuclear (CBRN) incidents. • Scale up public hospitals to at least level III as well as the government vaccination program coverage. • Establish a genuine, pro-poor universal health care system wherein public hospitals are given more financial support by the national government and local government units (LGUs).  KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS: Illegal Drugs and Substance Abuse • Enhance community-based rehabilitation programs through the Department of Health (DOH) and local health units (LHUs). • Educate the youth on the ills of illegal drugs and substance abuse. • Improve the socio-economic welfare of the people through education and livelihood programs. • Create an information / database system on illegal drugs and substance abuse. • Develop a comprehensive post release monitoring plan to prevent a relapse or return to illegal drug use and substance abuse. • Tap the religious sectors, media, academia and other relevant non-government organizations in rehabilitation programs and anti-illegal drug use and substance abuse campaign. [49] DEVELOP A DYNAMIC, INCLUSIVE, AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY The prevailing challenge of the 21st century is how to achieve the competitive advan tage . The cha l l enges o f g loba l i za t ion such a s economic i n t e g r a t i o n a n d increasing competition have called for the development of the s t r a t eg ic indus t r i e s w h i c h c a n p l a y a significant role in the country’s pursuit of r a p i d e c o n o m i c d e v e l o p m e n t a n d national security. Wi t h i t s r i c h natural and mineral resources, vibrant and resilient people, and mobility of labor and capital, the country can easily ride the tide of post-modernization. The country’s expansive arable lands and rich fishing grounds indicate that agribusiness and fishing will continue to thrive. Meanwhile, businesses in t h e m a n u f a c t u r i n g , banking and finance, and services segments can continue to take advantage of the country’s large pool of young, skilled, English- speaking and hardworking labor force. I n d u s t r i e s s u c h a s aviat ion, electronics , i n f o r m a t i o n a n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n s technology, land combat systems, robotics, satellite s y s t e m s a n d s p a c e technology, shipbuilding, strategic minerals, and weapons manufacturing, are supported by The challenge of globalization is how to translate human innovation and technological progress into the development of strategic industries which can create wealth for national development and national security. [50] paral le l industr ies such as par ts manufacturing, machining and assembly. Other industries with promising potential in the Philippines are logistics a n d t r a n s p o r t , b i o t e c h n o l o g y , construction, and renewable energy. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Promote military and defense establishments’ partnerships with the private sector and foreign companies in the build-up of strategic industries. • Develop and harmonize industry-based graduate and undergraduate programs and curricula with global standards and 21st century competencies. • Create more vibrant and livable growth centers to help decongest main urban areas and ensure a safe employment environment. • Promote science and technology competencies, programs and courses to develop and build an adequate pool of technocrats and scientists. • Fill the industry gaps by establishing supporting industries like industrial steel manufacturing (ISM) for steel refinery and recovery, and intelligent solutions industry (ISI) for highly-in-demand products and technology. • Support access to quality education and the competitiveness of human resource through people-to-people exchanges, and overseas training and education. • Support innovation-based interventions / technologies to enhance industry / Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) productivity. [51] ACHIEVE FOOD AND WATER SECURITY Food is the most important commodity in populous Philippines. Combined with our military instrument which is now among the weakest in Asia, food is a major element of Philippine national power. Among the various food items, rice is the staple food not only of Filipinos but most neighboring countries in Asia and even in Africa. I t i s a p o l i t i c a l commodity because its shor tage has caused social unrest and even a global food crisis in the past. This is why food security has become a significant national security concern. It is the policy of the government to ensure that every Filipino shall have food on their table, especially the poorer sector of society. It is a major challenge then for the government to come up with the necessary strategies to ensure c o n t i n u o u s d e v e l o p m e n t o f t h e agricultural and fishery sectors and mitigation of the adverse effects of man- made and natural crises on food security. Related to this, food security is closely linked t o w a t e r s e c u r i t y . Without water, there will hardly be food; and without secure water for crops, livestock, and human use, there will be conflict. The agricultural food-based production depends solely on water resource. Watersheds provide irrigation to agricultural lands especially lands planted with food crops such as rice and corn. [52] Food is a political commodity. Its shortage has caused social unrest in the past. Food security is closely linked with water security. However, despite the abundance of water in the country, there has still been a decline of supply of water in many parts of the country. The declining water supply was due to decades of resource mismanagement, inadequate investments in physical infrastructure, and the growing threat of climate change. Consequently, it has resulted to drought and desertification in some parts of the country. Water security then has become a major national security concern that the government should address. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS: Food Security • Address the problem of land conversion particularly the prime agricultural lands that are converted into non-agricultural uses and building of irrigations. • Allot bigger subsidy for the agricultural production of small and middle income farmers, implement genuine land reform, and respect the indigenous people’s right to their ancestral land. • Make use of technologies that have been proven beneficial to farmers and fishermen, to the health of the people and to the environment. • Implement a social development program that will enable poor communities to stand on their own and utilize their own resources. • Adopt a multi-faceted whole-of-government approach including partnerships with a wide range of non-government development actors and groups. [53] • Provide social protection schemes and educational assistance for farmers and fishermen. • Upgrade infrastructure, rehabilitate and protect major ecosystems, and adopt a basin-approach to environmentally sound management of resources. • Improve awareness, appreciation and coverage of small farmers and fisherfolk on risk insurance and resiliency to climate and disaster risks. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS: Water Security • Adopt the principles of integrated water resources management and sustainable forest conservation and management practices. • Promote social and individual awareness about water issues and encourage civil society participation in decision-making regarding environmental impacts and other measures. • Implement policies, plans and programs on the tenurial rights of indigenous peoples and forest dwellers, log ban, and mining operations in forest areas, protected areas and watersheds. • Rehabilitate mangrove forests and build water catchments and impounding facilities. [54] SAFEGUARD AND PRESERVE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY In safeguarding and preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Philippines shall provide emphasis on the implementation of a s t r o n g i n d e p e n d e n t foreign policy. At the very least, the Philippines n e e d s t o p r o j e c t a m i n i m u m d e f e n s e credibility. In particular, the dispute in the West Philippine Sea depicts the i m m e n s e h i s t o r i c a l , e c o n o m i c , l e g a l , diplomatic, and environ- menta l complexi t ies involved in the dispute pitting the Philippines with several other claimant countries. Actions to address the West Philippine Sea issue should look into the interplay of these dynamics and how government effor ts and resources should be prioritized. Relatedly, a media campaign at home and abroad on the Award issued by the Tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the West Philippine Sea dispute is called for. Over the past several decades , the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has b e e n p e r f o r m i n g multifarious functions, putting a strain on its limited equipment and resources. Apart from its main duty o f p r o t e c t i n g a n d defending the national territory against external threats, the AFP has been required to also support the internal security operations against terrorism and Islamic and communist insurgents. The military has also been at the frontline of The respective roles and mandates of our military, law enforcement agencies, reservists, and other key stakeholders need to be aligned with the country’s national security goals and objectives. [55] government rescue and relief operations during natural calamities and other disasters. In view of our limited capabilities and resources, the respective roles and mandates of our military, civilian law enforcement agencies, reservists, and other key stakeholders will need to be synchronized and aligned with the country’s national security goals and objectives. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Modernize the deterrent and self-defense capabilities of our ground, naval, littoral and air forces. • Enhance professional development of foreign service personnel and members of defense and foreign attaches. • Strengthen cooperation and peaceful approach with countries sharing common maritime borders and interests. • Pursue the passage of relevant national security legislations. • Support bilateral, regional and global mechanisms that promote peace and security, the rule of law and peaceful resolution of disputes. [56] HEIGHTEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND PRIDE ON FILIPINO HERITAGE, CULTURE AND VALUES The Philippines is a nation of diverse cultures that were rooted from the East and the West. But even prior to colonization, our indigenous peoples already had their distinct justice and governance systems, customs and traditions, arts, literature, music, dance, and values. This was later influenced by the introduction of Islam, the coming of the Chinese , the Spaniards , the Americans, and the Japanese. These various cultural influences have led us to become a country with 120-170 languages and dialects, spoken by 110 ethno-linguistic groups, and having distinct values of friendliness, hospitality, spirituality, and gratitude. Culture is also varied according to age group, gender, spirituality, and socio- economic class. Just like the archipelagic nature of our country, we take pride in our heritage of looking at our narratives – from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao – as being one history of the Filipino people. The Government needs to work towards preserving and enriching our sense of national pride in our unique historical roots, culture and value systems. [57] Given the rich cultural background of the Filipinos, it is the responsibility of the government to work towards preserving and enriching our sense of national pride in our unique historical roots, culture, and values systems. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Conserve, protect and promote the nation’s historical and cultural heritage. • Encourage the continuing and balanced development of a diverse culture by the people. • Ensure the widest dissemination of artistic and cultural products among the greatest number of people across the country and overseas for their appreciation, enjoyment and promotion. • Integrate the history, culture and identity studies of Filipino-Muslims and Indigenous people in the study of Philippine History in both basic and higher education. • Encourage and support continuing discussion and debate through symposia, workshops, publications, etc., on the highest norms available in the matrix of Philippine culture. • Embed the culture of nation-building, inclusiveness, cultural and gender- sensitivity and global citizenship in all aspects of education. [58] PROMOTE HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL SECURITY Climate change as well as natural and human-induced emergencies and disasters have become one of the most significant human security concerns of our time. The Philippines, in particular, is susceptible to both geological and hydro- meteorological hazards. In fact, the World Risk Report 2016 puts the country at third place among the countries with the highest disaster risk in the world, next to Vanuatu (first) and Tonga (second). With temperature and rainfall projected to increase from now until 2050 because of climate change, the impact of natural disasters is expected to increase. With the onslaught of the 2013 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Bohol and the 2013 Category 5 Super Typhoon Yolanda/ Haiyan in Leyte, we have seen how natural disasters have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, livelihood, businesses, and infrastructure. They have pushed people to poverty, d i s p l a c e m e n t a n d h u n g e r , a n d h a v e reversed some of our recent economic gains. In times of disasters, equally important is to give first responders access to disaster areas and provide re l ief g o o d s t o a f f e c t e d citizens. It is therefore imperat ive for the government, with the s u p p o r t o f a l l stakeholders, to better promote human and ecological security and seriously address the negative effect of climate change and disaster risks in the country. Climate change as well as natural and human-induced emergencies and disasters have become one of the most significant human security concerns of our time. [59] KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Adopt a set of approaches on the sustainable development goals to promote human security, significantly reduce poverty, protect the environment and ensure prosperity. • Develop environment-friendly technology and engineering solutions to address climate change and mitigate its negative impacts. • Strengthen the role and capability of the local government units and security forces in disaster, emergencies and crises response. • Allocate sufficient public funds and investments in disaster risk reduction and management and to personnel engaged in disaster-risk and reduction activities. • Promote “clean and green” consciousness in the Filipino youth through education and community-based programs and policies. • Mitigate the negative effects of climate change and calamities by having in place multiple plans to deliver relief goods in disaster areas. • Institutionalize punitive actions against local government units that prove unwilling to exert best efforts in cleaning and protecting the environment. • Dismantle private enterprises that adversely and significantly affect the environment by failing to comply with government regulations. [60] ACHIEVE ENERGY SECURITY E n e r g y s e c u r i t y i s t h e uninterrupted availability of energy sources to all households and economic sectors throughout the country at an affordable price. The Philippines is committed to secure and protect energy supply throughout the country, sustain and develop existing energy sources, develop a l t e r n a t i v e , s u s t a i n a b l e , a n d environmental-friendly sources of energy to support the growing demands of economic enterprises and households, and contribute to global efforts to address the negative effects of climate change.  KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Secure and protect the generation, distribution and transmission of domestic fuel resources. • Promote the use of alternative fuels and the aggressive development of renewable energy potentials such as biomass, natural gas, solar, wind, and ocean resources. • Pursue the development of alternative non-conventional energy technology for non-commercially viable remote areas and smaller villages. • Pursue a policy environment that hosts the convergence of education, scientific research, and business interests in promoting clean and renewable energy. • Improve the supply and maintain affordable pricing of oil and electricity services nationwide; • Utilize the services of international partners and explore the latest scientific innovations in achieving energy security. • Fast track implementation of the Philippine Energy Plan 2012-2030. [61] ENSURE MARITIME AND AIRSPACE SECURITY The Philippines has the third longest coastline in the world after Indonesia and Canada and is the world‘s sixth largest producer of fish. Fish is a main protein source and fisheries are a main source of livelihood for Filipinos in coastal areas. Fisheries have historically supported the survival of coastal populations and are vital to food security. The sea is extremely significant from an international navigational, economic, geopolitical and strategic perspective. Oil and gas resources have been proven to exist in areas adjacent to and closest to the coastlines of littoral states. The sea is also a lifeline for trade and energy supplies as well as for military navigation. Currently, the Philippines has difficulty patrolling its vast expanse of water due to lack of equipment and resources stemming mainly from meager border security and defense funding. There is an urgent need to develop a modern and adequately-equipped border security force capable of ensuring maritime and airspace security. [62] There is an urgent need to develop a modern and adequately-equipped border security force capable of ensuring maritime and air space security. Laws to counter illegal activities within the Philippines’ maritime and air spaces need to be strengthened. Security cooperation and political agreements should also be strengthened to promote regional peace and stability. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Integrate management plans and operations in our air and maritime domains. • Identify and acquire equipment to provide nationwide 24/7 domain awareness, and effectively manage and control Philippines air and maritime spaces. • Harmonize agency capability plans, legal and fund requirements relative to air and maritime security and development missions. • Establish comprehensive and integrated databases for planning and decision- making. • Promote maritime domain awareness. [63] STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS The present global political, economic and security order requires an independent foreign policy to ensure a s t a b l e a n d s e c u r e external environment for the country and people to thrive as a united and progressive nation. An independent foreign policy shall be geared towards bolstering cooperative and harmonious relations with all countries at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, promoting development through i n t e r n a t i o n a l cooperation and economic diplomacy, protecting the rights and welfare of overseas F i l i p i n o s , a n d advancing Philippine global stature through c o m m i t m e n t t o international obligations.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Promote amity and cooperation with all nations by enhancing bilateral relations, strengthening alliances and strategic partnerships, and developing new security or cooperation arrangements. • Expand and enhance engagements and cooperation with regional and international organizations, particularly in areas of interest to the country. • Expand the global presence of the Philippine Foreign Service and key attached agencies and establish Foreign Service posts in strategic areas. • Expand security, defense, social and economic diplomacy in support of the national vision and the country’s security and development agenda. An independent foreign policy shall be geared towards bolstering cooperative and harmonious relations with all countries. [64] PROVIDE STRONG CYBER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER SECURITY The Internet has become not only a ready source of information for research and education purposes, but has also become a platform to promote a culture of peace among people with varying cultures. On the other hand, the Filipinos’ increased dependence on online connectivity has also m a d e t h e p u b l i c , i n c l u d i n g t h e g o v e r n m e n t a n d business sectors, more vulnerable to various forms of web-based crimes. With advances in t echnology and innovations in the computer and mobile industry surging at a very fast pace, protecting its citizens and institutions from falling victims to cybercrimes has become a major challenge for the government. Moreover, the easy access to the Internet has also been used by insurgents, terrorists and other groups to publicize their actions and promote their cause. This has also resulted in the rise of r a d i c a l i z a t i o n a n d violent ext remism, especially among the vulnerable youth who are tech savvy. The protection of critical infrastructure from c y b e r a t t a c k s a n d i n f o r m a t i o n m a n i p u l a t i o n h a s b e c o m e a n u rg e n t impe ra t i ve . Our inability to harness the potentials and thwart the threats from cyberspace could imperil the country’s vital interests, critical infrastructure and installations, institutions, and the patrimony of the country and people. The protection of critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and information manipulation is an urgent national security concern. [65] Philippine initiatives have to be promoted and aligned to efforts of all countries that pursue a secure and reliable cyberspace environment. KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Protect the business and supply chains via the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Plan’s (NCSP) National Common Criteria Evaluation Program. • Establish the National Cyber Intelligence Platform for shared situational awareness and strengthen the capabilities of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to assess our vulnerabilities and to improve the country’s protection profiles in cyberspace. • Conduct a continuing cyber security education campaign to raise public awareness especially among the youth on the terrorist activities in the cyberspace. • Increase the supply of national cybersecurity professionals and experts. • Work with the global community to address the gaps and ongoing improvement in our national cyber security posture and coordinate law enforcement, investigation and prosecution of cyber criminals. • Provide a predictable and sustained clarity of roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders during the cyber-attacks. [66] IMPROVE VITAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND PORT SECURITY Transport is a critical sector of the Philippine economy, linking its people and business hubs across its many islands. B u t a b o o m i n g p o p u l a t i o n , r a p i d u r b a n i z a t i o n a n d d e c a d e s o f u n d e r s p e n d i n g i n i n f r a s t r u c t u r e development have left their mark upon the transport network in terms of ageing and o v e r l y - s t r a i n e d in f r a s t ruc tu re . I t s limited road network a n d c o n t i n u o u s l y increasing number of p r i v a t e v e h i c l e s exceeding the road network’s absorptive capacity have also exacerbated road congestion, pollution, and motor vehicle accidents especially in Metro Manila, the country’s financial and political hub. Developing an integrated and sustainable transport network that can move goods, people and services m o r e s p a c i o u s l y , efficiently, and safely is therefore an urgent c o n c e r n o f t h e Philippine government. Relatedly, the increased t h r e a t s p o s e d b y t e r r o r i s m a n d transnational crimes prompt more stringent i n t e r n a l s e c u r i t y protocols and measures. More thorough security m e a s u r e s m u s t b e implemented in the country’s aviation, port and cargo, and immigration facilities. The increased threats posed by terrorism and transnational crimes prompt more stringent internal security protocols and measures. More thorough security measures shall be implemented in the country’s aviation, port and cargo, and immigration facilities. [67] KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS • Enhance the transportation systems and train the personnel in responding to security threats or breaches of security in all roads and highways, seaports, and airports. • Develop inter-island connectivity nationwide, construct subways and overpasses in strategic routes, and adopt automated guideway transit (AGT) systems. • Establish and maintain a database for all the domestic and foreign transportation security threats. • Conduct a continuing awareness campaign on the security risks and threats to our transportation infrastructure, seaports and airports. • Establish partnerships with law enforcement officials, emergency responders, public safety agencies, and foreign counterparts with jurisdiction over transportation and port security. • Build strategic routes to transportation hubs that would improve the response time of law enforcement officials, emergency responders and public safety agents in times of emergencies, security threats or breaches of security or natural or human- induced disasters. • Adopt and fully implement international security protocols on port security, port access and facilitation. [68] [69] [70] “Ours is a rich country. Wealth that this country is endowed with is a gift from God to be utilized for the people’s welfare and the common good… That is why I say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth. What is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes… Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors and commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the Philippines to process our raw materials into finished products.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE State of the Nation Address 2017 o advance our national interests and achieve the national vision, the Philippines needs a coherent and cohesive national security organization that can effectively respond to the ever-shifting realities in the security environment. The organization for national security is primarily responsible for integrating the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities related to several critical aspects of national security management, i.e., information/intelligence gathering; conducting policy research and analysis; formulating policies; crafting action plans; and coordinating, overseeing and monitoring the status of implementation of action plans. The Philippines has an already existing national security infrastructure that has served the country well through its many crises and national emergencies. However, given the highly fluid and often unpredictable nature of the threats and challenges we are facing, the quest for a better way of accomplishing tasks should be a continuing goal of our national security managers and practitioners.   THE ORGANIZATION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY As Head of State and Government, the President of the Republic of the Philippines plays a central role in national security management and decision- making primarily in terms of giving broad guidance and impetus to the formulation and implementation of national security policies and strategies. In performing such a role, he is aided by two multi-agency bodies: the National Security Council (NSC) and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board. The President has also the authority to seek advice from other members of the Filipino national community. T [71] [72] A. National Security Council (NSC) The National Security Council is the principal advisory body on the proper coordination and integration of policies and plans affecting national security. The NSC consists of two distinct bodies – the Council Proper and the Office of the National Security Adviser and Director General of the NSC Secretariat. The National Security Council Proper is a collegial body chaired by the President. It is composed of the Vice President, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, selected Cabinet members, former presidents, and other government officials and private citizens or organizations who may be invited by the President. Theoretically, the Council Proper is where crucial policy decisions are arrived at. However, being collegial in nature, the Council Proper is convened only periodically, as may be called by the President. The NSC Secretariat, on the other hand, is a permanent body that provides technical support to the Council Proper. It is headed by the Director General, who is at the same time the National Security Adviser (NSA). Under the direction of the President, the National Security Council’s main functions are: • Assist the President in directing the National Security Policy and in giving direction to the execution of the National Security Strategy; • Guide in the drafting of any second- level Strategies that are deemed necessary and, if appropriate, proceed to their approval; • M o n i t o r c o m p l i a n c e i n t h e implementation of the National Security Strategy and approve the Annual Security Report for submission to Congress; • Direct and coordinate national crisis management; • Establish the necessary guidelines for planning and coordinating the National [73] Security Policy and the National Security Strategy; • Oversee the proper functioning of the intelligence and the national security community; • Perform other tasks attributed to it by law or as directed by the President. B. Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace Over the past decades, successive administrations have organized and reorganized a Cabinet Cluster on national security matters. At present, the Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace (EO No. 24, series of 2017) has been tasked to ensure the preservation of national sovereignty and the rule of law; as well as focus on the protection and promotion of human rights and the pursuit of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. The cluster is also the principal government body that supervises the government’s responses during emergencies related to national security. The Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace is responsible for coordinating and harmonizing efforts to formulate the country’s national security policies and strategies. Once adopted, it is the responsibility of the cluster to monitor the status of implementation and assess the impact of these policies and strategies. The Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace is chaired by the Secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND), and has as its members the following: Executive Secretary; Cabinet Secretary; Secretaries of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Department of Justice (DOJ); the National Security Adviser; and the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. The NSC Secretariat acts as the Cluster Secretariat. [74] C. National Intelligence Board It is in the national interest to widen and diversify the sources of intelligence information from the civilian and military sectors and intensify the coo rd ina t i on and i n t eg ra t i on o f intelligence activities. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 246, series of 1987, the National Intelligence Board (NIB) is mandated to coordinate and integrate all intelligence activities in the Government. It is therefore the responsibility of the NIB to monitor and verify compliance of the Intelligence Community’s activities with the National Security Strategy. The National Security Strategy will be revised periodically based on the Board’s advice and recommendation. The NIB submits an Annual Report to the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and debates on the guidelines of the policies and strategic lines of actions of the NSS. The National Security Adviser / Director General of the National Security Council Secretariat (NSA/DG-NSCS), as Chair of the NIB (A.O. No. 124, series of 2005) transmits the said Report to the President, the Council Proper, and the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace. In his capacity as Chair of the NIB, the NSA/ DG-NSCS shall conduct periodically an audit of the overall performance of the Intelligence Community in order to ensure that the programs undertaken achieve the identified goals. AO 124 likewise directs the NSA / DG-NSCS to revitalize the Intelligence Community to render it more responsive for the demands of the new security environment consistent with this Strategy and the President’s directives and guidelines. The Vice-Chair of the NIB is the Director-General of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) and its members are senior officials of the following: DFA, DND, DILG, DOJ, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Department of Trade [75] and Industry (DTI), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Transportation (DOTr), Department of Agriculture (DA), D e p a r t m e n t o f E n e r g y ( D O E ) , Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), D e p a r t m e n t o f To u r i s m ( D O T ) , Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Finance (DOF), Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP), Presidential Communicat ions and Operations Office (PCOO), Department of In fo rmat ion and Communica t ion Technology (DICT), Department of Education (DepED), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). The following agencies serve as technical advisers to the NIB: NICA, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Bureau of Immigration (BI), Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Anti- Terrorism Council (ATC), Philippine Center on Transnational Crimes (PCTC), and Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC). [76] D. National Intelligence Committee T h e N a t i o n a l I n t e l l i g e n c e Committee (NIC), serves as the principal advisory body for the coordination, integration and fusion of all intelligence activities relating to the preparation of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) and in addressing other issues of national intelligence concern. It is a collegial body for the purpose of promoting unity and cohesion of the national intelligence community as well as for prescribing policy guidelines and directives to various national government units, agencies and offices engaged in activities involving national intelligence. The NIC is chaired by the Director G e n e r a l , N a t i o n a l I n t e l l i g e n c e Coordinating Agency (NICA) and has the following as members: Undersecretary, DFA; Director, NBI; Commissioner, Bureau of Customs (BoC); Commissioner, Bureau of Immigration (BI); Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (J2), AFP; Director for Intelligence (DI), PNP; and Commanding Officer, Presidential Security Group (PSG). In September 2017, President Duterte amended Administrative Order No. 68 which created the NIC, to include the PDEA, the PCG, and the Office for Transportation Security (OTS) to the committee. [77] REINVIGORATING THE NATIONAL SECURITY SECTOR The effectiveness of the national security sector depends on its ability to remain pro-active and dynamic in the face of rapidly and ever-changing national security environment. To do so, it must constantly conduct a self-evaluation and seek self-perfection. Revitalizing the sector may necessitate updated education and training, structural realignments and streamlining to ensure a more efficient command and control and a more cost- effective utilization of government resources and manpower. Given the complex gamut of security-related disasters and emergencies that may arise, the country’s crisis management capability should be one of the top priorities in any serious effort to revitalize the national security sector. In particular, the crisis-management sector should evolve into a highly equipped, trained, motivated, systematic, organized and reliable system that can readily and speedily respond to crisis situations as they arise, or anticipate crisis situations and prevent them even before they arise. The system should be able to readily issue and coordinate clear guidelines for action while following standardized and inter- operable instruments within the purview of the national security structure. It shall provide close supervision over the operations of designated units on the ground as well as provide a system of monitoring and providing feedback and situation updates in as real time as possible. Meanwhile, the role of the NSC Proper and Secretariat should be further honed and tapped. Ideally, the NSC is the lead instrumentality of the national government mandated to address the multi-faceted national security concerns of the Philippines. So far, however, its activities have been largely limited to making decisions on high-impact external and internal security issues confronting the country. Executive Order No. 115 [78] (series of 1986) states that the function of the NSC is “to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, military, political, economic, social, and educational policies relating to the national security so as to enable all concerned ministries, departments, and agencies of the government to meet more effectively, problems and matters involving the national security.” Relatedly, the NSC Secretariat’s role of providing technical assistance to the Council Proper should be further optimized by developing its potential for research and national security policies and strategies formulation, management and communication tasks. Additional staffing should be provided and adequate training programs initiated in order to develop a highly competent pool of policy research and intelligence analysts and national security managers and communicators. Reforming the national security sector and perfecting the crisis- management system would necessitate efforts to institutionalize the changes. This may be done through legislation or executive orders. The NSC Secretariat is currently in the process of preparing a draft bill for National Security which will be submitted to Congress for approval. In t h e m o r e i m m e d i a t e t e r m , institutionalizing and managing the National Security Strategy process must be put into place. “REVITALIZING THE SECURITY SECTOR MAY NECESSITATE UPDATED EDUCATION AND T R A I N I N G , S T R U C T U R A L R E A L I G N M E N T S A N D STREAMLINING TO ENSURE A MORE EFFICIENT COMMAND AND CONTROL AND A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND MANPOWER.” [79] “Nawa ay maging daan ang pagkakaisa at kabayanihang ipinamalas ng ating mga bayani tungo sa mas makabuluhan at pangmatagalang pagbabago sa ating mga pamayanan.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE Message During the 120th Anniversary Celebration of the Philippine Independence Day / June 2018 [80] [81] he Philippines emerged from a unique set of historical and geopolitical circumstances that have combined to create a resilient and vibrant nation. However, it continues to be slowed down from within by long-standing political-security problems that have impeded the country’s ability to realize its full developmental potential. Resolving the country’s domestic troubles has gained more significance as the nation endeavors to better define its role in relation to the outside world, which is currently in a rapid state of flux. If unprepared, the Philippines will find it quite difficult to face its external challenges and to fully take advantage of new and exciting possibilities in the emerging global economic order. Only by ending all internal conflicts, creating a safer society, and making the fruits of development more evenly distributed among its people can this nation hope to live up to the challenges it faces today. Through a careful identification of the national interests and what currently threaten such interests, 12 major national security goals have been outlined in this NSS. Every goal reached should bring the nation a step closer to its vision of a more peaceful, more prosperous and better future for the Filipino people. To achieve the national vision, the State must harness all the assets and resources at its disposal. This requires the entire government and other sectors of society to work together, shoulder-to- shoulder, in a more well-planned, organized and synchronized manner toward the fulfillment of the 12-point national security agenda. All government departments and agencies should critically examine their policies and conduct their own internal assessment of their roles in realizing these national goals. [82] T Further reforms are needed in the national security sector to make it more efficient and proactive, able to respond quickly and effectively to national emergencies as they arise, and to predict and preempt crisis situations even before they arise. The national security community must make an effort to constantly seek self-perfection, hone and learn new skills, and overcome some of its most serious internal weaknesses related to turf issues and negative mindsets. Finally, this NSS requires no less than a whole-of-nation campaign. In our quest for meaningful change and a better future, every individual citizen, every sector of civil society, is enjoined to work hand-in-hand with the Government in the highest spirit of the Filipino people’s culture of “bayanihan.” As earlier pointed out, the NSS initiative is a relatively nascent process in the Philippines and will therefore be updated as needed. It will be difficult to always agree among ourselves on issues related to national development and national security, but this in itself should be viewed as a necessary precondition for n a t i o n a l r e n e w a l a n d s o c i e t a l transformation. [83] [84] “Let us work together and lay a new foundation in which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow.” President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE State of the Nation Address / 2017 ANNEX A – THREATS AND CHALLENGES IN THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT (NSP 2017-2022)    The national security sector needs to give focused attention to several major internal and external issues and challenges confronting the Philippine society.   INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT Law and Order and Administration of Justice The Philippines has grappled for years with a serious peace and order problem. The national crime rate, considered as one of the highest in Southeast and East Asia, has posed a significant deterrent to investments as well as constrained the country’s overall development potential. While the number of reported crimes has been rising, the ability of the police to solve crime has decreased. The twin scourge of corruption and patronage politics plaguing law enforcement institutions and government sector as a whole has made it extremely hard, if not impossible, to bring the crime rate down. Clearly, ensuring public security and enforcing the rule of law is one of the key governance challenges confronting the Philippine Government. This has amplified the need to undertake crucial r e f o r m s a i m e d a t c l e a n s i n g a n d strengthening the five pillars of the criminal justice system, namely: law enforcement, the courts, prosecution, c o r r e c t i o n a l i n s t i t u t i o n s , a n d t h e community. The Philippines’ growing illegal drugs problem in particular needs a determined and proact ive solut ion. Successive researches and pertinent crime statistics in the Philippines show a strong and direct correlation between crimes, especially serious or violent ones, and drug abuse. Any serious campaign to fight crime should therefore also involve a resolute crusade to stamp out drug abuse. This is a tough challenge. In 2015, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) reported that a fifth—or 8,629 out of the country’s 42,065 barangays—were “drug affected,” determined by the presence of at least one user, pusher, manufacturer, or other drug personality in the area. Based on PDEA’s 2014 arrest data, methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu tops the list of most abused illegal drugs , fo l lowed by mar i juana and expensive party drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. The proliferation of illegal drugs and the extent of drug trade in the Philippines are also reflected in the rising [85] volume of seizures of illegal drugs over the past few years amounting to: Php. 5.44 billion (2013), Php. 6.18 billion (2014), Php. 5.42 billion (2015), and Php. 12.4 billion (2016). Internal Armed Conflicts The communist rebellion being waged by the Communist Party of the Philippines, together with its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), and its political wing, the National Democratic Front (NDF/P); continues to pose serious peace and order problems in the country. The CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion is one of the world’s longest running communist insurgencies and has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. While the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 guerrillas now, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, it retains support among the extremely poor in the rural P h i l i p p i n e s . T h e r e a r e p e r s i s t e n t challenges to the three-decade-old peace negotiations with the communists, but the Government will keep forging on until both parties agree to end the fighting. The Mindanao confl ict being waged by non-state armed groups and extremist movements remains a major source of instability in resource-rich but impoverished parts of southern Philippines (or Mindanao). The on-and-off peace process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) – the largest and most organized of the myriad radical groups operating in Mindanao – made a promising breakthrough when finally, a peace deal was signed in March 2014. A draft Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which forms the backbone of the 2014 peace accord, is pending approval in the Philippine Congress. In l ine wi th the above , the Government, since the 1990s, has taken steps to decentralize power aimed at addressing the root causes of internal conflicts, namely: poverty and social injustice, widespread economic inequity, poor governance, abuse and control of political power, and marginalization of cultural communities which includes land security, natural resources, identity and human rights. The Local Government Code of 1991 sought to empower regions and local government units in a bid to distribute wealth more evenly and to extend the reach of essential government services to the broadest segments of the population. It is time to take these initial gains to the next higher level by exploring the full benefits of political devolution through a new form of government. The proposal could spur long and vigorous discussions among Filipinos, who have never known any other government than the present unitary one -- but let the public debates start now. Terrorism and Transnational Crimes I n t e r n a t i o n a l t e r r o r i s m a n d transnational crimes pose a direct threat to the security of individual countries and to international peace and prosperity. These twin problems are a persistent global threat that know no borders, nationality or religion, and operate outside the rule of law. Transnational terrorists and crime syndicates are usually well-organized internationally and domestically. They are [86] well-resourced, have access to the latest technologies and skills, and will use unlimited or any form of violence to achieve their goals and objectives. The Philippines faces continuing threats from terrorism, both of foreign and domestic origin. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) remains as the foremost terrorist group actively inflicting severe socio- political and economic disruptions. The ASG is an Islamist extremist organization known for its bandit-like tactics and notorious for beheadings and kidnap-for- ransom activities in Mindanao. Radically inspired by the Al Qaeda (Osama bin Laden) in its formative years, the ASG along with its affiliates, such as the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM), has a long-term intention of waging jihadist war against non-Muslims. Its members are known to have linkages with members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The ASG has recently pledged its allegiance (bay’ah) to the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS) but has faced stiff resistance due to continuing police and military operations. In addition to the ASG, other local terrorist groups such as the Ansar al-Khilafah Philippines (AKP), Maute Group, and Daesh-inspired entities have the potential to inflict various forms of violent attacks not only in Mindanao but also in any part of the Philippines. M e a n w h i l e , t h e p r o b l e m o f transnational crimes has become more pressing. Given its archipelagic attributes, the Philippines’ borders are porous and vulnerable to the activities of international crime syndicates. These illegal trans- border activities include: drug trafficking; human trafficking of children, women, illegal migrants and labor; illegal fishing/ poaching; a rms smuggl ing ; money laundering; and wildlife trafficking. The Philippines’ southern maritime borders which are shared with i ts ASEAN neighbors are also areas of concern due to the prevalence of high sea piracy and other related criminal activities. The asymmetric nature of terrorism and transnational crime requires the national government to continuously review and update current strategies, and to develop an integrated approach involv ing concerned law enforcement agencies of the Government. The Philippines must strengthen and enhance already existing cooperation with international partners while seeking to develop new ones in this regard. Economic and Social Threats Poverty remains pervasive and is not expected to change significantly in the near future. As the population continues to grow, more Filipinos are expected to join the ranks of the poor so long as the poverty rate remains largely unaddressed. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that poverty incidence among F i l i p inos i n 2015 r ema ins unacceptably high at 21.6%. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose incomes fall below the food threshold, was estimated at 8.1% during the same period. [87] Income inequality between the rich and the poor and between urban and rural areas has remained high and will likely persist into the future. The poorest 20% of Filipinos own less than 5% of the country’s total income and the richest 10% of the population accumulate income 2.7 times more than that of the poorest 40%. Moreover, average yearly unemployment and underemployment rates for the past five years remained steady at around 6% and 18%, respectively. In absolute terms, a b o u t 2 . 8 m i l l i o n F i l i p i n o s w e r e unemployed. While unemployment rate increased recently, the underemployment rate dropped to 16.3% in January 2017 from 19.6% recorded in the same year ago. In absolute terms, about 6.4 million Filipinos were underemployed, according to the Labor Force Survey released by Philippine Statistics Authority in January 2017. Different levels of economic and s o c i a l d e v e l o p m e n t , a l o n g w i t h demographic pressures, cause hunger and malnutrition, homelessness, and larger migrations of people from rural to urban areas. Demographic migrations, in addition to social problems and the growth of crime, can lead to increased instability and insecurity. Infectious diseases are also o n t h e r i s e p a r t i c u l a r l y h u m a n immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many of the HIV/AIDS cases were reported among overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and among workers engaged in business process outsourcing.   EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT Overlapping Territorial Claims and Maritime Domain Issues The country needs to address the disputes concerning maritime boundaries as they affect a complex range of national security concerns as well as threaten regional peace and stability. The Philippines must ensure good order within its sea boundaries and develop appropriate maritime domain awareness and response force capability to address the presence of hostile forces at sea, pirates, terrorists, traffickers, illegal fishers, and other environmental t ransgressors. The Philippines must also protect the nation’s maritime interests in the Philippine Rise and Batanes islands in the North, and the ZamBaSulTa and Bongao islands in the Southern Philippines. T h e d i s p u t e o v e r t h e We s t Philippine Sea (WPS) remains to be the foremost securi ty chal lenge to the Philippines’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. In July 2016, the Philippines won a key victory when the United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the Philippines has exclusive sovereign rights over the WPS (in the South China Sea) and that China’s “nine-dash- line” claim is invalid. Cognizant of the need to protect the nat ion’s sovereignty and terr i torial integrity, the Philippines will tread with prudence on this complex and delicate issue and will carefully calibrate its [88] diplomatic moves to avert the costly consequences of any potential outbreak of armed confrontations in the disputed sea region. The Government is looking to begin the process of diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries to delimit and define maritime borders and jurisdictions. In this connect ion, the enactment of laws pertaining to national defense, maritime zones, archipelagic sea lanes air defense identification zone, and all other matters necessary for compliance with the country’s commitments and obligations under international law is urgent and imperative. Global and Regional Geopolitical Issues In addition to the WPS issue, there are other inter- and intra-state flashpoints of immediate concern to the Philippines. These include the intensifying conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, persisting tension in the Korean Peninsula, unresolved territorial disputes in Northeast and Southeast-Asia, unsettled Sabah issue, China-Taiwan/ China-Japan/ Japan-South Korea conflicts, and other power rivalries where the hegemony of the United States is contested and threatened. United States The United States remains as the only superpower in the world today and maintains its strategic presence around the globe. In the Asia Pacific region, the US, during the Barack Obama administration, sought to improve its military standing t h rough the i n t roduc t ion o f more sophisticated weapons systems, in the improvement of basing facilities and in the alliance and multilateral network it has set up among i ts regional partners . A continuing US security presence in the Asia Pacific is a stabilizing force, particularly with the growing complexity of security challenges that confront the region. The US remains as the sole defense treaty ally of the Philippines. The Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951 between the Philippines and the United States has been strengthened under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of 2015 granting the U.S. increased military presence in the country for humanitarian and maritime security operations. Under the Donald Trump presidency, Washington has articulated its vision for a “free and open Indo-Pacific region. Hence, it is expected that the new US administration will remain closely engaged with regional affairs. The Philippines will work closely with the US on a whole range of issues, including shared security and economic concerns. China With China’s rise as the w o r l d ’s s e c o n d l a r g e s t e c o n o m y, surpassing Japan, attention has focused towards its direction due to its huge population, large territory and vast natural r e s o u r c e s , r a p i d i n d u s t r i a l a n d technological breakthroughs, unparalleled economic growth, and resultant military aggressiveness in Asia. The rivalry of major powers, spawned largely by the rise of China, is the most important long-term strategic concern of the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, Beijing’s rise generated policy concerns not only among developed [89] countries such as the US, Japan and Korea, but also among the ASEAN due to significant trade and investments, as well as territorial claims in the WPS and the SCS. China’s more active and aggressive presence in the WPS is motivated by growing need for food sources, increasing demand for energy resources, and renewed stirrings of nationalism. ASEAN While its member-states are not without disagreements, ASEAN has nonetheless consistently upheld the principles of consultation and consensus as i t s n o r m i n r e s o l v i n g i n t e r - s t a t e misunderstanding and conflicts. ASEAN is building a Political-Security Community, an Economic Community and a Socio- Cultural Community to promote greater regional integration and to strengthen ASEAN centrality in the context of the wider Asia-Pacific region. The ASEAN as a regional bloc had pursued greater regional cooperation on common problems such as combating piracy, smuggling, human trafficking, terrorism and other transnational crimes. ASEAN centrality is important as it complements other efforts in managing the impact of the geopolitical rivalry among the great powers. Japan Japan remains as an economic power house in Asia and the new security challenges confronting it will induce Tokyo to seek closer security relations with other regional states. Their pacifist constitution is a product of its experience in World War II as well as the continuing security umbrella the US has been providing it. However, because of various security chal lenges in the region including territorial disputes in the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, Japan sought to reorient its security posture under its policy of a “proactive contribution to peace,” which calls for enhanced defensive capabilities as well as strengthens security relations with other states. Japan has entered into a strengthened strategic partnership with the Philippines aimed at boosting political, security and defense ties and cooperation between the two countries. Other Regional Players Other regional powers such as Australia, India, Republic of Korea, and Russia are crucial in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the broader Indo-Asia- Pacific region. Engagement with these powers through var ious p la t forms, p a r t i c u l a r l y t h r o u g h A S E A N - l e d mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS), among others, will further enhance understanding and build confidence against the backdrop of an evolving regional security environment. Such multilateral initiatives will complement efforts to enhance ASEAN cent ra l i ty. The Philippines will work closely with these powers based on mutual respect and shared interests through bilateral and multilateral platforms. [90] Global Uncertainties and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Increased Global Economic Uncertainties While the world has so far averted a full-blown economic crisis, the present trends show that the potential for global economic recess ions has increased significantly. The slowdown in major economies of the world such as the US, China and the European Union will have an impact on virtually every country in the world including the Philippines. Economic downturns abroad could temper demand for Philippine exports, slow down foreign investments and hurt the overall business climate in the country. The Philippines has so far remained resi l ient to these chal lenges, even managing to remain as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia over the past several years. Much of this was due to the country’s sound and stable economic fundamentals as well as the overall fiscal health of the national economy. The Government must stay vigilant and proactive in the face of a volatile global economy. Global Security Issues and the Welfare of OFWs C o n f l i c t s a b r o a d a n d o t h e r emerging global security threats pose a direct danger to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), who contribute significantly to the national economy, accounting for most of the country’s net factor income from abroad (NFIA) through their remittances. The Government must exert continuing effort to promote and protect the rights and welfare of our OFWs, particularly victims of illegal recruitment, human trafficking, ill-treatment and human rights violations, and unfair labor practices, among others. Global disruptions resulting from armed conflicts, polit ical or social instabilities, economic or financial crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies or natural or man-made disasters can bring significant harm to our fellow Filipinos abroad. The Government must extend all possible assistance to distressed OFWs, including their repatriation or evacuation where necessary. The Government must also maintain i ts engagement with international organizations and other international partners on the issue of forced migration as well as other issues affecting their rights. Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Rapid technological advancements and greater access to scientific knowledge are changing the face of the world in unimagined ways. Scientif ic and technological breakthroughs are creating wealth and progress everywhere, but are also spawning new and increasingly dangerous triggers for global insecurity. Among the most serious of these threats is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), which has come to occupy center stage in international politics. WMDs are classified into three major types: nuclear weapons, chemical warfare agents, and biological warfare agents. Nine nations are currently in possession of such WMDs -- China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, [91] Pakistan, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States - and a number of states are believed to possess chemical and/or biological warfare agents (Source: SIPRI). While the mass killing of people is not a new characteristic of warfare, WMDs pose an unprecedented risk in terms of their potential for large-scale destruction and the indiscriminate nature of their effects. Aside from the dangers posed by existing stockpiles of WMD, there are growing concerns that WMDs and related technologies could spread to more states and non-state terrorist networks. The Philippines will continue to strongly support the global call for greater international collaboration to control the proliferation and use of WMDs.   OTHER STRATEGIC ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Rising Threat of Cybercrime T h e l a t e s t r e p o r t b y P r i c e Waterhouse Coopers’ (PWC) Global Economic Crime Survey revealed that cybercrime is today’s fastest rising economic crime. Expounding on the nature of cybercrime, Interpol said that more and more criminals are exploiting the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet to commit a wide range of criminal activities that know no borders, either physical or virtual, cause serious harm and pose very real threats to victims worldwide. Credit card fraud, ATM theft, call center scams, and other computer or web-based forms of deception schemes a n d i d e n t i t y t h e f t h a v e b e c o m e increasingly rampant especially in Asia. New and increasingly creative trends in cybercrime are emerging all the time, with estimated costs to the global economy running to billions of dollars. Interpol added that in the past, cybercrime was committed mainly by individuals or small groups, but today we are seeing highly complex cybercriminal networks bring together individuals from across the globe in real time to commit crimes on an unprecedented scale. To meet these rapidly evolving security challenges in cyberspace, the Philippines must first and foremost develop the nation’s cyber infrastructure and cyber security. Experts noted that one of the most serious weaknesses of the Phi l ipp ines i s the low number of practicing cybersecurity professionals. The State must enhance and expand its pool of i n f o r m a t i o n a n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n technology (ICT) experts, especially in the law enforcement and security sectors, in order to equip the government with the necessary skills/knowhow to detect, preempt and combat cyber-based crimes. Collaborative efforts with the academe, and the business sector, and the private ICT community should be part of this national campaign. Climate Change Scientific studies show that the Philippines is highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. In its most recent assessment , the Inter- Governmental Panel for Climate Change [92] stressed that the rising global temperature has already impacted on the climate threshold of the earth. For the Philippines, the findings predicted that we will expe r i ence ex t reme max imum and minimum temperatures, more frequent intense rains, and more disastrous tropical cyclones (e.g. Typhoon Haiyan) with an average of 22 typhoons per year. The possibility of more El Niño weather episodes will also increase. According to a 2015 study funded by the US Agency for International Development, every single major city in the Philippines is expected to face some form of water shortage by 2025. Scholars of climate change believe that change in climate variability increases the risk of armed conflict in certain circumstances, even if the strength of the effects is uncertain. Evidence suggests that climatic events over a large range of time and spatial scales contribute to the likelihood of violence through multiple pathways. The effects of climate change on conflict and insecurity have the potential to become key risks because factors such as poverty and economic shocks that are associated with higher risk of violent conflict are themselves sensitive to climate change. Given the enormous impact of climate change especially on the poor and vulnerable population, the United Nations viewed climate change as a threat multiplier or as an indirect pathway that could exacerbate existing sources of conflict and insecurity. There are five channels through which climate change could affect security: (i) threat to the well- being of the most vulnerable communities; (ii) impact to economic development --- halting or significantly slowing-down growth thereby worsening poverty and increasing desperation; (iii) second-order effect of unsuccessful adaptation in the form of uncoordinated coping or survival strategies of local population; (iv) threat posed by climate change to the viability and even survival of a number of sovereign states; and (v) availability or access to natural resource and the resultant competit ion and possible territorial disputes between countries. Institutional Concerns Other urgent concerns include much-needed reforms in the core security and judicial sectors with emphasis on the f o l l o w i n g : m o d e r n i z i n g a n d professionalizing the armed services; s t reng then ing the jud ic ia l sys tem; strengthening legislative oversight on security agencies; and improving the na t iona l s ecu r i t y and in t e l l i gence community. Renewed focus should be given to the following key governance issues: stamping out corruption and p rofess iona l i z ing the bureaucracy ; removing inst i tut ional obstacles to academic and scientific research and deve lopmen t ; f ac i l i t a t i ng a more - responsive procurement system; providing a more-realistic and mission-supportive government auditing rules and regulations; and enhancing the Government’s ability to quickly deliver basic services.

Guided by this shift, we  crafted the National Security Strategy that articulates our roadmap in building a stronger  nation.  In order to protect our most cherished democratic institutions and way of life, we will create an  environment where peace and economic development will complement each other.  We will  address urgent national security concerns and cope with the rapidly changing regional and  global security environment in line with the objectives set forth in the National Security  Policy 2017-2022.  To defend our sovereignty and the integrity of our national territory, we will continue to  develop and improve our defense, intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to enable our  troops to end communist insurgency, terrorism and violent extremism.  We will also bolster our  position in the community of nations by strengthening diplomatic relations with our traditional  allies, engaging non-traditional partners and pursuing an independent foreign policy that gives  primacy to our national interest.  These endeavors will be sustained by a medium-term socio-economic agenda that aims to  lessen the tax burden on the poor, reduce income inequality and improve the quality and  accessibility of education and healthcare.  We have also embarked on an ambitious  infrastructure development program that will pave the way for rapid industrialization and  modernization, thereby making our country the next top investment destination in the Asia  Pacific Region.  I call upon our people to stand behind our national security apparatus in carrying out this  National Security Strategy that will strengthen the foundations of a secure, peaceful, modern  and prosperous Philippines.

CONCLUSION: A CALL FOR UNITY 81  ANNEX A.  Threats and Challenges to National Security 85  ANNEX B.  List of Strategic Industries for National Security 94  [iii]    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   he leadership of President  Rodrigo Roa Duterte affirms its  commitment to deliver a more  s e c u r e , s t a b l e , j u s t a n d  prosperous future for the people   of the Philippines. To translate this vision  into reality, the Duterte Administration  promulgated in April 2017 the National  Security Policy (NSP) 2017-2022: For  Change and Well-Being of the Filipino  People.  Subsequently, the NSP became  the precursor as well as formed the basis  for the development of this National  Security Strategy (NSS), which in essence  articulates in operational terms the  policies set forth in the NSP.    This NSS is the Philippines’ first  such official publication and follows the  NSP’s overarching principle that national  security and economic development are  closely intertwined and mutually  reinforcing concepts. As in the NSP, the  NSS has the broad theme of bringing  about meaningful and lasting socio- economic and political change aimed at  building a stronger nation and improving  the lives of the majority of the Filipino  people.  The NSS outlines the ways and   means to attain the national security  vision, which the NSP states as: ““A safe  and secure Philippines, at peace with  itself and its neighbors, where its citizens  are allowed to reach their full potential  through the promotion of social justice  and harmony, political stability, sound  env i ronmen ta l managemen t , and  economic progress.”   The NSS integrates the State’s  m a j o r s e c u r i t y p o l i c i e s , g o a l s ,  responsibilities and courses of action into  a roadmap or blueprint for the fulfillment  of the national security vision. It seeks to  foster better coordination, synchronization  and cohesion of government functions in  order to improve efficiency and maximize  the use of limited State resources. The  NSS also serves as an important vehicle to  articulate the national interest, convey the  State’s intentions, and rally public support  for government policies and programs.  The support of Congress in particular will  be crucial to the success of the NSS in  terms of enact ing the necessary  legislations related to national security  a n d a p p r o p r i a t i n g t h e i r f i s c a l  requirements.    T  [iv]    The NSS has seven parts. Chapter  One introduces the concept of national  security and the overarching national  security framework in which the NSP and  NSS are shown as two inseparable  components. Chapter Two provides an  overview of the current strategic  environment. It highlights the State’s  national security priorities in light of the  various internal and external threats and  challenges it seeks to address.  Chapter  Three   discusses  the   national security  framework, core values and national  interests underpinning the NSS. It begins  with the definition of national security as  “the state or condition wherein the  nation’s sovereignty and territorial  integrity; the people’s well-being, core  values, and way of life; and the State and  its institutions; are protected and  enhanced.”    The Chapter ends with the  following 12-point national security goals  as basis for the strategic actions of  concerned government agencies and  departments, namely:    • Guarantee public safety and  achieve  good governance.   • Mitigate the impact of health related  threats.    • Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and  sustainable economy.   • Achieve food and water security.   • Safeguard and preserve national  sovereignty and territorial integrity.   • Heighten consciousness and pride on  Filipino heritage, culture and values.   • Promote human and ecological  security.   • Achieve energy security.   • Ensure maritime and airspace  security.   • Strengthen international relations.   • Provide strong cyber infrastructure  and cyber security.   • I m p r o v e v i t a l t r a n s p o r t a t i o n  infrastructure and port security.   Chapter Four introduces two  important components that will guide the  strategy’s successful and sustained  implementation. First is the combined,  balanced and effective use of the  instruments of national power, namely:  p o l i t i c a l a n d l e g a l , d i p l o m a t i c ,  informational, intelligence, economic, and  military and law enforcement. This  c o m p o n e n t a i m s t o p r o m o t e  comprehensiveness and shared efforts in  addressing current and future threats.   Second is wealth creation and resource  generation through intensified human   [v]    capital development, passage of national  security legislations, appropriate funding  for national security, and development of  strategic industries.    Meanwhile, the attainment of the  12-point national security agenda hinges  on the successful execution of the  strategic lines of action enumerated in  Chapter Five. The action areas are  designed to improve our defences, our  capabilities, our technologies, our  processes, our partnerships, and our  resources. A total of 109 strategic lines of  action were identified following a careful  analysis of the various threats and  challenges as well as opportunities that  are commensurate to the strengths and  potentials of the nation.     The successful execution of these  strategic lines of action is largely  dependent on the effectiveness and  cohesiveness of the national security  sector.  In this regard, the NSS endeavors  to reinvigorate and streamline the existing  national security structure to ensure a  more effective command and control and  a more cost-effective utilization of  government resources and manpower.   Crucial to this effort is the need to  revitalize the organizational structures of  the National Security Council and its  Secretariat; the Cabinet Cluster on  Security, Justice and Peace; the National   Intelligence Board and the National  Intelligence Committee.     The NSS concludes with a call for  unity among all sectors of Philippine  society --- that we all have a part to play:  government, business and the general  public. The NSS process is still in its  nascent stage and should be treated as a  work in progress.  But hopefully, this NSS  will set the stage for the formation of  national consensus and national will  toward the achievement of lasting peace  and prosperity across the country. To this  end, the support and cooperation of the  Filipino people are paramount.       [vi]    [1]       “If we are to embrace the vision of a prosperous  Philippines, we have to start putting value to   our people’s well-being — because the success  of every Filipino’s pursuit in life, liberty and   happiness directly mirrors the fulfillment of our  aspirations as a Filipino.   We will uphold and promote our national  interests in the international community.  We   will strengthen and seek partnership with those  who share our values.  We will engage nations  with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign   equality, and again, non-interference.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  State of the Nation Address 2017  [2]    h e n a t u r e o f s e c u r i t y   c h a l l e n g e s f a c i n g t h e   Philippines is more complex   today than in the past. These   challenges include decades old internal   insurgencies that have hampered   development and kept the nation in a   state of low-level but debilitating   conflict. The Mindanao conflict, in   particular, has assumed a more complex   and menacing form in recent years,   triggered by the internal splintering in   the Moro movement and further fueled   by Islamic State-inspired radicalism.    The five-month-long siege in   Marawi reflected this dangerous mix.   While important peace inroads have   been forged with the country’s largest   non-state armed rebel groups, the quest   for enduring peace in Mindanao   remains elusive unless the smaller but   decidedly more violent remnant and   extremist factions are ultimately   defeated.       T  [3]  “NATIONAL SECURITY IS   NOW EQUATED NOT ONLY  TO T H E T R A D I T I O N A L   NOTIONS OF NATIONAL  DEFENSE AND REGIME   SURVIVAL, BUT ALSO TO  THE OVERALL WELL-BEING   OF THE CITIZENS, THE  PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC   DEVELOPMENT, AND THE  P R O T E C T I O N O F T H E   E N V I R O N M E N T A N D   NATURAL RESOURCES.”    Similarly, the Philippines’ current   external security environment is marked   b y i n c r e a s e d u n c e r t a i n t y a n d   unpredictability. Rising tensions in the   South China Sea, which nestles the West   Philippine Sea, have brought to the fore a   changing security backdrop in the Asia-  Pacific region. This has prompted the   Philippines, which has not confronted any   external armed threat since it gained full   independence in 1946, to suddenly give   the same attention to territorial defense as   it does to internal security threats.    Since the turn of the millennium,   the Filipino people’s understanding of the   concept of national security itself has   changed dramatically. It is now equated   not only to the traditional notions of   national defense and regime survival, but   also to the overall well-being of the   citizens, the promotion of economic   development, and the protection of the   environment and natural resources.    More and more, the new outlook   links security to broad political and social   concerns, from governance issues, such as   graft and corruption, to various other   problems bese t t ing much of the   d e v e lo p in g w o r ld i n c lu d in g t h e   Philippines – i.e., poverty and lopsided   development, high crime rate, climate   change and environmental degradation,   spread of infectious diseases, and trans-  border threats such as human and drug   trafficking, cybercrime, and money   laundering.     The above challenges call for a   robust, dynamic and pro-active national   security framework and infrastructure,   capable of dealing with these growing   threats in real time.    The development of a national   security framework aims to ensure that the   country’s “sovereignty, terri torial   integrity, national interests, and the well-  being of its people and institutions are   preserved, protected and enhanced.”    It serves as a roadmap that guides   the State working together with civil   society and its leaders in setting vital   national goals and objectives and the   means to achieve these.     [4]    Central to the national security   f r a m e w o r k a r e t w o i n s e p a r a b l e   components: the National Security Policy   (NSP) and the National Security Strategy   (NSS). While the NSP articulates the   domestic and global interests of the   Philippines that are vital to national   security, the NSS lays down the   a p p r o a c h e s a n d r e s o u r c e s f o r   implementing the NSP with a view to   guarantee the security of the State and its   people in a dynamic and constantly   changing security environment.    As an extension of the NSP, the   NSS articulates in operational terms the   process of pursuing the national security   agenda.  This document attempts to fill the   remaining gap in the country’s national   security paradigm – a problem that had   often forced our security planners and   managers in the past to adopt an ad hoc   and short-sighted outlook, rather than a   pro-active and forward-looking one.    Undeniably, the evolution of a   national security framework has been a   long and fragmented process in the   Philippines. In fact, it was only in 2011   that the first official publication of the   N S P c a m e o u t . T h e i n c u m b e n t   administration of President Rodrigo R.   Duterte published its own NSP report in   April 2017.  Successive NSP documents   reflect progress in terms of defining the   country’s policy framework,  but  still  did   not   address the need for a clear-cut   National Security Strategy.     In developing this NSS, the views   of relevant government and non-  government experts, and other key   stakeholders and members of civil society   were sought . S ince the secur i ty   environment is in a constant state of flux,   this NSS shall undergo a continuous   process of evolution and shall be   reviewed, refined and amended as needed.      [5]       “Traditional and non-traditional security issues  test  our resolve to promote peace, stability,   security and prosperity…   Geopolitical and strategic developments around  the globe also pose a challenge to our shared  interests and goals, if not the security of our   environment.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  Speech at the Opening of the 30th ASEAN Leaders’ Summit   Manila, Philippines / April 2017  [6]    [7]    u r n a t i o n a l s e c u r i t y i s   confronted by challenges on   multiple fronts.  Aside from   decades-old internal armed   threats, there are emerging risks that pose   an obstacle to the attainment of national   unity, peace and stability, economic   development, and enhanced ties with our   neighbors and allies.  The lack of national   and sector-specific security strategies to   address current and emerging concerns   limits the ability of the Philippine   government to effectively handle and   manage these increasingly complex   challenges.      Resolving internal armed conflicts      remains   our   top   security concern and a   key cornerstone of our peace and   development strategy. The government is   committed to finding a peaceful socio-  political solution to the twin threats posed   by a lingering communist rebellion and   Muslim separatist insurgency.  However,   it must also be fully prepared to deal with   all eventualities, including the possible   failure of  all  peaceful initiatives.   Both   in peace and in war, addressing the root   causes of conflict and bringing the fruits   of development closer to conflict-affected   communities should go hand-in-hand with   peacekeeping efforts on the ground.    O  RESOLVING INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS REMAINS OUR TOP   SECURITY CONCERN AND A KEY CORNERSTONE OF OUR PEACE   AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY.  [8]    Our external environment likewise   needs more focused attention. The   Philippines’ archipelagic attributes and   geographic location are both a source of   strength and vulnerability. From most   indications, the Philippines can indeed   become a great maritime nation.  Among   archipelagos in the world, the Philippines   is a unique one for the contiguity with   which its islands, islets and other marine   features are clustered together.     Apart from its rich natural   endowments, the Philippines also boasts   of the highest marine biodiversity in the   world and the most number of fish species   and marine mammals. It is home to some   of the globally-adjudged most beautiful   beaches in the world – a great push factor   for the country’s booming tourism   industry.     On the other hand, and as history   has shown, our strategic geographic   location and rich natural resources have   also provided a strong temptation to   expansionist powers.     The  Philippines has not faced any   direct threat of foreign armed invasion   since the end of World War II, but there   are newly evolving regional security   uncertainties. Strategically straddled   between the bitterly contested South   China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, where   competing interests of superpowers and   other countries converge, we must be able   to chart our role in an increasingly multi-  polar global order.     Likewise, there are new threats,   possibly more destructive than invading   armies.  We must be fully equipped not   only to deter potential aggressors but also   to p ro tec t the a rch ipe lago f rom   international terrorists, pandemics,   transnational crimes and natural disasters.   It is a sad fact that despite the   lessons of the past our armed forces   remain one of the weakest in Asia, putting   in doubt our ability to protect and defend   our sovereignty and territorial integrity.       [9]    Developing a credible defense   capability would be a key priority of this   administration, while at the same time   s t r e n g t h e n i n g a n d p u r s u i n g   comprehensive and strategic alliances or   cooperation with our friends and partners   in the international community.   Fighting criminality and illegal   drugs is very high on the list of priorities   of the current administration. The   country’s drug problem is a particular   concern as this directly influences   criminal activity involving drug abuse,   heinous and violent crime, gang-related   activities, money laundering, and the   corruption of the criminal justice system.   Apart   from  destroying  society’s  moral   fiber, drug abuse has led to the widespread   disregard for the rule of law, particularly   among our youth.    P u r s u i n g a n i n c l u s i v e a n d   sustainable economic development is the   main pillar of the administration’s   economic policy.  Despite rapid GDP   growth in recent  years,  poverty incidence    in the Philippines – at about 21% --   remains one of the highest in Asia due to   unmitigated income gaps and lack of job   opportunities to sustain a burgeoning   population of about 104 million.    Corollary to this, demographic   challenges can be either a boon or bane,   depending on how we would handle it.   For the ‘boon’ part, call center jobs in the   cities, strong consumer spending and   remittances from millions of Filipinos   who work overseas are fueling the   Philippine economy.     In  2017, the gross domestic   product (GDP) grew by 6.7 percent.  It is   currently one of the fastest growing   economies in Asia, after China’s 6.9   percent and Vietnam’s 6.8 percent.  And   with the implementation of Tax Reform   Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law,   the growth of the Philippine economy is   expected to further accelerate this year.       [10]    O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , r a p i d   population growth and industrialization   are putting tremendous pressure on the   e c o l o g i c a l b a l a n c e , t r i g g e r i n g   unprecedented disasters brought by a   deteriorating natural environment. The   need to prevent man-made disasters,   soften the impact of natural calamities,   and save lives is imperative.    Many of the possible options and   solutions to these complex challenges will   likely be difficult, even painful, and there   will always be debates and divisions over   the proper way to deal with national   problems. However, over the long haul,   we must accept that we have only   ourselves to truly rely on, and that with   proper planning, preparation and action,   there is nothing that the Filipinos as a   nation cannot achieve.          (Annex A provides the Challenges in the Internal   and External Security Environment)  [11]       “May we all have a renewed sense of  commitment to promote the welfare of our   people, safeguard our national interest,  and assert our sovereign rights over our   waters and all other areas within our  jurisdiction.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  Speech During the Philippine Rise    Commemoration / May 2018   [12]    [13]    [14]    he development of a national   security strategy finds its basis   in several important tenets of   n a t i o n h o o d an d n a t i o n a l   identity. A full appreciation of these   fundamental precepts is crucial in    any effort to put together national-level or   sector-specific strategies. They serve as   the overarching context against which all   planning and decision-making involving   matters affecting national security are   undertaken.    National Security Defined   Globalization and rapid advances   in modern technology have substantially   altered the definition of national security,   from an exclusive or predominant focus   on armed threats to sovereignty and   territorial integrity, to clearly non-  traditional threats such as trafficking of   drugs, cyber security, and extreme   weather conditions. For many modern   states, including the Philippines, the new   outlook encompasses all possible   challenges to the people’s way of life,   including threats to public safety,   governance, economic development,   social welfare, and the environment.   Implici t ly, the expanded concept   highlights not just the threats, but also any   new opportunities that could enhance   security or speed up the attainment of   national goals.    Based on the above expanded   view, the Philippines defines national   security as “the state or condition   wherein the nation’s sovereignty and   territorial integrity, the people’s well-  being, core values, and way of life, and   the State and its institutions, are   protected and enhanced.”       T  [15]    National Values   Our national policies and strategies   should be a reflection and extension of the   Filipinos’ core national values. Patriotism   and love of country, the common good,   social justice, liberty and democracy are   some of the fundamental values our   peop le exp l i c i t l y uphe ld i n t he   foundational era of our nationhood, and   continue to cherish at the present.  This is   evident from the preambles, declaration of   principles and state policies, and Bill of   Rights of the 1899, 1935 and 1987   Constitutions.  Today, these values are   expressed concisely in the spirit of the   following traits that Philippine popular   culture attributes to good Filipinos: maka-  Diyos (God-fearing), makatao (humane),   makabayan (patriotic), and maka-  kalikasan (pro-environment).   We exalt patriotism as a moral duty   of every Filipino, who has an obligation to   pursue the promotion of the material and   moral welfare of the nation and its people.   Devotion to the common good is closely   related to this principle, with human life   as its central value. Combined, these twin   values form the very foundation of our   national strength and unity, and key  to    the Filipino’s  sense   of   oneness amidst   diversity in religion, language and   ethnicity.    The right to exercise one’s   religious faith is another fundamental   building block of our uniqueness as a   people and as a nation. Regardless of wide   differences in religious faiths, the belief in   an all-powerful God has been key to the   Filipinos’ sense of fortitude and desire to   lead an upright existence. Faith commonly   binds the Filipino family together even in   the face of hardships. The preservation,   protection and free practice of one’s   religious faith is therefore an essential part   of our journey as a nation.    The quest for justice has always   been one of our most fervent national   aspirations.  We are seeking an egalitarian   system of justice where all citizens   [16]    receive equal treatment and protection   before the law. In the same vein, we want   to give each person and each community a   just and equal share of the fruits of   progress while at the same time giving   preferential attention to the poor and the   marginalized.     Our commitment to freedom and   democracy is enshrined in our history,   throughout our long and bitter struggle for   independence, and presently as a maturing   Republic.  Upholding the rule of law and   protecting civil liberties and human rights   shall remain as essential pillars of our   democratic society. In our continuing   quest for the most ideal system of   government for the Filipino nation, we   must not be afraid to effect positive   changes. However, any change should   continue to harness the most important   backbones of Philippine democracy   rooted in the principles of governance by   deliberation and persuasion, separation of   powers, system of checks and balances,   and safeguards against authoritarianism   and abuse of state power.   National Interests   The national interest is an intrinsic   component of the national security   framework and reflects our national   values.  In the Philippine setting, the   national interest includes those conditions   we consider to be desirable or essential to   the unity, survival and well-being of the   country and its people.  Essentially, it   embodies our goals and ambitions as a   nation.  Our national strategy depends on   what our national interests are and how   we view these interests in the hierarchy of   our national priorities.    Within this hierarchy of priorities,   we identified the conditions below as core   national interests of the Philippines. These   interests are permanent ones and   considered as absolutely necessary for the   very survival of the nation and its people.     [17]    • Protection of the freedom, public safety and welfare of the people.   • Ending all internal armed conflicts, i.e., communist insurgency, violent   extremism and terrorism.   • Preservation of the sovereignty and integrity of the national territory.   • Pursuit of independent foreign policy in the exercise of national   sovereignty and self-determination.   • Pursuit and sustainment of inclusive economic growth and development.    • Protection of the Filipino public from criminality, illegal drugs,   pandemics, cyber-attack, and weapons of mass destruction.   • Freedom from any forms of nuclear weapons within the Philippine   territory.   • Protection and preservation of ecological balance.   • Promotion of social cohesion and national unity.   The conditions identified below,   although not directly threatening the   survival of the nation, are considered as   important for the enhancement of national   security and the well-being of the   Filipinos.  If unfulfilled, these will result   in damage that could undermine the   attainment of our goals, objectives and   programs.    • Development of credible armed forces and pursuit of security sector   reform.   [18]    • Improvement of the criminal justice system.   • Pursuit of inclusive economic growth.   • Protection and promotion of the welfare of overseas Filipino workers   (OFWs) and Filipino immigrants.   • Prevention of other transnational crimes in the country, i.e. trafficking in   persons, arms smuggling, money laundering, sea piracy, economic and   environmental crime.   • Deterrence of illegal migration and intrusion of foreign nationals across   borders.   • Promotion of the rights and welfare of farmers especially agrarian   reform beneficiaries.   • Promotion of quality education, competitiveness of graduates, and safe   employment environment.   Other interests that essentially pertain to our role as a responsible and peaceful   member of the regional and global community and reflects the kind of nation we want to   be and how we want to present ourselves to the world are the following:      • Participation in international efforts to reduce global warming and adapt   on the impacts of the changing climate.   • Adherence to international agreements specifically those related to   counterterrorism, collective security, and non-proliferation of weapons of   mass destruction.   [19]    • Participation of the Philippines in the United Nations and other   international fora and adherence to existing United Nations   commitments.   • Promotion of dialogue and negotiation to solve any issues of mutual   interest.   National Security Vision    Our national values and national   interests find their best expression in the   form of a desired end state and broad   national vision.  Keeping in mind our   definition of national security, our desired   end state is a community of peace where   security as a public good is delivered   effectively.     The national security vision sets   the country’s desired direction, forms the   basis    of   all    subsequent policy and   strategy planning, and seeks to  build a   Filipino nation of empowered citizens,   living in freedom, dignity, and prosperity   as one community regardless of social   status, ethnicity, language, and religion.    In our National Security Policy, the   Government envisions a Philippines that   by 2022 shall become “a secure and   prosperous nation wherein the people’s   welfare, well-being, way of life and core   values; government and its institutions;   territorial integrity and sovereignty are   protected and enhanced and confident   of its place in the community of   nations.”     [20]    As such, this National Security   Strategy envisages a safe and secure   Philippines, at peace with itself and its   neighbors, where its citizens are allowed   to reach their full potential through social   cohesion and the promotion of social   justice and harmony, political stability,   sound environmental management, and   economic progress.         OUR DESIRED END STATE IS:   “A SAFE AND SECURE PHILIPPINES,   AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND ITS  NEIGHBORS, WHERE ITS CITIZENS  ARE ALLOWED TO REACH THEIR  FULL POTENTIAL THROUGH SOCIAL  COHESION AND THE PROMOTION OF  SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HARMONY,  POLITICAL STABILITY, SOUND  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,   AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.”  [21]    Goals of the National Security Strategy   Below is a set of action areas, the   fulfillment of which will contribute to the   attainment of the desired national security   end state.  These action areas are   expressed in terms of strategic goals and   objectives, which in turn form the basis   for the formulation of agency/institutional   courses of actions.        Guarantee public safety and achieve good governance.       Mitigate the impact of health related threats.       Develop a dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable economy.       Achieve food and water security.       Safeguard and preserve national sovereignty and territorial integrity.       Heighten consciousness and pride on Filipino heritage, culture and values.       Promote human and ecological security.       Achieve energy security.       Ensure maritime and airspace security.       Strengthen international relations.       Provide strong cyber infrastructure and cyber security.       Improve vital transportation infrastructure and port security.   [22]    [23]       [24]  “I’ve always believed that there can really no  development and progress, irrespective of the  population and the hugeness of the territory,    if there is no law and order.”    President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  Speech During the 120th Founding Anniversary Celebration            of the Department of Foreign Affairs / June 2018     n its very essence, the National   Security Strategy lays down a   master plan for the attainment of   the national vision of creating a   safer and more prosperous Philippines,   whereby our national values and way of   life are protected and enhanced.    The NSS integrates the State’s   m a j o r s e c u r i t y p o l i c i e s , g o a l s ,   responsibilities and courses of action into   an overall blueprint for the fulfillment of   such a vision. It clarifies the institutional   framework within which the concerned   government and private institutions will   coordinate their activities in order to   create an integrated and cohesive national   security network.  There are several   important rationales for the development   of an NSS.   First, developing an NSS is   necessary because security issues   significantly affect the Philippines’   chances of attaining all its social and   economic    goals.    Since    the    security    environment itself is changing, the   government must regularly evaluate the   new challenges and threats it is facing. To   address these threats, the government   must put together a coherent and effective   plan of action.   Second, there is the need to   provide both political and strategic   guidance to the implementors of the NSS.   A country has a national security vision   and that vision is articulated by the   political leadership. The leadership   captures and communicates that vision in   a strategy so that those who are executing   the strategy have something clear in front   of them to follow. It defines the roles of   institutions and stakeholders in order for   them to synchronize their policies and    strategies.   Likewise, private citizens and   civil society sectors should be encouraged   to scrutinize it and take the necessary   steps to contribute to the accomplishment   of national programs.     [25]  I    Third, the NSS helps to generate   public awareness and create a common   understanding and ownership of issues   affecting the country’s security. Through   t h i s d o c u m e n t t h e g o v e r n m e n t   communicates the national vision and how   such a vision is to be achieved.   Communicating these issues effectively to   target audiences is crucial for securing the   kind of consensus, ownership and support   the government needs to ensure the   success of the strategy. The government   needs to communicate the NSS to   policymakers in order to secure both   political and resource backing for the   leadership’s security agenda. Similarly, it   is important to communicate the NSS to   the general public in order to win the   citizens’ cooperation and participation.   There is nothing that lures investors more   than stability, and there is nothing that   scares them more than instability.   Fourth, the NSS is about the ends,   ways and means. The resource aspect is   always a contentious and yet unavoidable   issue. One cannot have a strategy without   touching on the resource aspect because   the strategy will have to be implemented,   and if it is going to be implemented, one   needs to allocate resources and utilize   these resources in the most cost-effective   way. Avoiding waste should be a key   guiding principle. Having a document that   instructs NSS implementors on how to   efficiently utilize resources is absolutely   critical.    EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS    OF NATIONAL POWER   The efficacy of our national   security strategy is dependent on our   capacity – capability, ability and will - to   enforce it. The NSS serves as a catalyst to   fulfill the national security vision of the   Philippines through the combined and   coordinated use of all the resources and   instruments of national power – political   [26]    and legal, diplomatic, informational and   intelligence, economic and technological,   and military and law enforcement.    Protecting the national interests and   enforcing national policies call for good   governance, a patriotic citizenry united by   a common purpose, and a credible armed   forces.  The country faces a formidable   array of internal and external threats to its   national interests and well-being that   require a mix of national instruments   capable of mitigating the risks, upholding   national sovereignty, preserving territorial   integrity, backing foreign policy,   supporting its development thrusts, and   protecting public safety and natural   resources.    Political and Legal   The political and legal instrument   shall strengthen policy organization,   formulation, legislation, implementation,   and the most critical, generation and   appropriation of funds.  It will address   several weaknesses pertaining to   bureaucratic turfing, uneven-playing field,   p o o r g o v e r n a n c e , u n n e c e s s a r y   overlapping and multiple inter-agency   mechanisms. It will promote transparent,   accountable and participatory governance   and explore more efficient ways of   undertaking government tasks by   developing its e-governance capability.  It   will strengthen the five pillars of the   criminal justice system and empower   citizen’s organizations to actively   participate in governance, in the   implementation of public policies, in   cultivating a culture of peace, and   mainstreaming conflict sensitive and   p e a c e p r o m o t i n g a p p r o a c h e s i n   safeguarding the safety of the people.  It   will seek to pursue and communicate the   benefits of a federal-parliamentary form   of government and identify the need for   the creation of “rules-based” governance   in defending our sovereignty and   territorial integrity and in resolving   internal conflicts.   [27]    Diplomatic   The dip lomat ic ins t rument   provides the parameters on the outward-  looking position of the Philippines in the   comity of nations within the bounds of   international laws, norms and standards.    It aims to develop good partnerships and   improve all forms of foreign relations in   order to ensure the protection of our   overseas Filipino workers and advance the   pursuit of common interests that are   mutually beneficial to the Philippines and   other countries.    Informational   The informational instrument   aims to promote effective governance,   through strategic communications, while   at the same time countering any   misinformation and deceitful propaganda   being spread by the enemies of the State.    This component also aims to promote   national consensus, intelligence fusion   and shared understanding particularly   with regard to addressing conflicts and its   root causes.    Intelligence   Intelligence is foreknowledge and   therefore should be predictive.  It is a vital   instrument of national power to realize   national goals and objectives and promote   the well-being of the nation. Intelligence   process provides National Intelligence   Estimates and other inputs that are   essential for planning and execution of   desired political actions and national   programs. The intelligence instrument   includes human intelligence, signals   intelligence, image intelligence, and   [28]    measurement and signatures intelligence.    Counterintelligence or the denial of   undesirable information collection efforts   is also included under the intelligence   instrument.   Economic and Technological   The economic and technological   instrument aims to broaden economic   ventures, foster cooperation in the area of   innovation and technology development,   and promote sustainable development.  It   aims to pursue rapid economic growth,   with particular focus on reducing poverty   and income gaps through the creation of   more jobs and the improvement of the   educa t ion sec tor. Fore ign d i rec t   investments are a crucial growth engine   and should therefore continue to be   e n c o u r a g e d t h r o u g h a p e a c e f u l   environment, increased infrastructure   spending and a stable fiscal and policy   milieu. The protection and preservation of   the ecological environment and natural   resources will remain a key concern.    Military and Law Enforcement   The military and law enforcement   instrument includes the use of well-  equipped, trained, disciplined and   motivated armed forces to maintain law   and order at the homefront, and to   safeguard and defend the country’s   sovereignty and territorial integrity from   any threat of foreign armed aggression.  It   aims to build a credible deterrence   capability and enhance mutual defense   arrangements with other nations.     [29]    WEALTH CREATION AND RESOURCE GENERATION   Over the past three decades at   least, the defense budget process appears   to have been afflicted by the paralyzing   mindset that “we don’t have the money.”   Despite the continuously intensifying   internal and external threat environment,   such negative mindset essentially ignored   the wisdom of investing in safety and   strategic security to build a credible   deterrence to protect and uphold our   national interests. Consequently, the   country, by defaul t , has become   vulnerable to infiltration, sabotage,   poaching, insurgency, terrorism and   natural catastrophes.    However, with more wealth being   created at home in recent years, we now   have the unique opportunity to reverse   this fatalistic outlook in government. It is   time to say, “We have the money and we   can find more money”; it is high time we   think of national defense not as a financial   burden, but as a strategic investment for a   safer and more secure future.  As an   investment, it has payback in terms of   enabling and supporting economic growth   and sustainable development, and   boosting the national morale.   Human Capital Development   The Philippines is dealing with a   massive crop of Filipino men and women   on the threshold to adulthood who   potentially form the country’s rich talent   pool as thinkers, leaders, entrepreneurs,   employers, creative artists, innovators, job   creators, job collaborators, technical   specialists and experts of all kinds.  While   we continue to deal with the more obvious   risks related to the country’s population   boom and the negative effects of a very   high population density, we shall focus   [30]    also on the potential opportunities and   harness their full advantage. The provision   of quality education complemented by   sustainable employment or livelihood   opportunities and a stable security   environment are integral in solving the   country’s multifarious national problems.     We have a considerable percentage   of English-speaking people and deploy   about 8 to 10 million overseas workers   spread across continents and working in   various levels of expertise. Our overseas   workers are exposed to foreign cultures   and are knowledgeable in management   and in communication and technology   applications, making them competitive   candidates for future employment both   here and abroad.    Presently, the Philippines is also   the world’s business process outsourcing   (BPO) leader. Certainly, our talented and   industrious work force represents one of   our greatest competitive strengths.  To   sustain these potentials, the Government   shall continue to provide global-standard   education for its citizens.    However, beyond having the “right   stuff,” our human resource also needs to   develop the kind of mindframe that   compels them to look beyond their own   personal interests, needs, or circumstances   and attune this with the interests and   needs of Philippine society as a whole.     This kind of patriotic mindset   should be nurtured in every institution of   learning, where the students can develop   an appreciation and understanding of   society, governance, multi-dimensional   national security, and sustainable   development.         The National Defense College of   the Philippines (NDCP), the Philippine   Public Safety College (PPSC), the Foreign   Service Institute (FSI), and other military   and police training institutions shall be the   primary institutions of learning for   building up and expanding the pool of   national security leaders and practitioners   in the country.   [31]    National Security Legislation   The Government must work   towards the enactment of appropriate   legislations to address the country’s   complex national security challenges, and   protect and promote the nation’s interests.    One such legislation is the expanded   National Security Code in order to meet   the continuing threats of terrorism,   i n s u r g e n c i e s , c r i m i n a l i t i e s a n d   transnational crimes. It will also   strengthen the Organization for National   Security, revitalize the system for unified   coordination among the members of the   security community, and provide the legal   basis for the formulation, integration, and   implementation of the NSP and NSS.  The   Government will work with Congress to   attain the passage of this proposed law.    The Government shall also work   for the passage of pending bills in   Congress pertaining to national security   concerns.  Among these are the proposed   b i l l s on Witness Pro tec t ion and   Whistleblowers Act, Uniformed Personnel   Pension Reform, National Defense Act,   Chemical Weapons Convention Act,   Amendments to the Immigration Act, PNP   Modernization and Reorganization,   Mandatory ROTC, Amendments to the   Dangerous Drugs Act, Creation of the   Department of Disaster Resilience,     Protection   of Children in Situation of   Armed Conflict, Defense Acquisition,   Archipelagic Sea Lanes, Maritime Zones,   and the draft Bangsamoro Basic Law   (BBL). The BBL is seen as the political   solution to the age old conflict and   marginalization in the Bangsamoro   region.  The Government will vigorously   pursue amendments to the Philippine   Constitution aimed at facilitating the shift   to a new form of government and refining   key economic provisions.  Executive   Orders, Memoranda, Directives, Letter of   Instruction, etc. will also be issued from   time to time to strengthen security   legislation.   [32]    [33]  OTHER LEGISLATIONS AIMED AT ADDRESSING   TERRORISM AND ILLEGAL DRUGS   1. Amendments to the Human Security Act (HSA) - to strengthen the coordination and authority of  the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) and the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) in  suppressing terrorism.  In amending the HSA, the NICA, or its successor organization, shall  continue to perform its duty as Secretariat of the ATC.  On the other hand, the ATC-Program  Management Center, in addition to its other tasks, shall continue to serve as the coordinator of  the Council in the performance of the Council’s functions.  The institutionalization of this set up  will be done by the inclusion of the ATC-PMC in the HSA amendment.  Moreover, the objective  of the amendatory bill is generally to make the law consistent with the UN Conventions on Anti- Terrorism and the adoption of international best practices, considering that since the enactment  of the HSA, no case has prospered in the country.   2. Amendments to the Anti-Wiretapping Law - to judicially authorize the real-time/live monitoring  of telecommunications in cases involving pre-identified and confirmed persons or entities linked  to terrorism and other grave criminal activities.   3. Enactment of a SIM Card Registration Law - to pre-identify users of SIM cards and facilitate  their identification, as well as deter those who plan to use the same for terrorist or other  criminal activities.   4. Amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Financing Law - to freeze any account of pre-identified or  confirmed terrorist personalities, organizations or other entities engaged in terrorist financing or  trafficking in strategic goods (i.e. weapons of mass destruction and items of dual/alternative use  that can be applied in, converted to, or otherwise made a part of weapons of mass destruction,  pursuant to our obligation under UNSCR 2178) in coordination with the work of AMLC.    5. Enactment of an Official Secrets Act – to: (1) absorb best practices/provisions from laws of  various countries that already have such legislation; (2) provide classification and parameters  for classifying government secrets, authority for classifying and declassifying; (3) provide funds  for required hardware and software for databases, protocol for storage, retrieval, access to,  declassification and release to the public, period for storage, and protocol for destruction; (4)  proscribe solicitation by foreign user/s; and (5) legislate severe criminal liability for violations.   6. Amendments to the Cybercrime Law – to authorize, without prior judicial intervention/court  order, the blocking of any Internet site or source of pre-identified/confirmed terrorists, terrorist  organizations, or others propagandizing, inviting, inducing, recruiting for terrorism, including  terrorist financing for timely immediate action.  In amending the Cybercrime law, include  provision of guidelines and detailed description of the crimes.   7. Amendments to the Passport Law – to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ), without prior  judicial intervention/court order, to withhold, suspend, cancel/revoke passports or other travel  documents of Filipino extremists who have undergone trainings or have fought with/joined UN  proscribed terrorist organizations.  The DOJ confirmation of the legal basis for these actions will  be for the immediate implementation of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Also, this requires  synchronization and amendment of the Immigration Law.     Funding National Security   Central to the shift in government   outlook prescribed above is the need to   start exploring the possibility that there   are potentially other sources and means to   generate funds for the tremendous   demands of national security. Funding our   credible deterrence capability will end the   era of strategic drift that failed to   effectively manage safety and security   risks. Decades of inaction have led to   devastating consequences to internal   security and have undermined our ability   to adequately prepare for external defense   in the future.  Keeping defense spending   low to save money is a spurious   conjecture; it simply pushes expenses for   maintenance, training, and capital stock   into the future, and at the expense of the   country’s security and well-being.   There is a need to increase the size   and deterrent capability of the Navy and   the Air Force as quickly as possible to   serve as our external defense, protect our   national territory and Exclusive Economic   Zone (EEZ), and modernize all branches   of the armed forces. In addition, necessary   procedures should be taken as outlined   above to fix the acquisition system,   rebalance compensation for service   members, and pass legislations that aim to   create new wealth and strengthen human   and materiel resources.    The above requires a dynamic and   collaborative mix of executive and   legislative actions, with support from our   policymakers and economic managers. In   support of our defense modernization, the   government has to allocate at least 2   percent of the GDP as the minimum   annual budget for the defense sector in   order to elevate ourselves from the (near)   bottom position and quickly catch up with   our ASEAN neighbors, and fully exercise   our sovereignty. Myanmar, whose  GDP   per capita is smaller than the Philippines,   allocated 4.8% of GDP (2016) for military   expenditure (SIPRI).    [34    Apart from the budget provided by   the General Appropriations Act (GAA),   the Executive and Legislative branches   can also work together to identify and   develop other potential funding sources.    The funds generated from such sources   will be lodged in an exclusive national   account under the Office of the President   with congressional oversight. This is to   ensure that the GAA for publ ic   administration and the delivery of basic   services will not be impacted by the   requirements for credible deterrence.   There are important caveats to ensure   smooth program execution to prevent   costly delays. The Procurement Law   [35]  OTHER POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES  FOR NATIONAL SECURITY   • Convert portions of selected idle military lands in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao into defense industrial parks  and mixed-use residential-commercial zones, especially those bordering on highly developed regions.   Conversion of lands will be coordinated with the concerned departments concerning rules and regulations on  land use conversion.   • Float long-term bonds or Treasury bills for sale to the corporate and sovereign markets here and abroad.   Additionally, create affordable, low-denominated bonds for sale to patriotic individual citizens, to include our  OFWs abroad.   • Legislate a special national security tax applicable to mass air-sea-land transports and passengers; and to  telecommunication companies and end-users.   • Legislate a revision of the Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCC) charters to set aside at  least 3 percent of annual net income for credible deterrence.   • Legislate adjustments in the formula providing for the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of local government  units (LGUs) that carves out a significant amount of the annual IRA for credible deterrence.  LGUs must be  harnessed to help fund the effort which will be used to protect their own territories.   • Free up cash generated annually from anti-corruption and efficiency improvement measures targeting at least  10 percent of the GAA in ascending rates over time.    needs to be rev i sed a long wi th   Commission on Audit (COA) rules and   regulations, as well as bidding procedures   and the rules of engagement among   bidders where bidding cannot be   dispensed with, to prevent unwarranted   legal obstructionism.    Development of Strategic Industries   Developing the strategic industries   can make this sector a potential element of   national power. With its ample natural   resources and huge skilled workforce, the   Philippines could become another success   story in the field of strategic industries,   something long overdue.    The long-term objectives are: (1)   generate resources and wealth for the   Filipino people; (2) expand, diversify and   transform the economy of the country --   from an agricultural to an industrial/  manufacturing economy; (3) provide   sufficient jobs to sustain the Philippines’   growing population; and (4) accelerate   nation-building, economic development,   and stability of the country.   Of critical importance is the nature   of technology to be utilized and the types   of industry that can support rapid and   sustainable economic development.   Among the industries we need to develop   further are agriculture and aquaculture,   aircraft , investment and banking,   biotechnology, construction, disaster   prevention, electronics, environment,   informat ion and communica t ions   technology, land combat, manufacturing,   robotics, satellite systems and space,   shipbuilding, strategic materials and   minerals, transportation, weapons, and   tourism.     (Annex B provides the list of strategic industries that are vital to national security.)   [36]    [37]       [38]  “May we all have a renewed sense of       commitment  to promote the welfare of our  people, safeguard our national interest, and  assert our sovereign rights over our waters  and all other areas within our jurisdiction.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  Speech During the Philippine Rise    Commemoration / May 2018    o achieve the national security   vision and protect the national   interests, the State must address   t h e v a r i o u s t h r e a t s a n d   challenges that characterize the evolving   strategic security environment.  The NSS   presents the guiding principles in   preparing the strategic action plans to   address those challenges. The National   Security Council (NSC) shall coordinate   and oversee the day-to-day execution of   the ongoing security agenda.     Together with the agencies under   the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice   and Peace (CCSJP) and the National   Intelligence Board (NIB), the NSC shall   ensure the cohesion of policies and   programs for implementing the security   agenda.     Through the Cabinet and the   Executive Committee of the NSC, the   National Security Adviser (NSA) shall   report to the President the status of their   implementation.    Below is a set of specific action   areas, the fulfillment of which will   contribute to the attainment of the above   national vision.  Similarly, these action   areas were identified following a careful   analysis of the various threats and   challenges to national security and their   associated risks.     These action areas are expressed in   terms of specific goals and objectives   aimed at pro-actively countering or   reducing the country’s exposure to these   threats.   T  [39]    GUARANTEE PUBLIC SAFETY AND    ACHIEVE GOOD GOVERNANCE   The Strategy begins with the   determination to protect the nation against   the range of threats that directly impact on   the safety and welfare of the Filipino   people.  These are terrorism, insurgency   and subversion; transnational crimes;   criminality and illegal drugs; and graft   and corruption.     Terrorism, Insurgency and Subversion   The Communist Party of the   Philippines/New People’s Army/National   Democratic Front (CPP/  NPA/NDF) remains as   the most enduring and   challenging among the   l o c a l r e v o l u t i o n a r y   forces.  Virtually all   provinces in  the  country     are   affected  by CPP/  NPA/NDF terrorism and   ex to r t ion ac t iv i t i e s ,   including areas with   strong presence by non-  state armed groups.     The CPP/NPA/NDF continues to   subvert the state through subterfuge and   violence. On and off   peace talks with the   rebels have been on-  going for more than two   decades, but there has   been little progress. The   security situation remains   problematic in significant   parts of the resource-rich   but troubled region of   Southern Philippines or   Mindanao.     [40]  The CPP/NPA/NDF  continues to wage war   against the  government.  Peace  talks with the rebels   have been on-going for  more than two   decades, but there has  been little progress.    Over the past two decades, two   peace deals have been forged with the   Moro National Liberation   Front (MNLF) and the   Moro Islamic Liberation   Front (MILF). However,   p e a c e e f f o r t s i n   Mindanao have remained   f r a g i l e d u e t o t h e   splintering of the Moro   movement which gave   rise to the emergence of   smaller but decidedly   m o r e v i o l e n t a n d   e x t r e m i s t I s l a m i s t    jihadists. In recent years,   t h e s e g r o u p s h a v e   pledged allegiance to the Iraq-born   Islamic State (IS) terror network and are   believed to be seeking to   es tab l i sh an I s lamic   caliphate encompassing   the entire Southeast Asia.   The five-month siege in   Marawi City in 2017, led   by the Maute brothers and   a Hapilon-led  faction  of    the  Abu  Sayyaf  Group     (ASG) showed the more   m e n a c i n g b r a n d o f   Islamist extremism that   we are currently facing in   Mindanao.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Modernize, professionalize and synergize the Philippine Armed Forces and the   National Police to be capable of combating terrorism, insurgency and subversion,   quickly and decisively.   • Work with Congress to allocate greater resources to modernize our police,   military, and coast guard and to enable our troops to confront the challenges of   terrorism and insurgency.   [41]  The five-month siege  in Marawi City in  2017, led by the   Maute brothers and a  Hapilon-led faction  of the ASG showed  the more menacing  brand of Islamist  extremism that we   are currently facing    in Mindanao.    • Defeat radicalism and prevent recruitment through an effective whole-of-  government approach and address the process of radicalization and de-  radicalization through information operations and education.   • Implement the peace agreement with the MILF toward healing in the   Bangsamoro, complete the implementation of remaining commitments under the   GPH-MNLF peace agreement, and work for the immediate conclusion of the   peace process with the CBA-CPLA and the RPMP-RPA-ABB.    • Provide additional security to future and existing infrastructure projects to prevent   militant groups from sabotaging and/or interfering with the projects and structures’   purpose.   • Address the plight of the Indigenous Peoples and farmers especially agrarian   reform beneficiaries to prevent unrest in the countryside and recruitment of   insurgents and terrorists.   • Implement peace-promoting and catch-up socioeconomic development in conflict-  affected areas and empower communities by increasing their capacity to address   conflict and reduce their vulnerabilities.   • Strengthen government peace and development institutions and mechanisms to   increase their responsiveness to peace, conflict, and security issues.   • Ensure government rationalization, coordination, and monitoring of the delivery   of socioeconomic programs, and other interventions by donor institutions and   government agencies in conflict-affected areas, especially in Mindanao.   • In addition to the active force, train and expand the strength of the reservists to at   least one percent (1%) of the population pursuant to the Philippine Constitution   and the AFP Reservist Act (RA 7077).   [42]    Transnational Organized Crimes   Transnational organized crimes  (TOC) and the proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction continue to pose  numerous challenges to  t h e s t a t e ’s o v e r a l l   n a t i o n a l s e c u r i t y .  O r g a n i z e d c r i m e s  prevalent in the country  include drug trafficking,  trafficking in persons,  piracy and armed robbery  against ships, smuggling  of small arms and light  weapons (gunrunning),  internet fraud/identity  thef t (cybercr imes) ,   product counterfeiting  (Intellectual Property Rights or IPR theft)  and environmental crimes such as wildlife  trafficking.    Transnational organized crime  groups operate like multi-national  compan ie s and a s such , p ro f i t - maximization is the primary objective.   As new trends in the global market   emerge, these groups immediately adapt  to developments  in   information and  communications technology (ICT) and   t r a d e a n d f i n a n c i a l  practices, among others.    The Philippines’ shift  t o w a r d s g r e a t e r  integration within the  ASEAN framework blurs  the physical lines of state  borders that make illicit  a c t i v i t i e s e a s i e r t o  conduct. This context  provides TOC syndicates  more opportunities to  o p e r a t e a n d t h r i v e .  Moreover, violence and   corruption are inherent elements of TOC.     The rule of law enforced by state  authorities is met with violent and armed  resistance while corruption of government  officials further facilitates the illicit  activities of transnational organized  crimes without fear of arrest or  interdiction.   [43]  Transnational  organized crimes and   the proliferation of  weapons of mass   destruction continue  to pose numerous  challenges to the   state’s overall  national security.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies on equipment, training,   mobility, communications and weapons for effective deterrence and interdiction.   • Strengthen the anti-money laundering aspect of investigation by integrating   financial investigations in all law enforcement operations.   • Improve border management and security on land, water and air.    • Create a reliable database on transnational organized crime syndicates for   information-sharing with foreign counterparts.   • Improve international collaboration and cooperation in both the public and the   private sector.   • Implement the Strategic Trade Management Act of 2015 to address the threats on   the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.   Criminalities, Public Safety, Rule of Law and Human Rights   Public safety is defined as the   overall welfare and protection of the   general public. Prevailing public safety   concerns are criminality, illegal drugs,   and natural and human-induced disasters.   The strategic objective is to mainstream   the concept of public safety in the   national security agenda to build peaceful,   safe and resilient communities.    This entails the integration of law   enforcement, community policing,   disaster management and resilience, and   local governance in the security sector   framework.    In times of calamities or terror   attacks, there is a need to prioritize   securing access to the affected areas.     [44]    Public safety can be   better established if the   roads and bridges leading   to the distressed areas are   secure and passable.   Corollary to this is   the promotion of the rule   o f l a w a n d t h e   observance and respect   for human rights. The law   is a cornerstone of the   country’s democratic   values which enables the   attainment of public   s a f e ty and na t i ona l   security goals. To this   end , t he S t a t e w i l l   vigorously pursue the   p r o m o t i o n a n d   observance of the rule of   law, value the dignity of   every human being and   guarantee full respect for   human rights.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Institutionalize reforms within the PNP that will command community and citizen   respect, trust, and confidence.   • Build resilient communities that are able to deal with and recover from every   crisis.   • Guarantee the mobility and secure access of aid workers and peace-keeping   officers to affected areas in times of calamities or terror attacks.   The strategic objective  is to mainstream the   concept of public  safety in the national   security agenda to  build peaceful, safe   and resilient  communities.  [45]    • Step up police-community partnerships on crime prevention and for the protection   of critical infrastructures and installations.   • Dismantle all private armies.   • Integrate human rights approaches to all aspects of State functions.   • Build a system that will allow the exchange of information among law   enforcement, prosecution, court and corrections agencies for swift intelligence   gathering and apprehension of criminal elements.   • Strengthen border control to deter the entry of unlawful elements by passing a new   immigration law.   Governance   Bad governance   and structural inequities   have impeded economic   progress and continue to   demand priority attention,   efforts and resources   from government.  In   particular, corruption in   the public sector has   impeded the development   goals of the State. It   diverts scarce resources   f r o m t h e p o o r a n d   vulnerable sectors of   society.  Promoting a   c u l t u r e o f g o o d   g o v e r n a n c e w i l l ,   therefore, benefit the   long-term security of the   country.     I t e n t a i l s t h e   efficient and effective use   o f r e s o u r c e s t o   implement the priority   programs and projects of   the State to end extreme   poverty and raise the   living standards of every   Corruption in the  public sector has   impeded the  development goals of  the State and diverts  scarce resources from   the poor and  vulnerable sectors of   society.  [46]    Filipino. The overall strategic priorities   are to reduce corruption and increase   accountability and transparency in the   government.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Instill accountability and transparency in the government and stop corruption.   • Empower our people to cope with developments in science and technology, shifts   in economic power, and demographic and social change.   • Ensure in-city relocation site of communities that will be affected by rapid   urbanization and development programs.   • Encourage public participation through active 24/7 hotline 8888.   • Professionalize the civil service for a more competent and principled government   workforce.   • Pursue and communicate the benefits of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law   (BBL) and a federal-parliamentary form of government.     [47]    MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH-RELATED THREATS   Health security today demands   greater attention than before.  New   diseases are emerging and spreading;   virus and bacteria are developing drug-  resistant strains; and laboratories are   working on dangerous bacteria and   viruses.  The ease of global  travel has   increased  the  risk  of rapid spread and   contamination, as well as challenged   existing containment protocols.     Moreover, the proliferation of   illegal drugs has been another major   health problem as it primarily destroys the   human brain which impacts mental health.   Drug abuse leads to serious crimes, which   in turn can destroy lives and families as   well as the erosion of social peace.     A l t h o u g h t h e g o v e r n m e n t   acknowledges that the victims of drug   addiction are health patients, it is inclined   to treat the issue as a socio-political one   requi r ing a more comprehens ive   government intervention.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS:     Health and Nutrition   • Strengthen the nation’s capacity and continue collaboration with other countries   particularly the United Nation’s World Health Organization in preventing, detecting,   and responding to epidemics/pandemics.   • Maintain the high level of 24/7 preparedness and quick response capabilities.   • Modernize the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and continue the   capability building of its research teams.   [48]    • Develop or further strengthen facilities for detection (i.e. Laboratories and   Toxicology / Poison Centers) and case management for victims / casualties of   Chemical, Biological, and Radio-Nuclear (CBRN) incidents.   • Scale up public hospitals to at least level III as well as the government vaccination   program coverage.   • Establish a genuine, pro-poor universal health care system wherein public hospitals   are given more financial support by the national government and local government   units (LGUs).   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS:    Illegal Drugs and Substance Abuse   • Enhance community-based rehabilitation programs through the Department of   Health (DOH) and local health units (LHUs).   • Educate the youth on the ills of illegal drugs and substance abuse.   • Improve the socio-economic welfare of the people through education and livelihood   programs.    • Create an information / database system on illegal drugs and substance abuse.   • Develop a comprehensive post release monitoring plan to prevent a relapse or return   to illegal drug use and substance abuse.   • Tap the religious sectors, media, academia and other relevant non-government   organizations in rehabilitation programs and anti-illegal drug use and substance   abuse campaign.   [49]    DEVELOP A DYNAMIC, INCLUSIVE,    AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY   The prevailing challenge of the 21st   century is how to achieve the competitive   advan tage .  The cha l l enges o f   g loba l i za t ion such a s economic    i n t e g r a t i o n a n d    increasing competition   have called for the   development of the   s t r a t eg ic indus t r i e s   w h i c h c a n p l a y a   significant role in the   country’s pursuit of   r a p i d e c o n o m i c   d e v e l o p m e n t a n d   national security.     Wi t h i t s r i c h   natural and mineral   resources, vibrant and   resilient people, and   mobility of labor and   capital, the country can   easily ride the tide of post-modernization.   The country’s expansive arable lands and   rich fishing grounds indicate that   agribusiness and fishing will continue to   thrive.    Meanwhile, businesses in   t h e m a n u f a c t u r i n g ,   banking and finance, and   services segments can   continue to take advantage   of the country’s large pool   of young, skilled, English-  speaking and hardworking   labor force.     I n d u s t r i e s s u c h a s   aviat ion, electronics ,   i n f o r m a t i o n a n d   c o m m u n i c a t i o n s   technology, land combat   systems, robotics, satellite   s y s t e m s a n d s p a c e   technology, shipbuilding,   strategic minerals, and   weapons manufacturing, are supported by   The challenge of  globalization is how to   translate human  innovation and   technological progress  into the development of   strategic industries  which can create wealth   for national  development and  national security.  [50]    paral le l industr ies such as par ts   manufacturing, machining and assembly.     Other industries with promising   potential in the Philippines are logistics   a n d t r a n s p o r t , b i o t e c h n o l o g y ,   construction, and renewable energy.     KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Promote military and defense establishments’ partnerships with the private sector   and foreign companies in the build-up of strategic industries.   • Develop and harmonize industry-based graduate and undergraduate programs and   curricula with global standards and 21st century competencies.    • Create more vibrant and livable growth centers to help decongest main urban areas   and ensure a safe employment environment.   • Promote science and technology competencies, programs and courses to develop   and build an adequate pool of technocrats and scientists.   • Fill the industry gaps by establishing supporting industries like industrial steel   manufacturing (ISM) for steel refinery and recovery, and intelligent solutions   industry (ISI) for highly-in-demand products and technology.   • Support access to quality education and the competitiveness of human resource   through people-to-people exchanges, and overseas training and education.   • Support innovation-based interventions / technologies to enhance industry / Micro,   Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) productivity.   [51]    ACHIEVE FOOD AND WATER SECURITY   Food is the most important   commodity in populous Philippines.   Combined with our military instrument   which is now among the weakest in Asia,   food is a major element   of Philippine national   power.  Among the   various food items, rice is   the staple food not only   of Filipinos but most   neighboring countries in   Asia and even in Africa.   I t i s a p o l i t i c a l   commodity because its   shor tage has caused   social unrest and even a   global food crisis in the   past.  This is why food   security has become a   significant national security concern.    It is the policy of the government   to ensure that every Filipino shall have   food on their table, especially the poorer   sector of society.  It is a major challenge   then for the government to come up with   the necessary strategies to ensure   c o n t i n u o u s d e v e l o p m e n t o f t h e   agricultural and fishery sectors and   mitigation of the adverse effects of man-  made and natural crises   on food security.     Related to this, food   security is closely linked   t o w a t e r s e c u r i t y .    Without water, there will   hardly be food; and   without secure water for   crops, livestock, and   human use, there will be   conflict.  The agricultural   food-based production   depends solely on water   resource. Watersheds   provide irrigation to   agricultural lands especially lands planted   with food crops such as rice and corn.    [52]  Food is a political  commodity.  Its   shortage has caused  social unrest in the past.    Food security is closely   linked with water  security.    However, despite the abundance of   water in the country, there has still been a   decline of supply of water in many parts   of the country.  The declining water   supply was due to decades of resource   mismanagement, inadequate investments   in physical infrastructure, and the growing   threat of climate change.  Consequently, it   has resulted to drought and desertification   in some parts of the country. Water   security then has become a major national   security concern that the government   should address.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS:    Food Security   • Address the problem of land conversion particularly the prime agricultural lands   that are converted into non-agricultural uses and building of irrigations.   • Allot bigger subsidy for the agricultural production of small and middle income   farmers, implement genuine land reform, and respect the indigenous people’s right   to their ancestral land.   • Make use of technologies that have been proven beneficial to farmers and   fishermen, to the health of the people and to the environment.    • Implement a social development program that will enable poor communities to   stand on their own and utilize their own resources.   • Adopt a multi-faceted whole-of-government approach including partnerships with   a wide range of non-government development actors and groups.   [53]    • Provide social protection schemes and educational assistance for farmers and   fishermen.   • Upgrade infrastructure, rehabilitate and protect major ecosystems, and adopt a   basin-approach to environmentally sound management of resources.    • Improve awareness, appreciation and coverage of small farmers and fisherfolk on   risk insurance and resiliency to climate and disaster risks.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS:    Water Security   • Adopt the principles of integrated water resources management and sustainable   forest conservation and management practices.   • Promote social and individual awareness about water issues and encourage civil   society participation in decision-making regarding environmental impacts and   other measures.   • Implement policies, plans and programs on the tenurial rights of indigenous   peoples and forest dwellers, log ban, and mining operations in forest areas,   protected areas and watersheds.    • Rehabilitate mangrove forests and build water catchments and impounding   facilities.   [54]    SAFEGUARD AND PRESERVE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY                                              AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY   In safeguarding and preserving its   sovereignty and territorial integrity, the   Philippines shall provide emphasis on the   implementation of a   s t r o n g i n d e p e n d e n t   foreign policy.  At the   very least, the Philippines   n e e d s t o p r o j e c t a   m i n i m u m d e f e n s e   credibility.  In particular,   the dispute in the West   Philippine Sea depicts the   i m m e n s e h i s t o r i c a l ,   e c o n o m i c , l e g a l ,   diplomatic, and environ-  menta l complexi t ies   involved in the dispute   pitting the   Philippines   with several other claimant countries.   Actions to address the West Philippine   Sea issue should look into the interplay of   these dynamics and how government   effor ts and resources should be   prioritized.  Relatedly, a media campaign   at home and abroad on the Award issued   by the Tribunal of the United Nations   Convention on the Law of the Sea   (UNCLOS) on the West   Philippine Sea dispute is   called for.     Over the past several   decades , the Armed   Forces   of    the     Philippines   (AFP)   has     b e e n p e r f o r m i n g   multifarious functions,   putting a strain on its   limited equipment and   resources.      Apart from its main duty   o f p r o t e c t i n g a n d   defending the national territory against   external threats, the AFP has been   required to also support the internal   security operations against terrorism and   Islamic and communist insurgents.  The   military has also been at the frontline of   The respective roles  and mandates of our   military, law  enforcement agencies,  reservists, and other   key stakeholders need  to be aligned with the   country’s national  security goals and   objectives.  [55]    government rescue and relief operations   during natural calamities and other   disasters.    In view of our limited capabilities   and resources, the respective roles and   mandates of our military, civilian law   enforcement agencies, reservists, and   other key stakeholders will need to be   synchronized and aligned with the   country’s national security goals and   objectives.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Modernize the deterrent and self-defense capabilities of our ground, naval, littoral   and air forces.   • Enhance professional development of foreign service personnel and members of   defense and foreign attaches.   • Strengthen cooperation and peaceful approach with countries sharing common   maritime borders and interests.   • Pursue the passage of relevant national security legislations.   • Support bilateral, regional and global mechanisms that promote peace and security,   the rule of law and peaceful resolution of disputes.   [56]    HEIGHTEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND PRIDE ON FILIPINO  HERITAGE, CULTURE AND VALUES   The Philippines is a nation of   diverse cultures that were rooted from the   East and the West. But even prior to   colonization, our indigenous peoples   already had their distinct justice and   governance systems, customs and   traditions, arts, literature, music, dance,   and values. This was later influenced by   the introduction of Islam, the coming of   the Chinese , the Spaniards , the   Americans, and the Japanese.    These various cultural influences   have led us to become a country with   120-170 languages and dialects, spoken   by 110 ethno-linguistic groups, and   having distinct values of friendliness,   hospitality, spirituality, and gratitude.   Culture is also varied according to age   group, gender, spirituality, and socio-  economic class.    Just like the archipelagic nature of   our country, we take pride in our heritage   of looking at our narratives – from Luzon,   Visayas, and Mindanao – as being one   history of the Filipino people.    The Government needs  to work towards  preserving and   enriching our sense of  national pride in our   unique historical roots,  culture and value   systems.  [57]    Given the rich cultural background   of the Filipinos, it is the responsibility of   the government to work towards   preserving and enriching our sense of   national pride in our unique historical   roots, culture, and values systems.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Conserve, protect and promote the nation’s historical and cultural heritage.   • Encourage the continuing and balanced development of a diverse culture by the   people.   • Ensure the widest dissemination of artistic and cultural products among the   greatest number of people across the country and overseas for their appreciation,   enjoyment and promotion.   • Integrate the history, culture and identity studies of Filipino-Muslims and   Indigenous people in the study of Philippine History in both basic and higher   education.    • Encourage and support continuing discussion and debate through symposia,   workshops, publications, etc., on the highest norms available in the matrix of   Philippine culture.   • Embed the culture of nation-building, inclusiveness, cultural and gender-  sensitivity and global citizenship in all aspects of education.   [58]    PROMOTE HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL SECURITY   Climate change as well as natural   and human-induced emergencies and   disasters have become one of the most   significant human security concerns of our   time. The Philippines, in particular, is   susceptible to both   geological and hydro-  meteorological hazards.   In fact, the World Risk   Report 2016 puts the   country at third place   among the countries   with the highest disaster   risk in the world, next   to Vanuatu (first) and   Tonga (second). With   temperature and rainfall   projected to increase   from now until 2050   because of climate change, the impact of   natural disasters is expected to increase.    With the onslaught of the 2013 7.2   magnitude earthquake in Bohol and the   2013 Category 5 Super Typhoon Yolanda/  Haiyan  in   Leyte,    we  have    seen       how      natural       disasters  have    resulted  in  the  loss  of lives, homes,   livelihood, businesses, and infrastructure.   They have pushed people to poverty,   d i s p l a c e m e n t a n d   h u n g e r , a n d h a v e   reversed some of our   recent economic gains.    In times of disasters,   equally important is to   give first responders   access to disaster areas   and provide re l ief   g o o d s t o a f f e c t e d   citizens. It is therefore   imperat ive for the   government, with the   s u p p o r t o f a l l   stakeholders, to better promote human and   ecological security and seriously address   the negative effect of climate change and   disaster risks in the country.   Climate change as  well as natural and   human-induced  emergencies and   disasters have  become one of the  most significant  human security   concerns of our time.  [59]    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Adopt a set of approaches on the sustainable development goals to promote human   security, significantly reduce poverty, protect the environment and ensure   prosperity.   • Develop environment-friendly technology and engineering solutions to address   climate change and mitigate its negative impacts.   • Strengthen the role and capability of the local government units and security forces   in disaster, emergencies and crises response.   • Allocate sufficient public funds and investments in disaster risk reduction and   management and to personnel engaged in disaster-risk and reduction activities.   • Promote “clean and green” consciousness in the Filipino youth through education   and community-based programs and policies.   • Mitigate the negative effects of climate change and calamities by having in place   multiple plans to deliver relief goods in disaster areas.   • Institutionalize punitive actions against local government units that prove   unwilling to exert best efforts in cleaning and protecting the environment.   • Dismantle private enterprises that adversely and significantly affect the   environment by failing to comply with government regulations.   [60]    ACHIEVE ENERGY SECURITY   E n e r g y s e c u r i t y i s t h e   uninterrupted availability of energy   sources to all households and economic   sectors throughout the country at an   affordable price. The Philippines is   committed to secure and protect energy   supply throughout the country, sustain and   develop existing energy sources, develop   a l t e r n a t i v e , s u s t a i n a b l e , a n d   environmental-friendly sources of energy   to support the growing demands of   economic enterprises and households, and   contribute to global efforts to address the   negative effects of climate change.   KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Secure and protect the generation, distribution and transmission of domestic fuel  resources.   • Promote the use of alternative fuels and the aggressive development of renewable  energy potentials such as biomass, natural gas, solar, wind, and ocean resources.   • Pursue the development of alternative non-conventional energy technology for  non-commercially viable remote areas and smaller villages.   • Pursue a policy environment that hosts the convergence of education, scientific  research, and business interests in promoting clean and renewable energy.   • Improve the supply and maintain affordable pricing of oil and electricity services  nationwide;    • Utilize the services of international partners and explore the latest scientific  innovations in achieving energy security.   • Fast track implementation of the Philippine Energy Plan 2012-2030.   [61]    ENSURE MARITIME AND AIRSPACE SECURITY   The Philippines has the third   longest coastline in the world after   Indonesia and Canada and is the world‘s   sixth largest producer of fish.  Fish is a   main protein source and fisheries are a   main source of livelihood for Filipinos in   coastal areas. Fisheries have historically   supported the survival of coastal   populations and are vital to food security.    The sea is extremely significant from an   international navigational, economic,   geopolitical and strategic perspective. Oil   and gas resources have been proven to   exist in areas adjacent to and closest to the   coastlines of littoral states. The sea is also   a lifeline for trade and energy supplies as   well as for military navigation.     Currently, the Philippines has   difficulty patrolling its vast expanse of   water due to   lack of equipment and   resources stemming mainly from meager   border security and defense funding.          There is an urgent    need to develop a   modern and  adequately-equipped  border security force  capable of ensuring   maritime and airspace  security.   [62]    There is an urgent need to develop   a modern and adequately-equipped border   security force capable of ensuring   maritime and air space security.     Laws to counter illegal activities   within the Philippines’ maritime and air    spaces need to be strengthened.  Security   cooperation and political agreements   should also be strengthened to promote   regional peace and stability.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Integrate management plans and operations in our air and maritime domains.   • Identify and acquire equipment to provide nationwide 24/7 domain awareness, and   effectively manage and control Philippines air and maritime spaces.   • Harmonize agency capability plans, legal and fund requirements relative to air and   maritime security and development missions.   • Establish comprehensive and integrated databases for planning and decision-  making.    • Promote maritime domain awareness.   [63]    STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS   The present global political,   economic and security order requires an   independent foreign   policy to ensure a   s t a b l e a n d s e c u r e   external environment   for the country and   people to thrive as a   united and progressive   nation.  An independent   foreign policy shall be   geared towards bolstering cooperative and   harmonious relations with all countries at   the bilateral, regional and multilateral   levels, promoting development through   i n t e r n a t i o n a l     cooperation    and      economic diplomacy,   protecting the rights   and welfare of overseas   F i l i p i n o s , a n d   advancing Philippine   global stature through   c o m m i t m e n t t o   international obligations.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Promote amity and cooperation with all nations by enhancing bilateral relations,   strengthening alliances and strategic partnerships, and developing new security or   cooperation arrangements.   • Expand and enhance engagements and cooperation with regional and international   organizations, particularly in areas of interest to the country.   • Expand the global presence of the Philippine Foreign Service and key attached   agencies and establish Foreign Service posts in strategic areas.   • Expand security, defense, social and economic diplomacy in support of the   national vision and the country’s security and development agenda.   An independent foreign  policy shall be geared   towards bolstering  cooperative and   harmonious relations  with all countries.   [64]    PROVIDE STRONG CYBER INFRASTRUCTURE             AND CYBER SECURITY    The Internet has become not only a   ready source of information for research   and education purposes, but has also   become a platform to promote a culture of   peace among people   with varying cultures.    On the other hand, the   Filipinos’ increased   dependence on online   connectivity has also   m a d e t h e p u b l i c ,   i n c l u d i n g t h e   g o v e r n m e n t a n d   business sectors, more   vulnerable to various   forms of web-based   crimes.     With advances   in t echnology and   innovations in the computer and mobile   industry surging at a very fast pace,   protecting its citizens and institutions   from falling victims to cybercrimes has   become a major challenge for the   government.  Moreover, the easy access   to the Internet has also been used by   insurgents, terrorists and other groups to   publicize their actions and promote their   cause.  This has also   resulted in the rise of   r a d i c a l i z a t i o n a n d   violent ext remism,   especially among the   vulnerable youth who   are tech savvy.  The   protection of critical   infrastructure from   c y b e r a t t a c k s a n d   i n f o r m a t i o n    m a n i p u l a t i o n h a s    b e c o m e a n u rg e n t   impe ra t i ve .  Our   inability to harness the   potentials and thwart the threats from   cyberspace could imperil the country’s   vital interests, critical infrastructure and   installations, institutions, and the   patrimony of the country and people.   The protection of  critical infrastructure   from cyber attacks  and information   manipulation is an  urgent national   security concern.   [65]    Philippine initiatives have to be promoted   and aligned to efforts of all countries that   pursue a secure and reliable cyberspace   environment.    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Protect the business and supply chains via the implementation of the National   Cybersecurity Plan’s (NCSP) National Common Criteria Evaluation Program.   • Establish the National Cyber Intelligence Platform for shared situational   awareness and strengthen the capabilities of the Computer Emergency Response   Team (CERT) to assess our vulnerabilities and to improve the country’s protection   profiles in cyberspace.   • Conduct a continuing cyber security education campaign to raise public awareness   especially among the youth on the terrorist activities in the cyberspace.   • Increase the supply of national cybersecurity professionals and experts.   • Work with the global community to address the gaps and ongoing improvement in   our national cyber security posture and coordinate law enforcement, investigation   and prosecution of cyber criminals.   • Provide a predictable and sustained clarity of roles and responsibilities of various   stakeholders during the cyber-attacks.                     [66]    IMPROVE VITAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE  AND PORT SECURITY   Transport is a critical sector of the   Philippine economy, linking its people   and business hubs across its many islands.   B u t a b o o m i n g    p o p u l a t i o n , r a p i d   u r b a n i z a t i o n a n d   d e c a d e s o f   u n d e r s p e n d i n g i n   i n f r a s t r u c t u r e   development have left   their mark upon the   transport network in   terms of ageing and   o v e r l y - s t r a i n e d   in f r a s t ruc tu re . I t s   limited road network   a n d c o n t i n u o u s l y    increasing number of   p r i v a t e v e h i c l e s   exceeding the road network’s absorptive   capacity have also exacerbated road   congestion, pollution, and motor vehicle   accidents especially in Metro Manila, the   country’s financial and political hub.   Developing an integrated and sustainable   transport network that can move goods,   people and services   m o r e s p a c i o u s l y ,   efficiently, and safely is   therefore an urgent   c o n c e r n o f t h e   Philippine government.   Relatedly, the increased   t h r e a t s p o s e d b y   t e r r o r i s m a n d   transnational crimes   prompt more stringent   i n t e r n a l s e c u r i t y   protocols and measures.    More thorough security   m e a s u r e s m u s t b e   implemented in the   country’s aviation, port and cargo, and   immigration facilities.     The increased threats  posed by terrorism and   transnational crimes  prompt more stringent   internal security  protocols and measures.   More thorough security   measures shall be  implemented in the   country’s aviation, port  and cargo, and   immigration facilities.  [67]    KEY FEATURES OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS   • Enhance the transportation systems and train the personnel in responding to  security threats or breaches of security in all roads and highways, seaports, and  airports.   • Develop inter-island connectivity nationwide, construct subways and overpasses in  strategic routes, and adopt automated guideway transit (AGT) systems.   • Establish and maintain a database for all the domestic and foreign transportation  security threats.    • Conduct a continuing awareness campaign on the security risks and threats to our  transportation infrastructure, seaports and airports.   • Establish partnerships with law enforcement officials, emergency responders,  public safety agencies, and foreign counterparts with jurisdiction over  transportation and port security.   • Build strategic routes to transportation hubs that would improve the response time  of law enforcement officials, emergency responders and public safety agents in  times of emergencies, security threats or breaches of security or natural or human- induced disasters.   • Adopt and fully implement international security protocols on port security, port  access and facilitation.   [68]    [69]    [70]  “Ours is a rich country.  Wealth that this country  is endowed with is a gift from God to be utilized  for the people’s welfare and the common good…   That is why I say that it is not enough that we  mine this wealth.  What is more important is that  we convert the raw material thereof into finished  products for international and local purposes…   Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors  and commercial barons to put up factories and  manufacturing establishments right here in the  Philippines to process our raw materials into   finished products.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  State of the Nation Address 2017    o advance our national interests   and achieve the national vision,   the Philippines needs a coherent   and cohesive national security   organization that can effectively respond   to the ever-shifting realities in the security   environment. The organization for   national security is primarily responsible   for integrating the efforts of concerned   government agencies and instrumentalities   related to several critical aspects of   national security management, i.e.,   information/intelligence gathering;   conducting policy research and analysis;    formulating policies; crafting action plans;   and coordinating, overseeing and   monitoring the status of implementation   of action plans.     The Philippines has an already   existing national security infrastructure   that has served the country well through   its many crises and national emergencies.    However, given the highly fluid and often   unpredictable nature of the threats and   challenges we are facing, the quest for a   better way of accomplishing tasks should   be a continuing goal of our national   security managers and practitioners.    THE ORGANIZATION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY   As Head of State and Government,   the President of the Republic of the   Philippines plays a central role in national   security management and decision-  making primarily in terms of giving broad   guidance and impetus to the formulation   and implementation of national security   policies and strategies. In performing such   a role, he is aided by two multi-agency   bodies: the National Security Council   (NSC) and the National Economic and   Development Authority (NEDA) Board.   The President has also the authority to   seek advice from other members of the   Filipino national community.    T  [71]    [72]    A. National Security Council (NSC)   The National Security Council is   the principal advisory body on the proper   coordination and integration of policies   and plans affecting national security.  The   NSC consists of two distinct bodies – the   Council Proper and the Office of the   National Security Adviser and Director   General of the NSC Secretariat.    The National Security Council   Proper is a collegial body chaired by the   President.  It is composed of the Vice   President, the Senate President, the   Speaker of the House of Representatives,   selected Cabinet members, former   presidents, and other government officials   and private citizens or organizations who   may be invited by the President.     Theoretically, the Council Proper is where   crucial policy decisions are arrived at.    However, being collegial in nature, the   Council Proper   is   convened  only    periodically,  as may be called by the   President.   The NSC Secretariat, on the   other hand, is a permanent body that   provides technical support to the Council   Proper.  It is headed by the Director   General, who is at the same time the   National Security Adviser (NSA). Under   the direction of the President, the National   Security Council’s main functions are:    • Assist the President in directing the   National Security Policy and in giving   direction to the execution of the   National Security Strategy;    • Guide in the drafting of any second-  level Strategies that are deemed   necessary and, if appropriate, proceed   to their approval;    • M o n i t o r c o m p l i a n c e i n t h e   implementation of the National   Security Strategy and approve the   Annual Security Report for submission   to Congress;    • Direct and coordinate national crisis   management;    • Establish the necessary guidelines for   planning and coordinating the National   [73]    Security Policy and the National   Security Strategy;    • Oversee the proper functioning of the   intelligence and the national security   community;    • Perform other tasks attributed to it by   law or as directed by the President.    B.  Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice and Peace   Over the past decades, successive   administrations have organized and   reorganized a Cabinet Cluster on national   security matters. At present, the Cluster on   Security, Justice and Peace (EO No. 24,   series of 2017) has been tasked to ensure   the preservation of national sovereignty   and the rule of law; as well as focus on the   protection and promotion of human rights   and the pursuit of a just, comprehensive,   and lasting peace. The cluster is also the   principal government body that supervises   the government’s responses during   emergencies related to national security.    The Cluster on Security, Justice   and Peace is responsible for coordinating   and harmonizing efforts to formulate the   country’s national security policies and   strategies. Once adopted, it is the   responsibility of the cluster to monitor the   status of implementation and assess the   impact of these policies and strategies.     The Cluster on Security, Justice   and Peace is chaired by the Secretary of   the Department of National Defense   (DND), and has as its members the   following: Executive Secretary; Cabinet   Secretary; Secretaries of the Department   of Interior and Local Government   (DILG), Department of Foreign Affairs   (DFA) and Department of Justice (DOJ);   the National Security Adviser; and the   Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.   The NSC Secretariat acts as the Cluster   Secretariat.   [74]    C.  National Intelligence Board   It is in the national interest to   widen and diversify the sources of   intelligence information from the civilian   and military sectors and intensify the   coo rd ina t i on and i n t eg ra t i on o f   intelligence activities.  Pursuant to   Executive Order No. 246, series of 1987,   the National Intelligence Board (NIB) is   mandated to coordinate and integrate all   intelligence activities in the Government.    It is therefore the responsibility of the NIB   to monitor and verify compliance of the   Intelligence Community’s activities with   the National Security Strategy.  The   National Security Strategy will be revised   periodically based on the Board’s advice   and recommendation.   The NIB submits an Annual Report   to the Office of the National Security   Adviser (ONSA) and debates on the   guidelines of the policies and strategic   lines of actions of the NSS. The National   Security Adviser / Director General of the   National Security Council Secretariat   (NSA/DG-NSCS), as Chair of the NIB   (A.O. No. 124, series of 2005) transmits   the said Report to the President, the   Council Proper, and the Cabinet Cluster   on Security, Justice and Peace.  In his   capacity as Chair of the NIB, the NSA/  DG-NSCS shall conduct periodically an   audit of the overall performance of the   Intelligence Community in order to ensure   that the programs undertaken achieve the   identified goals.  AO 124 likewise directs   the NSA / DG-NSCS to revitalize the   Intelligence Community to render it more   responsive for the demands of the new   security environment consistent with this   Strategy and the President’s directives and   guidelines.    The Vice-Chair of the NIB is the   Director-General of the National   Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA)   and its members are senior officials of the   following: DFA, DND, DILG, DOJ,   Department of Public Works and   Highways (DPWH), Department of Trade   [75]    and Industry (DTI), Department of   Environment and Natural Resources   (DENR), Department of Transportation   (DOTr), Department of Agriculture (DA),   D e p a r t m e n t o f E n e r g y ( D O E ) ,   Department of Budget and Management   (DBM), Department of Labor and   Employment (DOLE), Department of   Science and Technology (DOST),   D e p a r t m e n t o f To u r i s m ( D O T ) ,   Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR),   Department of Social Welfare and   Development (DSWD), Department of   Finance (DOF), Office of the Presidential   Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP),   Presidential Communicat ions and   Operations Office (PCOO), Department of   In fo rmat ion and Communica t ion   Technology (DICT), Department of   Education (DepED), Commission on   Higher Education (CHED), Technical   Education and Skills Development   Authority (TESDA), and National   Economic and Development Authority   (NEDA).   The following agencies serve as   technical advisers to the NIB:  NICA,   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),   Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP),   Philippine National Police (PNP),   Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency   (PDEA), National Bureau of Investigation   (NBI), Bureau of Immigration (BI),   Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Anti-  Terrorism Council (ATC), Philippine   Center on Transnational Crimes (PCTC),   and Anti-Money Laundering Council   (AMLC).   [76]    D.   National Intelligence Committee   T h e N a t i o n a l I n t e l l i g e n c e   Committee (NIC), serves as the principal   advisory body for the coordination,   integration and fusion of all intelligence   activities relating to the preparation of the   National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) and   in addressing other issues of national   intelligence concern.    It is a collegial body for the   purpose of promoting unity and cohesion   of the national intelligence community as   well as for prescribing policy guidelines   and directives to various national   government units, agencies and offices   engaged in activities involving national   intelligence.    The NIC is chaired by the Director   G e n e r a l , N a t i o n a l I n t e l l i g e n c e   Coordinating Agency (NICA) and has the   following as members:  Undersecretary,   DFA; Director, NBI; Commissioner,   Bureau of Customs (BoC); Commissioner,   Bureau of Immigration (BI); Deputy Chief   of Staff for Intelligence (J2), AFP;   Director for Intelligence (DI), PNP; and   Commanding Officer, Presidential   Security Group (PSG). In September   2017, President Duterte amended   Administrative Order No. 68 which   created the NIC, to include the PDEA, the   PCG, and the Office for Transportation   Security (OTS) to the committee.    [77]    REINVIGORATING THE NATIONAL SECURITY SECTOR   The effectiveness of the national   security sector depends on its ability to   remain pro-active and dynamic in the face   of rapidly and ever-changing national   security environment. To do so, it must   constantly conduct a self-evaluation and   seek self-perfection.  Revitalizing the   sector may necessitate updated education   and training, structural realignments and   streamlining to ensure a more efficient   command and control and a more cost-  effective utilization of government   resources and manpower.    Given the complex gamut of   security-related disasters and emergencies   that may arise, the country’s crisis   management capability should be one of   the top priorities in any serious effort to   revitalize the national security sector.  In   particular, the crisis-management sector   should evolve into a highly equipped,   trained, motivated, systematic, organized   and reliable system that can readily and   speedily respond to crisis situations as   they arise, or anticipate crisis situations   and prevent them even before they arise.   The system should be able to readily issue   and coordinate clear guidelines for action   while following standardized and inter-  operable instruments within the purview   of the national security structure.  It shall   provide close supervision over the   operations of designated units on the   ground as well as provide a system of   monitoring and providing feedback and   situation updates in as real time as   possible.    Meanwhile, the role of the NSC   Proper and Secretariat should be further   honed and tapped.  Ideally, the NSC is the   lead instrumentality of the national   government mandated to address the   multi-faceted national security concerns   of the Philippines. So far, however, its   activities have been largely limited to   making decisions on high-impact external   and internal security issues confronting   the country.  Executive Order No. 115   [78]    (series of 1986) states that the function of   the NSC is “to advise the President with   respect to the integration of domestic,   foreign, military, political, economic,   social, and educational policies relating to   the national security so as to enable all   concerned ministries, departments, and   agencies of the government to meet more   effectively, problems and matters   involving the national security.”    Relatedly, the NSC Secretariat’s   role of providing technical assistance to   the Council Proper should be further   optimized by developing its potential for   research and national security policies and   strategies formulation, management and   communication tasks. Additional staffing   should be provided and adequate training   programs initiated in order to develop a   highly competent pool of policy research   and intelligence analysts and national   security managers and communicators.     Reforming the national security   sector and perfecting the crisis-  management system would necessitate   efforts to institutionalize the changes.    This may be done through legislation or   executive orders.  The NSC Secretariat is   currently in the process of preparing a   draft bill for National Security which will   be submitted to Congress for approval. In   t h e m o r e i m m e d i a t e t e r m ,   institutionalizing and managing the   National Security Strategy process must   be put into place.   “REVITALIZING THE SECURITY   SECTOR MAY NECESSITATE   UPDATED EDUCATION AND  T R A I N I N G , S T R U C T U R A L   R E A L I G N M E N T S A N D  STREAMLINING TO ENSURE A   MORE EFFICIENT COMMAND  AND CONTROL AND A MORE   COST-EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION  OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES   AND MANPOWER.”  [79]    “Nawa ay maging daan ang pagkakaisa at  kabayanihang ipinamalas ng ating mga bayani   tungo sa mas makabuluhan at  pangmatagalang pagbabago sa ating mga   pamayanan.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  Message During the 120th Anniversary Celebration   of the Philippine Independence Day / June 2018  [80]    [81]    he Philippines emerged from a   unique  set of historical and   geopolitical circumstances that   have combined to create a   resilient and vibrant nation. However, it   continues to be slowed down from within   by long-standing political-security   problems that have impeded the country’s   ability to realize its full developmental   potential. Resolving the country’s   domestic troubles has gained more   significance as the nation endeavors to   better define its role in relation to the   outside world, which is currently in a   rapid state of flux. If unprepared, the   Philippines will find it quite difficult to   face its external challenges and to fully   take advantage of new and exciting   possibilities in the emerging global   economic order.    Only by ending all internal   conflicts, creating a safer society, and   making the fruits of development more   evenly distributed among its people can   this nation hope to live up to the    challenges it faces today. Through a   careful identification of the national   interests and what currently threaten such   interests, 12 major national security goals   have been outlined in this NSS. Every   goal reached should bring the nation a   step closer to its vision of a more   peaceful, more prosperous and better   future for the Filipino people.    To achieve the national vision, the   State must harness all the assets and   resources at its disposal. This requires the   entire government and other sectors of   society to work together, shoulder-to-  shoulder, in a more well-planned,   organized and synchronized manner   toward the fulfillment of the 12-point   national security agenda. All government   departments and agencies should critically   examine their policies and conduct their   own internal assessment of their roles in   realizing these national goals.     [82]  T    Further reforms are needed in the   national security sector to make it more   efficient and proactive, able to respond   quickly and effectively to national   emergencies as they arise, and to predict   and preempt crisis situations even before   they arise. The national security   community must make an effort to   constantly seek self-perfection, hone and   learn new skills, and overcome some of its   most serious internal weaknesses related   to turf issues and negative mindsets.     Finally, this NSS requires no less   than a whole-of-nation campaign. In our   quest for meaningful change and a better   future, every individual citizen, every   sector of civil society, is enjoined to work   hand-in-hand with the Government in the   highest spirit of the Filipino people’s   culture of “bayanihan.”    As earlier pointed out, the NSS   initiative is a relatively nascent process in   the Philippines and will therefore be   updated as needed.  It will be difficult to   always agree among ourselves on issues   related to national development and   national security, but this in itself should   be viewed as a necessary precondition for   n a t i o n a l r e n e w a l a n d s o c i e t a l   transformation.   [83]    [84]  “Let us work together and lay a new  foundation in which a better Philippines        can be reconstructed.  Help me build a better tomorrow.”   President RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE  State of the Nation Address / 2017    ANNEX A –  THREATS AND CHALLENGES IN THE INTERNAL AND                                      EXTERNAL SECURITY  ENVIRONMENT   (NSP 2017-2022)      The national security sector needs to give focused attention to several major internal   and external issues and challenges confronting the Philippine society.     INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT   Law and Order and Administration of  Justice   The Philippines has grappled for  years with a serious peace and order  problem.  The national crime rate,  considered as one of the highest in  Southeast and East Asia, has posed a  significant deterrent to investments as well  as constrained the country’s overall  development potential.  While the number  of reported crimes has been rising, the  ability of the police to solve crime has  decreased.  The twin scourge of corruption  and patronage politics plaguing law  enforcement institutions and government  sector as a whole has made it extremely  hard, if not impossible, to bring the crime  rate down.    Clearly, ensuring public security  and enforcing the rule of law is one of the  key governance challenges confronting the  Philippine Government.  This has  amplified the need to undertake crucial  r e f o r m s a i m e d a t c l e a n s i n g a n d  strengthening the five pillars of the  criminal justice system, namely: law  enforcement, the courts, prosecution,   c o r r e c t i o n a l i n s t i t u t i o n s , a n d t h e  community.   The Philippines’ growing illegal  drugs problem in particular needs a  determined and proact ive solut ion.  Successive researches and pertinent crime  statistics in the Philippines show a strong  and direct correlation between crimes,  especially serious or violent ones, and  drug abuse.  Any serious campaign to fight  crime should therefore also involve a  resolute crusade to stamp out drug abuse.   This is a tough challenge.  In 2015, the  Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency  (PDEA) reported that a fifth—or 8,629 out  of the country’s 42,065 barangays—were  “drug affected,” determined by the  presence of at least one user, pusher,  manufacturer, or other drug personality in  the area. Based on PDEA’s 2014 arrest  data, methamphetamine hydrochloride or  shabu tops the list of most abused illegal  drugs , fo l lowed by mar i juana and  expensive party drugs like cocaine and  ecstasy.  The proliferation of illegal drugs  and the extent of drug trade in the  Philippines are also reflected in the rising   [85]    volume of seizures of illegal drugs over  the past few years amounting to:   Php.  5.44 billion (2013), Php. 6.18 billion  (2014), Php. 5.42 billion (2015), and Php.  12.4 billion (2016).   Internal Armed Conflicts  The communist rebellion being   waged by the Communist Party of the  Philippines, together with its armed wing,  the New People's Army (NPA), and its  political wing, the National Democratic  Front (NDF/P); continues to pose serious  peace and order problems in the country.  The CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion is one of the  world’s longest running communist  insurgencies and has claimed an estimated  30,000 lives since the 1960s.  While the  NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000  guerrillas now, down from a peak of  26,000 in the 1980s, it retains support  among the extremely poor in the rural  P h i l i p p i n e s . T h e r e a r e p e r s i s t e n t  challenges to the three-decade-old peace  negotiations with the communists, but the  Government will keep forging on until  both parties agree to end the fighting.     The Mindanao confl ict being  waged by non-state armed groups and  extremist movements remains a major  source of instability in resource-rich but  impoverished parts of southern Philippines  (or Mindanao).  The on-and-off peace  process with the Moro Islamic Liberation  Front (MILF) – the largest and most  organized of the myriad radical groups  operating in Mindanao – made a promising  breakthrough when finally, a peace deal  was signed in March 2014.  A draft  Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which   forms the backbone of the 2014 peace  accord, is pending approval in the  Philippine Congress.    In l ine wi th the above , the  Government, since the 1990s, has taken  steps to decentralize power aimed at  addressing the root causes of internal  conflicts, namely: poverty and social  injustice, widespread economic inequity,  poor governance, abuse and control of  political power, and marginalization of  cultural communities which includes land  security, natural resources, identity and  human rights.  The Local Government  Code of 1991 sought to empower regions  and local government units in a bid to  distribute wealth more evenly and to  extend the reach of essential government  services to the broadest segments of the  population.  It is time to take these initial  gains to the next higher level by exploring  the full benefits of political devolution  through a new form of government. The  proposal could spur long and vigorous  discussions among Filipinos, who have  never known any other government than  the present unitary one -- but let the public  debates start now.   Terrorism and Transnational Crimes    I n t e r n a t i o n a l t e r r o r i s m a n d   transnational crimes pose a direct threat to  the security of individual countries and to  international peace and prosperity. These  twin problems are a persistent global  threat that know no borders, nationality or  religion, and operate outside the rule of  law.  Transnational terrorists and crime  syndicates are usually well-organized  internationally and domestically. They are   [86]    well-resourced, have access to the latest  technologies and skills, and will use  unlimited or any form of violence to  achieve their goals and objectives.   The Philippines faces continuing  threats from terrorism, both of foreign and  domestic origin.  The Abu Sayyaf Group  (ASG) remains as the foremost terrorist  group actively inflicting severe socio- political and economic disruptions.  The  ASG is an Islamist extremist organization  known for its bandit-like tactics and  notorious for beheadings and kidnap-for- ransom activities in Mindanao.   Radically  inspired by the Al Qaeda (Osama bin  Laden) in its formative years, the ASG  along with its affiliates, such as the  Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and Rajah Solaiman  Movement (RSM), has a long-term  intention of waging jihadist war against  non-Muslims.   Its members are known to  have linkages with members of the  Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters  (BIFF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front  (MILF), and the Moro National Liberation  Front (MNLF).  The ASG has recently  pledged its allegiance (bay’ah) to the  Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS) but has faced  stiff resistance due to continuing police  and military operations.  In addition to the  ASG, other local terrorist groups such as  the Ansar al-Khilafah Philippines (AKP),  Maute Group, and Daesh-inspired entities  have the potential to inflict various forms  of violent attacks not only in Mindanao  but also in any part of the Philippines.     M e a n w h i l e , t h e p r o b l e m o f  transnational crimes has become more  pressing. Given its archipelagic attributes,   the Philippines’ borders are porous and  vulnerable to the activities of international  crime syndicates. These illegal trans- border activities include: drug trafficking;  human trafficking of children, women,  illegal migrants and labor; illegal fishing/ poaching; a rms smuggl ing ; money  laundering; and wildlife trafficking.  The  Philippines’ southern maritime borders  which are shared with i ts ASEAN  neighbors are also areas of concern due to  the prevalence of high sea piracy and other  related criminal activities. The asymmetric  nature of terrorism and transnational crime  requires the national government to  continuously review and update current  strategies, and to develop an integrated  approach involv ing concerned law  enforcement agencies of the Government.   The Philippines must strengthen and  enhance already existing cooperation with  international partners while seeking to  develop new ones in this regard.   Economic and Social Threats    Poverty remains pervasive and is   not expected to change significantly in the  near future.  As the population continues  to grow, more Filipinos are expected to  join the ranks of the poor so long as the  poverty rate remains largely unaddressed.  Data from the Philippine Statistics  Authority showed that poverty incidence  among F i l i p inos i n 2015 r ema ins  unacceptably high at 21.6%. On the other  hand, subsistence incidence among  Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos  whose incomes fall below the food  threshold, was estimated at 8.1% during  the same period.     [87]    Income inequality between the rich  and the poor and between urban and rural  areas has remained high and will likely  persist into the future.  The poorest 20% of  Filipinos own less than 5% of the  country’s total income and the richest 10%  of the population accumulate income 2.7  times more than that of the poorest 40%.   Moreover, average yearly unemployment  and underemployment rates for the past  five years remained steady at around 6%  and 18%, respectively. In absolute terms,  a b o u t 2 . 8 m i l l i o n F i l i p i n o s w e r e  unemployed.  While unemployment rate  increased recently, the underemployment  rate dropped to 16.3% in January 2017  from 19.6% recorded in the same year ago.  In absolute terms, about 6.4 million  Filipinos were underemployed, according   to the Labor Force Survey released by  Philippine Statistics Authority in January  2017.     Different levels of economic and  s o c i a l d e v e l o p m e n t , a l o n g w i t h  demographic pressures, cause hunger and  malnutrition, homelessness, and larger  migrations of people from rural to urban  areas.  Demographic migrations, in  addition to social problems and the growth  of crime, can lead to increased instability  and insecurity. Infectious diseases are also  o n t h e r i s e p a r t i c u l a r l y h u m a n  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and  acquired immune deficiency syndrome  (AIDS).  Many of the HIV/AIDS cases  were reported among overseas Filipino  workers (OFWs) and among workers  engaged in business process outsourcing.     EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT   Overlapping Territorial Claims and        Maritime Domain Issues    The country needs to address the  disputes concerning maritime boundaries  as they affect a complex range of national  security concerns as well as threaten  regional peace and stability.  The  Philippines must ensure good order within  its sea boundaries and develop appropriate  maritime domain awareness and response  force capability to address the presence of  hostile forces at sea, pirates, terrorists,  traffickers, illegal fishers, and other  environmental t ransgressors.  The  Philippines must also protect the nation’s  maritime interests in the Philippine Rise  and Batanes islands in the North, and the   ZamBaSulTa and Bongao islands in the  Southern Philippines.    T h e d i s p u t e o v e r t h e We s t  Philippine Sea (WPS) remains to be the  foremost securi ty chal lenge to the  Philippines’ sovereignty and territorial  integrity.  In July 2016, the Philippines  won a key victory when the United Nations  Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the Philippines  has exclusive sovereign rights over the  WPS (in the South China Sea) and that  China’s “nine-dash- line” claim is invalid.   Cognizant of the need to protect the  nat ion’s sovereignty and terr i torial  integrity, the Philippines will tread with  prudence on this complex and delicate  issue and will carefully calibrate its   [88]    diplomatic moves to avert the costly  consequences of any potential outbreak of  armed confrontations in the disputed sea  region.    The Government is looking to begin  the process of diplomatic negotiations with  neighboring countries to delimit and define  maritime borders and jurisdictions. In this  connect ion, the enactment of laws  pertaining to national defense, maritime  zones, archipelagic sea lanes air defense  identification zone, and all other matters  necessary for compliance with the  country’s commitments and obligations  under international law is urgent and  imperative.  Global and Regional Geopolitical Issues    In addition to the WPS issue, there  are other inter- and intra-state flashpoints  of immediate concern to the Philippines.   These include the intensifying conflicts in  the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)  region, persisting tension in the Korean  Peninsula, unresolved territorial disputes in  Northeast and Southeast-Asia, unsettled  Sabah issue, China-Taiwan/ China-Japan/  Japan-South Korea conflicts, and other  power rivalries where the hegemony of the  United States is contested and threatened.    United States  The United States remains as the   only superpower in the world today and  maintains its strategic presence around the  globe.  In the Asia Pacific region, the US,  during the Barack Obama administration,  sought to improve its military standing  t h rough the i n t roduc t ion o f more  sophisticated weapons systems, in the  improvement of basing facilities and in the   alliance and multilateral network it has set  up among i ts regional partners . A  continuing US security presence in the  Asia Pacific is a stabilizing force,  particularly with the growing complexity  of security challenges that confront the  region. The US remains as the sole defense  treaty ally of the Philippines.  The Mutual  Defense Treaty of 1951 between the  Philippines and the United States has been  strengthened under the Enhanced Defense  Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of 2015  granting the U.S. increased military  presence in the country for humanitarian  and maritime security operations. Under  the Donald Trump presidency, Washington  has articulated its vision for a “free and  open Indo-Pacific region. Hence, it is  expected that the new US administration  will remain closely engaged with regional  affairs.  The Philippines will work closely  with the US on a whole range of issues,  including shared security and economic  concerns.    China    With China’s rise as the   w o r l d ’s s e c o n d l a r g e s t e c o n o m y,  surpassing Japan, attention has focused  towards its direction due to its huge  population, large territory and vast natural  r e s o u r c e s , r a p i d i n d u s t r i a l a n d  technological breakthroughs, unparalleled  economic growth, and resultant military  aggressiveness in Asia.  The rivalry of  major powers, spawned largely by the rise  of China, is the most important long-term  strategic concern of the Asia-Pacific  region.  Indeed, Beijing’s rise generated  policy concerns not only among developed   [89]    countries such as the US, Japan and Korea,  but also among the ASEAN due to  significant trade and investments, as well  as territorial claims in the WPS and the  SCS.  China’s more active and aggressive  presence in the WPS is motivated by  growing need for food sources, increasing  demand for energy resources, and renewed  stirrings of nationalism.    ASEAN  While its member-states are not   without disagreements, ASEAN has  nonetheless consistently upheld the  principles of consultation and consensus as  i t s n o r m i n r e s o l v i n g i n t e r - s t a t e  misunderstanding and conflicts.  ASEAN is  building a Political-Security Community,  an Economic Community and a Socio- Cultural Community to promote greater  regional integration and to strengthen  ASEAN centrality in the context of the  wider Asia-Pacific region.  The ASEAN as  a regional bloc had pursued greater  regional cooperation on common problems  such as combating piracy, smuggling,  human trafficking, terrorism and other  transnational crimes.  ASEAN centrality is  important as it complements other efforts  in managing the impact of the geopolitical  rivalry among the great powers.    Japan  Japan remains as an economic   power house in Asia and the new security  challenges confronting it will induce Tokyo  to seek closer security relations with other  regional states. Their pacifist constitution  is a product of its experience in World War  II as well as the continuing security  umbrella the US has been providing it.    However, because of various security  chal lenges in the region including  territorial disputes in the Diaoyu/Senkaku  Islands, Japan sought to reorient its  security posture under its policy of a  “proactive contribution to peace,” which  calls for enhanced defensive capabilities as  well as strengthens security relations with  other states.  Japan has entered into a  strengthened strategic partnership with the  Philippines aimed at boosting political,  security and defense ties and cooperation  between the two countries.   Other Regional Players  Other regional powers such as   Australia, India, Republic of Korea, and  Russia are  crucial in the peace, stability,  and prosperity of the broader Indo-Asia- Pacific region.  Engagement with these  powers through var ious p la t forms,  p a r t i c u l a r l y t h r o u g h A S E A N - l e d  mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional  Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit  (EAS), among others, will further enhance  understanding and build confidence against  the backdrop of an evolving regional  security environment.  Such multilateral  initiatives will complement efforts to  enhance ASEAN cent ra l i ty.  The  Philippines will work closely with these  powers based on mutual respect and shared  interests through bilateral and multilateral  platforms.   [90]    Global Uncertainties and Proliferation  of Weapons of Mass Destruction     Increased Global Economic  Uncertainties   While the world has so far averted a  full-blown economic crisis, the present  trends show that the potential for global  economic recess ions has increased  significantly. The slowdown in major  economies of the world such as the US,  China and the European Union will have  an impact on virtually every country in the  world including the Philippines. Economic  downturns abroad could temper demand  for Philippine exports, slow down foreign  investments and hurt the overall business  climate in the country.     The Philippines has so far remained  resi l ient to these chal lenges, even  managing to remain as one of the fastest  growing economies in Asia over the past  several years. Much of this was due to the  country’s sound and stable economic  fundamentals as well as the overall fiscal  health of the national economy.  The  Government must stay vigilant and  proactive in the face of a volatile global  economy.   Global Security Issues and the                  Welfare of OFWs   C o n f l i c t s a b r o a d a n d o t h e r  emerging global security threats pose a  direct danger to overseas Filipino workers  (OFWs), who contribute significantly to  the national economy, accounting for most  of the country’s net factor income from  abroad (NFIA) through their remittances.   The Government must exert continuing  effort to promote and protect the rights and   welfare of our OFWs, particularly victims  of illegal recruitment, human trafficking,  ill-treatment and human rights violations,  and unfair labor practices, among others.     Global disruptions resulting from  armed conflicts, polit ical or social  instabilities, economic or financial crisis,  pandemics and other health emergencies or  natural or man-made disasters can bring  significant harm to our fellow Filipinos  abroad. The Government must extend all  possible assistance to distressed OFWs,  including their repatriation or evacuation  where necessary. The Government must  also maintain i ts engagement with  international organizations and other  international partners on the issue of  forced migration as well as other issues  affecting their rights.    Proliferation of Weapons of Mass  Destruction   Rapid technological advancements  and greater access to scientific knowledge  are changing the face of the world in  unimagined ways.  Scientif ic and  technological breakthroughs are creating  wealth and progress everywhere, but are  also spawning new and increasingly  dangerous triggers for global insecurity.   Among the most serious of these threats is  the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction (WMDs), which has come to  occupy center stage in international  politics. WMDs are classified into three  major types: nuclear weapons, chemical  warfare agents, and biological warfare  agents. Nine nations are currently in  possession of such WMDs -- China,  France, India, Israel, North Korea,   [91]    Pakistan, Russia, United Kingdom, and the  United States - and a number of states are  believed to possess chemical and/or  biological warfare agents (Source: SIPRI).   While the mass killing of people is  not a new characteristic of warfare, WMDs  pose an unprecedented risk in terms of  their potential for large-scale destruction  and the indiscriminate nature of their   effects.  Aside from the dangers posed by  existing stockpiles of WMD, there are  growing concerns that WMDs and related  technologies could spread to more states  and non-state terrorist networks.  The  Philippines will continue to strongly  support the global call for greater  international collaboration to control the  proliferation and use of WMDs.    OTHER STRATEGIC ISSUES AND CHALLENGES   Rising Threat of Cybercrime   T h e l a t e s t r e p o r t b y P r i c e   Waterhouse Coopers’ (PWC) Global  Economic Crime Survey revealed that  cybercrime is today’s fastest rising  economic crime.  Expounding on the  nature of cybercrime, Interpol said that  more and more criminals are exploiting the  speed, convenience and anonymity of the  Internet to commit a wide range of  criminal activities that know no borders,  either physical or virtual, cause serious  harm and pose very real threats to victims  worldwide. Credit card fraud, ATM theft,  call center scams, and other computer or  web-based forms of deception schemes  a n d i d e n t i t y t h e f t h a v e b e c o m e  increasingly rampant especially in Asia.   New and increasingly creative trends in  cybercrime are emerging all the time, with  estimated costs to the global economy  running to billions of dollars. Interpol  added that in the past, cybercrime was  committed mainly by individuals or small  groups, but today we are seeing highly  complex cybercriminal networks bring  together individuals from across the globe   in real time to commit crimes on an  unprecedented scale.   To meet these rapidly evolving  security challenges in cyberspace, the  Philippines must first and foremost  develop the nation’s cyber infrastructure  and cyber security.  Experts noted that one  of the most serious weaknesses of the  Phi l ipp ines i s the low number of  practicing cybersecurity professionals. The  State must enhance and expand its pool of  i n f o r m a t i o n a n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n  technology (ICT) experts, especially in the  law enforcement and security sectors, in  order to equip the government with the  necessary skills/knowhow to detect,  preempt and combat cyber-based crimes.   Collaborative efforts with the academe,  and the business sector, and the private  ICT community should be part of this  national campaign.     Climate Change   Scientific studies show that the   Philippines is highly vulnerable to the  negative effects of climate change.  In its  most recent assessment , the Inter- Governmental Panel for Climate Change   [92]    stressed that the rising global temperature  has already impacted on the climate  threshold of the earth.  For the Philippines,  the findings predicted that we will  expe r i ence ex t reme max imum and  minimum temperatures, more frequent  intense rains, and more disastrous tropical  cyclones (e.g. Typhoon Haiyan) with an  average of 22 typhoons per year.  The  possibility of more El Niño weather  episodes will also increase.  According to  a 2015 study funded by the US Agency for  International Development, every single  major city in the Philippines is expected to  face some form of water shortage by 2025.    Scholars of climate change believe  that change in climate variability increases  the risk of armed conflict in certain  circumstances, even if the strength of the  effects is uncertain.  Evidence suggests  that climatic events over a large range of  time and spatial scales contribute to the  likelihood of violence through multiple  pathways.  The effects of climate change  on conflict and insecurity have the  potential to become key risks because  factors such as poverty and economic  shocks that are associated with higher risk  of violent conflict are themselves sensitive  to climate change.  Given the enormous  impact of climate change especially on the  poor and vulnerable population, the United  Nations viewed climate change as a threat  multiplier or as an indirect pathway that  could exacerbate existing sources of  conflict and insecurity.  There are five  channels through which climate change  could affect security: (i) threat to the well- being of the most vulnerable communities;  (ii) impact to economic development ---   halting or significantly slowing-down  growth thereby worsening poverty and  increasing desperation; (iii) second-order  effect of unsuccessful adaptation in the  form of uncoordinated coping or survival  strategies of local population; (iv) threat  posed by climate change to the viability  and even survival of a number of  sovereign states; and (v) availability or  access to natural resource and the resultant  competit ion and possible territorial  disputes between countries.   Institutional Concerns    Other urgent concerns include   much-needed reforms in the core security  and judicial sectors with emphasis on the  f o l l o w i n g : m o d e r n i z i n g a n d  professionalizing the armed services;  s t reng then ing the jud ic ia l sys tem;  strengthening legislative oversight on  security agencies; and improving the  na t iona l s ecu r i t y and in t e l l i gence  community.  Renewed focus should be  given to the following key governance  issues:  stamping out corruption and  p rofess iona l i z ing the bureaucracy ;  removing inst i tut ional obstacles to  academic and scientific research and  deve lopmen t ; f ac i l i t a t i ng a more - responsive procurement system; providing  a more-realistic and mission-supportive  government auditing rules and regulations;  and enhancing the Government’s ability to  quickly deliver basic services.

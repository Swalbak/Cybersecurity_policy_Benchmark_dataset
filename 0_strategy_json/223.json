(ii) From a domestic perspective, particularly with respect to  experiences and concerns expressed by Maltese participants in annual Euro Barometer surveys specialising in cyber security  Malta’s current scenario in particular aspects of cyber security (iii) From a stakeholder perspective, as it is understood that apart from technology, cyber security impacts upon all of country’s political, legal, economic and social well being. Hence, the document also identifies the strategy’s stakeholders with their corresponding interest. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 9 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Part Two The Global Cyber Threat Scenario NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 10 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 2 What is meant by a Cyber threat A cyber threat is defined as: The possibility of a malicious attempt to inflict damage or disruption within cyber space, through cyber attacks. It can be conducted, mainly through automated means, individually or corporately. A key characteristic of a cyber threat is its asymmetric nature. Thus, a cyber attack may be conducted:  Anywhere, as long as there is digital interconnectedness  In one vulnerable area, leading to potential attack into more well protected systems  Instantaneously, leaving no time for an appropriate response to be mounted  With very minimal traceability or detection, thus making it hard to locate response by the defence. The following sections identify a number of cyber threats along with their perpetrators. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 11 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 3 Cyber Threats and their Agents The findings shown in this Section are based mainly upon the Threat Landscape drawn by ENISA for the year 20141. 3.1 THE CYBER THREATS Table 1 identifies the top 15 threats, menacing cyber space by end 2014, ten of which are noted to be on the increase. Top threat Observed current trend Malicious code  Web-based attacks  Web application/injection attacks  Botnets  Denial of service  Spam  Phishing  Exploit kits  Data breaches  Physical damage / theft/ loss  Insider threat  Information leakage  Identity theft/ fraud  Cyber espionage  Ransomware / Rogueware / Scareware  Table 1 – Top Cyber threats for 2014 An explanation for each of the cyber threat identified is given below. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 12 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Malicious code Over 50% of malware is undetected by antivirus solutions due to its dynamics, complexity, sophistication and stealthiness. Malware detections are also noted to be predominant in open environments, mainly academia and education (at 40%), where access to a variety of users, who do not necessarily maintain robust end-point security, is high. Web-based attacks The threat is especially predominant in web browsers and is potentially enabled by malicious URLs. Web application attacks/ Injection attacks The threat consists mainly of feeding vulnerable servers and/or mobile applications with malicious inputs or unexpected sequence of events so as to alter site content, breach information or inject malicious code. Cloud computing as well as mobile applications and unsupported Web software are seen as most likely victims of such a threat. Botnet A serious cyber threat, accounting for 34% of attacks and ranking first in attack statistics. Although the number of botnet-infected computers has decreased from 3.5 million to 2.3 million during 2014, mainly due to successful law enforcement activity, its decline cannot be taken for granted due to a noted increase in sophistication and stealthiness in the technology. Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks A threat that is evolving in sophistication, stealthiness and unpredictability. In most cases, DDOS attacks are noted to be launched in combination with other attacks as a means of distraction. The main objectives of collateral attacks assessed are: virus and malware installation/activation, data theft, loss of intellectual propertyand financial theft. Spam Although it has decreased due to succesful spam blocking practices and take downs of large spam bots, it is still considered as serious mainly due to often succesful attempts by spammers to create user confidence in their messages through social media and mobile devices. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 13 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Phishing Technical deception, through spoofed emails and counterfeit Websites as well as social engineering significantly contribute to phishing. Social networking sites as well as the proliferation of new technologies having vulnerabilities and weak security controls are also likely to enable phishing, leading to information theft or leakage. End-user behaviour and awareness may help in defending against phishing. Exploit kits They are increasingly complex and sophsticated automated tools applied by a number of threat agents that mainly detect vulnerabilities at user end-devices so as to download and manage malicious content. It is noted that organisations deploying vulnerability management, based upon mature and formal methods, are less likely to be infected from exploit kits. Data breaches It is a result of successful cyber-attacks or erroneous unintentional user activities, all leading to disclosure of confidential information. Due to their impact and their long term consequences, data breaches are among the most thoroughly managed and investigated cyber incidents. Security preparedness for new technologies, such as for mobile and cloud computing, is still in its early maturity phases, with challenges arising with respect to data ownership in off-premises environments. However it also needs to be kept in view that over 50% of data breaches are attributed to a lax regard to security controls and procedures by end-users. Physical damage, theft and loss Various cyber-security incidents, mainly data breaches and identity theft, may be a result of such a threat. Theft and loss of end user ICT devices rank high in related statistics. Insider threat Top most information types that have been breached by organisation insiders are intellectual property, customer data and financial records, whilst the top five activities of insider misuse assessed include privilege abuse, non-approved hardware, bribery and email misuse and data mishandling. Such an attack is possible due to the inherent ability to bypass existing security controls through available access rights, insider knowledge of existing protection and the awareness of an NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 14 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document organisation’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It could also be due to user error; potentially resulting from user negligence 2or lack of employee security training3. Information leakage It relates to a set of threats that emerge due to unintentional or maliciously triggered exposure of sensitive data, mainly through technical or organisational weaknesses to an unauthorised party. Software application vulnerabilities resulting in areas such as their coding or implementation are also cited as sources for informatin leakage. Social media is also reported as a major channel for information leakage that can be used in other attacks. Proper security controls are also necessary to ensure protection of data in transit or at rest on mobile and cloud computing technology. Identity theft, fraud and cyber espionage Identity theft is a cyber threat that aims at collecting personal identifying information (PII) which includes credentials, personal profiling, details of financial identification/authentication methods, credit card information, various access codes, technical identification data, etc. An increase in identity theft/fraud incidents has led to consumer mistrust in using digital means to perform financial transactions.Increased interoperability within the consumer market may increase the likelihood of such threat, particularly if one vulnerable application falls victim to it.Emerging yet security - immature technologies, as well as older technologies having poor security controls are envisaged as likely targets for identity theft. Sophisticated methods are increasingly being used to target both large organisations as well as small to medium sized enterprises. Ransomware, rogueware and scareware Although this threat belongs to the family of malware, it may still be considered on its own merits, due to recently introduced features which enable it to infiltrate mobile devices. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 15 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 3.2 THE CYBER THREAT AGENTS This section attributes cyber threats to an identified number of threat agents. Table 2 identifies the various threat agents along with the likely key motive for their activity. Threat Agent Motive Cyber criminal Profit oriented - in criminal activities Online social hacker Criminal Hactivist Socially motivated citizens Nation state Espionage Corporation Espionage Employee (current, former) Revenge, sabotage, extortion or profit Cyber fighter Nationally motivated citizens Cyber terrorist Ideological Script kiddy Thrilled about past achievements, considered outrageous/skills of tech saavy individuals Table 2 – Threat Agents The level of sophistication in terms of expertise and technology capability for each of the identified threat agents can also be noted by the Figure below. Technology Capability Low High Expertise Low High Figure 1- The level of sophistication of each threat agent Cyber Criminal Hacktivist Nation-State Corporation Cyber fighter Cyber terrorist On-line Social Hacker Employee NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 16 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Table 3 highlights the most likely threat agent for each of the top cyber threats. It indicates a widespread involvement of cyber criminals, followed by hactivists and nation-states4 in such forms of activities. Identity thefts or frauds, information leakages and phishing are the predominant threats originating from any of the threat agents identified. Threat Agents Cyber criminal On-line social hacker Hacktivist Nation state Corporation Employee Cyber fighter Cyber terrorist Script kiddy Top threats Identity theft fraud Information leakage Phishing Data breaches Malicious code Web-based attacks Web application / injection attacks Exploit kits Physical damage /theft/ loss of data Insider threat Denial of Service Cyber espionage Spam Botnets Ransomware / rogueware / scareware Table 3 –The likely threat agent for each cyber threat The cyber agent scenario is however not complete without also identifying the friendly cyber agents – the agents who positively contribute to a safe and secure cyber space – who are listed in Table 4. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 17 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Cyber Agent Motive/ Sector Security Agent National Security Ethical Hacker Market Law enforcement Agent Law enforcement Researcher Research community Cyber soldier Military Table 4 – The friendly cyber agents Emerging technologies, such as smart environments5, may create possibilities for malicious activities, and thus the establishment of new cyber threat agents who may target smaller user communities. Such malicious activity may even cost human lives and should thus not be discounted for consideration particularly in the near future. The next Section amplifies further on this area of cyber security concern. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 18 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 4 The emerging threat landscape The following is a list of emerging technology areas whereby their level of maturity in cyber security and their subsequent emerging threat are outlined for consideration. 4.1 THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS Cyber Physical Systems Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are seamlessly integrated engineered systems which interact with computing equipment so as to control, manage and optimise physical processes in a number of applications6. Such systems are expected to undergo a high degree of innovation and hence they pose an emerging issue. Mobile Computing The increasing role of mobile devices in next generation ICT architectures coupled with their contribution towards technology convergence make them a key asset both for their users as well as for operators of related application services. Hence mobile devices are increasingly being targeted by threat agents. The secure development of mobile applications is also another area in its very early stages of maturity. The reuse of code libraries and binary code protection are two areas that also expected to be further developed, so as to minimize cyber threats such as data leakage and identity theft. Cloud Computing Cloud computing is another area of concern to users and security experts. Innovative usage models, attack scenarios and security control implementations for cloud computing are envisaged to fall under increased focus within the realm of cyber security in the future. Trust infrastructure Trust infrastructure and authentication infrastructure, are two vital components for cyber security and for which a heightened level of attack has been reported by ENISA in 2014. Such attacks are NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 19 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document however seen as an opportunity for dynamic changes, introduction of good practice and potentially innovations within the area. Big Data Big data is essentially a valuable asset and is therefore targeted by cyber threat agents. It also turns out to be a very powerful tool for security professionals, given that it significantly contributes to building intelligence about threats and incident management. Internet of Things/ Interconnected devices/ smart environments Interconnected devices from areas such as smart home, smart vehicle exchange information that may be of a highly sensitive nature. Home automation through the Internet of Things concept may potentially lead to cyber cases of harassment, abuse, sabotage and bullying7. Network virtualisation (NV) and Software defined networks (SDN) Network virtualisation builds virtual networks whilst software defined networks (SDN) perform changes to virtual networks according to user needs. Although both technologies pose opportunities towards quality of service, performance and efficient network management, yet, existing standards and released technology are still in the very early stages of adoption and maturity. Hence the need for more detailed security assessments for such technology is evidently necessary. 4.2 THE CORRESPONDING EMERGING THREATS Table 5 lists out the corresponding likely cyber threats for each of the emerging technologies identified. Except for two cyber threats which are noted as stable within the Trust infrastructure area, most threats are noted to be on the increase during 2014. It can also be noted that the cyber threats featuring across all of the six emerging technologies, albeit at varying intensity, include:  Malicious code or malware  Phishing  Web application or injection attacks  Identity theft or fraud  Information leakage  Physical damage or theft or loss of data NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 20 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Threat Trend   Emerging Technology areas Cyber Physical Systems Malicious Code Web based attack Spam Phishing Physical damage/theft/loss Insider threat Web application attacks Information leakage Mobile Computing Malicious Code Physical damage/theft/loss Phishing Web application attacks Web based attack Information leakage Identity theft Exploit kits Ransomware/rogueware/scareware Cloud Computing Malicious Code Web based attack Web application attacks Botnets Denial of Service Insider threat Data Breach Cyber espionage Identity theft Information leakage Trust Infrastructure Phishing Malicious Code Web application attacks Information leakage Identity theft Physical damage/theft/loss Exploit kits Cyber espionage Big Data Data Breaches Information leakage Identity theft / fraud Insider threat Cyber espionage Web based attack Physical damage/theft/loss Phishing Internet of Things / Interconnected devices / Smart environments Malicious Code Web based attack Phishing Exploit kits Information leakage Insider threat Web application attacks Physical theft/damage/loss Identity theft Denial of Service Network Virtualisation and Software defined Networks Denial of Service Malicious Code Web application attacks Phishing Exploit kits Insider threat Physical theft/damage/loss Identity theft Table 5 – Cyber threats from emerging technology Web based attack Denial of Service NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 21 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 5 Insights on Cyber Security 5.1 CYBER SECURITY IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS The Cyber security scenario is a highly dynamic and complex one. Sophistication of cyber threats continues increasing. Trust infrastructures face massive stress as their basic security constituents have been challenged. Other emerging technologies such as big data, social media, mobile computing and interconnected devices if not properly applied and/or protected constitute a perfect knowledge base for cyber criminals, allowing for covert, well planned, human and/or technical means of targeted attacks. Additionally, related standards and technology applied may still be in the very early stages of adoption and maturity , hence increasing the vulnerability risks. Furthermore, the unknown number of breaches and security incidents is a major concern for cyber security experts and law enforcement officials, calling for the need of breach notification at various business areas/sectors, possibly through regulation. Governments are challenged to follow up on related developments with regulation and legislation; seeking to establish a balance between what is technically possible and what is legally transparent in the process. New, sophisticated attacks call for development of new defences, such as through new detection techniques and new security controls. In effect, such requirements for innovation call for research and development efforts and investments involving Government, business as well as the academia. 5.2 CYBER CRIMINALITY IS EXTENSIVE, COMPLEX AND ADVANCED Cyber criminals are increasingly more effective in targeting their attacks. They are being more successful in exploitation of vulnerabilities (human and technical) through effective application of malicious tools and attack methods. Breached or leaked data is considered as one of the key means to achieve this goal. New attack techniques and practices also allow for lack of detection and traceability of the perpetrator. The nature and efficacy of the cyber crime market does not exclude having specialised roles such as administrators, specialists in varous areas of cyber crime, intermediaries, brokers and vendors. Interactions of cyber criminals with cyber terrorists is not excluded either. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 22 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 5.3 CYBER THREATS MAY ALSO ARISE FROM BUSINESS PARTNERS The need for organisations to take heed of insider threats through their employees is critical. However consideration also needs to be taken of business partners. It is reported that financial institutions are increasingly concerned about their ability to combat threats that can arise from sharing networks and data with business partners, with 41% of respondents stating that they detected incidents perpetrated by third parties with trusted access. A number of organisations within healthcare and the utilities industry also admit to forging strategic business relationships without consideration to robust due diligence, regulatory policies or deployment of monitoring and detection controls, on third parties with whom they share sensitive information8. 5.4 NO INDUSTRY CAN DO WITHOUT A ROBUST CYBER SECURITY PROGRAM The public sector is reported to be the primary target of cyber attacks, accounting over 75% of more than 63,400 incidents reported worldwide during 20149. However, one cannot discount the vulnerability of any other organisation – public sector or otherwise – from any cyber attack. The Healthcare industry payers and providers report that information security incidents increased by 60% in 2014, and that costs attributed to such incidents increased to 282%10. For example, identity theft and fraud is particularly noted within the healthcare industry, with an estimate of around two million US citzens envisaged to spend over $12 billion as a result of such an incident alone. Cyber attacks against power and utilities organisations have also transitioned from speculative to indisputable 11. Article 2.3 of the European Commission’s European Energy Security Strategy, in particular, states that: “The EU has started to develop a policy to address the physical protection of critical infrastructure (against threats, hazards) which includes energy infrastructure. Increasing attention should be given to IT security”12. Within the Finance sector, its regulators are increasingly expecting the effective implementation of robust security programs from its operators. Ultimately, the crux of it all is not simply having a cyber security program, but that its implementation does not lag behind. ENISA specifically reports in 2014, that falling behind in cyber security continues to be the number one reason for security incidents such as data breaches. 5.5 A RISK-BASED GOVERNANCE MODEL TO CYBER SECURITY IS NEEDED As highlighted earlier, the uses of technologies - and in particular, emerging ones - present opportunities and pose risks too. Hence the need for thorough risk assessments, prior to their deployment is necessary. Possibly with the aid of widely accepted frameworks, consideration needs to be given to closely link technologies, processes and personnel skills with enterprise risk management NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 23 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document within an organisation. The purchase of cyber insurance to help mitigate financial losses of cyber- attacks13 may also contribute further towards a healthy risk based approach. 5.6 RESPONSIBILITY, COMMITMENT AND ACTIVE SUPPORT FROM TOP MANAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR CYBER SECURITY Cyber security is indeed a responsibility of each and every employee within an organisation. However, as in any other initiative within an organisation this is likely to falter, potentially leading to earlier reported negligence unless it is not continuously and actively communicated and supported by top management. Ongoing cyber security training and awareness programmes may help in this regard. 5.7 EFFECTIVE CYBER SECURITY DEMANDS THAT NO ORGANISATION SHOULD OPERATE IN ISOLATION Threat analyses and achieved results, performed by various organisations, are rather complex. The challenge faced may be eased by effective sharing of information on threat intelligence and response tactics. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 24 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Part Three Domestic cyber security concerns and preparedness NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 25 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 6 An Outline of European-wide Concerns 6.1 CYBERCRIME The Euro barometer Survey specialising on cyber security for 2014 specifically states that “85% of Internet users across the EU agree that the risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime is increasing”. The levels of concern about each specific type of cybercrime14 are also considerably higher than in 201315. Compounded to such concern, is a high level of agreement among European citizens that they still do not feel well informed about cyber crime risks. \"Cybercrime undermines consumer confidence in the use of Internet, hampering both our digital economy and our online lives. Our priority is to create a safer Internet for all users by preventing and combating cybercrime in all its forms, to enable users to reap the full benefits of the digital internal market and to exercise their fundamental rights online ” Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship. 6.2 NATION-STATE ACTORS Of equal concern is a noted increased ‘alarm’ over nation state actors16 as evidenced by cyber- security simulation exercises being conducted. The European Network Security Agency (ENISA) conducts EU-wide ‘simulation exercises’ to prepare for better cooperation against the threat of critical systems from hostile cyber agents17 NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 26 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 7 Experiences and concerns of the Maltese citizen A number of indicative traits or concerns on cyber security issues among Maltese citizens have been extracted from Special Euro barometer public opinion surveys on cyber security conducted across the European Union for years 201218, 201319 and 201420 for particular consideration. Table 6 presents a number of incidents reported by the Survey’s Maltese respondents for 2014 with an indicative trend from the previous year based upon the percentage of responses.Table 7 lists a number of concerns expressed by the Maltese respondents with respect to various aspects of cyber security. A detailed explanation and analyses for each of the factors listed is given further below. Experiences Trend (2014) Having hindered access to online services due to cyber attacks  Avoid disclosing personal information on-line  Account hacked  Accidentally encountered material of racial hatred etc.  Reported cyber related incidents to Police  Identity theft  Received fraudulent emails  Online banking fraud  Online fraud (e.g. unfulfilled online purchases, false advertisements) (higher relative to EU) Table 6 – Indicative trend of cyber incidents among Maltese (2014) Legend  Increasing  Decreasing ▬ Stable NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 27 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Concerns Trend (2014) Being victims of cybercime  Being victims of identity theft  Being victims of account hacking  Not having access to online services  Receiving fraudulent emails  Bank card or online backing fraud  Security of online payments for banking or purchasing activities  Use of Internet for activities like online banking or purchasing  Personal information not kept secure by public authorities  Discovering malicious software  Encountering offensive material online  Personal information not kept secure on Websites  Table 7 – Indicative trend of cyber related concerns among Maltese (2014) Legend  Increasing  Decreasing ▬ Stable 7.1 CYBERCRIME Similar to the overall EU scenario, there is an increasing level of proportion of Maltese respondents who express their strong concern of becoming a victim of cybercrime - from 69% in 2013 to 85% in 2014. The following are a number of cybercrime variants encountered or perceived to occur within the Maltese context. 7.2 ACCESS TO ONLINE SERVICES The overall confidence to use the Internet for online services (e.g. banking, public services) has decreased from 74% in 2012 to 73% to 2013 across the EU. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 28 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document A proportional increase is noted in 2014 in the level of concern expressed by EU respondents in having access to online services, through the Internet, as a result of cyber attacks. In Malta’s case, the findings indicate an increase from 44% in 2013 to 61% in 2014. This could be potentially attributed to an increase in the proportion of the Maltese respondents, from 7% in 2013 to 10% in 2014 who complain of related incidents. 7.3 ONLINE FRAUD Overall, almost all respondents within the EU member states attribute the use of Internet to access e- mail. The Maltese respondents who receive fraudulent emails have decreased significantly from 53% in 2012 to 39% in 2013 and have remained so (39%) in 2014. However, the percentage of those who are concerned of receiving fraudulent emails has increased from 55% in 2013 to 58% in 2014. Furthermore, Malta ranks high within the EU in the proportion of respondents (16%) who claim on-line fraud in terms of unfulfilled purchase of goods, counterfeit goods, or falsely advertised products; although the percentage has remained locally stable since 2013. The level of concern has however sharply increased in proportion from 55% in 2013 to 67% in 2014. 7.4 ONLINE BANKING FRAUD Concern on bank card or online banking fraud appears to be on the rise across the EU in 2014, relative to 2013. In the case of Malta, the findings indicate an increase in level of concern from 62% to 71%. Such proportion of concern is considered relatively high in Malta compared to the rest of Europe in 2013 and tends to remain so, albeit to a lesser extent, in 2014. On the other hand, although there is a 1% increase in proportion of EU respondents who claim such fraud during 2014, there is a corresponding decline within the Maltese case - from 6% (2013) to 5%. 7.5 SECURITY OF ONLINE PAYMENTS During 2014, there again appears to be a rise in concern amongst the Maltese respondents (27%) on the security of online payments for banking or purchasing activities. This follows a previous decline from 29% in 2012 to 24% in 2013. 7.6 PERSONAL ONLINE DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY Over a three year period, there also appears to be a variation in the trend of Maltese respondents who seek to avoid disclosing personal information online. It has significantly declined from 95% in 2012 to 80% in 2013, but has almost returned to the original level, increasing to 93% in 2014.This may similarly reflect an increase in 2014, in stated concerns with respect to the NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 29 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document  Use of the Internet for activities like online banking and online purchases – an increase of 12%. This percentage indicates an increase of 12% from 2013. Malta also registers the highest proportion of respondents registering such concern across the EU, at 34%.  Personal information not kept secure by public authorities – with proportion of respondents varying from 65% in 2012 down to 62% in 2013 and increasing again by 4% (66%) in 2014. On a positive note however, a declining trend is noted in the level of concern regrding online personal information not being secured by websites – from 74% in 2012 to 71% in 2013 and declining further to 69% in 2014. 7.7 IDENTITY THEFT The proportion of Maltese respondents who have experienced identity theft has declined from 11% to 5% between 2013 and 201421. However, this does not dispel the increasing level of concern of experiencing such an incident as stated across the EU, including Malta – from 59% in 2013 to 74% in 2014. 7.8 ACCOUNT HACKING During 2014, a significant proportion of the Maltese respondents (71%) relative to the EU average (60%) express their concern of having their social media or email account hacked. In addition, there is also an increase in proportion of Maltese respondents who claim that their social media or email account has been hacked – from 12% in 2013 to 16% in 2014. 7.9 MALICIOUS SOFTWARE In 2014, a significantly high proportion of Maltese respondents (76%) have also stated concern of discovering malicious software on their ICT devices. 40% of Maltese respondents have also reported discovering malicious software. The survey also refers to a direct correlation between those who installed anti-virus software and those who discovered malicious software. It is noted that during the same period, the proportion of Maltese respondents who claim to have installed anti-virus software stands at around 40%, increasing to 60% by end 2014. 7.10 OFFENSIVE MATERIAL Across the EU, respondents are more likely to state that they have encountered material which promotes racial hatred or religious extremism online; with an increase of 11% from 2013. Indeed, in the case of Malta, the level of related concern has increased from 37% in 2013 to 50% in 2014. A NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 30 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document sharp increase, in the case of Malta is noted in the percentage of those who accidentally encountered such material – from 12% in 2013 to 25% in 2014. Similarly, an increase of 9% is noted between 2013 and 2014 in the number of Maltese respondents who are concerned with accidentally encountering child pornography online. 7.11 ON-LINE HARASSMENT In 2013, when compared to the highest EU level of 9%, only 4% of Maltese respondents report that they have been personal victims of on-line harassment. Additionally, only 1% of the Maltese respondents claim to have child victims of on-line harassment, compared to the EU’s highest proportion of 5%. During the same period, it is noted that on-line harassment is consistent among EU states and is higher among:  Frequent internet users  Respondents aged 15-24 years  Multiple (rather than single) households with children Notably, in 2014, Malta ranks amongst the top:  four EU countries where 52% of respondents take steps to protect children when they are online  five EU countries where 31% of respondents monitor children’s Internet usage Specifically, at 23%Malta rates highest amongst the EU respondents who state that they adjust security settings for children. 7.12 FEELING INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS OF CYBERCRIME On a more positive trend, the percentage of Maltese internet users who feel well informed about the risks of cybercrime has increased from 45% in 2013 to 54% in 2014. This similarly reflects an EU trend, with a decrease from 59% to 53% during 2012 -2014 among those who do not feel well informed about the risks of cybercrime. This may potentially explain one behavioural trait reported in the Euro barometer 2014 survey whereby a significant proportion of the Maltese respondents, relative to their EU counterparts (48%) claim that they are most likely to visit only known Websites. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 31 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Significantly encouraging is that despite the overall cyber security concerns, it appears that a fewer proportion of Maltese respondents (6%), compared to European ones, deem it likely not to buy goods or services online. 7.13 REPORTING CYBERCRIME On an EU –wide perspective (including Malta), the Police are most frequently contacted in case of cyber crime such as for identity theft, online banking fraud, child pornography. This indicates the key role that the Police force is perceived to play within the cyber crime area. However the survey findings also suggest that a higher level of knowledge on cybercrime leads to a preference to contact website or vendor organisations rather than the police. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 32 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 8 Current domestic scenario in cyber security At this stage, current domestic on cyber security aspects in Malta has been largely noted from on-line publicly available sources as follows: 8.1 DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE As an EU Member State, Malta is expected to align itself to Europe 2020, the 10-year strategy proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the European Union through smart, sustainable, inclusive growth\" with greater coordination of national and European policy. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), adopted by the European Commission in May 2010, is one of the Strategy’s seven flagship initiatives that aim to increasingly facilitate the deployment of high-speed internet and reap the benefits of a digital single market for households and firms. Along with other related Council of the European Union Conclusions, the DAE highlights a shared understanding that security and trust are the necessary prerequisites for the wider uptake of ICT. The Implementation of the DAE, focuses, among others, on four action items pertaining to Trust and Security, namely:  Action 38 – Member States to establish pan-European Computer Emergency Response teams  Action 39 – Member states to carry out cyber attack simulations  Action 40 – Member States to implement harmful content alert hotlines  Action 41 – Member States to set up national alert platforms Reference to the latest status for the action items can be found at 8.2 ITU REPORT – CYBER WELLNESS PROFILE Malta is a member of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)-the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies. The ITU has embarked the Global Cyber security Agenda (GCA); a framework for international cooperation aimed at enhancing confidence and security in the information society. The CGA is based upon five domains for a country’s cyber security development, namely Legal Measures, Technical Measures, Organisation Measures, Capacity Building and Cooperation. Information on Child Online NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 33 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Protection, a key ITU initiative, is also covered. A Cyber Wellness profile has been established by the ITU for each its member states, as a means to assess their level of cyber security development.

Need awareness. Various representations of civil society, such as those for children, youths, elderly and pensioners, families, workers, education, NGOs, political parties. Table 8 – Indication of Stakeholders for Malta Cyber Security Strategy Within the local context, it is likely that the Public sector and regulated industries, such as those in banking and finance, electronic (mobile) telephony, ISPs are key leaders in cyber security; given that they:  Use the Web and mobile channels extensively for their services  Handle sensitive data  May already be expected, as critical infrastructure owners / operators to undertake related security measures  May likely have more human and financial resource capacity and capability to mount robust cyber security measures A brief review of some local indicators, such as the highest percentage contribution to GDP in 201325, further suggests that the following sectors need to take particular active consideration of cyber security in Malta: NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 37 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document  Services (76.4% contribution), which apart from Finance notably includes Gaming, Education, Real-estate services, ,Hospitality and Tourism, Transport and storage, Professional, Scientific and Technical activities, ICT activities  Industry (22.2% contribution)  Agriculture (1.4% contribution) Additionally, as also indicated within the Table, consideration also needs to be made of cyber security related updates to regulation and legislation, international cooperation, capacity building, education and awareness. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 38 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document Part Five Conclusion NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT 39 Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document 10 Concluding Note Such findings, provide various indications of areas where further attention needs to be further expended with respect to cyber-security. Above all, they clearly show that cyber security cannot be treated as a monolith. Cyber threats are not all the same and resulting impacts are not to the detriment to technology only, but to organisations,processes and ultimately to the end-user. Ultimately it is not only the public sector alone that is impacted upon. Given today’s digital interconnectedness between Government, the private sector and civil society, it is thus necessary for a continuous and well planned concerted effort so as to ensure updated security in place so as to minimise cyber threats as much as possible.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   8  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         1 Purpose and Scope   This document aims to serve as background information and rationale for the strategic approach   proposed within the Green Paper: National Cyber Security Strategy   It draws upon various published sources to assess cyber security:   (i) from a global and a European Union perspective, as it is understood that the   interconnectedness in cyberspace renders any challenge in cyber security as potentially   impacting any country applying Information and Communications Technology, including   Malta.   (ii) From a domestic perspective, particularly with respect to     experiences and concerns expressed by Maltese participants in annual Euro   Barometer surveys specialising in cyber security    Malta’s current scenario in particular aspects of cyber security   (iii) From a stakeholder perspective, as it is understood that apart from technology, cyber   security impacts upon all of country’s political, legal, economic and social well being.   Hence, the document also identifies the strategy’s stakeholders with their corresponding   interest.         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   9  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document                     Part Two   The Global Cyber Threat Scenario         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   10  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         2 What is meant by a Cyber threat   A cyber threat is defined as:   The possibility of a malicious attempt to inflict damage or disruption within cyber   space, through cyber attacks.   It can be conducted, mainly through automated means, individually or corporately. A key   characteristic of a cyber threat is its asymmetric nature. Thus, a cyber attack may be conducted:    Anywhere, as long as there is digital interconnectedness    In one vulnerable area, leading to potential attack into more well protected systems    Instantaneously, leaving no time for an appropriate response to be mounted    With very minimal traceability or detection, thus making it hard to locate response by the   defence.   The following sections identify a number of cyber threats along with their perpetrators.          NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   11  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         3 Cyber Threats and their Agents   The findings shown in this Section are based mainly upon the Threat Landscape drawn by ENISA for   the year 20141.   3.1 THE CYBER THREATS   Table 1 identifies the top 15 threats, menacing cyber space by end 2014, ten of which are noted to be   on the increase.   Top threat  Observed current trend   Malicious code    Web-based attacks    Web application/injection attacks    Botnets    Denial of service    Spam    Phishing    Exploit kits    Data breaches    Physical damage / theft/ loss    Insider threat    Information leakage    Identity theft/ fraud    Cyber espionage    Ransomware / Rogueware / Scareware    Table 1 – Top Cyber threats for 2014    An explanation for each of the cyber threat identified is given below.     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   12  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      Malicious code   Over 50% of malware is undetected by antivirus solutions due to its dynamics, complexity,   sophistication and stealthiness. Malware detections are also noted to be predominant in open   environments, mainly academia and education (at 40%), where access to a variety of users, who do   not necessarily maintain robust end-point security, is high.    Web-based attacks   The threat is especially predominant in web browsers and is potentially enabled by malicious URLs.   Web application attacks/ Injection attacks   The threat consists mainly of feeding vulnerable servers and/or mobile applications with malicious   inputs or unexpected sequence of events so as to alter site content, breach information or inject   malicious code. Cloud computing as well as mobile applications and unsupported Web software are   seen as most likely victims of such a threat.   Botnet   A serious cyber threat, accounting for 34% of attacks and ranking first in attack statistics. Although   the number of botnet-infected computers has decreased from 3.5 million to 2.3 million during 2014,   mainly due to successful law enforcement activity, its decline cannot be taken for granted due to a   noted increase in sophistication and stealthiness in the technology.     Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks   A threat that is evolving in sophistication, stealthiness and unpredictability. In most cases, DDOS   attacks are noted to be launched in combination with other attacks as a means of distraction. The   main objectives of collateral attacks assessed are: virus and malware installation/activation, data   theft, loss of intellectual propertyand financial theft.   Spam   Although it has decreased  due to succesful spam blocking practices and take downs of large spam   bots, it is still considered as serious mainly due to often succesful attempts by spammers to create   user confidence in their messages through social media and mobile devices.      NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   13  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      Phishing   Technical deception, through spoofed emails and counterfeit Websites as well as social engineering    significantly contribute to phishing. Social networking sites as well as the proliferation of new   technologies having vulnerabilities and weak security controls are also likely to enable phishing,   leading to information theft or leakage. End-user behaviour and awareness may help in defending   against phishing.   Exploit kits   They are increasingly complex and sophsticated automated tools applied by a number of threat agents   that mainly detect vulnerabilities at user end-devices so as to download and manage malicious   content.  It is noted that organisations deploying vulnerability management, based upon mature and   formal  methods, are less likely to be infected from exploit kits.   Data breaches    It is a result of successful cyber-attacks or erroneous unintentional user activities, all leading to   disclosure of confidential information. Due to their impact and their long term consequences, data   breaches are among the most thoroughly managed and investigated cyber incidents. Security   preparedness for new technologies, such as for mobile and cloud computing, is still in its early   maturity phases, with challenges arising with respect to data ownership in off-premises   environments. However it also needs to be kept in view that over 50% of data breaches are attributed   to a lax regard to security controls and procedures by end-users.   Physical damage, theft and loss   Various cyber-security incidents, mainly data breaches and identity theft, may be a result of such a   threat. Theft and loss of end user ICT devices  rank  high in related statistics.    Insider threat   Top most information types that have been breached by organisation insiders are intellectual   property, customer data and financial records, whilst the top five activities of insider misuse   assessed include privilege abuse, non-approved hardware, bribery and email misuse and data   mishandling. Such an attack is possible due to the inherent ability to bypass existing security controls   through available access rights, insider knowledge of existing protection and the awareness of an     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   14  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      organisation’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It could also be due to user error; potentially resulting   from user negligence 2or lack of employee security training3.    Information leakage   It relates to a set of threats that emerge due to unintentional or maliciously triggered exposure of   sensitive data, mainly through technical or organisational weaknesses to an unauthorised party.   Software application vulnerabilities resulting in areas such as their coding or implementation are also   cited as sources for informatin leakage. Social media is also reported as a major channel for   information leakage that can be used in other attacks. Proper security controls are also necessary to   ensure protection of data in transit or at rest on mobile and cloud computing technology.   Identity theft, fraud and cyber espionage   Identity theft is a cyber threat that aims at collecting personal identifying information (PII) which    includes credentials, personal profiling, details of financial identification/authentication methods,   credit card information, various access codes, technical identification data, etc. An increase in   identity theft/fraud incidents has led to consumer mistrust in using digital means to perform financial   transactions.Increased interoperability within the consumer market may increase the likelihood of   such threat, particularly if one vulnerable application falls victim to it.Emerging yet security -  immature technologies, as well as older technologies having poor security controls are envisaged as   likely targets for identity theft. Sophisticated methods are increasingly being used to target both   large organisations as well as small to medium sized enterprises.   Ransomware, rogueware and scareware   Although this threat belongs to the family of malware, it may still be considered on its own merits, due   to recently introduced features which enable it to infiltrate mobile devices.

It indicates a   widespread involvement of cyber criminals, followed by hactivists and nation-states4 in such forms of   activities. Identity thefts or frauds, information leakages and phishing are the predominant  threats   originating from any of the threat agents identified.

Such malicious activity may even cost human lives and should thus not be discounted for   consideration particularly in the near future. The next Section amplifies further on this area of cyber   security concern.         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   18  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         4 The emerging threat landscape   The following is a list of emerging technology areas whereby their level of maturity in cyber security   and their subsequent emerging threat are outlined for consideration.    4.1 THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS   Cyber Physical Systems   Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are seamlessly integrated engineered systems which interact with   computing equipment so as to control, manage and optimise physical processes in a number of   applications6. Such systems are expected to undergo a high degree of innovation and hence they pose   an emerging issue.    Mobile Computing   The increasing role of mobile devices in next generation ICT architectures coupled with their   contribution towards technology convergence make them a key asset both for their users as well as   for operators of related application services. Hence mobile devices are increasingly being targeted by   threat agents. The secure development of mobile applications is also another area in its very early   stages of maturity. The reuse of code libraries and binary code protection are two areas that also   expected to be further developed, so as to minimize cyber threats such as data leakage and identity   theft.    Cloud Computing   Cloud computing is another area of concern to users and security experts.  Innovative usage models,   attack scenarios and security control implementations for cloud computing are envisaged to fall   under increased focus within the realm of cyber security in the future.    Trust infrastructure   Trust infrastructure and authentication infrastructure, are two vital components for cyber security   and for which a heightened level of attack has been reported by ENISA in 2014. Such attacks are     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   19  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      however seen as an opportunity for dynamic changes, introduction of good practice and potentially   innovations within the area.   Big Data   Big data is essentially a valuable asset and is therefore targeted by cyber threat agents. It also turns   out to be a very powerful tool for security professionals, given that it significantly contributes to   building intelligence about threats and incident management.   Internet of Things/ Interconnected devices/ smart environments   Interconnected devices from areas such as smart home, smart vehicle exchange information that   may be of a highly sensitive nature. Home automation through the Internet of Things concept may   potentially lead to cyber cases of harassment, abuse, sabotage and bullying7.   Network virtualisation (NV) and Software defined networks (SDN)   Network virtualisation builds virtual networks whilst software defined networks (SDN) perform   changes to virtual networks according to user needs. Although both technologies pose opportunities   towards quality of service, performance and efficient network management, yet, existing standards   and released technology are still in the very early stages of adoption and maturity. Hence the need for   more detailed security assessments for such technology is evidently necessary.    4.2 THE CORRESPONDING EMERGING THREATS   Table 5 lists out the corresponding likely cyber threats for each of the emerging technologies   identified. Except for two cyber threats which are noted as stable within the Trust infrastructure   area, most threats are noted to be on the increase during 2014. It can also be noted that the cyber   threats featuring across all of the six emerging technologies, albeit at varying intensity, include:    Malicious code or malware    Phishing    Web application or injection attacks     Identity theft or fraud    Information leakage    Physical damage or theft or loss of data         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   20  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         Threat Trend       Emerging  Technology areas   Cyber Physical Systems    Malicious Code  Web based attack   Spam  Phishing   Physical damage/theft/loss  Insider threat   Web application attacks  Information leakage   Mobile Computing    Malicious Code  Physical damage/theft/loss   Phishing  Web application attacks   Web based attack  Information leakage   Identity theft  Exploit kits   Ransomware/rogueware/scareware   Cloud Computing    Malicious Code   Web based attack  Web application attacks   Botnets  Denial of Service   Insider threat  Data Breach   Cyber espionage  Identity theft   Information leakage   Trust Infrastructure      Phishing  Malicious Code   Web application attacks  Information leakage   Identity theft  Physical damage/theft/loss   Exploit kits  Cyber espionage   Big Data    Data Breaches  Information leakage   Identity theft / fraud  Insider threat   Cyber espionage  Web based attack   Physical damage/theft/loss  Phishing   Internet of Things / Interconnected   devices / Smart environments     Malicious Code  Web based attack   Phishing  Exploit kits   Information leakage  Insider threat   Web application attacks  Physical theft/damage/loss   Identity theft  Denial of Service   Network Virtualisation and Software  defined Networks      Denial of Service  Malicious Code   Web application attacks   Phishing  Exploit kits   Insider threat  Physical theft/damage/loss   Identity theft   Table 5 – Cyber threats from emerging technology      Web based attack   Denial of Service      NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   21  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      5 Insights on Cyber Security   5.1 CYBER SECURITY IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS   The Cyber security scenario is a highly dynamic and complex one. Sophistication of cyber threats   continues increasing.   Trust infrastructures face massive stress as their basic security constituents have been challenged.    Other emerging technologies such as big data, social media, mobile computing and interconnected   devices if not properly applied and/or protected constitute a perfect knowledge base for cyber   criminals, allowing for covert, well planned, human and/or technical means of targeted attacks.   Additionally, related standards and technology applied may still be in the very early stages of adoption   and maturity , hence increasing the vulnerability risks.   Furthermore, the unknown number of breaches and security incidents is a major concern for cyber   security experts and law enforcement officials, calling for the need of breach notification at various   business areas/sectors, possibly through regulation. Governments are challenged to follow up on   related developments with regulation and legislation; seeking to establish a balance between what is   technically possible and what is legally transparent in the process.   New, sophisticated attacks call for development of new defences, such as through new detection   techniques and new security controls. In effect, such requirements for innovation call for research   and development efforts and investments involving Government, business as well as the academia.   5.2 CYBER CRIMINALITY IS EXTENSIVE, COMPLEX AND ADVANCED   Cyber criminals are increasingly more effective in targeting their attacks. They are being more   successful in exploitation of vulnerabilities (human and technical) through effective application of   malicious tools and attack methods. Breached or leaked data is considered as one of the key means    to achieve this goal. New attack techniques and practices also allow for lack of detection and   traceability of the perpetrator.   The nature and efficacy of the cyber crime market does not exclude having specialised roles such as   administrators, specialists in varous areas of cyber crime, intermediaries, brokers and vendors.   Interactions of cyber criminals with cyber terrorists is not excluded either.      NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   22  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      5.3 CYBER THREATS MAY ALSO ARISE FROM BUSINESS PARTNERS   The need for organisations to take heed of insider threats through their employees is critical.   However consideration also needs to be taken of business partners.  It is reported that financial   institutions are increasingly concerned about their ability to combat threats that can arise from   sharing networks and data with business partners, with 41% of respondents stating that they detected   incidents perpetrated by third parties with trusted access. A number of organisations within   healthcare and the utilities industry also admit to forging strategic business relationships without   consideration to robust due diligence, regulatory policies or deployment of monitoring and detection   controls, on third parties with whom they share sensitive information8.    5.4 NO INDUSTRY CAN DO WITHOUT A ROBUST CYBER SECURITY PROGRAM   The public sector is reported to be the primary target of cyber attacks, accounting over 75% of more   than 63,400 incidents reported worldwide during 20149. However, one cannot discount the   vulnerability of any other organisation – public sector or otherwise – from any cyber attack.   The Healthcare industry payers and providers report that information security incidents increased by   60% in 2014, and that costs attributed to such incidents increased to 282%10. For example, identity   theft and fraud is particularly noted within the healthcare industry, with an estimate of around two   million US citzens envisaged to spend over $12 billion as a result of such an incident alone. Cyber   attacks against power and utilities organisations have also transitioned from speculative to   indisputable 11. Article 2.3 of the European Commission’s European Energy Security Strategy, in   particular, states that: “The EU has started to develop a policy to address the physical protection of   critical infrastructure (against threats, hazards) which includes energy infrastructure. Increasing   attention should be given to IT security”12. Within the Finance sector, its regulators are increasingly   expecting the effective implementation of robust security programs from its operators.    Ultimately, the crux of it all is not simply having a cyber security program, but that its implementation   does not lag behind. ENISA specifically reports in 2014, that falling behind in cyber security continues   to be the number one reason for security incidents such as data breaches.    5.5 A RISK-BASED GOVERNANCE MODEL TO CYBER SECURITY IS NEEDED   As highlighted earlier, the uses of technologies - and in particular, emerging ones - present   opportunities and pose risks too. Hence the need for thorough risk assessments, prior to their   deployment is necessary. Possibly with the aid of widely accepted frameworks, consideration needs to   be given to closely link technologies, processes and personnel skills with enterprise risk management     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   23  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      within an organisation. The purchase of cyber insurance to help mitigate financial losses of cyber-  attacks13 may also contribute further towards a healthy risk based approach.   5.6 RESPONSIBILITY, COMMITMENT AND ACTIVE SUPPORT FROM TOP MANAGEMENT   IS CRUCIAL FOR CYBER SECURITY   Cyber security is indeed a responsibility of each and every employee within an organisation. However,   as in any other initiative within an organisation this is likely to falter, potentially leading to earlier   reported negligence unless it is not continuously and actively communicated and supported by top   management. Ongoing cyber security training and awareness programmes may help in this regard.   5.7 EFFECTIVE CYBER SECURITY DEMANDS THAT NO ORGANISATION SHOULD   OPERATE IN ISOLATION   Threat analyses and achieved results, performed by various organisations, are rather complex. The   challenge faced may be eased by effective sharing of information on threat intelligence and response   tactics.      NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   24  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document                     Part Three   Domestic cyber security concerns and   preparedness         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   25  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         6 An Outline of European-wide Concerns   6.1 CYBERCRIME   The Euro barometer Survey specialising on cyber security for 2014 specifically states that “85% of   Internet users across the EU agree that the risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime is increasing”.   The levels of concern about each specific type of cybercrime14 are also considerably higher than in   201315. Compounded to such concern, is a high level of agreement among European citizens that they   still do not feel well informed about cyber crime risks.   \"Cybercrime undermines consumer confidence in the use of Internet, hampering both   our digital economy and our online lives. Our priority is to create a safer Internet for   all users by preventing and combating cybercrime in all its forms, to enable users to   reap the full benefits of the digital internal market and to exercise their fundamental   rights online ...”   Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and   Citizenship.   6.2 NATION-STATE ACTORS   Of equal concern is a noted increased ‘alarm’ over nation state actors16 as evidenced by cyber-  security simulation exercises being conducted. The European Network Security Agency (ENISA)   conducts EU-wide ‘simulation exercises’ to prepare for better cooperation against the threat of   critical systems from hostile cyber agents17         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   26  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         7 Experiences and concerns of the Maltese citizen   A number of indicative traits or concerns on cyber security issues among Maltese citizens have been   extracted from Special Euro barometer public opinion surveys on cyber security conducted across   the European Union for years 201218, 201319 and 201420 for particular consideration. Table 6 presents a   number of incidents reported by the Survey’s Maltese respondents for 2014 with an indicative trend   from the previous year based upon the percentage of responses.Table 7 lists a number of concerns   expressed by the Maltese respondents with respect to various aspects of cyber security. A detailed   explanation and analyses for each of the factors listed is given further below.

The following are a number of cybercrime variants encountered or perceived to occur within the   Maltese context.    7.2 ACCESS TO ONLINE SERVICES   The overall confidence to use the Internet for online services (e.g. banking, public services) has   decreased from 74% in 2012 to 73% to 2013 across the EU.     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   28  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      A proportional increase is noted in 2014 in the level of concern expressed by EU respondents in having   access to online services, through the Internet, as a result of cyber attacks.  In Malta’s case, the   findings indicate an increase from 44% in 2013 to 61% in 2014. This could be potentially attributed to   an increase in the proportion of the Maltese respondents, from 7% in 2013 to 10% in 2014 who   complain of related incidents.   7.3 ONLINE FRAUD   Overall, almost all respondents within the EU member states attribute the use of Internet to access e-  mail. The Maltese respondents who receive fraudulent emails have decreased significantly from 53%   in 2012 to 39% in 2013 and have remained so (39%) in 2014. However, the percentage of those who   are concerned of receiving fraudulent emails has increased from 55% in 2013 to 58% in 2014.   Furthermore, Malta ranks high within the EU in the proportion of respondents (16%) who claim on-line   fraud in terms of unfulfilled purchase of goods, counterfeit goods, or falsely advertised products;   although the percentage has remained locally stable since 2013. The level of concern has however   sharply increased in proportion from 55% in 2013 to 67% in 2014.     7.4 ONLINE BANKING FRAUD   Concern on bank card or online banking fraud appears to be on the rise across the EU in 2014, relative   to 2013. In the case of Malta, the findings indicate an increase in level of concern from 62% to 71%.   Such proportion of concern is considered relatively high in Malta compared to the rest of Europe in   2013 and tends to remain so, albeit to a lesser extent, in 2014.     On the other hand, although there is a 1% increase in proportion of EU respondents who claim such   fraud during 2014, there is a corresponding decline within the Maltese case - from 6% (2013) to 5%.   7.5 SECURITY OF ONLINE PAYMENTS   During 2014, there again appears to be a rise in concern amongst the Maltese respondents (27%) on   the security of online payments for banking or purchasing activities. This follows a previous decline   from 29% in 2012 to 24% in 2013.   7.6 PERSONAL ONLINE DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY   Over a three year period, there also appears to be a variation in the trend of Maltese respondents   who seek to avoid disclosing personal information online. It has significantly declined from 95% in   2012 to 80% in 2013, but has almost returned to the original level, increasing to 93% in 2014.This may   similarly reflect an increase in 2014, in stated concerns with respect to the     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   29  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document       Use of the Internet for activities like online banking and online purchases – an increase of   12%. This percentage indicates an increase of 12% from 2013. Malta also registers the highest   proportion of respondents registering such concern across the EU, at 34%.    Personal information not kept secure by public authorities – with proportion of respondents   varying from 65% in 2012 down to 62% in 2013 and increasing again by 4% (66%) in 2014.   On a positive note however, a declining trend is noted in the level of concern regrding online personal   information not being secured by websites – from 74% in 2012 to 71% in 2013 and declining further to   69% in 2014.   7.7 IDENTITY THEFT   The proportion of Maltese respondents who have experienced identity theft has declined from 11% to   5% between 2013 and 201421. However, this does not dispel the increasing level of concern of   experiencing such an incident as stated across the EU, including Malta – from 59% in 2013 to 74% in   2014.   7.8 ACCOUNT HACKING   During 2014, a significant proportion of the Maltese respondents (71%) relative to the EU average   (60%) express their concern of having their social media or email account hacked. In addition, there   is also an increase in proportion of Maltese respondents who claim that their social media or email   account has been hacked – from 12% in 2013 to 16% in 2014.    7.9 MALICIOUS SOFTWARE   In 2014, a significantly high proportion of Maltese respondents (76%) have also stated concern of   discovering malicious software on their ICT devices.  40% of Maltese respondents have also reported   discovering malicious software. The survey also refers to a direct correlation between those who   installed anti-virus software and those who discovered malicious software.   It is noted that during the same period, the proportion of Maltese respondents who claim to have   installed anti-virus software stands at around 40%, increasing to 60% by end 2014.    7.10 OFFENSIVE MATERIAL   Across the EU, respondents are more likely to state that they have encountered material which   promotes racial hatred or religious extremism online; with an increase of 11% from 2013. Indeed, in   the case of Malta, the level of related concern has increased from 37% in 2013 to 50% in 2014.  A     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   30  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      sharp increase, in the case of Malta is noted in the percentage of those who accidentally encountered   such material – from 12% in 2013 to 25% in 2014.   Similarly, an increase of 9% is noted between 2013 and 2014 in the number of Maltese respondents   who are concerned with accidentally encountering child pornography online.   7.11 ON-LINE HARASSMENT   In 2013, when compared to the highest EU level of 9%, only 4% of Maltese respondents report that   they have been personal victims of on-line harassment. Additionally, only 1% of the Maltese   respondents claim to have child victims of on-line harassment, compared to the EU’s highest   proportion of 5%.   During the same period, it is noted that on-line harassment is consistent among EU states and is   higher among:    Frequent internet users    Respondents aged 15-24 years    Multiple (rather than single) households with children   Notably, in 2014, Malta ranks amongst the top:    four EU countries where 52% of respondents take steps to protect children when they are   online    five EU countries where 31% of respondents monitor children’s Internet usage   Specifically, at 23%Malta rates highest amongst the EU respondents who state that they adjust   security settings for children.   7.12 FEELING INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS OF CYBERCRIME   On a more positive trend, the percentage of Maltese internet users who feel well informed about the   risks of cybercrime has increased from 45% in 2013 to 54% in 2014. This similarly reflects an EU   trend, with a decrease from 59% to 53% during 2012 -2014 among those who do not feel well   informed about the risks of cybercrime.   This may potentially explain one behavioural trait reported in the Euro barometer 2014 survey   whereby a significant proportion of the Maltese respondents, relative to their EU counterparts (48%)   claim that they are most likely to visit only known Websites.       NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   31  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document      Significantly encouraging is that despite the overall cyber security concerns, it appears that a fewer   proportion of Maltese respondents (6%), compared to European ones, deem it likely not to buy goods   or services online.   7.13 REPORTING CYBERCRIME   On an EU –wide perspective (including Malta), the Police are most frequently contacted in case of   cyber crime such as for identity theft, online banking fraud, child pornography. This indicates the key   role that the Police force is perceived to play within the cyber crime area. However the survey   findings also suggest that a higher level of knowledge on cybercrime leads to a preference to contact   website or vendor organisations rather than the police.            NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   32  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         8 Current domestic scenario in cyber security   At this stage, current domestic on cyber security aspects in Malta has been largely noted from on-line   publicly available sources as follows:   8.1 DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE   As an EU Member State, Malta is expected to align itself to Europe 2020, the 10-year strategy   proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the   European Union through smart, sustainable, inclusive growth\" with greater coordination of national   and European policy. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), adopted by the European Commission in May   2010, is one of the Strategy’s seven flagship initiatives that aim to increasingly facilitate the   deployment of high-speed internet and reap the benefits of a digital single market for households and   firms. Along with other related Council of the European Union Conclusions, the DAE highlights a shared   understanding that security and trust are the necessary prerequisites for the wider uptake of ICT.   The Implementation of the DAE, focuses, among others, on four action items pertaining to Trust and   Security, namely:    Action 38 – Member States to establish pan-European Computer Emergency Response teams    Action 39 – Member states to carry out cyber attack simulations    Action 40 – Member States to implement harmful content alert hotlines    Action 41 – Member States to set up national alert platforms   Reference to the latest status for the action items can be found at   http://daeimplementation.eu/member_states.php?id_pillar=45&id_country=18.   8.2 ITU REPORT – CYBER WELLNESS PROFILE   Malta is a member of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)-the United Nations specialized   agency for information and communication technologies.    The ITU has embarked the Global Cyber security Agenda (GCA); a framework for international   cooperation aimed at enhancing confidence and security in the information society.  The CGA is based   upon five domains for a country’s cyber security development, namely Legal Measures, Technical   Measures, Organisation Measures, Capacity Building and Cooperation.

Table 8 – Indication of Stakeholders for Malta Cyber Security Strategy    Within the local context, it is likely that the Public sector and regulated industries, such as those in   banking and finance, electronic (mobile) telephony, ISPs are key leaders in cyber security; given that   they:    Use the Web and mobile channels extensively for their services    Handle sensitive data    May already be expected, as critical infrastructure owners / operators to undertake related   security measures     May likely have more human and financial resource capacity and capability to mount robust   cyber security measures   A brief review of some local indicators, such as the highest percentage contribution to GDP in 201325,   further suggests that the following sectors need to take particular active consideration of cyber   security in Malta:     NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   37  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document       Services (76.4% contribution), which apart from Finance notably includes Gaming, Education,   Real-estate services, ,Hospitality and Tourism, Transport and storage, Professional, Scientific   and Technical activities, ICT activities    Industry (22.2% contribution)    Agriculture (1.4% contribution)   Additionally, as also indicated within the Table, consideration also needs to be made of cyber security   related updates to regulation and legislation, international cooperation, capacity building, education   and awareness.      NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   38  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document                     Part Five   Conclusion         NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER – SUPPORTING DOCUMENT   39  Malta | National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper – Supporting Document         10 Concluding Note   Such findings, provide various indications of areas where further attention needs to be further   expended with respect to cyber-security. Above all, they clearly show that cyber security cannot be   treated as a monolith. Cyber threats are not all the same and resulting impacts are not to the   detriment to technology only, but to organisations,processes and ultimately to the end-user.    Ultimately it is not only the public sector alone that is impacted upon. Given today’s digital   interconnectedness between Government, the private sector and civil society, it is thus necessary for   a continuous and well planned concerted effort so as to ensure updated security in place so as to   minimise cyber threats as much as possible.

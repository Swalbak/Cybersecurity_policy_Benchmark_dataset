We as a country need to embrace technology, set a path and ensure we use it well. The Digital Malta Strategy is that path. It is important that all our people are involved in the advance of the Maltese economy. Nobody should be left behind. This Strategy not only results from a wide consultation but also from an underlying deep concern to involve everyone. In its pages are actions and commitments to turn us into a digital society. Information and Communications Technology is an important industry in itself, while just about every other industry depends on ICT to thrive. This strategy will encourage innovation and entrepreneurial ventures and will help all businesses remain competitive and fight their corner in the global economy. There is also a clear message here that Malta is a good place to set up business. We not only offer the European open market, and good links with Africa and the Middle East, but we are well positioned on the digital superhighway. We are accelerating in the fast lane of technology and don’t intend to take our foot off the pedal. The road ahead is a lot clearer because of the Digital Malta Strategy. I encourage you to be part of it. Foreword by JOSEPH MUSCAT Prime Minister 4 National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 5 We live in a competitive world. We can buy products from around the corner or thousands of miles away. And what we make we can sell in the local shop or to a market of millions. This is the global economy. Barriers have come tumbling down. We can be continents apart yet communicate in an instant. The world is more inter-connected and that is the way it will stay. In both government and business there has been recognition of the need to understand new technology and utilise it. But could we be doing more? The answer is yes. We would be foolish to allow ourselves to lag behind our competitors. The Digital Malta Strategy sets out how everyone can learn, broaden their skills and make good use of technology. It sets out what we should be doing for the next few years, but it is also flexible in that it recognises how fast technology changes and puts us on alert for future developments. The young are born into modern technology and have never known a world without gaming, mobiles and the Internet. Grandparents may not be so enthusiastic with gadgetry yet they still delight in video chats with their grandchildren on the other side of the world. And everybody else is constantly living in an online world of email, social media and the web. Government has increasingly put its services online and there can be few businesses not powered by technology. Technology matters to us all, and that is why the Digital Malta Strategy is so important. It is the way forward for all Maltese. Foreword by EDWARD ZAMMIT LEWIS Parliamentary Secretary 6 1 ICT can empower the economy and society, directly and indirectly. It is both critical infrastructure and an enabling tool. Malta recognises this and government is setting out a vision to transform the country into one which will prosper as a digitally-enabled nation in all sectors of society. This will be done through the implementation of this strategy, which is being branded as Digital Malta. INTRODUCTION 1. The term ‘digital’ within this text refers to the application of information and communication technology National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 7 8 The Strategy outlines three strategic themes - Digital Citizen, Digital Business and Digital Government, and these are supported by three strategic enablers: Regulation and Legislation, Infrastructure and Human Capital. The Strategy puts forward a suite of guiding principles and actions for ICT to be used for socio-economic development. It sets out how ICT can make a difference in areas such as the economy, employment, industry and small businesses, and how it can be used for national development, to empower citizens and transform government. It encourages everyone to reap the benefits that ICT can bring: better education, stronger businesses, efficient Government, sustainable economic growth and much more. Truly, it can provide a better quality of life for the Maltese. It is essential that the benefits of this nation’s knowledge society are enjoyed by every citizen irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, education, economic means or race. This will be achieved through intervention to circumvent obstacles. There will be action to enhance digital literacy and social equality, increase access for all and stimulate local content. 1 INTRODUCTION National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 9 The ICT industry in Malta has achieved substantial growth in the past decade. Excluding the iGaming sector, it now accounts for more than 5% of the nation’s GDP. Besides being a sector in its own right, ICT also helps other business sectors to develop and grow. It is the enabler of the smart specialisation areas identified in the National Research and Innovation Strategy 2020. The Digital Malta Strategy has been designed to foster a strong, competitive, ICT-enabled and export-oriented industry, able to compete globally. It will also propel ICT further in sustaining business and innovation, contributing to economic growth. Innovative application of ICT is also a crucial catalyst in the transformation of government. Sophisticated ICT implementations carry little value if citizens and businesses are not able to use public services or participate in the policy making process in meaningful ways. This strategy advocates the re-engineering of public services to achieve greater responsiveness to citizen and business needs, using multiple channels. Government will have an open approach to communicating and sharing information following the principles of transparency, participation and collaboration. Technology is continually advancing so this strategic plan will not, in the conventional jargon of management, be limited only to rational policy interventions. The Digital Malta Strategy is pragmatic, and flexible enough to react to future developments. There is high-level strategic direction that allows entities flexibility in implementation. Digital Malta is not just a Strategy to provide national policy direction on ICT initiatives covering 2014-2020. It also constitutes a framework, permitting policy makers, business leaders and entrepreneurs to take decisions now knowing they will be supported by policy that is responsive to the technological advances of the coming years. The Digital Malta vision is ambitious. The path towards achieving it will no doubt need refinement and, sometimes major updating, because today’s assumptions will carry diminished significance as events unravel and competitive advantages shift. These refinements will be reflected in the Programme of Initiatives complementing the Digital Malta Strategy. Each year a recalibration of the Initiatives will take place after measuring outcomes and targets achieved. This document is the result of an extensive consultative process. The first phase covered a series of consultation workshops with ICT stakeholders from the public and private sectors, associations and other interest groups from civil society, as well as the public at large. The second phase included more focused discussions with stakeholders involved in the eventual implementation and ownership of parts of the Strategy. This consultative approach will continue during the life-time of the Strategy. Digital Malta reflects the collective aspirations and goodwill of stakeholders, structured in the form of a national plan owned by the stakeholders themselves. It is a journey that all stakeholders will nurture to attain a vision of where Malta wants to be. 10 2 Malta has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the sovereign debt crisis that affected many other countries in Europe 2. Nevertheless, the crisis cannot be ignored because of the exposure that comes from having a small, open economy. Indeed, in May 2013, the European Commission recommended that Malta be placed under an Excessive Deficit Procedure and called for reforms in pensions, healthcare and sustainable public finances. According to Eurostat, the unemployment rate in Malta ranks among the lowest in the EU and, in 2013, the inflation rate fell to 1.38% compared to 2.72% and 2.42% in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The rate of economic growth for 2013 was higher than expected 3 and a growth of 1.7% is projected for 2014 4. THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 2.

National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 11 12 In the GCI for 2013-2014, Malta has climbed six places and now ranks number 41, out of 148 countries 5. Switzerland, Singapore and Finland are ranked in the top three positions. Compared to other European countries, Malta is placed 17th 6. Among southern European countries, France and Spain performed better than Malta, while Italy, Turkey, Portugal and Cyprus performed worse. The results are encouraging, but there is no room for complacency and Malta should actively strive to improve its competitiveness. A strong digital economy is central to any country’s competitiveness, growth and jobs strategy. Our technological readiness is vital in this regard, with Malta ranking 16th in the Technology Readiness index (Fig. 1). 5. Source: The Global Competitiveness Report (2013 – 2014) - 6. This ranking takes into consideration European countries that are not members of the EU, such as Switzerland and Norway. 2 THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE TECHNOLOGICAL READINESS INDEX MALTA RANKS 16 OUT OF 148 COUNTRIES. (Source: World Economic Forum) Fig. 1 National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 13 Universally, ICT is acknowledged as a fundamental enabler and one of the pillars for socio-economic development. The past ten years have seen a rapid growth of the ICT industry in Malta. ICT contributes circa 5.7% value-added to national GDP 7 (Fig. 2) and employs 3.3% of a population of 165,300 gainfully employed 8 (Fig. 3). In 2013, the World Economic Forum ranked Malta in 28th place (out of 138 countries) in its Networked Readiness Index (Fig. 4), which measures the preparedness of an economy to use ICT to boost competitiveness and well being. Malta also featured in fourth place for the importance of ICT to the government vision and in fifth place for successfully promoting the use of ICT within the country 9. The fact that there is political consensus on ICT strategic direction is a strength. 7. Source: NSO – Gross Domestic Product.

Source: NSO Fig. 2 Source: NSO Fig. 3 14 TAKE-UP OF ICT Improving ICT access and its use is an important challenge. Although the ICT footprint is increasing, not all homes, schools, or businesses have taken it up or are using it as they could. Compared to other EU countries, Malta falls behind in the numbers using the Internet, uploading self-created content, using Internet banking, taking online courses, and looking for a job or sending a job application. SMEs and start-up companies need encouragement to see ICT more as a tool for reducing costs, innovating and gaining access to wider markets. Citizens are expecting ICT to play a more significant role in the next generation of healthcare services; it shall enable patient empowerment, and safer and more personalised care. 2 THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE NETWORKED READINESS INDEX MALTA RANKS 28 OUT OF 138 COUNTRIES. (Source: World Economic Forum) Fig. 4 National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 15 People with age-related dependencies or different abilities need to be empowered to stay active, live independently and avoid institutionalisation. All citizens, including those at risk of exclusion (for example, those with different abilities, low digital literacy/eSkills), need access to smart environments and innovative services. Over the past decade ICT has become integrated in schools, with all pupils having access to computers and the Internet. Yet, building capacity in education remains a challenge. It is important that teachers have the skills to harness eLearning materials. Teaching methods need updating and there must be sufficient digital content for students to gain full advantage of the benefits of ICT. Greater effort is needed to encourage learning among unskilled working-age adults, the elderly and people with disabilities. Those without eSkills risk not reaping benefits from ICT, both in terms of earnings and job prospects. ICT offers great potential to bring the unemployed back into the workforce. HUMAN CAPITAL The industry, both the ICT- producing and the ICT-using sectors, are supported by experienced, efficient, skilled and multi-lingual professionals. In 2012, Eurostat reported that Malta ranked in 23rd position out of the EU27+ in terms of computer skills. Between the 2007 and 2012, the average number of ICT-related graduates from the University of Malta was 151. The highest number of ICT graduates from the University of Malta was registered in 2011 with 197 – a share of 6.8% of all graduates. During the same period, the average number of graduates from the ICT Institute within MCAST, which is the country’s leading vocational education and training institution, in levels 5 & 6 was 542 graduates. Work practices are flexible and unit labour costs are generally competitive and responsive to market conditions. These attributes are complemented by a competitive tax regime. Within the ICT labour market, the low female participation rate, the misalignment between the ICT education curriculum and industry needs (such as the lack of specialised skills for the iGaming sector) and the lack of supportive education are serious weaknesses. These are hampering resource capacity, resource readiness and innovation. The arrival of ‘cheaper’ skilled competitors, particularly from the Baltic region, Eastern Europe and Asia, poses a new threat to the digital industry in Malta. Source: Eurostat Fig. 5 16 THE CHALLENGES FOR THE LOCAL ICT INDUSTRY Similar to other industries, it is clear that the ICT industry in Malta is past the stage where it can attempt to achieve higher levels of economic activity on the basis of low labour costs. Incentive packages are no longer sufficient in attracting investment, because today there are equally attractive incentives in other countries. Investors seek profitable opportunities in countries offering the best prospects in terms of competitiveness. If Malta is to improve its performance in attracting FDI, greater focus on knowledge and innovation-based investment and on economic efficiency 10 is needed. These factors carry the promise of sustained growth in the wealth-generating capacity of the Digital Economy. SMEs within the ICT industry know that their main weakness in terms of growth is the small size of the local market. Some of these businesses are adopting a more outward-looking entrepreneurial culture that is focused on exports rather than relying on short- term advantages in the captive domestic market. However, these SMEs face a multitude of difficulties. The World Economic Forum has identified a list of problematic factors for doing business in Malta. The top three are inefficient government bureaucracy, limited access to financing and insufficient capacity to innovate. Malta also lacks the adequate schemes for business angel investors 11, who are generally needed by start-ups to take off, and by established ICT businesses to expand. This may reflect Malta’s entrepreneurial culture, which tends towards lower risk or conventional “bricks-and-mortar” ventures. Currently, most local ICT companies are software services and hybrid solution providers and integrators. Few qualify as software products companies, deriving well over half of their sales from licence fees. This may suggest that less intellectual property, inherent in the software being developed, can be translated into patents or copyrights. Similarly, the lack of participation and contribution in open source communities limits the exposure of Maltese skills and the potential to increase FDI. The small size of the Maltese islands presents special opportunities for the ICT industry. These include the deployment of “first-in-the-world” nation-wide projects or “test bed” projects in strategic alliances with ICT multinational companies. Highlighting these opportunities is important in FDI strategy, especially when it comes to targeting ICT investment and building partnerships. With important events due to take place, with ‘including the hosting of the CHOGM in 2015, Malta’s EU Presidency during the first half of 2017 and Valletta as the European Capital of Culture in 2018, now is the time to launch a branding exercise. TRUE VALUE TO CITIZENS For the past twenty years, government has substantially invested in ICT. Government capitalised on the lack of complexity in Malta compared to large countries, which often have two or more levels and branches of administration, multiple police forces, several courts of justice and region-based healthcare systems. Government adopted policies favouring the consolidation of its investments, as well as standards to support such policies. This led to the adoption of corporate systems and shared services across all departments. A robust and resilient ICT infrastructure forms the back-bone of an interconnected government. Most of these initiatives were implemented in partnership with the private sector. Government also established a strong governance framework and strengthened the eCommerce legislative framework. More recently, Government inaugurated a TIER III Data Centre, 12 hosting government infrastructure and information systems. This Data Centre is the fifth data centre in Western Europe and one of only 34 data centres worldwide certified to reach the Tier III Facility Certification. 10. The term economic efficiency refers to the use of resources so as to maximize the production of goods and services - Sullivan, Arthur; Steven M. Sheffrin (2003). Economics: Principles in action. 11. Business angel is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up. 12. Tier III Facility Certification verifies that each and every component within the MITA Data Centre can be maintained, replaced or upgraded without disrupting the service. 2 THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 17 Public projects are most fruitful when they are owned and funded by the respective government entity (as opposed to a more prescriptive, centralised entity) and driven by business objectives. In order to widen government efficiency, ICT champions are required in important decision-making positions and ICT strategies need to be integrated into overall government policy. Malta is considered one of Europe’s high performers in delivering eGovernment. The country is constantly improving its eGovernment platform to ensure that the number of services available online can increase without a proportionate increase in cost and complexity. The platform’s architecture promotes reusability and scalability. In the eGovernment Benchmark 2012 report, Malta ranked first in four benchmarks (user-centric government, transparent government, citizen mobility, business mobility) and second in the enablers benchmark. The 2012 report also highlighted that eGovernment users are expecting more from the services being supplied. Statistics from Eurostat highlight that the take-up of public online services by citizens is below the EU average. Malta ranked 18th (Fig. 6) in terms of percentage of individuals using eGovernment services and 15th (Fig. 7) in terms of enterprises using the Internet to interact with government. The messages are clear. Users want to interact on everything from health and education to security and tax. They expect government to focus on finding out what citizens want, rather than deciding what they need. Citizens are also expecting government to cut red tape. The development of Digital Government has to be hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce bureaucracy. Source: Eurostat Source: Eurostat Fig. 6 Fig. 7 18 HARNESSING NEW PARADIGMS The drive of the European Commission to accelerate interoperability, making systems and organisations work together, poses additional challenges and opportunities. It nurtures the concept of connected government through the alignment of departmental processes, standardisation, discovery and reuse of ICT assets and continuous rigour in improving the level of trust in the services provided by the public sector. Implementation of information systems within the public sector needs to incorporate the principles and recommendations of initiatives such as the European Interoperability Framework, European Interoperability Strategy and the semantic initiatives promoted through the European Commission’s Joinup platform13. National technological infrastructure is in a good shape and compares quite favourably at an international level (Table 1). Malta has an impressive proliferation of mobile telephony and Internet access. Similarly, there is high digital confidence by consumers. By 2012, the mobile penetration rate in Malta reached 132%, slightly higher than the EU average of 130%14. In 2012, 77% of households had access to the Internet – slightly higher than the EU27 average of 76%. In this regard, the main concerns are the dependence on other countries for Internet connection, the capacity of international connectivity, the affordability of broadband for users and the lack of local content for the web and mobile devices15. The new enterprise ICT landscape of cloud services, mobility and BYOD, and social media usage, creates very different types of network traffic to the traditional mix of in-house client-server workloads. Architecture and networks need to evolve to keep pace. Not only is more bandwidth required to accommodate the workloads involved, but also time delay must be avoided. Lower latency, particularly over wide-area networks, is needed to ensure good response times for cloud-based applications and other services.

The term ‘mobile devices’ within the context of this document includes mobile phones, tablets, laptops, ultrabooks, etc. Table 1 National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 19 RAMPING UP ICT-DRIVEN INNOVATION The budget allocation for ICT faces competition within government, placing an onus on departments and entities to make the most efficient use of both national and EU funds. Participation in EU-funded projects by government bodies may need increased resource and legal governance support. Government needs to consider innovative means to procure ICT services, explore the feasibility of private funding and public-private partnerships, and consider the prospect of re-using and sharing with other countries. In the past, R&I strategies for ICT had been identified as a priority area. In the National Research & Innovation Strategy 2020, ICT is now singled out as an enabling technology for all sectors because of its potential to innovate industries. Since Malta’s size cannot sustain the entire R&D life cycle, efforts should be directed to applied research that is closer to the market16 and in existing areas of strength that could enhance Malta’s profile as a centre of ICT excellence. Many companies in Malta associate R&D to the closed innovation model of larger companies and multinationals. In comparison, open innovation approaches are more collaborative and leverage complementarities, and are, therefore, more adaptive to the needs of small businesses. Combining industrial innovation with educational policies and focusing on areas of strength (smart specialisation) increases the chances of Malta and its industrial base (both ICT and non-ICT) gaining a competitive advantage through differentiation. The contribution of ICT towards energy efficiency in Malta is still marginally low. ICT offers many opportunities to offset the costs of energy through green ICT measures, such as, energy efficient equipment, virtualised environments, grid computing, cloud computing, home automation systems and advanced virtual services. MAXIMISING OPPORTUNITIES Malta’s ICT priorities are guided by government strategic priorities and the Europe 2020 Strategy flagship initiatives. More specifically these tie in with the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Innovation Union. Malta already has strong regulatory authorities and agencies including the LGA, the MCA, the Government’s IT arm, MITA and various other successful endeavours such as the eSkills Malta Foundation, upon which it can successfully build. The expectations of what ICT can deliver, are higher than ever and are likely to keep on growing. The main elements are in place for the industry to prosper. The challenges now are to prioritise and implement the missing elements. Malta’s ICT industry must emerge from its plateau state and move quickly to exploit opportunities. It needs to build on its strengths, minimise its weaknesses and aim for sustained growth. 16. Source: MCST 2011. 20 3 Digital Malta will take ICT policy development and implementation to a higher gear, meeting the expectations of all - the Citizen and civil society, Business and government. This vision will be enabled by supportive regulation and legislation, sound infrastructure and productive human capital. These building blocks will empower stakeholders to collaborate both within and across sectors. This is represented by Fig. 8: THE DIGITAL MALTA VISION Digital Malta is a vision for the country in 2020 when: “Malta will prosper as a digitally-enabled nation in all sectors of society.” This is an exciting goal, advancing the nation’s digital economy to let business prosper and improve the quality of people’s lives. To meet this vision there is a need to address the most pressing strategic issues and capitalise on digital opportunities. 3.1 STRATEGIC THEMES National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 21 Fig. 8 22 Improve the wellbeing of Citizens and civil society. Everyone, including vulnerable and minority groups, will benefit from a higher standard of living. Basic digital skills will empower citizens to seize opportunities presented by technology and digitisation. Digital services will be affordable, secure and accessible to all regardless of skill and economic means. Local digital content will be encouraged. Transform the way Business operate. Digital Malta will increase competitiveness and boost the attractiveness of local industry. It will promote more start-ups, attract foreign investment, enable strategic alliances, encourage angel investment and nurture niche service providers. Business will be encouraged and supported to exploit (i) the opportunities of the European Digital Single Market, (ii) Malta’s strategic location in the Mediterranean, with ready access to the European and North African markets, (iii) Government’s strategic alliances with foreign ICT organisations, (iv) opportunities to expand into new or bigger markets. Enhance the delivery of Government. Better application of digitisation will result in reduced bureaucracy, increased efficiency and transparency. The public service will be closer to civil society and enterprises, improving the government’s decision-making processes. Open Government and eDemocracy will be facilitated. On-line government services will be more accessible through the use of smart devices and mobile-friendly applications as well as websites and social media. Government’s technological capabilities will be widened to include open- source, cloud computing and big data concepts. Information sharing across government systems and services will be promoted, as will be the re-use of public sector information by third parties. These vertical strategic pillars need to be supported by a suite of enabling / driving forces: Regulation & Legislation Of central importance will be government’s direction and priorities at a Strategic and Digital Policy level. Regulation and legislation will ensure an empowered digital society is realised. Good ICT governance will be promoted, with judicious use of resources and participation by all stakeholders. International best practices will be adopted. Infrastructure Infrastructure services need to be accessible, reliable, secure, affordable and resilient. They shall provide for disaster recovery where appropriate. Investment by private sector, will ensure fast broadband, wifi, next-generation access and robust government information systems architecture. Human Capital It is important to invest in people to ensure the supply of eSkills to meet the future needs of different sectors. Action will be taken to develop a high quality specialised skills base, maximising employment opportunities, with an emphasis on increasing female participation and tackling inequalities. The portrayal of this six-pillar model, with a three-dimensional perspective, carries through to sectors such as health, education, transport, justice, welfare and taxation, and themed areas of specialisation identified in the ‘National Research and Innovation Strategy 2020’. The diversity of each area and sector will be taken into account when tailoring initiatives. 3 THE DIGITAL MALTA VISION Digital Malta is built upon three vertical strategic pillars with clear goals to: National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 23 3.2 UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES Core principles underpin the implementation of the Digital Malta vision: 1. Ensuring all citizens are offered the possibility to benefit from ICT as a fundamental right. 2. Advocating proactive leadership, and delivering programmes that meet needs. 3. Supporting national priorities in line with government policy, the National Reform Programme and the EU obligations. 4. Engaging the private sector as an important player in the delivery of the Strategy. 5. Optimising value and accountability. 6. Ensuring collaboration between stakeholders to make the best use of national strategic information assets, encourage synergies and minimise fragmentation. 7. Encouraging a more- environmentally friendly society through greener procurement, implementation and application of ICT. 8. Supporting and enabling R&I in identified areas of strength, capability and centres of excellence (smart specialisation). 9. Adopting an open and experimental mindset, capitalising on lessons learned from success stories and respecting best practices and international standards. 10. Maximising opportunities from multiple funding sources, including European and international funding programmes and the private sector. 24 4 DIGITAL CITIZEN 4.1 GOALS Digital technologies can improve the quality of life of all citizens. Every Maltese, irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, education, economic means and race should grow as a digital citizen with rights, responsibilities and abilities to access and use ICT. Digital technologies must serve as a social equaliser, enabling everyone to participate and contribute in community activity. Ease access to technology and connectivity, and help citizens to learn how to get the best out of it. The goals of the actions under this strategic pillar are to: Build trust in the digital world. Raise awareness of how ICT can improve daily life and work. Provide every citizen with the tools to balance work with family commitments, pursue leisure and lifelong learning, and to remain active within the community. Use digital technologies to preserve, enhance and promote Maltese culture and identity, and to enable access to quality content and services. Build social cohesion to overcome social, health, age and disability vulnerabilities. Empower civil society to become more actively engaged in digital activities of the community. National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 25 4.2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES Citizens will be supported to: i. Adopt digital technologies to help with their work and improve their quality of life. ii. Create value content that can be accessed through digital means. iii. Collaborate with others to make the Internet a safer place for everyone. iv. Re-use public sector information while respecting privacy legislation, national security and the need to protect intellectual property rights of third parties. v. Be innovative in applying digital technology. A. When planning and implementing digital initiatives, feedback from citizens and civil society will be sought. Barriers that stop citizens from exploiting the benefits of the Internet must be removed. B. C. 26 Improve the wellbeing of Citizens and civil society. Everyone, including vulnerable and minority groups, will benefit from a higher standard of living. Basic digital skills will empower citizens to seize opportunities presented by technology and digitisation. Digital services will be affordable, secure and accessible to all regardless of skill and economic means. Local digital content will be encouraged. National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 27 28 4.3 ACTIONS ENHANCING DIGITAL LITERACY AND SOCIAL EQUALITY Achieving widespread digital literacy is vital for inclusivity and social cohesion. For example, digitally competent workers and digitally competent citizens can be more successful in the job market and contribute more effectively within the community. Those without digital competences are in danger of falling behind. ICT offers people the tools to overcome limitations. 1. Basic level of ICT competence An education and awareness programme will be launched to boost ICT competences, media literacy and confident, critical and safe use of the Internet. The programme will be implemented at community level. Vulnerable groups will be a major focus. 2. Empowering the young through a safer Internet Digital Citizenship will become part of the National Education Curriculum, to equip children and youths with the abilities to interact and use the Internet safely and intelligently. Parents and carers will be involved together with educators and youth workers. This action will stimulate the production of creative online content, empower the younger generation and help create a safer environment. With the support of competent authorities this measure will help combat cyber child abuse and exploitation. 3. Empowering vulnerable/minority groups and the elderly Initiate an ongoing programme designed to assist every citizen, in par- ticular the ageing and the vulnerable to harness the potential of ICT.

Local firms must be encouraged and supported to embrace ICT to transform themselves into digital enterprises. This will strengthen their competitiveness and make them more export-orientated. Local ICT companies have an important role to play in bringing about this change. Increase and support ICT entrepreneurial activities. Support the application of ICT. Step up investments in R&I. Align the supply and demand of eSkills. Support local businesses to be more innovative and offer more competitive products and services. The goals of the actions under this strategic pillar are to: National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 31 5.2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES Because of the country’s size and limited resources, ICT should be used in a strategic way, as an enabler of growth and innovation, and as a driver of economies of scale and pools of knowledge. A. Collaboration between the main local players in the ICT field will be fostered. User communities, ICT specialists and other professionals in ICT-enabled or supporting services will be encouraged to pool their resources to focus on generating products and services which are not just technological, but adaptive and value creating and able to serve both business and everyday needs. B. C. All stakeholders must aim to develop an environment that is conducive to business. Partnerships within the EU and with other countries in the region should be established to provide a platform for cooperation. ICT-based R&I investment needs to be directed at niches and sectors of the economy that are already strong and areas of specialisation identified in the National Research and Innovation Strategy 2020. D. Business sustainability and growth will be facilitated, and emergent economic opportunities will be exploited. E. Students and young entrepreneurs will be encouraged and supported to make use of local innovation/ incubation centres. F. Local stakeholders will be supported to participate in funding programmes supportive of local incubation centres and related efforts to gain international exposure. G. 32 Transform the way Business operate. Digital Malta will increase competitiveness and boost the attractiveness of local industry. It will promote more start-ups, attract foreign investment, enable strategic alliances, encourage angel investment and nurture niche service providers. Business will be encouraged and supported to exploit (i) the opportunities of the European Digital Single Market, (ii) Malta’s strategic location in the Mediterranean, with ready access to the European and North African markets, (iii) Government’s strategic alliances with foreign ICT organisations, (iv) opportunities to expand into new or bigger markets. National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 33 34 5.3 ACTIONS TRANSFORMING BUSINESS Demographic change, globalisation, and more recently, the worldwide economic crisis have placed strains on industry. There have been radical changes in societal patterns and technology, leading to changed business models and increased competition. The business landscape is complex but industries will always seek to identify opportunities to capitalise on. ICT can serve as an important enabler for businesses in their transformation. 12. ICT initiatives for sectors facing stiff competition Government, working with industry, will organise a series of initiatives for sectors facing stiff competition (e.g. manufacturing, construction and retail) to help them benefit from ICT. 13. Forum for the transformation of industries through ICT A forum will be established, comprising of executives from leading local firms and industry representative bodies. The forum’s mandate will be to develop programmes to raise awareness about how ICT can help industries transform themselves and become more profitable. The Forum will discuss issues such as internationalisation, eCommerce, the use of social networking as a business tool, the benefits of NGA networks, self- regulation, compliance with web accessibility guidelines, and supply chain management. 14. ICT capability framework for SMEs and co-operatives A framework will be developed to enable local SMEs and co-operatives to assess their ICT capability, human capital and ICT-enabled processes and technology. This will be supported by ‘benchmarking’ and roadmaps to enable these organisations to improve performance and derive increased ICT business value from their human, technical and operational assets. 15. ICT training programmes Government will support enterprises by administering ICT training programmes for their employees. The programmes will focus on unskilled and semi-skilled workers with the objective of improving their productivity, employability and mobility. They will also promote understanding of new business models enabled through technology. In parallel, ICT up-skilling and re-skilling programmes will be re-introduced. 5 DIGITAL BUSINESS National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 35 SUSTAINING ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ATTRACTING NEW BUSINESSES The size, structure and type of ownership of many local enterprises, a tendency towards risk-aversion and a perceived lack of funding, support mechanisms and incentives all run counter to the culture of entrepreneurship needed for an innovation economy and towards attracting FDI. There are a number of ICT-themed measures that can be taken to support and improve the level of business entrepreneurial activity in Malta. 16. Supporting entrepreneurship Collaborating with stakeholders, government will: Invest resources to cultivate a widespread entrepreneurial mind-set, allowing for the launch of more ICT start-ups and young high-growth ventures exploiting ICTs. Special emphasis will be devoted to Gozo- based entrepreneurial initiatives in view of the island’s difficulties in developing a mature ICT industry. Facilitate improved ‘access to capital’ programmes for start-ups, micro and small firms. This includes the setting up of a business angels network, incentives for crowd-funding and other investor schemes. Provide firms with incentives to deploy advanced ICT services in unprofitable areas. These could be interest-free credit, subsidies, or preferential tax rates. 17. Attracting FDI in ICT Measures will be taken to attract foreign ICT companies with the objective of transforming Malta into a regional hub for technological cooperation and trade. These will include: Corporate packages, structures and business models that target FDI in ICT ventures, start-ups, ICT educational collaborations and niche markets such as digital games, mobile apps and other creative content. Actively supporting SmartCity Malta and others involved in incubation or innovation activities. 18. Cloud Computing The government in partnership with industry will develop a strategy on ‘Cloud Computing’ aimed at establishing Malta as a world-class hub for the provision of cloud computing services, boosting innovation and productivity across the digital economy. 19. Digital Gaming Execute a Digital Games strategy in an attempt to strengthen what Malta offers operators in the sector, including improving the specialist skills base. 36 ECOMMERCE - GOING GLOBAL The local ICT Industry is a vital part of the economy, but it must target international markets if it is to advance. Digital technologies provide significant opportunities for growth through exporting. eCommerce extends boundaries. Products and services can be easily marketed and traded over the Internet, expanding markets from neighbourhood to global. While local firms can gain substantially from such opportunity, they also need to manage the challenges of eCommerce. 20. Widening horizons Government, working with industry bodies, will develop policies and incentives to: Enable ICT clusters to flourish. Technology development, innovation and internationalisation should be the main focus of clustering activity. Support may include seed funding, market intelligence services, and internationalisation services. Exploit Malta’s eGovernment expertise to develop training and consultancy services for other countries, especially those with cultural or traditional links in the Mediterranean or the Commonwealth. Promote the concept of ‘Born Global’ products and services. 21. ICT-focused incentive schemes Incentive schemes and voucher-based credit lines will be developed to enable local SMEs and co-operatives to benefit from free or subsidised consultancy services. This will help them adopt digital technology and innovative business models to both establish themselves online and internationalise their products and services. 22. eCommerce markets Government and industry stakeholders will: Develop measures to sustain and grow the local eCommerce market on both the supply and demand sides. Implement initiatives to assist and further drive the adoption of eCommerce by business sectors with the potential to capitalise on web technologies and penetrate foreign markets. Identify opportunities for Malta to attract business activities that operate or support global eCommerce markets. 23. Emerging electronic transactions Government, working with payment providers, will develop an education programme to explain and promote different forms of electronic transactions and emerging monetisation models. The programme will explain business models, technologies, costs and risks. 5 DIGITAL BUSINESS National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 37 STIMULATING RESEARCH & INNOVATION Besides being a sector in its own right, ICT is a horizontal enabler for R&I. There needs to be continued investment in both ICT infrastructures, and innovation using ICT, as identified in the National R&I Strategy 2020. The two lines of investment are mutually reinforcing, as investment in ICT infrastructure and human capital provides the way for ICT-based innovation. 24. Harnessing international R&I funding Local ICT companies need to take advantage of pan-European and international R&I funding frameworks and industrial development funding opportunities. To help in this, government will: Provide logistical and brokerage support. Offer incentives to companies to invest time and human resources researching and developing innovative products, processes, and services and new marketing methods. 25. Open innovation Government will set up a multi-stakeholder Innovation Centre to offer incentives for ICT-themed R&D, idea-generation, incubation and innovation with a view towards co-creation and open innovation. Its purpose will be to: Create an environment to enable open collaboration by enterprises, academic institutions and public bodies wishing to engage in R&I activities, particularly projects requiring testing and validation in real- life settings. Attract multi-national enterprises, contributing different technological platforms and expertise. Provide mentorship, specialised training and an alternative ICT incubation facility for young entrepreneurs, students and start- ups wishing to test and demonstrate their innovations in a live environment. Serve as a networking hub and a show-case of locally developed talent and products. 38 6 DIGITAL GOVERNMENT 6.1 GOALS Government services should be designed around the requirements of the people. They need to be more user-friendly and less burdened by red tape. They should be accessible through multiple channels. The concept of service to the community needs to be expanded so that government involves citizens and businesses in decision-making processes.

National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 65 10.1 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS A suite of factors are critical for attaining the vision: Adequate funding. Continuous engagement with stakeholders. Re-skilling of government employees and creating new structures and roles. Strong political leadership, solid governance and commitment by all stakeholders to implement the initiatives. Good programme and project management throughout the life- cycle of initiatives. A culture of sharing of resources (accompanied by supportive business frameworks) across and between stakeholders. Government, business, organisations, leaders and individuals being more creative and open to experimentation with new technologies and methods. 66 10.2 POLITICAL LEADERSHIP Within the public sector, the goals identified in Digital Malta will be considered as high priority and strategic direction will be given. Politically championing the Strategy at the most senior level, and securing ownership from the respective areas, is fundamental for success. The Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, will champion the attainment of Digital Malta through political will, supportive policy and adequate funding. The Ministry / Parliamentary Secretariat responsible for the Digital Economy will provide focus on ultimate goals, overall governance and the engagement of relevant parties. Senior figures within government will own and be accountable for actions and initiatives. 10.3 GOVERNING BODY Strong governance will support the leaders. It will enable management of the dependencies and interactions between players and mitigate the risks associated with adopting different policies and implementing various actions. Stakeholders need to work closely together to overcome challenges. A governing body, representing the primary stakeholders, will be established. It will report to the Ministry / Parliamentary Secretariat responsible for the Digital Economy and will: Oversee the implementation of the Strategy ensuring the necessary commitment, engagement and collaboration of stakeholders. Provide leadership, mentorship and support to stakeholders in understanding and implementing the Strategy. Approve a programme of initiatives within the public sector on a yearly basis. Oversee progress and provide direction on major ICT investment. Develop a framework and tools to measure the benefits gained from the digital experience, and make the results accessible to all. Market and promote the Strategy and associated actions and initiatives. Celebrate and share success-stories. Re-calibrate the Strategy as necessary. A sub-committee will be setup to determine yearly ICT budgets and to ensure savings from ICT projects are reinvested in ICT. 10 ATTAINING THE VISION National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 67 ICT Malta will be set up on similar basis to Finance Malta. It will be led by the business community and will have objectives to: Promote and market Malta to attract ICT investments; Assist the local ICT industry to penetrate the global market; Promote ownership of the Malta brand among all stakeholders; Synergise business sectors to create ICT areas of strength (e.g. software development), to contribute towards economic growth. Citizen and Business Champions. Two individuals will be appointed to champion ‘Digital Citizen’ and ‘Digital Business’ activities. They will be the central contact point for initiatives within these two strategic themes and will lead their implementation. A Digital Society Stakeholder Forum will be established for civil society, government and industry to discuss how ICT is impacting society, and how it can be used to create better social cohesion. The Forum will look at eInclusion, digital citizenship and Internet safety; it will propose policy to government and encourage industry self-regulation. A Forum for Internet Safety and minors will be set up to bring together the MCA, the Commissioner for Children, FSWS, the Education Directorates, the Malta Police Force, industry representatives and others to share knowledge and to monitor developments. The Forum will put forward policy ideas and represent Malta on European bodies working in this field. An FDI multi-stakeholder committee will be responsible for designing corporate packages specifically targeting ICT multinationals. Special attention will be reserved for promoting and facilitating knowledge economy investments in Gozo. The committee will include stakeholders from public, private and independent bodies from both Malta and Gozo. An entity will be responsible for the coordination of national cyber security efforts. This entity will be also responsible for the creation, maintenance and governance of the National Cyber Security Strategy. A Data Governance Council will provide strategic direction for data related issues and decisions. 10.4 OPERATIONAL BODIES The Digital Malta Strategy will be supported by a yearly ‘Programme of Initiatives.’ Initiatives will be identified and scoped by the respective owners and submitted to the Digital Malta Governing Body in the form of a business case for approval and prioritisation. Once this is done, the respective owners will take measures to secure the necessary funding and to drive implementation in line with the direction provided. In this regard, at different stages of the Strategy timeline, various organisations, entities and individuals will be involved. A number of new functions will be established: 68 The MITA will continue to drive government’s ICT policy, programmes and initiatives within Malta. The MCA will, in line with its regulatory remit, continue to ensure an optimal environment for the deployment of multiple high speed fixed and mobile networks, while promoting public and business uptake of ICT. ME and MCST will promote Digital Malta in their spheres. The FITA will be given a stronger role to build and promote accessibility standards across government and industry. The Ministry and Entity’s Office of CIOs will be responsible for developing, managing and implementing the Ministry’s ICT strategy and an ICT programme plan as directed by Digital Malta. The Office of CIOs will be strengthened to ensure that these Offices are in a position to successfully deliver. Structures responsible for combating cyber crime and supporting Critical Information Infrastructure Protection, especially those relating to CSIRT Malta, will be reinforced. Furthermore, National early warning cyber security advisory capability and National law enforcement agencies will be strengthened. The Malta Internet Governance Forum will serve as the national platform for the protection of human rights and democracy on the Internet. The Forum will be open to all local stakeholders. Its aims will include activities to promote data protection and privacy; coordinate cooperation against cyber crime and maximise the Internet’s potential to promote democracy and cultural diversity. eSkills Malta Foundation - Government will transform the eSkills Alliance into a purpose foundation giving it more independence, strength and agility. 10.5 SUPPORT FUNCTIONS The execution of the Strategy also requires the creation or strengthening of a number of support functions including: Planning and budgeting, monitoring and auditing, and marketing of the Strategy. Foundation of bodies with a similar aim of increasing proliferation of ICT across the island. These support functions will work in liaison with the operational bodies to reap the benefits that result from continuous collaboration. In addition, where appropriate, the remit, the strategic direction, the structures and the operations of existing organisations will be aligned in such a way so as to be in a stronger position to implement this Strategy: 10 ATTAINING THE VISION National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 69 70 11 MEASURING SUCCESS Digital Malta has bold goals in order to deliver a better quality of life and sustained economic growth. The Strategy will be measurable and transparent, allowing all stakeholders to track its success. It will continually be monitored by the Governing Body. Reports will be presented on qualitative and quantitative assessments and progress achieved. The monitoring will also guide the re-calibration of Digital Malta, so that it remains equipped to satisfy evolving needs. National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 71 72 11 MEASURING SUCCESS PLANNING MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION CO-ORDINATION with budget processes, other strategies and stakeholders PARTICIPATION ensure participation and build trust Fig. 10 MEASURING DIGITAL MALTA An open and participatory approach will be adopted when measuring success. National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 73 11.1 PERFORMANCE TARGETS The following DAE targets are adopted for the Digital Malta Strategy: Malta has already achieved the ‘Broadband coverage for all by 2013’ target.

Qualitative evaluations, identifying the extent of implementation and benefits delivered to citizens, business and government. Assessments, surveys and audits analysing specific areas. 74 11.3 BENCHMARKING EXERCISES Various international organisations carry out studies to measure and compare the performance of different countries. These measures will also be used by the Governing Body to gauge success: Eurostat - Information Society Indicators Percentage of Individuals using the Internet for interaction with public authorities Percentage of Individuals using the Internet for interaction with public authorities, by type of interaction Percentage of enterprises using the Internet for interaction with public authorities PC and Internet penetration rates for business of different sizes Percentage of Enterprises having purchased online Percentage of Enterprises having received orders online Size of ICT workforce Contribution of ICT sector to GDP Contribution of ICT enabled sectors to GDP Total eCommerce export (or percentage of enterprises exporting through eCommerce) Total percentage of eCommerce trade within the local market World Economic Forum - The Networked Readiness Index Environment index Readiness index Usage index Impact United Nations - eGovernment Indices eGovernment development index Online Service index Telecommunication infrastructure index eParticipation index European Commission - eGovernment benchmarking User-centric government Transparent government Citizen mobility Business mobility Key enablers Effective government eGovernment use INSEAD & Singaporean Human Capital Institute – Global Talent Competitiveness Index Enablers Attract Grow Retain Labour and Vocational Global Knowledge 11 MEASURING SUCCESS National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 75 11.4 QUALITATIVE EVALUATIONS In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative criteria will be used to assess whether or not: ICT has contributed towards improving the economic competitiveness of the country. ICT has brought sustained improvements in the quality of life of Maltese citizens. ICT has enabled sustainable economic growth in business. The Maltese public are constructively engaged in realising Digital Malta. Government is more efficient and more open. Areas of ICT skills shortages have been addressed. Malta has a sound legal basis and regulatory framework for digital growth. The Maltese ICT community has critical mass, access to resources and supporting infrastructure. 76 11.5 SPECIFIC ASSESSMENTS The rhythm of achievement will be monitored by closely observing specific areas. This will be done through assessing: The readiness and use of ICT by local entrepreneurs to determine levels of access, skills, perceptions and technology foresight. The extent of use of ICT by SMEs in Malta. The supply chain level of automation by industry sectors. The readiness of logistics services. The entrepreneurial culture and ICT integration within local business. The readiness of Maltese enterprises to internationalise. The attributes of non-users, particularly in relation to access, affordability and perceived uses. Focus will be on working adults, the unemployed and the elderly. The use of ICT, perceptions and competence levels of the Maltese. The level of satisfaction of users of online government services. The National Cyber Security Strategy based on considerations issued by International Organisations e.g. the ENISA 18. The realisation of benefits and value for money audits. 18.

We as a country need to embrace  technology, set a path and ensure we use it well. The Digital Malta Strategy is that path.  It is important that all our people are involved in the advance of the Maltese economy. Nobody  should be left behind. This Strategy not only results from a wide consultation but also from an  underlying deep concern to involve everyone. In its pages are actions and commitments to turn us  into a digital society.  Information and Communications Technology is an important industry in itself, while just about every  other industry depends on ICT to thrive. This strategy will encourage innovation and entrepreneurial  ventures and will help all businesses remain competitive and fight their corner in the global economy.  There is also a clear message here that Malta is a good place to set up business. We not only  offer the European open market, and good links with Africa and the Middle East, but we are well  positioned on the digital superhighway. We are accelerating in the fast lane of technology and don’t  intend to take our foot off the pedal.  The road ahead is a lot clearer because of the Digital Malta Strategy. I encourage you to be part of it.  Foreword by  JOSEPH MUSCAT  Prime Minister  4    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 5  We live in a competitive world. We can buy products from around the corner or thousands  of miles away. And what we make we can sell in the local shop or to a market of millions. This is the  global economy.   Barriers have come tumbling down. We can be continents apart yet communicate in an instant. The  world is more inter-connected and that is the way it will stay.  In both government and business there has been recognition of the need to understand new  technology and utilise it. But could we be doing more? The answer is yes. We would be foolish to  allow ourselves to lag behind our competitors.   The Digital Malta Strategy sets out how everyone can learn, broaden their skills and make good use  of technology. It sets out what we should be doing for the next few years, but it is also flexible in that  it recognises how fast technology changes and puts us on alert for future developments. The young  are born into modern technology and have never known a world without gaming, mobiles and the  Internet. Grandparents may not be so enthusiastic with gadgetry yet they still delight in video chats  with their grandchildren on the other side of the world. And everybody else is constantly living in an  online world of email, social media and the web. Government has increasingly put its services online  and there can be few businesses not powered by technology.   Technology matters to us all, and that is why the Digital Malta Strategy is so important. It is the way  forward for all Maltese.  Foreword by  EDWARD ZAMMIT LEWIS  Parliamentary Secretary     6  1  ICT can empower the economy and society,  directly and indirectly. It is both critical  infrastructure and an enabling tool. Malta  recognises this and government is setting out a  vision to transform the country into one which  will prosper as a digitally-enabled nation in all  sectors of society.    This will be done through the implementation  of this strategy, which is being branded as  Digital Malta.  INTRODUCTION  1. The term ‘digital’ within this text refers to the application   of information and communication technology    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 7    8  The Strategy outlines three strategic themes -   Digital Citizen, Digital Business and Digital Government,  and these are supported by three strategic enablers: Regulation and   Legislation, Infrastructure and Human Capital.    The Strategy puts forward a suite of guiding principles and actions for  ICT to be used for socio-economic development.  It sets out how ICT can  make a difference in areas such as the economy, employment, industry  and small businesses, and how it can be used for national development, to  empower citizens and transform government.  It encourages everyone to  reap the benefits that ICT can bring: better education, stronger businesses,  efficient Government, sustainable economic growth and much more.  Truly, it can provide a better quality of life for the Maltese. It is essential  that the benefits of this nation’s knowledge society are enjoyed by every  citizen irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, education,  economic means or race.  This will be achieved through intervention to  circumvent obstacles. There will be action to enhance digital literacy and  social equality, increase access for all and stimulate local content.   1  INTRODUCTION    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 9  The ICT industry in Malta has achieved  substantial growth in the past decade.  Excluding the iGaming sector, it now accounts  for more than 5% of the nation’s GDP. Besides  being a sector in its own right, ICT also helps  other business sectors to develop and grow.  It is the enabler of the smart specialisation  areas identified in the National Research and  Innovation Strategy 2020.  The Digital Malta  Strategy has been designed to foster a strong,  competitive, ICT-enabled and export-oriented  industry, able to compete globally. It will also  propel ICT further in sustaining business and  innovation, contributing to economic growth.  Innovative application of ICT is also a crucial  catalyst in the transformation of government.   Sophisticated ICT implementations carry little  value if citizens and businesses are not able to  use public services or participate in the policy  making process in meaningful ways.  This  strategy advocates the re-engineering of public  services to achieve greater responsiveness  to citizen and business needs, using multiple  channels.  Government will have an open  approach to communicating and sharing  information following the principles of  transparency, participation and collaboration.  Technology is continually advancing so this  strategic plan will not, in the conventional  jargon of management, be limited only to  rational policy interventions. The Digital Malta  Strategy is pragmatic, and flexible enough to  react to future developments. There is high-level  strategic direction that allows entities flexibility  in implementation.    Digital Malta is not just a Strategy to provide  national policy direction on ICT initiatives  covering 2014-2020. It also constitutes a  framework, permitting policy makers, business  leaders and entrepreneurs to take decisions now  knowing they will be supported by policy that is  responsive to the technological advances of the  coming years.  The Digital Malta vision is ambitious. The  path towards achieving it will no doubt need  refinement and, sometimes major updating,  because today’s assumptions will carry  diminished significance as events unravel and  competitive advantages shift.  These refinements  will be reflected in the Programme of Initiatives  complementing the Digital Malta Strategy. Each  year a recalibration of the Initiatives will take  place after measuring outcomes and targets  achieved.  This document is the result of an extensive  consultative process.  The first phase covered  a series of consultation workshops with ICT  stakeholders from the public and private sectors,  associations and other interest groups from  civil society, as well as the public at large.  The  second phase included more focused discussions  with stakeholders involved in the eventual  implementation and ownership of parts of  the Strategy.  This consultative approach will  continue during the life-time of the Strategy.  Digital Malta reflects the collective aspirations  and goodwill of stakeholders, structured in  the form of a national plan owned by the  stakeholders themselves. It is a journey that all  stakeholders will nurture to attain a vision of  where Malta wants to be.      10  2  Malta has shown remarkable resilience in the  face of the sovereign debt crisis that affected  many other countries in Europe 2. Nevertheless,  the crisis cannot be ignored because of the  exposure that comes from having a small, open  economy.  Indeed, in May 2013, the European  Commission recommended that Malta be  placed under an Excessive Deficit Procedure  and called for reforms in pensions, healthcare  and sustainable public finances.  According  to Eurostat, the unemployment rate in Malta  ranks among the lowest in the EU and, in 2013,  the inflation rate fell to 1.38% compared to  2.72% and 2.42% in 2011 and 2012 respectively.   The rate of economic growth for 2013 was  higher than expected 3 and a growth of 1.7% is  projected for 2014 4.    THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE:  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES  2.

National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 11    12  In the GCI for 2013-2014, Malta has climbed six places and now ranks number 41, out of 148  countries 5.  Switzerland, Singapore and Finland are ranked in the top three positions.  Compared to  other European countries, Malta is placed 17th 6.  Among southern European countries, France and  Spain performed better than Malta, while Italy, Turkey, Portugal and Cyprus performed worse.  The  results are encouraging, but there is no room for complacency and Malta should actively strive to  improve its competitiveness.  A strong digital economy is central to any country’s competitiveness,  growth and jobs strategy.  Our technological readiness is vital in this regard, with Malta ranking 16th  in the Technology Readiness index (Fig. 1).  5.

(Source: World Economic Forum)  Fig. 1    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 13  Universally, ICT is acknowledged as a fundamental  enabler and one of the pillars for socio-economic  development.  The past ten years have seen a  rapid growth of the ICT industry in Malta.   ICT  contributes circa 5.7% value-added to national  GDP 7 (Fig. 2) and employs 3.3% of a population  of 165,300 gainfully employed 8 (Fig. 3).        In 2013, the World Economic Forum ranked  Malta in 28th place (out of 138 countries) in  its Networked Readiness Index (Fig. 4), which  measures the preparedness of an economy  to use ICT to boost competitiveness and well  being.  Malta also featured in fourth place for the  importance of ICT to the government vision and  in fifth place for successfully promoting the use  of ICT within the country 9. The fact that there is  political consensus on ICT strategic direction is a  strength.  7. Source: NSO – Gross Domestic Product.

Although the ICT footprint is  increasing, not all homes, schools, or businesses  have taken it up or are using it as they could.  Compared to other EU countries, Malta falls  behind in the numbers using the Internet,  uploading self-created content, using Internet  banking, taking online courses, and looking for a  job or sending a job application.  SMEs and start-up companies need  encouragement to see ICT more as a tool for  reducing costs, innovating and gaining access  to wider markets. Citizens are expecting ICT to  play a more significant role in the next generation  of healthcare services; it shall enable patient  empowerment, and safer and more  personalised care.  2  THE LOCAL ICT LANDSCAPE  NETWORKED READINESS INDEX MALTA RANKS 28 OUT OF 138 COUNTRIES.  (Source: World Economic Forum)  Fig. 4    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 15  People with age-related  dependencies or different  abilities need to be empowered  to stay active, live independently  and avoid institutionalisation.  All citizens, including those at  risk of exclusion (for example,  those with different abilities,  low digital literacy/eSkills), need  access to smart environments  and innovative services.  Over the past decade ICT has  become integrated in schools,  with all pupils having access  to computers and the Internet.   Yet, building capacity in  education remains a challenge.  It is important that teachers  have the skills to harness  eLearning materials. Teaching  methods need updating and  there must be sufficient digital  content for students to gain full  advantage of the benefits of ICT.    Greater effort is needed to  encourage learning among  unskilled working-age adults,  the elderly and people with  disabilities.  Those without  eSkills risk not reaping benefits  from ICT, both in terms of  earnings and job prospects.  ICT  offers great potential to bring  the unemployed back into the  workforce.  HUMAN CAPITAL  The industry, both the ICT- producing and the ICT-using  sectors, are supported by  experienced, efficient, skilled  and multi-lingual professionals.   In 2012, Eurostat reported that  Malta ranked in 23rd position  out of the EU27+ in terms of  computer skills. Between the  2007 and 2012, the average  number of ICT-related graduates  from the University of Malta was  151.  The highest number of ICT  graduates from the University  of Malta was registered in 2011  with 197 – a share of 6.8% of all  graduates.  During the same  period, the average number of   graduates from the ICT Institute  within MCAST, which is the  country’s leading vocational  education and training institution,  in levels 5 & 6 was 542 graduates.    Work practices are flexible and  unit labour costs are generally  competitive and responsive  to market conditions.  These  attributes are complemented by  a competitive tax regime.   Within the ICT labour market,  the low female participation rate,  the misalignment between the  ICT education curriculum and  industry needs (such as the lack of  specialised skills for the iGaming  sector) and the lack of supportive  education are serious weaknesses.   These are hampering resource  capacity, resource readiness and  innovation.    The arrival of ‘cheaper’ skilled  competitors, particularly from  the Baltic region, Eastern  Europe and Asia, poses a new  threat to the digital industry in  Malta.     Source: Eurostat  Fig. 5    16  THE CHALLENGES  FOR THE LOCAL ICT INDUSTRY  Similar to other industries, it is clear that the ICT  industry in Malta is past the stage where it can  attempt to achieve higher levels of economic activity  on the basis of low labour costs.  Incentive packages  are no longer sufficient in attracting investment,  because today there are equally attractive incentives  in other countries.  Investors seek profitable  opportunities in countries offering the best prospects  in terms of competitiveness.  If Malta is to improve  its performance in attracting FDI, greater focus on  knowledge and innovation-based investment and on  economic efficiency 10 is needed.  These factors  carry the promise of sustained growth in the  wealth-generating capacity of the Digital Economy.   SMEs within the ICT industry know that their main  weakness in terms of growth is the small size of the  local market.  Some of these businesses are adopting  a more outward-looking entrepreneurial culture that  is focused on exports rather than relying on short- term advantages in the captive domestic market.   However, these SMEs face a multitude of difficulties.   The World Economic Forum has identified a list of  problematic factors for doing business in Malta.  The  top three are inefficient government bureaucracy,  limited access to financing and insufficient capacity  to innovate.  Malta also lacks the adequate schemes  for business angel investors 11, who are generally  needed by start-ups to take off, and by established  ICT businesses to expand.  This may reflect Malta’s  entrepreneurial culture, which tends towards lower  risk or conventional “bricks-and-mortar” ventures.   Currently, most local ICT companies are software  services and hybrid solution providers and  integrators.  Few qualify as software products  companies, deriving well over half of their sales from  licence fees.  This may suggest that less intellectual  property, inherent in the software being developed,  can be translated into patents or copyrights.   Similarly, the lack of participation and contribution   in open source communities limits the exposure of  Maltese skills and the potential to increase FDI.  The small size of the Maltese islands presents special  opportunities for the ICT industry.  These include  the deployment of “first-in-the-world” nation-wide  projects or “test bed” projects in strategic alliances  with ICT multinational companies.  Highlighting  these opportunities is important in FDI strategy,  especially when it comes to targeting ICT investment  and building partnerships. With important events  due to take place, with ‘including the hosting of  the CHOGM in 2015, Malta’s EU Presidency during  the first half of 2017 and Valletta as the European  Capital of Culture in 2018, now is the time to launch a  branding exercise.  TRUE VALUE TO CITIZENS  For the past twenty years, government has  substantially invested in ICT.  Government capitalised  on the lack of complexity in Malta compared to  large countries, which often have two or more levels  and branches of administration, multiple police  forces, several courts of justice and region-based  healthcare systems. Government adopted policies  favouring the consolidation of its investments, as  well as standards to support such policies.  This led  to the adoption of corporate systems and shared  services across all departments. A robust and  resilient ICT infrastructure forms the back-bone  of an interconnected government.  Most of these  initiatives were implemented in partnership with  the private sector.  Government also established a  strong governance framework and strengthened the  eCommerce legislative framework.  More recently,  Government inaugurated a TIER III Data Centre, 12   hosting government infrastructure and information  systems.

In order  to widen government efficiency, ICT champions are  required in important decision-making positions  and ICT strategies need to be integrated into overall  government policy.   Malta is considered one of Europe’s high performers  in delivering eGovernment.  The country is constantly  improving its eGovernment platform to ensure  that the number of services available online can  increase without a proportionate increase in cost and  complexity.  The platform’s architecture promotes  reusability and scalability.  In the eGovernment  Benchmark 2012 report, Malta ranked first in four  benchmarks (user-centric government, transparent   government, citizen mobility, business mobility)  and second in the enablers benchmark.  The 2012  report also highlighted that eGovernment users are  expecting more from the services being supplied.   Statistics from Eurostat highlight that the take-up  of public online services by citizens is below the  EU average.  Malta ranked 18th (Fig. 6) in terms  of percentage of individuals using eGovernment  services and 15th (Fig. 7) in terms of enterprises  using the Internet to interact with government.   The messages are clear.  Users want to interact on  everything from health and education to security and  tax.  They expect government to focus on finding out  what citizens want, rather than deciding what they  need.  Citizens are also expecting government to cut  red tape.  The development of Digital Government  has to be hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce  bureaucracy.

It nurtures the concept of connected  government through the alignment of departmental processes, standardisation, discovery and reuse  of ICT assets and continuous rigour in improving the level of trust in the services provided by the  public sector.  Implementation of information systems within the public sector needs to incorporate  the principles and recommendations of initiatives such as the European Interoperability Framework,  European Interoperability Strategy and the semantic initiatives promoted through the European  Commission’s Joinup platform13.  National technological infrastructure is in a good shape and compares quite favourably at an  international level (Table 1).  Malta has an impressive proliferation of mobile telephony and Internet  access. Similarly, there is high digital confidence by consumers.  By 2012, the mobile penetration  rate in Malta reached 132%, slightly higher than the EU average of 130%14.  In 2012, 77% of households  had access to the Internet – slightly higher than the EU27 average of 76%.  In this regard, the main  concerns are the dependence on other countries for Internet connection, the capacity of international  connectivity, the affordability of broadband for users and the lack of local content for the web and  mobile devices15.   The new enterprise ICT landscape of cloud services, mobility and BYOD, and social media usage,  creates very different types of network traffic to the traditional mix of in-house client-server workloads.   Architecture and networks need to evolve to keep pace.  Not only is more bandwidth required to  accommodate the workloads involved, but also time delay must be avoided. Lower latency, particularly  over wide-area networks, is needed to ensure good response times for cloud-based applications and  other services.

Participation in  EU-funded projects by government bodies may  need increased resource and legal governance  support. Government needs to consider innovative  means to procure ICT services, explore the  feasibility of private funding and public-private  partnerships, and consider the prospect of re-using  and sharing with other countries.      In the past, R&I strategies for ICT had been  identified as a priority area. In the National Research  & Innovation Strategy 2020, ICT is now singled out  as an enabling technology for all sectors because  of its potential to innovate industries.  Since Malta’s  size cannot sustain the entire R&D life cycle, efforts  should be directed to applied research that is closer  to the market16 and in existing areas of strength  that could enhance Malta’s profile as a centre of  ICT excellence.  Many companies in Malta associate  R&D to the closed innovation model of larger  companies and multinationals.  In comparison, open  innovation approaches are more collaborative and  leverage complementarities, and are, therefore,  more adaptive to the needs of small businesses.  Combining industrial innovation with educational  policies and focusing on areas of strength (smart  specialisation) increases the chances of Malta and  its industrial base (both ICT and non-ICT) gaining a  competitive advantage through differentiation.  The contribution of ICT towards energy efficiency  in Malta is still marginally low.  ICT offers many  opportunities to offset the costs of energy  through green ICT measures, such as, energy  efficient equipment, virtualised environments, grid  computing, cloud computing, home automation  systems and advanced virtual services.  MAXIMISING OPPORTUNITIES  Malta’s ICT priorities are guided by government  strategic priorities and the Europe 2020 Strategy  flagship initiatives. More specifically these tie  in with the Digital Agenda for Europe and the  Innovation Union.  Malta already has strong  regulatory authorities and agencies including the  LGA, the MCA, the Government’s IT arm, MITA  and various other successful endeavours such  as the eSkills Malta Foundation, upon which it can  successfully build.   The expectations of what ICT can deliver, are  higher than ever and are likely to keep on  growing.  The main elements are in place for the  industry to prosper.  The challenges now are to  prioritise and implement the missing elements.  Malta’s ICT industry must emerge from its plateau  state and move quickly to exploit opportunities.   It needs to build on its strengths, minimise its  weaknesses and aim for sustained growth.   16. Source: MCST 2011.    20  3  Digital Malta will take ICT policy development and implementation  to a higher gear, meeting the expectations of all - the Citizen and  civil society, Business and government. This vision will be enabled  by supportive regulation and legislation, sound infrastructure and  productive human capital. These building blocks will empower  stakeholders to collaborate both within and across sectors.   This is represented by Fig. 8:  THE DIGITAL MALTA VISION  Digital Malta is a vision for the country in 2020 when:  “Malta will prosper as a digitally-enabled     nation in all sectors of society.” This is an exciting goal, advancing the nation’s digital economy to let business prosper and  improve the quality of people’s lives. To meet this vision there is a need to address the most  pressing strategic issues and capitalise on digital opportunities.  3.1  STRATEGIC THEMES    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 21  Fig. 8    22  Improve the wellbeing of  Citizens and civil society.  Everyone, including vulnerable  and minority groups, will benefit  from a higher standard of living.  Basic digital skills will empower  citizens to seize opportunities  presented by technology and  digitisation.  Digital services  will be affordable, secure and  accessible to all regardless  of skill and economic means.  Local digital content will be  encouraged.  Transform the way Business  operate. Digital Malta will  increase competitiveness and  boost the attractiveness of  local industry. It will promote  more start-ups, attract foreign  investment, enable strategic  alliances, encourage angel  investment and nurture niche  service providers.  Business will  be encouraged and supported  to exploit (i) the opportunities  of the European Digital Single  Market, (ii) Malta’s strategic  location in the Mediterranean,  with ready access to the  European and North African  markets, (iii) Government’s  strategic alliances with  foreign ICT organisations,  (iv) opportunities to expand into  new or bigger markets.  Enhance the delivery of  Government. Better application  of digitisation will result in  reduced bureaucracy, increased  efficiency and transparency.  The public service will be closer  to civil society and enterprises,  improving the government’s  decision-making processes.  Open Government and  eDemocracy will be facilitated.  On-line government services  will be more accessible through  the use of smart devices and  mobile-friendly applications  as well as websites and  social media. Government’s  technological capabilities will  be widened to include open- source, cloud computing and  big data concepts. Information  sharing across government  systems and services will be  promoted, as will be the re-use  of public sector information by  third parties.  These vertical strategic pillars need to be supported by a suite of enabling / driving forces:  Regulation & Legislation Of central importance will be  government’s direction and  priorities at a Strategic and  Digital Policy level. Regulation  and legislation will ensure an  empowered digital society is  realised. Good ICT governance  will be promoted, with  judicious use of resources and  participation by all stakeholders.  International best practices will  be adopted.    Infrastructure Infrastructure services need to  be accessible, reliable, secure,  affordable and resilient. They  shall provide for disaster  recovery where appropriate.    Investment by private sector,  will ensure fast broadband,  wifi, next-generation access and  robust government information  systems architecture.     Human Capital It is important to invest in  people to ensure the supply  of eSkills to meet the future  needs of different sectors.  Action will be taken to develop  a high quality specialised skills  base, maximising employment  opportunities, with an  emphasis on increasing female  participation and tackling  inequalities.   The portrayal of this six-pillar model, with a three-dimensional perspective, carries through to sectors  such as health, education, transport, justice, welfare and taxation, and themed areas of specialisation  identified in the ‘National Research and Innovation Strategy 2020’.  The diversity of each area and  sector will be taken into account when tailoring initiatives.  3  THE DIGITAL MALTA VISION  Digital Malta is built upon  three vertical strategic pillars  with clear goals to:    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 23  3.2  UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES  Core principles  underpin the  implementation of the  Digital Malta vision:  1. Ensuring all citizens  are offered the  possibility to  benefit from ICT as  a fundamental right.  2. Advocating  proactive  leadership,  and delivering  programmes that  meet needs.  3. Supporting national  priorities in line with  government policy,  the National Reform  Programme and the  EU obligations.   4. Engaging the  private sector  as an important  player in the  delivery of the  Strategy.  5. Optimising value  and accountability.  6. Ensuring  collaboration  between  stakeholders  to make the  best use of  national strategic  information  assets, encourage  synergies  and minimise  fragmentation.   7. Encouraging a more- environmentally  friendly society  through greener  procurement,  implementation and  application of ICT.   8. Supporting and enabling R&I in identified areas  of strength, capability and centres of excellence  (smart specialisation).  9. Adopting an open and  experimental mindset,  capitalising on lessons learned  from success stories and  respecting best practices and  international standards.  10. Maximising  opportunities from  multiple funding  sources, including  European and  international  funding  programmes and  the private sector.    24  4 DIGITAL CITIZEN  4.1  GOALS  Digital technologies can improve the quality of life of all citizens.  Every Maltese, irrespective of age,  gender, sexual orientation, disability, education, economic means and race should grow as a digital  citizen with rights, responsibilities and abilities to access and use ICT.  Digital technologies must serve  as a social equaliser, enabling everyone to participate and contribute in community activity.  Ease access to  technology and  connectivity, and  help citizens to  learn how to get  the best out of it.  The goals of the  actions under this  strategic pillar are  to:   Build trust in the  digital world.  Raise awareness  of how ICT can  improve daily life  and work.  Provide every  citizen with the  tools to balance  work with family  commitments,  pursue leisure and  lifelong learning,  and to remain  active within the  community.  Use digital  technologies to  preserve, enhance  and promote  Maltese culture  and identity, and  to enable access  to quality content  and services.  Build social  cohesion to  overcome social,  health, age  and disability  vulnerabilities.  Empower civil  society to become  more actively  engaged in digital  activities of the  community.    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 25  4.2  GUIDING PRINCIPLES  Citizens will be supported to:  i. Adopt digital technologies to help with their work and improve  their quality of life.  ii. Create value content that can be accessed through digital means. iii. Collaborate with others to make the Internet a safer place for   everyone. iv. Re-use public sector information while respecting privacy   legislation, national security and the need to protect intellectual  property rights of third parties.  v. Be innovative in applying digital technology.  A.  When planning  and implementing  digital initiatives,  feedback from  citizens and civil  society will be  sought.  Barriers that stop  citizens from  exploiting the  benefits of the  Internet must be  removed.   B.  C.    26  Improve the wellbeing of  Citizens and civil society.  Everyone, including vulnerable  and minority groups, will benefit  from a higher standard of living.  Basic digital skills will empower  citizens to seize opportunities  presented by technology and  digitisation.  Digital services  will be affordable, secure and  accessible to all regardless  of skill and economic means.  Local digital content will be  encouraged.    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 27    28  4.3  ACTIONS  ENHANCING DIGITAL LITERACY AND SOCIAL EQUALITY  Achieving widespread digital literacy is vital for inclusivity and social cohesion. For example, digitally  competent workers and digitally competent citizens can be more successful in the job market and  contribute more effectively within the community. Those without digital competences are in danger  of falling behind.  ICT offers people the tools to overcome limitations.  1. Basic level of ICT  competence  An education and awareness programme will be launched to boost  ICT competences, media literacy and confident, critical and safe use of  the Internet.  The programme will be implemented at community level.  Vulnerable groups will be a major focus.  2. Empowering the  young through a  safer Internet  Digital Citizenship will become part of the National Education Curriculum,  to equip children and youths with the abilities to interact and use the  Internet safely and intelligently. Parents and carers will be involved  together with educators and youth workers. This action will stimulate the  production of creative online content, empower the younger generation  and help create a safer environment.  With the support of competent  authorities this measure will help combat cyber child abuse and  exploitation.  3. Empowering  vulnerable/minority  groups and the  elderly  Initiate an ongoing programme designed to assist every citizen, in par- ticular the ageing and the vulnerable to harness the potential of ICT. Ap- propriately equipped ICT access and training centers will be set up within  local communities to support the programme.  4. Accessibility  and Assistive  Technology  Internet accessibility standards will be promoted to enable everyone,  irrespective of  disability, to navigate and access content to access and  use of assistive technologies will be promoted and facilitated to help  independent living of the elderly and vulnerable groups. This will also  stimulate market demand for diverse, affordable technologies.   4  DIGITAL CITIZEN    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 29  ACCESS FOR ALL  Every citizen, irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, economic means and  employment should have the opportunity to access and make use of ICT for their daily needs.  5. NGA Networks There will be promotion of NGA networks by demonstrating their  potential applications and by supporting their introduction in homes,  offices and public buildings.  6. Free access to  wireless Internet  There will be free access to wireless Internet in public buildings, main  squares and many public spaces around the islands.  7. Portable devices  for children  Portable devices will be provided for children, their teachers and LSAs as  part of the government’s vision of transforming formal education through  the use of digital technologies.  8. Citizen  Engagement  Contact with citizens and between citizens will be promoted, especially  through the use of mobile apps and social networking websites.   Guidelines on social media strategies for local government and NGOs  will be developed, encouraging them to act as intermediaries in a more  participative civil society.   9. Promote innovative  ICT applications  Innovative ICT applications that lead to a better lifestyle will be promoted  in a joint partnership with the private sector.  The initiative will focus on  developments that enhance daily activities such as shopping, banking,  commuting and entertainment.  STIMULATING LOCAL CONTENT  Relevant, alluring and engaging content drives people to make use of ICT. High quality local content  will draw more people online. The Internet offers the opportunity to overcome economic limitations,  and to reach households with greater ease. The Internet also offers unprecedented opportunities to  digitally preserve heritage.  10. Developing online  content  A programme will be established to support and stimulate the  development of high quality online content that is appealing, educational  and culturally distinctive. Government will support joint collaborations  between public and private media providers to produce, stream or make  available local digital content.   11. Maltese language  tools  Government will facilitate the development and distribution of language  tools to support the use of Maltese as a medium for teaching and learning,  and therefore widening take-up of ICT in the Maltese language.       30  5 DIGITAL BUSINESS  5.1  GOALS  Malta’s businesses will have a greater chance of success if powered by ICT. Local firms must be  encouraged and supported to embrace ICT to transform themselves into digital enterprises. This will  strengthen their competitiveness and make them more export-orientated. Local ICT companies have  an important role to play in bringing about this change.   Increase and  support ICT  entrepreneurial  activities.  Support the  application of  ICT.  Step up  investments  in R&I.  Align the supply  and demand of  eSkills.  Support local  businesses to be  more innovative  and offer more  competitive  products and  services.  The goals of the  actions under this  strategic pillar are  to:     National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 31  5.2  GUIDING PRINCIPLES  Because of the country’s size and limited resources, ICT should be  used in a strategic way, as an enabler of growth and innovation, and  as a driver of economies of scale and pools of knowledge.  A.  Collaboration between the main local  players in the ICT field will be fostered.   User communities, ICT specialists and  other professionals in ICT-enabled or  supporting services will be encouraged to  pool their resources to focus on generating  products and services which are not just  technological, but adaptive and value  creating and able to serve both business  and everyday needs.  B.  C. All stakeholders  must aim to  develop an  environment  that is conducive  to business.  Partnerships  within the EU  and with other  countries in the  region should be  established to  provide a platform  for cooperation.  ICT-based R&I  investment needs  to be directed at  niches and sectors  of the economy  that are already  strong and areas  of specialisation  identified in the  National Research  and Innovation  Strategy 2020.   D.  Business  sustainability  and growth will  be facilitated,  and emergent  economic  opportunities will  be exploited.    E. Students and young  entrepreneurs will  be encouraged  and supported  to make use of  local innovation/  incubation centres.  F.  Local stakeholders  will be supported  to participate  in funding  programmes  supportive of local  incubation centres  and related efforts  to gain international  exposure.  G.    32  Transform the way Business  operate. Digital Malta will  increase competitiveness and  boost the attractiveness of  local industry. It will promote  more start-ups, attract foreign  investment, enable strategic  alliances, encourage angel  investment and nurture niche  service providers.  Business will  be encouraged and supported  to exploit (i) the opportunities  of the European Digital Single  Market, (ii) Malta’s strategic  location in the Mediterranean,  with ready access to the  European and North African  markets, (iii) Government’s  strategic alliances with  foreign ICT organisations,  (iv) opportunities to expand into  new or bigger markets.    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 33    34  5.3  ACTIONS  TRANSFORMING BUSINESS   Demographic change, globalisation, and more recently, the worldwide economic crisis have placed  strains on industry. There have been radical changes in societal patterns and technology, leading to  changed business models and increased competition. The business landscape is complex but industries  will always seek to identify opportunities to capitalise on.  ICT can serve as an important enabler for  businesses in their transformation.  12. ICT initiatives for  sectors facing stiff  competition   Government, working with industry, will organise a series of initiatives  for sectors facing stiff competition (e.g. manufacturing, construction and  retail) to help them benefit from ICT.   13. Forum for the  transformation of  industries  through ICT   A forum will be established,  comprising of executives from leading local  firms and industry representative bodies. The forum’s mandate will be  to develop programmes to raise awareness about how ICT can help  industries transform themselves and become more profitable. The Forum  will discuss issues such as internationalisation, eCommerce, the use of  social networking as a business tool, the benefits of NGA networks, self- regulation, compliance with web accessibility guidelines, and supply chain  management.  14. ICT capability  framework for  SMEs and  co-operatives  A framework will be developed to enable local SMEs and co-operatives to  assess their ICT capability, human capital and ICT-enabled processes and  technology.  This will be supported by ‘benchmarking’ and roadmaps to  enable these organisations to improve performance and derive increased  ICT business value from their human, technical and operational assets.  15. ICT training  programmes  Government will support enterprises by administering ICT training  programmes for their employees.  The programmes will focus on unskilled  and semi-skilled workers with the objective of improving their productivity,  employability and mobility. They will also promote understanding of new  business models enabled through technology.  In parallel, ICT up-skilling  and re-skilling programmes will be re-introduced.    5  DIGITAL BUSINESS    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 35  SUSTAINING ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ATTRACTING NEW BUSINESSES  The size, structure and type of ownership of many local enterprises, a tendency towards risk-aversion  and a perceived lack of funding, support mechanisms and incentives all run counter to the culture of  entrepreneurship needed for an innovation economy and towards attracting FDI.  There are a number of ICT-themed measures that can be taken to support and improve the level of  business entrepreneurial activity in Malta.  16. Supporting  entrepreneurship  Collaborating with stakeholders, government will:      Invest resources to cultivate a widespread entrepreneurial mind-set,  allowing for the launch of more ICT start-ups and young high-growth  ventures exploiting ICTs.  Special emphasis will  be devoted to Gozo- based entrepreneurial initiatives in view of the island’s difficulties in  developing a mature ICT industry.      Facilitate improved ‘access to capital’ programmes for start-ups, micro  and small firms. This includes the setting up of a business angels  network, incentives for crowd-funding and other investor schemes.      Provide firms with incentives to deploy advanced ICT services in  unprofitable areas. These could be interest-free credit, subsidies, or  preferential tax rates.  17. Attracting FDI  in ICT  Measures will be taken to attract foreign ICT companies with the objective  of transforming Malta into a regional hub for technological cooperation  and trade.  These will include:      Corporate packages, structures and business models that target FDI  in ICT ventures, start-ups, ICT educational collaborations and niche  markets such as digital games, mobile apps and other creative content.      Actively supporting SmartCity Malta and others involved in incubation  or innovation activities.    18. Cloud Computing The government in partnership with industry will develop a strategy  on ‘Cloud Computing’ aimed at establishing Malta as a world-class hub  for the provision of cloud computing services, boosting innovation and  productivity across the digital economy.  19. Digital Gaming Execute a Digital Games strategy in an attempt to strengthen what Malta  offers operators in the sector, including improving the specialist skills base.       36  ECOMMERCE - GOING GLOBAL  The local ICT Industry is a vital part of the economy, but it must target international markets if it is to  advance.  Digital technologies provide significant opportunities for growth through exporting.  eCommerce extends boundaries. Products and services can be easily marketed and traded over the  Internet, expanding markets from neighbourhood to global.  While local firms can gain substantially  from such opportunity, they also need to manage the challenges of eCommerce.  20. Widening horizons Government, working with industry bodies, will develop policies and  incentives to:      Enable ICT clusters to flourish. Technology development, innovation  and internationalisation should be the main focus of clustering activity.  Support may include seed funding, market intelligence services, and  internationalisation services.      Exploit Malta’s eGovernment expertise to develop training and  consultancy services for other countries, especially those with cultural  or traditional links in the Mediterranean or the Commonwealth.      Promote the concept of ‘Born Global’ products and services.  21. ICT-focused  incentive schemes  Incentive schemes and voucher-based credit lines will be developed to  enable local SMEs and co-operatives to benefit from free or subsidised  consultancy services. This will help them adopt digital technology and  innovative business models to both establish themselves online and  internationalise their products and services.   22. eCommerce  markets  Government and industry stakeholders will:      Develop measures to sustain and grow the local eCommerce market  on both the supply and demand sides.      Implement initiatives to assist and further drive the adoption of  eCommerce by business sectors with the potential to capitalise on  web technologies and penetrate foreign markets.  Identify opportunities for Malta to attract business activities that operate  or support global eCommerce markets.  23. Emerging  electronic  transactions  Government, working with payment providers, will develop an education  programme to explain and promote different forms of electronic  transactions and emerging monetisation models. The programme will  explain business models, technologies, costs and risks.  5  DIGITAL BUSINESS    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 37  STIMULATING RESEARCH & INNOVATION  Besides being a sector in its own right, ICT is a horizontal enabler for R&I. There needs to be  continued investment in both ICT infrastructures, and innovation using ICT, as identified in the  National R&I Strategy 2020. The two lines of investment are mutually reinforcing, as investment in ICT  infrastructure and human capital provides the way for ICT-based innovation.  24. Harnessing  international R&I  funding   Local ICT companies need to take advantage of pan-European and  international R&I funding frameworks and industrial development funding  opportunities.  To help in this, government will:      Provide logistical and brokerage support.      Offer incentives to companies to invest time and human resources  researching and developing innovative products, processes, and  services and new marketing methods.  25. Open innovation Government will set up a multi-stakeholder Innovation Centre to offer  incentives for ICT-themed R&D, idea-generation, incubation and innovation  with a view towards co-creation and open innovation. Its purpose will be  to:      Create an environment to enable open collaboration by enterprises,  academic institutions and public bodies wishing to engage in R&I  activities, particularly projects requiring testing and validation in real- life settings.      Attract multi-national enterprises, contributing different technological  platforms and expertise.      Provide mentorship, specialised training and an alternative ICT  incubation facility for young entrepreneurs, students and start- ups wishing to test and demonstrate their innovations in a live  environment.      Serve as a networking hub and a show-case of locally developed talent  and products.    38  6 DIGITAL GOVERNMENT  6.1  GOALS  Government services should be designed around the requirements of the people. They need to  be more user-friendly and less burdened by red tape. They should be accessible through multiple  channels. The concept of service to the community needs to be expanded so that government  involves citizens and businesses in decision-making processes. In addition, public data, which  government creates, designs and manages, should be openly shared across entities and authorities,  and externally with third parties for their commercial re-use. This will prevent costly duplication and  re-invention.  Simplify existing  digital public  services.  The goals of the  actions under this  strategic pillar are  to:   Engage citizens  and increase  participation.  Promote higher  take-up of  eGovernment  services.  Make government  services accessible  through mobile  devices.   Extend  government  transparency and  eDemocracy. Stimulate greater   collaboration  between  international  partners,  government, local  enterprises and  citizens.  Enable fact-based  decision-making.   Encourage the  re-use of public  sector information.    National Digital Strategy 2014 – 2020 39  Online government  services will be  organised around  customers’ needs.   Businesses,  local councils,  community  learning centres  and the public  will have a role  in designing and  implementing  new or enhanced  services.    A.  6.2  GUIDING PRINCIPLES  New or enhanced  government  services will be  designed for the  web and mobile  platforms. Most  ICT services should  function equally  well across different  platforms and  devices.  C.  Government will  have an active  online presence  through social  media.  G.  Ministries and  entities17 will own  their ICT projects.  Only horizontal  services, shared  across government,  will be centrally  owned and  delivered.  H.  Government will  equip leaders and  decision makers to  be better tuned in  taking advantage  of technological  advancements.   Similarly,  government will  take measures to  cater for the needs  of digital employees  and to capitalise on  their digital skills.  E.  Online government services will meet EU  regulations and embrace EU building blocks  (e.g. eSignatures) in support of the EU  Single Market.   B.  Government will use technology, coupled  with business process reengineering,  to rethink and redesign resources. A  simplification of services will reduce paper  use, cut costs and lower the risks that arise  from cash handling.  D.  Government  systems will be  regularly assessed  for efficiency and,  when necessary,  be enhanced or  replaced.  F.  Government will adopt open standards,  encouraging the exchange of information and  innovation, while seeking healthy competition  and lower costs.  Equal consideration will be  given to open source and closed source software.  I.  Government  employees will  be supported by  innovative, flexible  technologies and  associated business  models.    J.  16. Authorities, Corporations,  Agencies and commercial  public sector entities in which  government has a majority  shareholding, and are not   listed on the stock exchange.    40  Enhance the delivery of  Government. Better application  of digitisation will result in  reduced bureaucracy, increased  efficiency and transparency.

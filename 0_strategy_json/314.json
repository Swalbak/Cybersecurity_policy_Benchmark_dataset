This mission consisted of an initial assessment of the current cyber security situation in the country, through the convening of stakeholders from a number of sectors, such as government, civil society, academia, and critical infrastructure operators. Facilitated by OAS experts, discussion groups were organized to identify cyber security gaps and needs. Taking into account that each Member State has different cyber security priorities and necessities, and that each country must find a plan that meets its unique needs, the OAS mission in Suriname adopted a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach, in which participants strongly collaborated with their different perspectives about the matter. Following these discussions, the OAS will assist Suriname in the preparation of an implementation outline, that will include a framework of tangible actions to be accomplished within a specific time frame. Neil Klopfenstein, Executive Secretary of the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE), said that the Organization is pleased to collaborate with the Government of Suriname to provide support for the development of its Cyber Security Capacity. “The commitment and leading role being played by Suriname’s Presidential Office demonstrates the priority given to this initiative,” said Klopfenstein. The OAS Cyber 2/2 Security Program has been working with Latin American and Caribbean countries on cyber security issues over a decade, “playing a leading role in fostering a secure cyber space in the region,” Klopfenstein stressed. In addition to its recent work with Suriname, the OAS has helped Colombia, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago to draft and adopt their national cyber security strategies. The OAS has also initiated the national strategy development process in Dominica and Jamaica, and is planning to assist Paraguay and Peru to develop their Cyber Security Strategy and Colombia again to renew theirs. OAS Cyber Security efforts have been possible thanks to the financial contributions of the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

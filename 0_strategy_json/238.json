The domain is transforming our economy and security posture more than ever before, creating opportunities for innovations and the means to improve general welfare of the citizens. It is transforming many countries’ growth, dismantling barriers to commerce, and allowing people across the globe to communicate, collaborate and exchange ideas. However, behind this increasing dependence on cyberspace lies new risks that threaten the national economy and security. Sensitive data, networks and systems that we now trust can be compromised or impaired, in a fashion that detection or defence can be hard, thus undermining our confidence in a connected economy. The Federal government is not unmindful of the diversity of implications of the nation’s risk exposure in cyberspace, hence we have put in place cohesive measures towards addressing national risks effectively now and in the immediate future. Furthermore, the government has recognized that for Nigeria and its citizens to continue to benefit from the full potential of information and communication technology revolution, we must take the cyber-risks seriously. It is on this premise that we are determined to confront the threats, uphold and support the openness of the cyberspace as well as balance security with respect to privacy and fundamental rights. If we fail to prepare now and act appropriately, we may be faced with future challenges that will be more complex to manage. In this context, government has developed a common framework that aggregates our collective responses towards addressing the challenges. These are encapsulated in this National Cybersecurity Policy. It outlines the actions government and other players alike will take to lessen the risks and secure the gains of our continuous dependence on cyberspace. The policy recognizes three key approaches to a successful national cybersecurity program: public private sector partnership; multi-stakeholders engagement; and international cooperation. \r   Our collective vision is to see a Nigeria, where law enforcement agencies are empowered in tackling cybercrimes; businesses and citizens are creating wealth and conscious of what to do to protect themselves on cyber space. This requires raising awareness on the imperatives of cybersecurity readiness as a vital component of our lives, as no individual or organization in any sector is immune from the consequences of cyber threat. In addition, ensuring private and public assets online are secure and resilient; and threats to the nation’s infrastructure and national security are proportionately dealt with. It is in the light of the above that my office, in collaboration with other agencies of government and key actors from the private sector are championing the urgent need for comprehensive national cybersecurity programmes. It is my hope that the synergy already developed between the stakeholders drawn from different backgrounds will be sustained through all the implementation stages. My office will continue to explore common grounds around which we can sustain this collaboration on cybersecurity for the common good of our country. We shall keep all channels open for close monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of this policy, which shall be due for comprehensive review in another five years. My office shall facilitate regular collation of feedback from stakeholders that will enhance periodic review of the process. I therefore wish to express my appreciation to the cross section of contributors and stakeholders, including professional bodies, corporate leaders and captains of industry who have contributed to our efforts towards creating an enduring safer digital environment for our dear country.

The convergence of components of information and communications technology (ICT); advances in underlying technologies fuelling reduction in costs, suggest that accessing the internet will become increasingly inexpensive and stress-free in Nigeria. The implication is that more and more people in Nigeria and around the globe will continuously engage in cyberspace. As more ideas continue to drive the expansion of the cyberspace for improved advantage and profitability, more surprises are unavoidable. While heralding the success of the Internet, there is also a challenge in identifying and curbing cyber threat inherent within its sphere. It is well documented that the Internet is being used as a vehicle to carry out criminal activity within and outside Nigeria’s borders. These activities adversely affect the country’s economy as well as individuals and organisations within Nigeria’s physical territorial boundaries from a financial, reputational, security and privacy perspectives. Where external threat actors such as foreign intelligence agencies, hackers and other online criminal syndicates are carrying out the activities, they can also threaten the national security posture, which includes the economic, political and social fabric of Nigeria. This policy therefore sets out the strategic intent of the government in mitigating the country cyber risk exposure by prioritising our needs while focusing on key areas, curtailing escalation of cyber threats that are inimical to the national security posture and the Nigerian economic wellbeing. This policy is a vital response element for safeguarding the nation. It helps to enlighten the citizens on the components that are to be used to empower the nation to understand, respond and collectively deter cyber threat activities. The policy outlines the doctrinal framework and guiding principles for achieving our roadmaps through a coordinated effort of all stakeholders in the country. \r   December 2014. PART ONE INTRODUCTION \r   This part sets out the overview of the Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Policy process and provides a background of Nigeria’s cybersecurity status in relation to the global context. It also provides the rationale for the institution of a National Cybersecurity Policy. 1.1 Background: \r   Vision 2020 envisages improved socio-economic activities in Nigeria through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Similarly, recent developments in telecommunications and Internet expansion occasioned by introduction of undersea fibre optics, has resulted in improved use of the Internet for social and business activities in Nigeria. The country is operating progressively and actively in cyberspace. \r   Cyberspace has become an essential component of 21st century activities. As critical and non-critical activities are increasingly migrating to cyberspace, globalisation and the increasing interdependence of nations has also put significant pressure on nations to continuously look for ways of ensuring that the domain remains safe for players utilising it for social, economic and development purposes. \r   The purpose of the national cybersecurity policy is multifaceted. It considers the versatile landscape, the various stakeholders involved, and the threats posed by individuals and groups out there which take an undue advantage of users. Similarly, measures necessary to address national challenges come from an articulated approach, which must take into consideration the peculiarities and international commitments of the country. \r   1.2 Global Cybersecurity Context \r   Cyberspace has become an indispensable global domain coming after Land, Sea, Air, and Space as number five. Increasingly, nations are depending on information and communications infrastructures in governing societies, conducting business, exercising individual rights on interactions and freedom of communication. \r   Cyberspace is open for diverse engagements. In contrast to land, air, sea and space, cyberspace poses unique difficulties in terms of the Non-boundary and universal nature of its networks. It does not recognize the conventional rules-based international systems. State actors, organized syndicate criminals, insurgents and terrorists are exploiting cyberspace for dubiuos purposes. \r   The world is confronted with growing challenges of cyber threat that constantly challenge confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace, all of which can affect the critical functioning of nation states, including Nigeria. Global connectivity, vulnerable technologies, and anonymous nature enable the spread of disruptive cyber-activities that causes considerable collateral damage to a country’s national interests. Cybersecurity is, therefore, an international challenge, which requires international cooperation in order to successfully attain an acceptable level of confidence and trust at national and global levels. 1.3 Nigeria National Cybersecurity Threat \r   Five key cyber threats have been identified and listed as posing significant challenges to Nigeria and inimical to national growth and security. They are: a) Cybercrime b) Cyber-espionage c) Cyber conflict d) Cyber-Terrorism e) Child Online Abuse & Exploitation \r   Activities classified under these unwholesome schemes that are taking place on the Internet or on using information systems, have impact on the level of risk exposure, resistance and protection of associated national critical and non-critical infrastructure. These threats have serious implications for the nation’s presence and active participation in the global ecosystem. Nigeria is therefore keen to secure and protect its cyber space in a coordinated and all-inclusive manner. Government is striving to understand the emergent complex threat landscape and contending with the breadth and depth of cyber attacks, especially those affiliated with nation-states or organised crime. Therefore, the protection, security, and sustainability of the nation’s active presence in cyberspace are dependent on the country’s readiness to articulate a strategic approach and engagement roadmap to secure the nation’s cyberspace. In 2004, the Nigerian government developed a framework for cyber security following recommendations by the Presidential Committee on Illegal Online Activities. The strategic framework deals with the overall goal of setting a clear direction, coordination of the nation’s engagements in cyberspace, as well protect and defend the national interests and the sovereignty of Nigeria. This culminated into the establishment of the Cyber Security Focal Point at the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA). Various activities and initiatives have been taken by ONSA in collaboration with various stakeholders towards ensuring security of the country’s presence in cyberspace. \r   PART TWO THE NATIONAL DOCTRINES Part 2 describes Nigeria’s cybersecurity doctrines in specific terms. It also provides basic understanding of the doctrinal frameworks within which they are defined. 2.1 Doctrine on Cyberspace: \r   2.1.1 Cyberspace is an interdependent network of critical and non-critical national information infrastructures, convergence of interconnected information and communication resources through the use of information and communication technologies. It encompasses all forms of digital engagements, interactions, socializations and transactional activities; contents, contacts and resources deployed through interconnected networks. 2.1.2 Cyberspace is recognized as a domain for non-critical and critical national functions such as economic development, trade and commerce, social interactions, communication, medical and health, government operations, national security and defence. 2.2. Doctrine on Cyberspace Critical Assets & Infrastructure: \r   2.2.1 The operation, sustaining and survival of critical national functions is anchored on a safe and secure national critical information infrastructure, robust policies and processes with skilled manpower to manage such critical infrastructure. These complements of empowered people, processes and systems are fundamental to the cardinal objectives of Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Policy and its abiding principles. \r   2.3 Doctrine on Cyber-Risk Exposure: \r   2.3.1 National functions rely on interdependent networks of critical information infrastructures for confidentiality, integrity, availability and accessibility. 2.3.2 Interdependent network of critical information infrastructures do not exist in isolation of global networks, i.e. the cyberspace. \r   2.3.3 National functions are recurrently exposed to predictable and unpredictable risks in the cyberspace. \r   2.3.3 Any disruption of critical national functions as a result of their exposure to cyber risks, that compromise their confidentiality, integrity, availability and accessibility constitute a threat to the doctrines of National Security. 2.4 Doctrine on Cybersecurity: \r   2.4.1 National provision of sustainable proactive measures mitigates, protects, and safeguards the nation from cyberspace risk exposures, including cyber- threat and vulnerability. An insecure cyberspace is inimical to the nation’s sovereignty, national security and economic development. \r   PART THREE NATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSECURITY 3.1 The Goal of National Security Strategy on Cybersecurity \r   3.1.1 The fundamental aim of the National Security Strategy as enshrined in the National Security Policy framework seeks for a harmonized security strategy that will respond to the dynamism of the national security threat landscape. \r   3.1.2 One of such emergent national security threat landscape is national risk exposure and uncoordinated presence in cyberspace. \r   3.2.3 In the context of the immediate and future security challenges, instruments of Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy are intended to manage security threats in cyberspace in line with the overall national security objective. \r   PART FOUR NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY ROADMAP 4.1 National Cybersecurity Vision: A safe, secured, vibrant, resilient and trusted community that provides opportunities for its citizenry, safeguards national assets and interests, promote peaceful interactions and proactive engagement in cyberspace for national prosperity. \r   4.2 National Cybersecurity Mission: To foster harmonious, sustainable and integrated Nigeria’s national cybersecurity readiness and coordination capacities towards addressing and mitigating the nation’s cyber risks exposure in cyberspace. 4.3 Policy Objectives: \r   4.3.1 Statement of Purpose The aim of this National Cybersecurity Policy is to chart a course towards an assured and trusted presence in cyberspace. \r   4.3.2 Objectives The objectives of National Cybersecurity policy are stated as follows: \r   i.

It is the cardinal objective of this National Cybersecurity Policy to complement the efforts of the Federal Government of Nigeria on the existing plans and documents relating to safeguarding and protection of the nation’s Critical Information Infrastructure. \r   \r   ii. The legislation on cybercrime and cybersecurity thus states that The President may on the recommendation of the National Security Adviser, by Order published in the Federal Gazette, designate certain computer systems, and/or networks, whether physical or virtual, and/or the computer programs, computer data and/or traffic data vital to this country that the incapacity or destruction of or interference with such system and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national or economic security, national public health and safety, or any combination of those matters as constituting Critical National Information Infrastructure. \r   iii. This policy recognizes that Nigeria’s well-being depends largely on a secure and resilient critical national information infrastructure—the systems, assets and networks that underpin our national life. \r   iv. Therefore, this policy details how the private sector will work with government in the identification and protection of critical infrastructure in order to manage risks and achieve resilience to national critical information infrastructure. \r   7.2 Vision of National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP) The country envisions an environment where physical and cyber critical infrastructure are secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced and consequences minimised to acceptable tolerable limits, where threats are identified and dealt with in a coordinated response and recovery strategy. \r   7.3 Policy Objectives of NCIIPP: i. Detect, identify, discourage, disrupt and prepare for threats and cyber hazards to Nigeria’s critical information infrastructure ii. Reduce vulnerabilities of critical assets, systems and networks to deliberate, unintentional and natural threats. \r   \r   iii. Mitigate the potential consequences to critical infrastructure of incidents or adverse events that do occur through advance planning and mitigation efforts to save lives and ensure prompt recovery of essential services. iv. Share important and actionable information among the critical infrastructure community in order to build awareness and provide a risk-informed decision making. \r   v. Promotes learning and rapid revision of NCIIPP during and after incidents. 7.4 Strategic Readiness Plan (SRP) \r   i. The policy shall facilitate the development of a strategic action plan through a collaborative process involving stakeholders from all \r   identified critical infrastructure sectors, all states of the federation and from all levels of government and industry. ii. Provide a clear call to action, which will leverage on the coordination, cooperation, collaboration, and smart risk management procedures, and focus on specific actions germane to the policy goals. 7.5 The Critical Infrastructure Sectors: i. Policy preparatory process on NCIIPP carried out a general national survey with the goal of identifying critical infrastructure sectors whose strategic operational backbone rely on functional and secure National Critical Information Infrastructure. ii. The policy identifies the following infrastructures. a. Communications Sector b. Government Facilities Sector c. Manufacturing Sector d. Dams Sector e. Defence Sector f. Chemical Sector {Oil and Gas} g. Power and Energy Sector h. Commercial Facilities Sector i. Financial Services Sector j. Food and Agriculture Sector k. Emergency Services Sector l. Transportation Systems Sector m. Public Health and Healthcare Sector n. Water & Waste Water systems o. Information Technology Sector \r   iii. Effective risk management requires an understanding of the significance of assets, systems, networks, as well as the associated dependency and interdependency of critical infrastructure. \r   iv. Consequently, the policy encourages stakeholders to identify critical functions and resources that impact on their businesses and \r   communities in order to support preparedness, planning and capability development. \r   v. The policy describes a national unified effort to achieve critical infrastructure security and resilience. Given the diverse authorities, roles, and responsibilities of critical infrastructure partners, a proactive and inclusive partnership among all levels of government and the private and non-profit sectors is required to provide optimal critical infrastructure security and resilience. \r   7.6 Coordination Policy Specific to NCIIPP i. The NCIIPP for each sector details sector level performance objectives and feedback to the coordinating agency of government charged with the responsibility of managing the sector. \r   ii. The NCCC shall be empowered through legislation to provide the following national critical information infrastructure protection roles: • National Coordination and Reporting Mechanism of cybersecurity incidents for critical infrastructure. \r   • NCCC shall facilitate development and implementation of national criteria on best practices approach at each critical information infrastructure sector. \r   • NCCC shall facilitate the development of a national Critical Information Infrastructure Measurable Program (CIIMP) as part of the cohesive National Cybersecurity Strategy. \r   • NCCC shall assist government and the private sectors to mitigate their cyber-risks \r   • It shall provide legal framework for investigating cyber security incidents. \r   \r   • Promote regional and international cooperation on NCIIPP across national boundaries and assist in determining transnational solutions. \r   PART EIGHT PRINCIPLES ON ASSURANCE & MONITORING 8.1 Introduction: \r   i. Vulnerabilities exist in critical national information infrastructure for several reasons including: technological flaws, non-existent or weak security controls, non-compliance with defined security policies, dearth of effective mitigating strategies and plans amongst others. \r   ii. Absence of a feedback reporting mechanism on how effective implemented controls are safeguarding the nation's cyberspace will lead to an assumed, unverified and false sense of protection. \r   iii. The policy provides for the creation of a National Assurance & Monitoring mechanism for the nation’s cyberspace. 8.2 Focal Points: The National Assurance & Monitoring Mechanism, under the supervision and coordination of NCCC will achieve the following outcomes: i. Motivate compliance to national cybersecurity standards. ii. Ensure collection of relevant data that validates previous cyber security initiatives, and support its' on-going improvements. iii. Provide feedback on the status of the nations' cyber security posture, thus enabling stakeholders, partners and policy-makers to develop sound cyber security countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. \r   iv. Increase confidence that responsible stakeholders are complying with statutory cybersecurity requirements and frameworks v. Ensure efficient and effective solutions are deployed to protect the nation's cyberspace. vi. Ensure awareness of evolving threats to the nation's cyberspace thereby enabling proactive defence measures. \r   PART NINE PRINCIPLES ON NATIONAL COMMITMENT & GOVERNANCE 9.1 Introduction: i. Nigeria is committed to establishing the highest level of governance and commitment in tackling cybercrime. To achieve this goal it will design and implement appropriate, sustainable and effective policies and practices. The ONSA will provide oversight responsibilities on matters relating to policies, practices, individuals and organizations charged with the responsibility of combating cybercrime. \r   ii. The national commitment will ensure that these practices are continually being reviewed and improved by benchmarking against internationally accepted best practices and lessons learned. \r   iii. The outcomes of the national commitment on governance are: \r   • To give Nigerian citizens and the rest of the world comfort and understanding of our resolve and stance on tackling cybercrime. \r   • Allow the nation to identify progress on the key strategies that need to be implemented \r   • Steer the country towards efficient and transparent methods of conducting operations for cybercrime especially where there are conflicting objectives. \r   iv. It is the policy of the Government of Nigeria to have and maintain principles on national commitments and governance. \r   v. These principles will allow the nation to foster cooperation and coordination in the drive to maintain a positive image across local, regional and global communities in the nation’s drive to reduce the effects of cybercrime. \r   9.2 Nature of Commitment \r   i. In order to ensure the fight against cybersecurity in Nigeria is sustained. Nigeria commits to putting in place perpetual counter-measure instruments and cybercrime fighting environment that will be sufficiently funded and which in turn will be monitored and supported by the national security agencies. \r   ii. It will ensure that it appoints the most suitably trained and qualified individuals to oversee the delivery of its commitment to combat cybercrime and make it difficult for cybercriminals to successfully operate within the nation’s cyberspace. \r   9.3 Nature of Governance i. In order to ensure the fight against cybercrime is successful, the government will commit to putting in place, effective governance and control mechanisms to ensure its national security agencies have appropriate oversight of the activities within its cyberspace environment. \r   ii. This will include amongst other areas identifying the institutions and bodies that control activities and services that can impact on its cyberspace environment. Such organizations and bodies will include but are not limited to; \r   • Internet Service Providers • Domain Name Registration Body • Telecommunications Service Providers • Internet Exchanges; and • Other associated bodies \r   iii. The governance oversight will allow for centralization, prompt and effective response to cybercrime activities. \r   \r   \r   \r   9.4 National Legal Commitments i. An integral part of the nation’s National Cybersecurity Policy is the adoption of regional and international harmonized legislations against the misuse and abuse of cyberspace for criminal and other unlawful purposes. \r   ii. In order for Nigeria to ensure its policy on cybercrime is successful, Nigeria commits to enacting appropriate laws relating to cybercrime. \r   iii. The nation’s commitment will include reviewing these laws on a regular basis so that they can be updated when the need arises. The benefit of this approach will be that the nation’s legal landscape will be adaptable to the changing cybercrime environment. 9.5 Regional Commitments and Governance \r   i. To ensure its policy on cybercrime is comprehensively successful, Government commits to fostering initiatives for the cooperation, collaboration, information sharing and coordination of anti-cybercrime strategies with countries, law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in the African Region. \r   ii. Government will build and foster partnerships with willing and participating countries by sharing information and combining efforts to combat cybercrime. \r   iii. Nigeria will engage in regional discourse, consultations and negotiations that impact positively on regional cybersecurity efforts. \r   PART TEN PRINCIPLES ON ONLINE CHILD ABUSE & EXPLOITATION 10: 1 Introduction: \r   i. The Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy recognizes growing engagement of the nation’s active young population in cyberspace. \r   ii. The resultant impact of this engagement has contributed significantly to digital knowledge acquisitions and economic empowerment of this critical segment of the nation’s population. \r   iii. Unrestricted access to digital contents, contacts and communications through Cyberspace has raised new areas of national security concern on vulnerability, exploitation and abuse especially as it affects this critical segment of the nation’s population. \r   iv. There are growing national concerns on the distribution of digital content and materials targeted to young population which are making them vulnerable to cyber-terrorism recruitment, child pornography, sexual abuse, harassment, exploitation, extremism, violence and human trafficking resulting into unpleasant outcomes. \r   10.2 Strategic Areas of Focus: \r   i. National Cybersecurity Policy will work within the current and future legislative frameworks to provide countermeasure mechanisms on Online Child Abuse and Exploitation within the nation’s cyberspace. \r   ii. The policy provides for a partnership framework for counter-measures towards safeguarding the safety and security of the Nigeria children online. \r   iii. The policy seeks membership of relevant global law enforcement bodies, which provides a 24/7 mechanism to receive reports about illegal behavior or content from persons in member countries. \r   iv. The policy seeks for national awareness and capacity building of Nigerian law enforcement community and the judicial sector on countermeasures, investigating child online abuse and exploitation as well as prosecution within current and future legislation. \r   v. The policy seeks for the creation of national mechanisms guaranteeing that Child Abuse Materials found in the nation’s cyberspace are channeled towards appropriate law enforcement apparatus within the Nigeria Police Force. \r   vi. The policy seeks for the development of working mechanisms to provide means for reporting illegal content found in the country’s cyberspace, which has the capacity to respond rapidly and have illegal materials removed or rendered inaccessible. \r   vii. The policy seeks for multi-stakeholder partnership, bilateral and multilateral cooperation, collaboration and information exchanges on online crime against children. \r   PART ELEVEN MISCELLANOUS PRINCIPLES i. It is the policy of the Nigerian government to provide and sustain continuity of government in the advent of cybersecurity emergency. ii. The policy seeks citizen’s proactive and collective participatory measures towards ensuring that national cybersecurity policy obligations are effectively respected in regards to national security, strategic economic interest and patriotism. \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY \r   \r   \r   FOREWORD BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER The emergence of cyberspace, a virtual global domain, is increasingly impacting almost every aspect of our lives. The domain is transforming our economy and security posture more than ever before, creating opportunities for innovations and the means to improve general welfare of the citizens. It is transforming many countries’ growth, dismantling barriers to commerce, and allowing people across the globe to communicate, collaborate and exchange ideas. However, behind this increasing dependence on cyberspace lies new risks that threaten the national economy and security. Sensitive data, networks and systems that we now trust can be compromised or impaired, in a fashion that detection or defence can be hard, thus undermining our confidence in a connected economy. The Federal government is not unmindful of the diversity of implications of the nation’s risk exposure in cyberspace, hence we have put in place cohesive measures towards addressing national risks effectively now and in the immediate future. Furthermore, the government has recognized that for Nigeria and its citizens to continue to benefit from the full potential of information and communication technology revolution, we must take the cyber-risks seriously. It is on this premise that we are determined to confront the threats, uphold and support the openness of the cyberspace as well as balance security with respect to privacy and fundamental rights. If we fail to prepare now and act appropriately, we may be faced with future challenges that will be more complex to manage. In this context, government has developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy as cohesive national measures towards addressing the challenges. These measures contain strategic initiatives and programs that are aligned with the national doctrines, principles, vision, goals and objectives as enshrined in the National Cybersecurity Policy. The strategy recognizes three key approaches to a successful national cybersecurity engagement: public private sector partnership; stakeholders’ collaborations and international cooperation. Our commitment is to ensure continuity of government in the advent of cyber threat emergency, safeguard critical information infrastructure, and nurture national cybersecurity readiness through the engagement of all stakeholders. It is in the light of the above that my office, in collaboration with other agencies of \r   government and key actors from the private sector are championing the urgent need for comprehensive national cybersecurity programmes. It is my hope that the synergy already developed between the stakeholders drawn from different backgrounds will be sustained through all the implementation stages. My office will continue to explore common grounds around which we can sustain this collaboration on cybersecurity for the common good of our country. We shall keep all channels open for close monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of this policy, which shall be due for comprehensive review in another five years. My office shall facilitate regular collation of feedback from stakeholders that will enhance periodic review of the process. I therefore wish to express my appreciation to the cross section of contributors and stakeholders, including professional bodies, corporate leaders and captains of industry who have contributed to our efforts towards creating an enduring safer digital environment for our dear country.

Digital infrastructure is the National Information Infrastructure (NII) component that permeates the physical infrastructural landscape supporting it to function seamlessly, endlessly and sustainably. The NII is the backbone of the nation’s active presence in cyberspace. Significant disruption of its operation will undermine the confidentiality, integrity and availability of essential national services, which will be inimical to national economy and security. In comparison with other industrial and commercial entities, the Internet has been with us for a relatively short period of time. It has been responsible for the most revolutionary and rapid changes to the way we communicate, undertake business, perform job functions as well as boost our military strategies. We have seen the examples in the home schooling, social media and cloud computing rising on the tails of the Internet phenomenon. The Internet has given the phrase “global village” an appropriate meaning, this is driven home with the illustration that an individual in Nigeria can immediately set up an online conference call and chat with group of people on the other side of the planet in real-time. The majority of users of the Internet conduct their activities in a legitimate and above board manner, while on the other side of the internet there are individuals, organisations, foreign intelligence agencies and state sponsored actors that have used the very benefits of the internet, i.e. its speed, global presence and openness, to carry out criminal activities that can cause havoc to those that are not aware, prepared or equipped to deal with such undertakings. This document therefore examines the strategic imperative of a national cybersecurity. It highlights various strategies that will be used to implement the measures outlined in the new National Cybersecurity Policy. \r   These include the following: • The development and implementation of appropriate legal framework, with initiatives that will allow for the identification and prosecution of cybercrimes that impact Nigeria regardless of whether they originate within Nigeria or are launched from outside of the country. It encompasses training the judiciary, security and law enforcement agencies, seeking international co-operation, public and private sector co-operation and public awareness programmes. It also introduces a special focus on data protection, privacy and lawful interception. • Establishment of a National Incidents Management Strategy which outlines the commissioning of a National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and introduces the roadmap for implementing Detective, Preventative and Response capabilities to deal with cybercrime activities. • The strategy for Protecting Critical information Infrastructures including shared responsibility between government and owner operators of critical infrastructure. It also highlights the ways in which early warning, detection, reaction and crisis management will be assessed, developed and implemented to provide a proactive readiness to react to and deal with threats towards Nigeria’s Critical Infrastructures. • The strategy seeks to ensure the development of information security assurance and monitoring plan. It includes a new national mechanism on cybersecurity assurance, adoption of fit for purpose standards for Governance, Risk and Control, Core Assurance Capabilities, National Enterprise Architecture Framework. It also endorses the adoption of application security testing as well as the adoption of a Balanced Scorecard Framework for cybersecurity. • The introduction of a sustainable strategy to develop, maintain and ensure Nigerians are informed and equipped to deal with cybersecurity events by establishing a mechanism for Cybersecurity Skill and Manpower Development initiatives. These initiatives will be driven through public-private partnership. It introduces a model for certification of individuals to ensure quality of competence in the field of cybersecurity relevant to the nation. \r   • The strategy for protecting Nigerian Children from Online Child Exploitation and Sexual Abuse includes initiatives, such as the national awareness programmes through multi-stakeholder engagement, and international cooperation in the countermeasures. • The Strategy on Public-Private Partnership highlights the need for interagency collaboration with private sector. It engages the framework for a public and private partnership in developing a cohesive response to mitigating cyber-risk. In conclusion, The National Internet Safety initiative is aimed at providing general public awareness, education, and advocacy through multi-stakeholders’ engagement, development of local tools, training software and applications in Internet safety and security readiness. It provides mechanism for gauging the nation’s cyber security posture. December 2014. \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   CHAPTER ONE AN OVERVIEW OF NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY 1.1 Introduction: 1.1.1 National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) is the nation’s readiness strategy to provide cohesive measures and strategic actions towards assuring security and protection of the country presence in cyberspace, safeguarding critical information infrastructure, building and nurturing trusted cyber-community. 1.1.2 The NCSS comprises of short, medium and long term mitigation strategies covering all national priorities, addressing the nation’s cyber risk exposure. Specific key cyber threats worldwide inimical to National interest are identified. Such as; i. Cybercrime ii. Cyber-terrorism iii. Cyber conflict iv. Cyber espionage v. Child online abuse and exploitation. 1.1.3 These threats have significant capability to damage the integrity of the nation, disruption of critical information infrastructure operations, undermine government operations and national security. 1.1.4 The NCSS articulates, coordinates and guides the country in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Policy and cohesive counter-threat measures for the protection, security and defence of National Cyberspace. 1.1.5 The Strategy provides various initiatives for the focused areas and national mechanisms for developing and implementing Legal & Policy Measures, National Incident Management, Critical Information Infrastructure Protection, Cybersecurity Assurance Framework, Manpower Development, Child Online \r   Abuse & Exploitation, National Internet Safety, Public Awareness, Multi- Stakeholder Partnership and Global Cooperation on Cybersecurity. 1.2. National Cybersecurity Vision: The National Cybersecurity Policy has set out a clear purpose, direction and outcome of the country’s engagement in cybersecurity. What is the Nigeria Cybersecurity Vision? A safe, secured, vibrant, resilient and trusted community that provide opportunities for its citizenry, safeguard national assets and interests, promote peaceful interactions and proactive engagement in cyberspace for national prosperity – Culled from National Cybersecurity Policy 2014 1.3. The Aim of National Cybersecurity Strategy: The aim of the NCSS is to provide a cohesive roadmap, initiatives, and implementation mechanism for achieving the national vision on cybersecurity. 1.4 Cyberspace Within the Context of National Prosperity & Opportunities: 1.4.1 Cyberspace offers excellent platforms and opportunities for securing and growing the nation’s economy. 1.4.2 Every citizen that is connected to cyberspace through the internet is immeasurably impacted and empowered for actions. 1.4.3 In the next few years, Nigeria will become a broadband economy where every individual and corporate citizens will have unhindered wholesome access to the internet. 1.4.4 Cyberspace will become the mainstream for national integration and digital economy empowerment. It is a knowledge driven space with massive capacity to bridge gaps in mobility, commerce, innovations, education, poverty reduction, and economic empowerment. \r   1.4.5 What is the Cyberspace? Cyberspace is an interdependent network of critical and non-critical national information infrastructures, convergence of interconnected information and communication resources through the use of information and communication technologies. It encompasses all forms of digital engagements, interactions, socializations and transactional activities; contents, contacts and resources deployed through interconnected networks. – Culled from National Cybersecurity Policy 2014 1.4.6 Why is Cyberspace important to the National Government? It has been established that we have the contemporary four (4) domains of land, Sea, Air and Space, Nigeria recognizes Cyberspace as the fifth (5th) domain for driving critical national functions such as economic development, commerce and transactions, social interactions, medical and health, government operations, national security and defense. 1.5 Impact of Cyber-Risk on National security and the Economy 1.5.1 The nation’s digital economic existence relies on the effective functioning of digital infrastructure. In Cyberspace, the country is not isolated but interconnected to other countries and active actors within cyberspace through interdependent networks of information infrastructures. Thus, the country is exposed to predictable and unpredictable risks. 1.5.2 Just as we have actors with legitimate intentions so also exist other actors with illegitimate and malicious intentions. Within the global network of networks there are critical structural flaws which can be exploited for criminal intents and purposes against the country to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, availability and accessibility of the nation information systems and critical information infrastructure. \r   1.5.3 Vulnerabilities exist within cyberspace that can be used to exploit national economic interest and constitute threats to National Security. For instance, recent compromise of some government websites, growing underground cybercrime industry, emergence of activism through online backdoors, fraudulent practices, incidence of online exploitation of the young segment of the population, gross abuse of the social media for waging malicious campaign against the state, conflict and violence perpetuated through internet, economic sabotage through distributive denial of critical services, coordinated cyber espionage, malicious intrusion into computer systems and other digital devices, cyber piracy and stealing of intellectual assets, cyber-terrorism, online financial crime and money laundering, distribution of offensive contents and child abuse materials and hosts of other malignant activities committed through cyberspace are all inimical to the wellbeing of the country. The economic impact is destructive to any nation. 1.6 Cybersecurity within the context of National Security Strategy: Providing security for the critical information infrastructure and other critical components of information system within the current state of affairs is a huge national challenge. National Security needs the infusion of a cohesive framework on cybersecurity to provide holistic approach to the current and future security landscape, because the nation security and economic terrain is fast paced and is moving towards a digitally enabled and mobile terrain. State and non-state actors involved in cyber-crimes are adequately equipped with sophisticated cyber tools to cause damage with unprecedented dimension. The security inclusion of cyberspace domain will help the country prepare and response to such security threat and help address the country’s weakness in her own digital vulnerability, as well as strengthening our ability to provide countermeasures in partnership with other legitimate state and non-state actors. This is the strategic rationale for the development of National Cybersecurity Policy and the context within which National Cybersecurity Strategy is articulated for national security readiness. \r   CHAPTER TWO UNDERSTANDING NATIONAL CYBER-RISK EXPOSURE 2.1 Introduction In line with the national doctrine on cyber-risk exposure as reflected in the National Cybersecurity Policy document, the country presence in cyberspace exposes it to a new dimension of risk. Therefore, development of the country’s Cybersecurity Strategy is approached from examining security risk exposure of the whole country. What Is Cyber-risk? Cyber risk is the possibility that a threat and vulnerability exists within the nation’s cyberspace inimical to the security and safety of information systems and associated infrastructures. Furthermore, it is the possibility that the threat will exploit a vulnerability to breach the safety and security of an information system and or information networks or infrastructure. National cyber-risk has two (2) major components: i. Cyber-threat ii. Vulnerability 2.2 Cyber-threat Landscape & Impacts: 2.2.1 Cyber threat is the possibility of a malicious attempt to damage or disrupt the \r   operations of a vulnerable computer network and information system. \r   2.2.2 The nature and the dimension of the impact of cyber-threat are diverse and it involves a threat actor who performs a pre-mediated attack or exploit circumstances of an accident. A threat actor is engaged by a threat source either clandestinely or tactically. A threat source initiates a desire to breach access to critical information or security controls with the purpose of benefiting from the breach, for example for financial gain or competitive advantage in the case of industry cyber espionage. \r   \r   Sources of Cyber-threat \r   \r   \r   \r   NCSS Fig. 1 Sources \r  of \r   Cyber-­‐Threat \r   Foreign \r   States \r   Organized \r   Criminal \r   Syndicates \r   Terrorists \r  & \r   Extremist \r   Group \r   Hackctivists \r   \r   Corporate \r   Insiders \r   2.2.3 Cyber threat is escalated to cyber-attack by a threat actor where a deliberate effort is initiated to exploit the vulnerability of computer systems, information and communication networks, and internet driven processes for criminal intent and malicious purpose. 2.2.4 It usually involves the use of malicious codes to alter digital codes, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and lead to manipulation of information systems and internetwork infrastructure. 2.2.5 Cyber-attacks may lead to the following consequences: Identity theft, fraud, extortion, Malware, pharming, phishing, spamming, spoofing, spyware, Trojans and viruses, manipulation of hardware, denial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service attacks, breach of access, password sniffing, system infiltration, website defacement, private and public web browser exploits, instant messaging and social media abuse, and intellectual property theft. 2.2.6 Economic Impact of Cybercrime • Recently, a total of $388billion USD was estimated as the approximate total financial loss to cybercrime in more 24 countries in the last six years. • The global black market in marijuana, cocaine and heroin combined ($288bn) and approaching the value of all global drug trafficking ($411bn). • At $388bn, cybercrime is more than 100 times the annual expenditure of UNICEF ($3.65 billion).1 • Physical crime are becoming digital. More criminals that were involved in traditional crimes are moving towards the Internet. They know that it’s easier, more profitable and the probability of being caught is lower \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   1 \r   \r   \r   • Nigerian financial consumer loss to Cybercrime in 2010 stood at N2,146,666,345,014.75 ($13,547,910,034.80) to cybercrime in 20122 • 2.2.7 Cyber threat landscape is diverse and diffusely driven by state and non-state actors. State Actor: The State Actors are established and well organised to carry out the most sophisticated threat in the cyberspace with the goal of exploiting computers and information and communication networks to gather intelligence on government, military, industrial and economic targets, and opponents of their Regimes. They gathered intelligence data and information which can be used for spreading falsehood and disrupting critical services. Sometimes they install hidden malicious software on a system can be adapted to suit an attacker’s changing objectives, lying hidden within the system in readiness for exploitation during times of increased tension or conflict. Non State Actors: Organized and unorganized criminals operating in the underground economy exploiting weakness in individual, corporate and government systems and information infrastructure. They used different technology and psychology method to manipulate users and engage highly sophisticated cyber tools to infect, hijack, control and extract value information for criminal purpose. Financial motivation is usually the driven force of this particular non- state actor. They inflict huge financial damage on their victims. Their action damage country reputation and inflict huge collateral damage on the country financial system. Terrorists and extremist engage resources of cyberspace to perpetuate against the government; falsehood, communication, recruitment, indoctrination, raising of fund activists and distribution of extremist contents. They are active attackers and constitute one of the major threat to national security. \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   2 \r  Economic \r  Cost \r  of \r  Cyber \r  Crime \r  in \r  Nigeria \r  by \r  Gbenga \r  Sesan, \r  Babatope \r  Soremi \r  and \r  Bankole \r  Oluwafemi \r  as \r  part \r  of \r  the \r  output \r  for \r  the \r  Cyber \r   Stewards \r  Network \r  Project \r  of \r  The \r  Citizen \r  Lab, \r  Munik \r  School \r  of \r  Global \r  Affairs. \r  University \r  of \r  Toronto \r  and \r  Supported \r   \r  by \r  international \r   development \r  research \r  centre.(IDRC) \r   \r   \r   Activist with unwholesome pattern of obtaining information used against established authorities. They operate through social media and vulnerable backdoors, usually connecting with an insider with passive attack tendency. 2.2.8 The National Cybersecurity Policy document has identified and classified five (5) major cyber threats as inimical to the national security strategy. These threats have significant capability to cause considerable damage to the integrity of the country’s economy. 2.2.9 The underlying ideology of this National Cybersecurity Strategy is to proffer relevant strategic frameworks and mechanisms for addressing these cyber- threats, securing the nation in the advent of cyber-attack, while preparing the nation for a proactive engagement towards building and nurturing a safe and secure cyberspace where trust and confidence are hallmark of Nigeria cyber- community. 2.3 Imperative of a National Vulnerability Assessment 2.3.1 Vulnerability is the structural weaknesses of the nation’s information systems and critical information infrastructure ranging from technical flaws, porous measures, to human negligence. 2.3.2 The NCSS requires that national vulnerability assessment be conducted towards determining weaknesses in government information systems, websites, networks, data handling processes and vulnerabilities existing in the nation’s critical information infrastructure. 2.3.3 The national vulnerability assessment helps the government appreciate the level of her unpreparedness, the need to safeguard huge investments in information systems and communication infrastructure and commitment made to global partners National ICT developmental goals. 2.3.4 There are efforts aimed at addressing some of these challenges at the sectorial levels. However, NCSS is laying a foundation for the coordination of the country cyber-ecosystem with a unified framework on cybersecurity. \r   2.3.5 The ultimate goal is to build a collective counter-measures mechanisms that will facilitate the country’s capability in addressing the huge vulnerability gaps among the states information systems, critical information infrastructure, and protection of our presence in cyberspace. 2.4 Gauging the Impacts and Opportunities 2.4.1 There are many advantages associated with the implementation of the national Cybersecurity strategy. Building and nurturing trust and confidence in the use of national information systems and critical information and communication technology is crucial to the socio-economic well-being of the citizenry, therefore it is important to secure our nation in cyberspace thereby infusing high level of confidence and trust in the nation digital economy. 2.4.2 The nation depends on the functioning of information and communication technology and the operation of critical information infrastructures. Our interactions, transportation, communication, trading and e-commerce, financial services, mission critical services are relying on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information flowing through these infrastructures. 2.4.3 National enterprise security architecture is further enhanced with the inclusion of cybersecurity strategy. A new and holistic National Security Architecture will emerge by integrating physical and cyber security as countermeasures against external threat, thus consolidate the country readiness capability. 2.4.4 The country’s emerging opportunities as a result of her trusted presence in cyberspace are inclusive of the following; • A resilient digital economy, stimulating innovations, wholesome engagement, development and inflow of foreign direct investment. • An opportunity to exploit cyberspace to advance the country’s military capability in engaging external threat, conflict, violence and terrorism. \r   • Nigeria’s readiness to defend her citizens, safeguarding operations of critical information infrastructures and extra-territorial jurisdiction in time of unpredictable cyber-attack, ensures continuity of critical operations amidst adversaries. \r   CHAPTER THREE NATIONAL READINESS STRATEGY 3.1 National Cybersecurity Policy Direction 3.1.1 The National Cybersecurity Strategy defines the nation’s readiness to safeguard and prepare the whole Nation in advance for global economic competitiveness in cyberspace. It also addresses willingness to empower the nation in building a comprehensive, coherent, structural and procedural capabilities at strategic and tactical levels in mitigating cyber risks. 3.1.2 The strategy involves engagement of government and non-government actors, employing multi-stakeholder’s principles of approach, inclusive of all participatory and partnerships of government, industry and other stakeholders. 3.1.3 The critical success factor of NCSS is hinged on comprehensive mobilization, engagement and coordination of critical components towards securing our presence in cyberspace and protecting critical information infrastructures. 3.1.4 The direction of the policy of government on cybersecurity is in agreement with regional and global direction on securing cyberspace. 3.1.5 The paramount focus of the cybersecurity strategy is addressing our cyber risk exposure, protection of our national critical information infrastructure, exploiting cyberspace opportunities for national security and economic goals, and the enthronement of a trusted cyber community remain a paramount focus of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. 3.2. Necessity of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.2.1 The multi-dimensional nature of the evolving security threats is moving the current National Security Strategy beyond the traditional scope. \r   3.2.2 The nature of the current security threats such as cybercrime, violence, conflict and terrorism increasingly exploits the openness and borderless nature of cyberspace. This constitutes a threat to our growing dependence on cyberspace. 3.2.3 Government is leading a coherent national response towards reducing the impact and escalation of cyber threats in a manner that safeguards the nation’s presence and guarantee trust and confidence in our connected economy. 3.3. Objectives of National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.3.1 The Strategy aims are to set out a national roadmap with various coordinated mechanisms; harness implementation framework; and actions that will guarantee attainment of the National vision, mission and goals on Cybersecurity as captured in the National Cybersecurity Policy. 3.3.2 Therefore, the Strategy is needed to achieve the following specific objectives: i. A comprehensive cybercrime legislation and cyber-threat counter measures that are nationally adoptable, regionally and globally relevant in the context of securing the nation’s cyberspace. ii. Provision of measures that protect critical information infrastructure, as well as reducing our national vulnerabilities through cybersecurity assurance framework. iii. To articulate an effective computer emergency response capability. iv. National mechanisms on capacity building, public awareness, skills empowerment is necessary to help strengthen our capability so as to respond promptly and effectively to cyber-attacks. \r   v. A trusted mechanism for engaging national multi-stakeholder and international partners towards collectively addressing cyber threats. vi. To deter and protect government from all forms of cyber-attacks. vii. To coordinate cybersecurity initiatives at all levels of government in the country. viii. To build national capabilities against cyber threats with coherent cooperation through public- private sector partnership and multi- stakeholder engagement. ix. To promote national vision on cybersecurity through awareness, partnership through shared responsibilities and a trusted community of stakeholders. x. To promote coordination, cooperation and collaboration of regional and global stakeholders on cybersecurity. 3.3.2 The Strategy is further aligned with National Security Strategy and other relevant government documents most especially National ICT policy and National broadband plan. 3.3.3 The Strategy defines the basis for a coordinated national and globally compatible framework for action, cooperation and approach to protecting national critical information infrastructure against cyber threats. 3.4 Scope of National Cybersecurity Strategy The scope of the national cybersecurity strategy covers the areas of national priorities as well as general framework for partnership and international multi- stakeholder cooperation on cybersecurity. 3.5 Approach, Guiding Principles & National Priorities The NCSS approach involves coordination of the nation’s cybersecurity constituents and public-private partnership which are consistent with the objectives and the guiding principles as encapsulated in the National Cybersecurity Policy. 3.6 Governance Strategy 3.6.1 The implementation of the provision of the strategy will be coordinated through the Office of National Security Adviser in collaboration with other relevant government agencies. \r   3.6.2 The central coordination model will operate in synergy with federated structures toward achieving comprehensive measures on cybersecurity. 3.6.3 Central coordination model is adopted in line with international best practices and has recommended in the global framework for cooperation on cybersecurity 3.6.4 The sustainability and critical success factor of this governance model is anchored on public-private sector partnership, multi-stakeholder engagement as well as regional and international cooperation. \r   \r   \r   CHAPTER FOUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK INITIATIVES 4.1 Objective 4.1.1 The objective of the Cyber Security Legal Framework is to identify the strategy required to ensure areas defined in the Cyber security Policy are implemented, managed, sustained and effective in combating cybercrime in Nigeria. 4.1.2 To achieve this aim, a number of immediate and long term legal framework initiatives will need to be developed, agreed, funded and rolled out to accomplish success. 4.2 Approach • The approach takes the form of referencing aspects of the Legal Framework in the cyber security policy with a view to prescribing the initiatives that will allow for the implementation of each of the detailed areas. NCSS Fig 2 Initiatives Pyramid 4.3 Initiatives: 4.3.1 Initiave1: Enacting Fit for Purpose Cybercrime Legislation Cyber \r  CrimeLegal \r   Framework \r   Judicial \r  Review \r   International \r  Cooperation \r   Public \r  Private \r  Sector \r  Collaboration \r   Raising \r  Awareness \r   \r   \r   • As prescribed in the cyber security policy, fit for purpose legislation will need to be enacted and implemented to combat cybercrime. • The main focus of this initiative will entail a root and branch review of Nigeria’s current and draft cybercrime legislations. • The objective of this exercise will be to identify any gaps between what is currently available and what has been proposed in the Cyber security policy with a view to updating any omissions or redundancies so that when the legislation is enacted , it will be adequately effective , workable and flexible enough to deter and prosecute cybercrime activities • This initiative supports a strategy to enact a number of separate and distinct legislations that will make up the cybercrime legislative framework as opposed to a single legislation that has the banner of cybercrime legislation. • To the barest minimum, the following legislations will need to be included in the new cybercrime framework: Anti-Spam, Child Online Protection, Child Pornography, Cookies, Computer Misuse, Cyber Blackmail, Cyber bullying and Harassment, Cyber Espionage, Cyber Terrorism, Digital Evidence and Preservation, Data Protection, Data Retention, Hacktivism; Identity Theft, Information Security, Intellectual Property Rights, Lawful Interception, Online Fraud, Privacy, tribalism and Xenophobia, Software Piracy, Security Breach Notifications, Unauthorized System Interference etc. • Aligned to the review and enactment of the cybercrime legislative framework is the need to put in place measures to keep the laws up to date and effective. • The strategy to achieve this will include the establishment of a Cyber Crime Legislative Review Committee (CCLRC) whose purview will be to advise the National Security Advisor, Legislature and regulatory bodies on aspects of legislations that needs to be amended to ensure current legislations do not become redundant, unenforceable and ineffective. \r   • This is an immediate initiative and needs to be given special priority as it forms the bedrock of the applicability, enforceability and prosecution of individuals and organisations that breach key segments of the National Cyber Security policy. 4.3.2 Initiative 2. Preparing and Revamping the Judiciary for Cybercrime Legislations • Nigeria’s current judicial environment is not adequately equipped to handle sophisticated cybercrime cases. In order to ensure the new cybercrime legislations are effective in the prosecution of alleged cybercrimes, when they are brought before the courts, it is the strategic objective of NCSS to ensure the Nigerian Court system is equipped to handle cybercrime cases. • In fulfilling this strategy, the following initiatives will be undertaken a) Capacity building for Judges and lawyers on the new cybercrime laws b) Courts will be equipped to handle digital forensic evidence c) Provide law enforcement agencies with the processes and procedures for investigating cybercrime activities. d) Capacity building for law enforcement and security agencies on digital forensic capability. • This will be achieved by developing a home grown fit for purpose certified programme of training courses, capacity building, awareness programmes and materials for current Nigerian judges and lawyers. • The strategy will also include the incision of new cybercrime legislation courses in institutes of higher learning so that newly qualified lawyers have a basic understanding of Nigeria’s cybercrime framework. • This will be a long term and on-going initiative. 4.3.3 Initiative 3: International Co-operation • To ensure our cybercrime laws are effective and internationally harmonised, the legal strategy is to adopt the provisions of the convention on cybercrime to enable effective cross border law enforcement. \r   • This will allow for the following: I. International harmonisation of our legislations II. Collation of all existing conventions and bilateral agreements III. International cooperation to combat cybercrime IV. wider investigatory capability V. Capacity Building and knowledge sharing VI. Opportunity for Nigeria to make a contribution to how cyberspace is governed through international instruments of law. International co-operation will also include becoming a member of recognised bodies such as: • The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) • Cybercrime Convention • Interpol It is envisaged that the processes to engage with international bodies will start to be defined with the objective of implementing and achieving within the next 12 months. This is an immediate initiative 4.3.4 Initiative 4: Public/Private Sector Collaboration • Recognizing that cybercrime can impact both private and public sector environments, the legal strategy is to adopt processes for both public and private sector collaboration in combating cybercrime. • As an example relationships between Communication Service Providers in assisting law enforcement agencies in preserving communications data for specified periods as dictated by the Data Retention legislations will be encouraged and forged. • This will also extend to financial institutions in ensuring they retain customer records according to specified time lines. • The strategy will also entail providing specific guidelines on how to meet these requirements. \r   • A key part of the public/private sector collaborative strategy will be to put in place measures to reduce reliance on foreign controlled networks to store personal information of Nigeria Citizens. • This will have the impact of reducing the risk footprint as well as the potential for such data to be compromised and used to the detriment of Nigerians • This is an immediate and ongoing initiative 4.3.5 Initiative 5: Raising Awareness • While implementing cybercrime legislations are paramount in combating cybercrime, it is to be noted that making citizens aware of the threats and vulnerabilities that can accrue to them when they use the internet, is a measure that can be used to reduce the likelihood of them being victims of cybercrime. • Raising awareness of the new laws through high profile campaigns is an initiative that will be used to make criminals aware of the consequences of being in breach of these legislations once they are enacted. • It is also part of the strategy to socialise these new laws to the wider international community. • This is an immediate initiative 4.4 Special Areas of Focus: 4.4.1 Data Protection, Privacy and Lawful Interception. • Personal Information has economic and political value. The recent identification of Nigeria as a MINT (i.e. Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) country not only raises its profile in monetary and economic terms, it also raises the risk of infrastructure and systems containing Nigerian citizens data being targeted by unscrupulous individuals, organisations and nation states, leading to data loss, leakage as well as confidentiality, integrity and availability compromise. • The recent revelations of American whistle-blower Edward Snowden has significantly raised awareness of the need for nations to put in place appropriate measures to protect the personal information, and privacy of its citizens. \r   • The revelations also identified the need to protect and secure communications of not only high ranking government and high profile individuals from mobile phone tapping but also ordinary individuals from their everyday non-criminal conversations being intercepted and analysed by law enforcement agencies, organisations and foreign countries. • To protect and legislate for criminal activities against Nigerian Citizens data and their communications special emphasis will be given to the development and roll out of Data Protection and Privacy laws in Nigeria. NCSS Fig 3 Data Protection and Privacy • The objective of this initiative will be to ensure individuals and organisations are aware of their responsibilities when handling and processing personal information. • It will also allow them to be aware of what constitutes unacceptable and illegal behaviour in relation to the use of such information and communication streams. • The legislative, technical and policy initiatives to fulfil this aim will consist of the following: \r   i. Developing and enacting fit for purpose Data Protection and Privacy laws. ii. Defining minimum policy and standards requirements for handling personal information iii. Defining data Protection requirements for outsourcing initiatives. iv. Deploying an effective and transparent Lawful Interception regime. v. Deploying appropriate and workable data retention periods to assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. vi. Defining Data Protection Requirements for safeguarding Nigerian Citizens details on government systems vii. Defining minimum technical measures that need to be in place to safeguard against personal information compromise viii. Identifying where Nigerian Citizens Data details are held and if systems held on are appropriately protected ix. Identifying Data Leakage Areas with view to reducing risk x. Developing and implementing fit for purpose guidelines xi. Liaison with Communication service providers to provide their customers with advice on how to protect themselves from cybercriminal activities xii. Liaison with both private and public sector commercial organisations to help them understand the measures they need to take to reduce their risks to data protection and privacy breaches \r   xiii. Liaising with NCC , NITDA, Central Bank , Judiciary and Military to drive data protection in Telecoms, Finance and, government institutions and Judiciary xiv. Establishment of a new regulatory body for adjudicating and providing guidelines on Data Protection, Privacy and Lawful Interception xv. Reduce reliance on foreign-hosted cloud services for storing personal data of Nigerian Citizens. xvi. Long-term strategy is to Partner with Nigerian Service providers to develop capabilities to provide local cloud service capabilities. NCSS Fig 4: Data Protection Impact Point \r   CHAPTER FIVE NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 5.1 Purpose: 5.1.1 The strategy on incident management is designed to effectively deter and respond to cyber threats and cybercrime that will leverage on an efficient emergency readiness and coordination capability. 5.1.2 The strategy will also facilitate, promote and strengthen national commitments to regional and global partnerships and cooperation on cybersecurity. 5.2 Establishing National CERT: 5.2.1 The Nigerian Computer Emergency Team (ngCERT) shall be established to ensure efficient response to security incidents within our cyberspace. 5.2.2 An effective computer emergency response capability is essential to monitor and deter threats that can exploit information system vulnerabilities. 5.2.3 The Nigerian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ngCERT) will be empowered by a legal framework through which its functions and responsibilities are defined. \r   5.2.4 However, where existing laws are inadequate, a review or new legislative processes should commence to address legal vacuum that will hinder operations of the national CERT. 5.2.5 The harmonized laws should clearly mandate it to function as of one the strategic components of the central coordinating center for all computer security incident management within our national cyberspace. Additionally, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT. 5.2.6 Additionally, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT. 5.3 Implementation Approach 5.3.1 A National Incident Response Plan (NIRP) will be formulated to achieve a coordinated emergency response protocols. It will govern both the national and sectorial CERTs 5.3.2 The plan will set out clear definitions and procedures for incident response that will focus on incident classification and its severance. 5.3.3 In addition, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT. 5.3.4 CEMS will classify threats that constitute a national-level cyber incident requiring ngCERT involvement and the triggering of incident response protocols. 5.4 Initiative 1: Preventive Strategy 5.4.1 All key national information infrastructures shall have a preventive mechanism for network monitoring system integrated into CEMS. \r   5.4.2 The preventive strategy will primarily be implemented by CEMS for analysis and detection as well as alert notification. 5.4.3 CEMS operational procedure will define the baseline security monitoring for broad detection of malicious or anomalous network activity within our cyberspace and specify specialized security monitoring for critical assets and critical processes within the context of the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP). 5.5 Initiative 2: Detection Strategy 5.5.1 The Cyber Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) will serve as the main provider of data analysis and reporting to other key detection and response partners across the incident management ecosystem. 5.5.2 Its key focus is to consistently monitor indicators within the nation’s cyber space in order to detect potential threats and classify them according to its severance level determined. This can serve as an alert to the trigger the next chain of activity in the response protocols. 5.6 Initiative 3 Response Strategy: 5.6.1 After an incident is detected and validated by the CEMS, direct and coordinated action will be implemented immediately to ensure that appropriate actions to stop an on-going incident occur at the right time on the right cybersecurity priorities. 5.6.2 The action plan will require identifying the scope and scale of the incident in order to activate the relevant countermeasures procedures as outlined in NIRP to mitigate damages. Investigating cybercrime incident requires a strict evidence preservation procedures showing appropriate evidence handling procedure and \r   established chain of custody. Therefore, it is necessary for incident handlers to take appropriated measures in order to preserve any artefacts that could be of evidential value by recording, reviewing and resolving security incidents with the established incident management processes as define in the NIRP. Additionally, ngCERT is expected to document all such report as will be required to be submitted by all monitored information infrastructure custodians in order to evaluate the effectiveness of response plan through lessons learned. 5.7 Cooperation and Partnership 5.7.2 The ngCERT under the framework of National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center will coordinate activities of other sectorial CERT and facilitates cooperation and partnership of all cybersecurity stakeholders, including international and multilateral organizations. 5.7.3 It is imperative to note that, sharing of action noteworthy information about new threats and vulnerabilities with partners by ngCERT will avail them the security status of the national cyberspace and the need to protect it 5.7.4 NgCERT also will enable both government and private sector actors through stimulated exercises to support stakeholders understand their roles during a crisis and better prepare for incident response scenarios. This will test incident response capabilities and processes created to communicate, collaborate, and restore services in the event of an incident. 5.8 Capacity Building 5.8.2 To sustain an optimal incident response readiness capability, technical and procedural capacity building will be instituted for both law enforcement as well as judicial officers to build their expertise and facilitate understanding of the dynamics of cybercrime. \r   5.8.3 Training will focus on methods of handling digital evidence to ensure that it preserves its evidential weight and thus admissibility in Court. 5.9 National Digital Forensic Mechanism 5.9.1 The National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center shall develop a framework for the setting up of a National Digital Forensic Laboratory as a core unit under the coordination of NCCC. 5.9.2 The implementation and coordination of digital forensic technical and management guidelines will help develop guide for the law enforcement and security agency engagement in digital forensic investigation, analysis, interpretation and reconstruction of e-crime scene. \r   CHAPTER SIX STRATEGY ON CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURES PROTECTION & RESILIENCE 6.1 Introduction 6.1.1 This Strategy articulates the various Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) protection and resilience activities the Government undertakes, ranging from how it engages with business, government (international and domestic) as well as other stakeholders. 6.1.2 This Strategy presents the Government’s approach to Critical Information Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIIPR). 6.1.3 It also acknowledges that CIIPR is a shared responsibility across governments, the owners and operators of critical infrastructure. 6.2 Vision of CIIPR • To ensure continued operation of CII in the face of all hazards, as this critical infrastructure supports national defense and security, and underpins our economic prosperity and social wellbeing. \r   6.3 Mission of CIIPR • To harness all relevant stakeholder’s CIIPR Programs into a national holistic agenda capable of supporting the country’s national security and ensure provision of essential services. 6.4 Strategic Objectives i. Assess threats to, vulnerabilities of, and consequences to critical infrastructure through an intelligent and information-led, risk management approach. ii. Secure CII against physical, human and cyber threats through sustainable efforts to reduce risk. iii. Enhance CII resilience by reducing impact of unforeseen and unexpected incidents through advance planning and mitigation efforts, as well as effective responses aimed at saving lives and ensuring rapid recovery of essential services; iv. Share relevant information across the CII community to build awareness and enable a coordinated risk- informed decision making, while promoting a learning and adaptation during and after exercises and incidents impacting on CII. v. These objectives will be supported by regular developments of more specific priorities by key critical infrastructure partnerships related to risk management and capability enhancement. vi. Based on the vision, mission, and goals, the critical infrastructure community will work together to set specific national priorities. National priorities will be set considering resource availability, progress already made, known capability gaps, and emerging trends and risks in cybersecurity. \r   vii. National priorities will drive implementation and will be supplemented by sector, regional, and corporate priorities. Performance measures will be set based on the goals and priorities of each sector, regional or national Government. viii. The National Annual Preparedness Report will include measurements of progress that will help derive a common understanding of the state of critical infrastructure security and resilient efforts. 6.5 STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO ACHIEVE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 6.5.1 The Government recognizes the importance of critical infrastructure, including those parts that provide essential services for everyday life (such as energy, food, water, transport, communications, health and banking and finance). A disruption to critical infrastructure could have a range of serious implications for business, governments and our social wellbeing. 6.6 Initiative 1: Operate an effective business-government partnership with critical infrastructure owners and operators. • A significant proportion of the nation’s critical infrastructure is privately owned or operated on a commercial basis. • A business-government partnership will be established to help build confidence and reliability for the continued operation of critical infrastructure that supports national security, economic prosperity, and social and community wellbeing. • It is important that the business-government partnership offers value and mutual benefit to the parties involved. \r   6.6.1 Necessity for Trust Information Sharing Network (TISN) Activity for NCIIPP • There will be need for the establishment of a TISN for National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP). • This network will comprise of relevant private sector and government representatives, to raise the awareness of risks to critical information infrastructure, share information and techniques required to assess and mitigate risks, and build resilience capacity within entities in the network. • Working with the TISN, the private sector is able to bring issues to government that are seen as impediments to achieving critical information infrastructure protect. • The TISN will be the most visible component of the public-private partnership and will provide an important mechanism to foster cooperation between public- private stakeholders on mutually important issues. • The TISN will raise awareness on critical infrastructure issues, including potential impediments to achieving CIP. Government agencies directly involved in CIP are able to better represent stakeholder interests in the various machineries of government that are used to develop and implement Government policy and act as critical infrastructure advocates in the broader policy debate. • Accordingly, Government agencies that have a role in implementing the CIP Strategy are able to influence or shape government policy initiatives that have impact on critical infrastructure organizations and their ability to achieve CIP. \r   6.6.2 Trusted Information Sharing Network Initiative (TISN) • The TISN will be established in the Office of the National Security Adviser as an exclusive forum in which the owners and operators of critical infrastructure work come together and share information on threats and vulnerabilities as well as develop strategies and solutions to mitigate risk to the nation’s CII. • TISN members include owners and operators of critical infrastructure, Federal, State and local government agency representatives as well as departments and agencies of government. • The TISN, through its Sector and Expert Advisory Groups, will promote infrastructure protection to owners and operators as well as promote the need for investment in resilient and reliable infrastructure. 6.6.3 Sector Groups • Sector Groups form the bridge between government and the individual owners and operators of Nigeria’s critical infrastructure. • Their purpose is to assist owners and operators to share information on issues relating to generic threats, vulnerabilities and to identify appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate risk. 6.6.4 Sector Specific Plans • There will be sector specific plans for each sector which will highlight sector level performance objectives and feedback to the coordinating agency of government charged with the responsibility of managing the sector. • For example, the sector specific plan for the Information Technology Sector will be coordinated and managed by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology. In collaboration with other stakeholders \r   (public and private sector partners), this Ministry will develop and implement a Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) to enable assessment of national, cross sector critical infrastructure protection and resilience plan. (Please see appendices pages for a sample approach to implementing sector specific plan and program). • Sector specific plan will be developed for other critical infrastructure sectors including but not limited to: Communications Sector Government Facilities Sector Manufacturing Sector Dams Sector Defence Sector Chemical Sector Power and Energy Sector Commercial Facilities Sector Financial Services Sector Food and Agriculture Sector Emergency Services Sector Transportation Systems Sector Public Health and Healthcare Sector Water & Waste Water systems Information Technology Sector 6.7 Initiative 2: Identifying and Evaluating Potential Critical information Infrastructure 6.7.1 Identification • There will be national, sectorial and organizational approach in identifying and refining actual and potential critical information infrastructure. • The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Unit of the Office of NSA (NCIIPU) will work with other government agencies, owners and \r   operators of critical infrastructure to ensure an on-going identification of critical information infrastructure. • Due to infrastructure investment and expansion, advent of new technologies, population growth and increasing interdependence of systems and technologies, identification process will be subject to continual review. . 6.7.2 Evaluation • After the identification of potential critical components of information infrastructure, there will be the need for the evaluation to understand the mode of operation and estimate its risk levels and criticality. • The evaluation process relies on the cooperation of infrastructure owners and operators. Having an understanding of the estimated risk and criticality levels is important for the government. However, this does not replace the owner’s responsibility to develop a robust risk management program to safeguard their assets from known and unknown threats. 6.8 Initiative 3: Enhancing Strategic Readiness of Infrastructure Owners and Operators • A key component of the NCIIPP is to sensitize owners and operators to adopt best practices in their approach to planning and preparedness. This will ensure a structured, logical and rigorous approach on the most appropriate steps to take in order to prevent, detect, react and recover from any incident of potential disruptive value. \r   • Strategic readiness will enable owners and operators identify vulnerabilities and interdependencies as well as plan redundancy programmes including risks from acts of terrorism. • It is suggested that owners and operators consider the following approach in their preparedness towards enhancing the strategic readiness for protection of critical information infrastructure. i. Prevention and Early Warning Strategy ii. Detection Strategy iii. Reaction Strategy iv. Crisis Management Strategy READINESS APPROACH TO NCIIPP Prevention and Early Warning Strategy Goal: Ensure CII are less vulnerable to disruptions and impairment duration is short and limited in proportion. Approach: Periodic dissemination of guidelines and best practices on specific threats using the TSIN framework Detection Strategy Goal: Discover and detect emerging threats on a timely basis Approach: NCIIPU in collaboration with ngCERT will identify and detect new forms of technical an non-technical attacks Reaction Strategy Goal: Identification and correction of causes of disruption. Approach: NCIIPU in collaboration with ngCERT will maintain a 24/7 incident reporting service. Furthermore, distribution of incident report and reaction among TISN members to share lesson learned in improving crisis and emergency planning Crisis Management Strategy Goal: Alert key actors of CII of the interdependencies and minimizing effects of disruptions on society. \r   Approach: Using TSIN and ngCERT frameworks, constant rehearsals and practice of defined crisis management strategies NCSS \r  Figure \r  5: \r  Four \r  Pillars \r  of \r  Critical \r  Infrastructure \r  Protection \r  [adapted \r  from \r  ITU’s \r  A \r  Generic \r   \r   National \r  Framework \r  for \r  Critical \r  Information \r  Infrastructure \r  Protection \r  (CIIP)] \r   6.9 Initiative 4: Identify, analyse and manage cross-sectorial dependencies • The identification and analysis of cross-sectorial dependencies assists the risk management decision making of critical infrastructure organizations and helps to inform the Government’s policy on CIP. • Critical infrastructure by nature are highly interdependent, so that failure or disruption in one sector can lead to disruptions in other sectors. For instance, owners and operators of water infrastructure rely on electricity for pumping and telecommunications for monitoring operations. Similarly, the communications industry needs electricity to run their networks, and the electricity industry needs telemetry services to run their operations and electricity marketing. \r   • A cross-sectorial analysis of dependencies will assist owners and operators of critical infrastructure and the Nigerian Government to understand system-wide risks that are beyond the purview of individual organizations or sectors. • This increases the potential for a more effective sharing of risk to cope with certain incidents. The Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) is proposed as a key initiative of the Nigerian Government’s efforts to enhance the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure in Nigeria. 6.9.1 The Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) • CIPMA is a computer-based capability, which uses a vast array of data and information from a range of sources (including the owners and operators of critical infrastructure) to model and simulate the behavior and dependency relationships of critical infrastructure systems. • CIPMA uses an all hazards approach to undertake computer modelling to determine the consequences of different disasters and threats (human and natural) to critical infrastructure. • Owners and operators of critical infrastructure can use this information to prevent, prepare for, respond to or recover from a natural or human-caused hazard. • CIPMA also helps government shape policies on national security and critical infrastructure resilience. • CIPMA is an important capability to support the business-government partnership, and relies on strong support from stakeholders such as owners and operators of critical infrastructure, Federal, State and local governments, and government agencies for its ongoing development. \r   • Importantly, CIPMA can show the relationships and dependencies between critical infrastructure systems, and the cascade impacts from a failure in one sector on the operations of critical infrastructure in other sectors. • NCIPP unit manages CIPMA and works with ONSA-NCCC and other technical service providers to further develop and deliver this whole-of- government capability. 6.10 Success Criteria And Review Of CIIP Strategy • Critical infrastructure protection and resilience is an ongoing process that requires periodic review and fine tuning of the activities under each strategic imperative will be required as the strategy is implemented. 6.10.1 Mechanism for Measuring Success: Success will be measured through following mechanisms: • Effective Critical Information Infrastructure Protection is reliant on a strong, collaborative partnership between governments and critical infrastructure owners and operators to deliver the Government’s policy aim of the continued operation of critical infrastructure in the face of all cyber threats. • Need for investment in resilient, robust infrastructure (e.g CIPMA) to identify key cross-sectorial dependencies and vulnerabilities with respect to both cyber and physical infrastructure. • Businesses and governments collaborating to progress national research and submission of curriculum inputs to training and research on CIP • Periodic lessons from incident report and reaction exercise activities and real life events propagated to all Sector Groups to enhance organization’s \r   • Understanding of protection and resilience and improve planning arrangements. • Coordination of Nigeria’s international engagement with periodic updates provided to NCCC as required • In order to ensure Government’s policy settings remain appropriate, the CIP Strategy will undergo a comprehensive review after five years of operation. Chapter Seven STRATEGY ON ASSURANCE & MONITORING \r   7.1 Introduction 7.1.1 There is a need to address the issues of cyber threats from risks management and process governance approaches because of the need to address the nation's internal vulnerability and other weakest link. 7.1.2 The development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy designed to address these issues however, is only as good as the National Cybersecurity program that implements it. 7.1.3 The continuous monitoring and review (i.e. assessment and evaluation) of the implementation and management of the National Cybersecurity Program, and the surrounding context that it operates within, will be critical in providing assurance to various stakeholders that the National Cybersecurity program is well able, and continually so, to safeguard our vulnerability and other critical national infrastructure. 7.2 Strategic Objective \r   i. This strategy seeks to establish and maintain a monitoring and an assurance framework that will ensure that the efforts put in place to secure the nations cyberspace are in compliance with international best practices, perform as expected by the stakeholders involved, as well as to maintain the capabilities necessary to protect our nation's cyberspace and other critical infrastructure. ii. To harness, profile, harmonize and priorities various technology neutral information security frameworks that will help determine best standards and guidelines suitable to the national peculiarity and in line with international best practices. iii. To achieve coordination of information security regimes through consensus, collaboration, and partnership with relevant stakeholders. iv. To facilitate national awareness on the criticality of ensuring and enabling information security conscious operational environment both in the public and private sectors 7.3 The Cybersecurity Assurance context • The surrounding context within which the cybersecurity assurance mechanism will operate and monitor include the following: i. The National Cybersecurity Strategy This is the foundation on which the National Cybersecurity Assurance Program and action plans will be built, it will be periodically reviewed to provide assurance that will continue to address evolving threats in a dynamic threat environment. ii. Stakeholders' Commitment to Cybersecurity \r   • An effective and efficient National Cybersecurity Assurance Program will require clear direction, commitment from the highest level of Government, top management and administration executive among others. \r   \r   • The \"tone at the top\" will determine to a large extent the commitment shown by others in the lower cadres as it relates to Cybersecurity and also the resources committed to effecting the Program. This will be periodically reviewed and adequate strategies developed to ensure that those at the top are motivated to ensure consistent commitment to the cause of Cybersecurity. \r   \r   \r   iii. Cybersecurity awareness level \r   \r   • The level to which all citizens of the country become aware of, and educated about cybersecurity issues will to a large extent determine how strong the cybersecurity efforts of the nation will be. As security is only as strong as its weakest link. Initiatives to continually create awareness among the citizens will be established and continually reviewed for effectiveness. \r   \r   iv. The Regulatory/Legal environment \r   • The Cybersecurity bill, National Cyber Security Policy and other laws, policies and regulations will be periodically reviewed to ensure that they continue to be relevant, properly streamlined and serve as a good legal foundation to support the initiatives to secure the nation's cyberspace. \r   \r   v. Cybersecurity Capabilities, Skills, Expertise • The level of skills, capabilities and expertise possessed by the personnel that will be charged with the responsibility of securing the nation's cyberspace, who will essentially be Nigerian citizens, will go a long way in determining how well it will be done. \r   \r   \r   • Lack of adequately skilled personnel is a major vulnerability, and operating a national cybersecurity program within this context will constitute a major risk to the nation, therefore the capabilities, skills and expertise of personnel as related to the skills required to continually defend our nation in cyberspace will be periodically assessed and recommendations made to address any shortcoming. \r   \r   vi. Risk Management Program \r   • An effective cybersecurity risk management process will enable the nation to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to the nation's cyberspace. These will include threat analysis both for determining evolving threats to the nation's cyberspace and emerging trends and threats. \r   \r   • These information feeds into the Cybersecurity program to ensure that it continues to provide countermeasures that will protect the nation against both current and future threats to the nation’s cyberspace and also serve as a basis for prioritizing responses to such threats based on risk/impact level. \r   \r   • The Risk Management program will be established and continually reassessed to ensure it continues to provide relevant information to help proactively protect our presence in cyberspace. \r   \r   v. Cooperation/Collaboration and Communication/ \r   Information sharing \r   \r   • Level of Public-Private collaboration, intergovernmental, inter- sectorial and international collaboration and communication will continually be assessed to ensure that maximum benefits that leads to a more secure cyberspace are achieved from such collaboration/cooperation and information sharing. \r   \r   \r   viii \r  National Cybersecurity program \r   Assurance activities including periodic assessment and reviews will be carried out to provide assurance that the cybersecurity program is achieving its objectives and that such objectives will aligned with SMART framework i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results- focused and Time-bound \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   NCSS \r  Figure \r  6 \r  The \r  Cybersecurity \r  Assurance \r  context \r  -­‐ \r  It \r  shows \r  the \r  logical \r  environment \r  within \r  which \r  the \r  Cybersecurity \r   Assurance \r  mechanism \r  will \r  operate \r  and \r  monitor. \r   7.4 Focal Points 7.4.1 Monitor the implementation program for the Cyber Security Strategy to provide assurance that the program is meeting, and will continue to meet stakeholder's expectations within a dynamic cyber landscape. 7.4.2 Make recommendations on possible improvements in the Cyber Security Strategy itself based on observed changes in threats profile. 7.4.3 Encourage, monitor and review the adoption of national and international best practices as codified in the international frameworks and standards to ensure National \r  Cybersecurity \r  Strategy \r   National \r  Cybersecurity \r  Program \r   Cooperation \r  and \r  Information \r  sharing \r   \r   Cybersecurity \r   Assurance \r   \r   (Assessment \r  and \r   Monitoring) \r   \r   Risk \r  Management \r  program \r  Stakeholders' \r  Commitment \r   Regulatory/Legal \r  environment \r   Cybersecurity \r  awareness \r  level \r   Cybersecurity \r  Capabilities, \r  Skills, \r  Expertise \r   \r   national cybersecurity practices that compare well with international standards and practices and also serve as a basis for benchmarking our maturity level. 7.4.4 Monitor and review cybersecurity capabilities of actors at the national, state and sectorial levels to ensure continuous improvement and development of relevant capabilities, skills and proficiencies, enabling them to defend our nation in the face of present and future threats to the nation’s cyberspace. 7.4.5 Monitor and review level of preparedness and capacity of various actors at the national, state and sectorial levels to ensure their readiness to defend our nation in the face of present and future threats to the nation’s cyberspace. 7.4.6 Ensure a continuous improvement process for cybersecurity. 7. 4.7 To develop performance measures both at the policy, strategic, tactical and operational levels based on the proposed Cybersecurity balanced scorecard and perform reviews based on these measures to ensure feedback on performance of the National Cybersecurity program so that adequate corrective and improvement changes can be made. 7.4.8 Conducting information security audits and process audits for government entities and also coordinating and validating security audits and process audits of self- assessment entities. \r   7.4.9 Conducting and coordinating information security risk assessment and analysis while establishing reasonable security guidelines and measures to protect data and systems. 7.5 Strategy 7.5.1 Initiative 1 • The National Cybersecurity Assurance Department as an arm of the NCCC will be established to serve as a mechanism for fulfilling all Assurance and Monitoring focal points. \r   • The department will be charged with the responsibilities of providing assurance as regards the National Cybersecurity program. • The unit will be set up at the start of implementation of the National Cybersecurity program. 7.5.2 Initiative 2 • The Strategy approach to cybersecurity governance is anchored on a sound technology neutral framework. This is line with global best practice, while emphasizing the need for an effective business governance process from a risk management approach. • The dynamism of cybersecurity risks requires a flexible and responsive risk management strategy. • Thus, this Strategy provides adoptable and adaptable fit-for-purpose International Standards and frameworks for information Security Governance, Risk and Control in line with globally consensus. • This strategy will facilitate cooperation among stakeholders responsible for ensuring the security and safety of our cyberspace and other critical infrastructure towards ensuring commonality in approaches to cybersecurity and standardization. • This initiative recommends consensus driven international standards and multi-stakeholders’ frameworks on information security assurance. 7.5.3. Initiative 3 • With a definite timeline, the strategy will implement continuous monitoring software solutions for vulnerability and security configuration compliance monitoring, threat management functions and penetration testing activities to \r   identify alterations and weaknesses in security configurations on critical national infrastructure. \r   7.5.4 Initiative 4 \r   • An effective Cybersecurity risk assessment program will be established with a definite timeline. \r   7.5.5. Initiative 5 \r   • This strategy will implement a core assurance capability thus enabling the nation to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of cybersecurity controls, when evaluated from an attacker’s perspective, to deny the compromise of critical nation infrastructure. \r   7.5.6.

This national cybersecurity strategy provides for a coherent and coordinated cybersecurity skills and human empowerment framework as envisioned in the National Cybersecurity Policy. 8.2 Objectives: Cybersecurity skills development is a national priority and also a foundation for the achievement of national cybersecurity readiness. Therefore, this focus area aims to achieve the following objectives: i. To provide an institutional framework anchors on public-private partnership towards building local professional skills. ii. To provide central coordination and regulation of skills development within the public sector. iii. To help build framework for public-private partnership on professional training and capacity building in cybersecurity for private sector \r   towards promoting common understanding on cybersecurity challenge. 8.3 Scope 8.3.1 The scope of the national cybersecurity skills development include the following; i. To leverage on cybersecurity in national securi ty and economic innovation for competi t ive advantage. ii. To develop cybersecurity professional skills roadmap that will facilitate emergence of local content and expertise. iii. To harness initiatives that will stimulate emergence of cybersecurity industry in Nigeria. 8.3.2 Therefore, this section focuses on the framework for the creation of programmes to increase the cadre of cybersecurity professionals in Managerial, Technical and Information Assurance areas rather than general user awareness and education. It further advocate for re- organization of the nation’s educational priorities to address cybersecurity challenges and opportunities. 8.4 Initiatives \r   \r   8.4.1 A specialized national skills development and empowerment initiative on cybersecurity covering various level of knowledge in information assurance will be established under the National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center. \r   • The initiative will be set up under the framework of Nigeria Institution of Cybersecurity (NIOC) in partnership with stakeholders as enshrined in the National Cybersecurity Policy. \r   \r   § The framework will involve designing, developing, and implementing level of skills, requirement, coordination, certifications, regulations, capabilities and expertise to be possessed by the personnel that will be charged with \r   the responsibility of securing and maintaining the nation's presence in cyberspace, who will essentially be Nigerian citizens. \r   \r   § Lack of adequately skilled personnel is a major vulnerability, and operating a national cybersecurity program within this context will constitute a major risk to the nation, therefore the capabilities, skills and expertise of personnel charged with the responsibility of defending our presence in cyberspace will be periodically assessed, regulated and recommendations made to address identified gaps. \r   \r   \r   \r   8.5 \r   \r   Roadmap \r  for \r  Nigeria \r  Cybersecurity \r  Industry: \r   \r   8.5.1 \r   In \r  Nigeria, \r   cybersecurity \r   essential \r   skills \r   at \r   the \r   public \r   institutions \r   and \r   industry \r   level \r  engagement \r  are \r  scarce. \r  The \r  scarcely \r  available \r  ones \r  are \r  extremely \r  limited \r  in \r   their \r  scope \r  and \r  capabilities \r  to \r  safeguard \r  and \r  protect \r  critical \r   industries. \r  Various \r   genuine \r  concerns \r  have \r  been \r  expressed \r  on \r  the \r  apparently \r  incapacity \r  of \r  Nigeria \r  as \r   a \r  nation \r   to \r  protect \r   itself \r  and \r  her \r   industry \r   in \r   the \r   face \r  of \r  a \r  major \r  attacks \r  on \r  her \r   Critical \r  Information \r  and \r  Related \r  Infrastructures. \r   \r   8.5.2 \r   Stakeholders \r   from \r   Industries, \r   law \r   enforcement \r   agencies, \r   academics, \r   non-­‐ governmental \r   organizations, \r   government \r  Ministries, \r  Department \r   and \r  Agencies, \r   Nigeria \r   Professionals \r   in \r   diasporas \r   should \r   emerge \r   together \r   under \r   a \r   proposed \r   framework \r  for \r  cybersecurity \r  profession \r  umbrella \r  body \r  to \r  help \r  the \r  country \r  drive \r   common \r   professional \r   synergy \r   on \r   cybersecurity \r   instrument \r   of \r   research \r   and \r   development, \r   innovations, \r   and \r   trusted \r   cooperation \r   necessary \r   for \r   a \r   national \r   cohesion \r  on \r  cybersecurity. \r   \r   8.5.3 \r   \r   The \r  proposed \r  government \r  and \r  private \r  sector \r  synergy \r  should \r  culminate \r  into \r  the \r   formation \r  of \r  Nigeria \r   Institution \r  of \r   Cybersecurity \r   (NIOC) \r   that \r  will \r   help \r  develop \r   and \r  drive \r  a \r  coherent \r  body \r  of \r  useful \r  and \r  applicable \r  knowledge \r  in \r  cybersecurity. \r   \r   \r   8.5.4 \r   The \r  NIOC \r  will \r  be \r  expected \r  to \r  be \r  built \r  on \r  nationwide \r  standards \r  with \r  the \r  aim \r  of \r   harmonizing, \r   developing, \r   promoting \r   and \r   enhancing \r   multidisciplinary \r   professional \r   skills \r   capacity \r   and \r   standards \r   in \r   the \r  development \r  of \r  Cybersecurity \r   industry, \r   while \r   providing \r   opportunity \r   for \r   the \r   citizen \r   positive \r   engagement \r   in \r   cyberspace. \r   \r   8.5.5 \r   It \r   is \r   expected \r   that \r   by \r   promoting \r   national \r   dignity, \r   preserving \r   national \r   security \r   and \r   economic \r   values, \r   including \r   international \r   standards \r   on \r   multidisciplinary \r   professionalism \r   and \r   expertise, \r   the \r   institution \r   will \r   serve \r   the \r   human \r   resources \r   needs \r   of \r   the \r   country \r   in \r   both \r   the \r   government \r   and \r   private \r   sectors \r   covering \r   all \r   \r   aspect \r   of \r   cybersecurity \r   as \r   defined \r   through \r   the \r   international \r   framework \r   of \r   cooperation \r   on \r   cybersecurity \r   and \r   other \r   widely \r   recognized \r   international \r   best \r   practices. \r   \r   \r   \r

Securing Nigeria in Cyberspace: To build an infinitely sustainable cybersecurity readiness, there is critical need to focus on our collective strength, sense of responsibility, excellence, prudency, and strategic appropriation of our collective ingenuity for the benefit of protecting our common wealth in cyberspace within the current and future dispensation. \r   \r   CHAPTER NINE STRATEGY ON ONLINE CHILD ABUSE & EXPLOITATIONS 9.1 Introduction: • Cyberspace has brought huge benefits to children around the world, with the number of connected households increasing each year. While the potential for good is undisputed, Internet has become increasingly accessible to the critical segment of our population i.e. Nigerian children and young people, both at home and in schools. • Rather than surfing the Internet passively, children and young people participate in a dynamic online environment that allows them to generate, manipulate and consume internet content like never before, forging their place and identity in online communities. • More importantly, as a result of the universal availability of Internet access in homes, schools, libraries, mobile phones, etc., children are increasingly becoming involved in the use of the new technological application and taking advantage of the opportunity it provides for learning, research, entertainment and business. • However, the Internet has also raised new and disturbing issues of vulnerability, especially for children. It exposes children to potentially negative contents. • Children and Young Persons are the most active participants in online social networking and therefore are potential victims of improperly disseminated and dysfunctional contents that could cause disorientation and threaten their survival and that of the society. • There are growing concerns on the distribution of online child abuse materials targeted to children which are making them vulnerable to child pornography, sexual abuse, harassment, exploitation, extremism, brain washing for terrorist \r   acts of violence and human trafficking resulting into unpleasant outcome of the information age. • In order to address these issues of child online exploitation and its disastrous consequences, the National Cybersecurity Policy viewed it as one of the critical areas of focus. 9.2 Rationale for COAEP 9.2.1 The National Cybersecurity Policy framework provides a rationale and philosophy to guide development of strategy for Nigerian Child Online Abuse and Exploitation. 9.2.2 The Principles on Child Online Abuse & Exploitation and Counter-measures emphasized Social Media as a vital attractive channel and tool for social interactions and productive engagements. Regrettably, the openness and transparent nature of cyberspace have been exploited for good causes and malicious intents. 9.2.3 Therefore, there is need for the following actions; i. Integration of Child Online Abuse and Exploitation into National legislation on cybercrime and cybersecurity. ii. There is a need to establish that any act against a child which is illegal in the real world is illegal online and that online data protection and privacy rules for legal minor are also adequate. iii. Ensure that a mechanism is established and is widely promoted to provide a readily understood means for reporting illegal content found on the internet , for example , a national hotline which has the capacity to respond rapidly and have illegal material removed or rendered inaccessible 9.2.4 It is the intention of government to harness counter-measures through a legislative framework, policy and strategic actions to address cyber abuse and online exploitation of Nigerian Child in a manner that will prevent and curtail cybercriminal intents and related malicious acts inimical to the national dignity, security and economic interests of the country. 9.3 Objectives 9.3.1 To provide common approach in the development and implementation of National Countermeasures strategy. \r   9.3.2 To provide robust security initiatives, action plan, and roadmap that will give overall direction to the planning and implementation of these countermeasures strategy within the framework of National Security. 9.3.3 The strategy addresses urgent security and law enforcement challenges, roles and shared responsibilities and government interventions. 9.3.4 The strategy harnesses frameworks that provide coherent structure for coordination of multi stakeholder engagement. 9.4 Strategic Approach These objectives are anchored through the following approaches while considering our socio-economic security peculiarity and vulnerable operating environment for the purpose of protecting Nigerian children and young generations on the internet. i. The National Cybersecurity Strategy approach adopts multi-stakeholder and multi-sectorial collaboration through partnership and alliances of government and key actors with clearly defined and specific guidelines for policy makers, law enforcement and security agencies. ii. The partnership and alliances will be forged to ensure cooperation for action and mutual awareness among stakeholders on the consequence of improper engagement in cyberspace. 9.5 Strategy 9.5.1 Initiative 1: Focusing on National Process Mechanism i. There shall be Infusion of Child Online Abuse and Exploitation Protection Strategy (COAEPS) into the larger framework for National cooperation on cybersecurity. ii. Establishment of a unit under the National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center (NCCC) to handle matters relating to Child Online Abuse and Exploitation within the scope National Cybersecurity Policy. iii. The COAEP unit of NCCC will collaborate with industry regulators and operators to implement a coherent Countermeasures Technical Mechanisms (CTM) to prevent access to web sites identified as hosting \r   contents that are offensive to children and to implement processes to enable the removal of any child sexual abuse content posted on their own services. iv. The Unit will provide partnership mechanism in regard to the promotion of public awareness, messages and campaigns center on safety and security of Nigeria children interactions online. v. The unit will train and build the capacity of Nigerian Law enforcement officers to conduct investigations into Internet related crimes against children and young people and maintain a register of convicted online crime offenders. vi. The unit will facilitate national processes which ensure that all Child Abuse and Exploitation materials found in cyberspace are channeled towards a centralized, national resource. 9.5.2 Initiative 2: Focusing on International Process Mechanism i. The NCCC will drive Virtual National Taskforce (VNT) which will work with Virtual Global Taskforce, a law enforcement body which provides a 24/7 mechanism to receive reports about illegal behavior or content from persons across the globe. The nation will develop modality for working with this global security platform most especially for countermeasures against terrorist recruitment and online predators.3 ii. It is strategically essential that the Nigerian law enforcement community becomes fully informed through training and capacity building and empower through legislation to help make the Internet safer for children and young people. iii. Investing in training for law enforcement, prosecutorial and building capacity of Nigerian Judges through collaboration with National Judiciary Institutes. Investment will also be needed in acquiring and maintaining the facilities necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital devices on Child Abuse Materials. 9.6 Operational Measures \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   3 \r   \r   \r   9.6.1 NCCC will ensure that a working mechanism is established and is widely promoted to provide a readily understood means for reporting illegal content found on the Internet, for example, a national hotline which has the capacity to respond rapidly and have illegal material removed or rendered inaccessible. 9.6.2 NCCC will ensure various security and law enforcement agencies in the country implement abuse report mechanisms which will be prominently displayed on relevant parts of any web site that allows user generated content to appear. It should also be possible for people who feel threatened in any way, or for people who have witnessed any worrying activity on the Internet, to be able to report it as quickly as possible to the relevant law enforcement agencies that need to be trained and ready to respond. 9.6.3 NCCC will promote a number of software programmes which can help screen out unwanted material or block unwanted contacts. Utilizing some of the child safety and filtering programmes because they are part of a computer’s operating system or they are provided as part of a package available from an ISP or ESP. The manufacturers of some game consoles also provide similar tools if the device is Internet enabled. These programmes are not foolproof but they can provide a welcome level of support, particularly in families with younger children. These technical tools will be used as part of a broader arsenal. Parental and/or guardian involvement is critical. 9.6.4 It is strategically essential that the Nigerian law enforcement community becomes fully engaged with any overall strategy to help make the Internet safer for children and young people. 9.6.5 Nigerian Law enforcement officers will be appropriately trained to conduct investigations into Internet related crimes against children and young people. They need the right level of technical knowledge and access to forensic facilities to enable them to extract and interpret data obtained from computers or the Internet. 9.6.6 NCCC will establish a clear mechanism to enable children and young people, or any member of the public, to report any incidents or concerns they might have about a child’s or a young person’s online safety. 9.7 National Security Response Measures 9.7.1 With escalation of cybercrime, youths based conflict and terrorist recruitment, bombing attack in the country, the Internet has made possible a range of \r   ways of abusing children and recruiting young people, e.g., through web cams, chat rooms and internet blog. 9.7.2 The internet has also played a singular role in expanding the scale on which Child Abuse Material (CAM) has become available in all parts of the world. For these reasons, when addressing online safety concerns for children and young people from national security perspective, the Strategy gives special consideration to the following: i. Outlawing “grooming” or other forms of remote enticement of legal minors into inappropriate sexual contact or sexual activity, possession, production and distribution of CAM, irrespective of the intent to distribute. ii. Taking additional response steps to disrupt or reduce the traffic in CAM, for example by establishing a national hotline and by deploying measures which will block access to web sites and Usenet Newsgroups known to contain or advertise the availability of CAM. iii. Ensuring that national processes are in place which ensure that all CAM found in a country is channeled towards a centralized, national resource. iv. Developing strategies to address the demand for CAM particularly among those who have convictions for such offences. It is important to build awareness of the fact that this is not a victimless crime: children are abused to produce the material being viewed and by intentionally viewing or downloading CAM one is contributing directly to the abuse of the child depicted and one is also encouraging the abuse of more children to produce more pictures. v. Building awareness of the fact that Nigerian children usually would not consent to being sexually abused, whether for the production of CAM or in any other way. Encourage people who use CAM to seek help, while at the same time, making them aware that they will be held criminally responsible for the illegal activity in which they engaged/are engaging. vi. Ensuring that law enforcement crime prevention strategies as well as school-based and social programmes include sections on cyber safety and the risks posed by online predatory behavior, with age appropriate advice. \r   vii. NCCC maintains a register of convicted online crime offenders. Courts have issued judicial orders banning such offenders from using the Internet altogether or from using parts of the Internet which are frequented by children and young people. The problem with these orders hitherto has been its enforcement. viii. Consideration will be given to integrating the list of convicted sex offenders into a block list which will prevent those on it from visiting or joining certain web sites. ix. Providing appropriate long term support for victims. Where children or young people have been victimized online, where for example an illegal image of them has appeared on the Internet, they will naturally feel very concerned about who might have seen it and what impact this will have on them. It could leave the child or young person feeling vulnerable to bullying or to further sexual exploitation and abuse. x. Ensuring that a grassroots’ reporting and intelligence gathering mechanism is established and is widely promoted to provide a readily understood and rapid means for reporting illegal content or illegal or worrying online behavior e.g. a system similar to that which has been established by the Virtual Global Taskforce. The use of the INTERPOLi24/7 system will be encouraged. xi. Ensuring that a sufficient number of law enforcement officials are appropriately trained in investigating Internet and computer-based crime and have access to appropriate forensic facilities to enable them extract and interpret relevant digital data. xii. Investing in training for law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial authorities in the methods used by online criminals to perpetrate these crimes. Investment will also be needed in acquiring and maintaining the facilities necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital devices. xiii. In addition, it will be important to establish bilateral and multilateral collaboration and information exchanges with relevant law enforcement authorities and investigative bodies in other countries. \r   CHAPTER TEN STRATEGY ON PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP 10. 1 Introduction • The present administration has demonstrated her commitment to the prevailing security challenges by taking positive step to re-invigorate National Cybersecurity Strategy as part of the National Security agenda. • The Cybercrime legislation and the need to actualize the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy requires effective machinery of public-private partnership and management framework to drive the buildup process with tripartite synergy of the whole nation including the government, non- government actors and international stakeholders. • In the light of the above, this section seeks to provide the government with a strategic public-partnership management framework approach for the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy. • The key elements of this strategy are as follows: i. The PPP Management Framework to facilitate the cooperation and partnership in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy among the tripartite stakeholders in the country. ii. The Nature of the PPP Framework Model, Benefit, Impact & Direction. iii. Special Purpose Vehicle and Delivery channel through the setting up of PPP for Cyber security (3PC). iv. 3PC Working Document & Terms of Reference v. 3PC Sustainable Strategy \r   vi. Evaluation & Appraisal   10.2 The Imperative of Public-Private Partnership Framework for National Cybersecurity Strategy • In the current dispensation, engagement in cyberspace is central to the existence, survivability, relevancy, as well as security and protection of the public institutions and private sector businesses. • The public and private sectors’ interests are enormously intertwined with a shared responsibility for ensuring a secure cyberspace and a protected critical economic infrastructure upon which businesses and government services depend. • Public-Private Partnership framework is critical to the build-up process and overall success of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. • Right from the commencement of the efforts on National Cybersecurity Strategy since 2003, which was reinvigorated in 2010 and till the present time. Most often, private sectors are usually caught unprepared in the buildup process. • There is a concrete evidence that the Federal government cannot succeed in the many facets of securing National cyberspace if it works in isolation in her build up in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy. Therefore PPPC is set to define roles and responsibilities, integrate capabilities, and facilitate joint ownership of the problems and the challenges towards developing holistic Cybersecurity Strategy. It is only through such sustainable partnerships that the Country will be able to enthrone cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution. • Furthermore, the National Security challenge of securing cyberspace requires an increased effort in all stakeholders’ collaborations. This effort should seek—in continued collaboration with the private sector—to improve the security of national interoperable networks • The private sector, however, designs, invest, builds, owns, operates and maintains most of the critical information infrastructures that support government and private users alike. • Therefore Industry and governments share the responsibility for the \r   security and reliability of the infrastructure and the transactions that take place on it and should work closely together to address these interdependencies. • There are various approaches the NCSS take to address these challenges, some of which require changes in law and policy. • Thus private-sector engagement is required to help address the limitations of law enforcement and national security. The Federal government and the private sector have an enduring interest in assuring the security of the digital infrastructure. Accordingly, government-industry collaboration is fundamental to achieving National Cybersecurity Strategy. • It is, therefore, critically important that government and private sector work together in a proactive way. Successful government-private sector collaboration requires three important component: i. A clear value proposition: • NCCC will articulate the mutual benefits to government and private sector partners. ii. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities. • NCCC will develop a framework for common understanding that will guide mutual working relation and define basis of relationship between NCCC and private sector with clearly define roles and responsibilities. iii. Trust: • This is fundamental and necessary for establishing, developing, and maintaining sharing relationships between government and industry. • NCCC will develop, engender, nurture and infuse a Trust Framework for public-private sector cooperation and understanding on critical issues of cybersecurity assurance and monitoring, sectorial CERT, and critical information infrastructure protection plan. • NCCC will provide a Trust Framework that respect and address industry areas of concern in a manner that will not jeopardize but \r   balance intrinsic business interest and National Interest. 10.3 Public-Private Sector Partnership Management Strategy (PPPMS) 10.3.1 The nature of the proposed PPMF Model involves the following: • A linear build-up structural processes and national coordination through a PPP Special Purpose Vehicle created by NCCC for this purpose • The SPV drives and coordinates all the PPP buildup processes for the coordination of government and industry partnership. Fig 7 The proposed linear build-up process coordination through Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) \r   Special \r  Purpose \r  Vehicle \r   (SPV)Comprising \r  Joint \r  Govt-­‐ \r   Private \r  Sector \r  National \r  Technical \r   Group \r  (NTWG) \r   Build-­‐Up \r  Processes, \r  Cordinating \r   all \r  Activities, \r  Unifying \r  Platform \r   for \r  PPP, \r  Cordination \r  of \r  all \r   National \r  Stakeholders \r   Commencement \r  of \r  Operation \r  of \r   National \r  of \r  Cybersecurity \r   Strategy \r   SPV \r   Components \r   ONSA-­‐Led \r   Govt \r  Reps \r   Muilt-­‐ International \r   Reps \r   \r   Private \r   Sectors \r  Reps \r   \r   • The ONSA through the NCCC will take the lead by establishing PPP- National Technical Working Group (NTWG) composing of representatives from private sector, government organizations and representatives of international multistakeholder partners. • The NTWG should not exceed a number needed to be sufficient representatives of all the interests but at the same time capable of conducting PPP-MF business. • To assure its continued connection to the interests it is intended to represent, provisions could be made for term limits for members. 10.3.2 The Objectives of PPP Management Framework (PPPMF) i. To develop and implement public-private partnership action plan to support the review and monitoring of implementation cybercrime and cybersecurity legislation. ii. To provide and nurture a sustainable trusted platform for National cooperation, understanding and interactions among all stakeholders, while managing all the build-up processes that will lead to the harmonized agreements on National Cybersecurity among the government, lawmakers, and the private sector. iii. To provide a national mechanism that will unify variety of positions, equities, and knowledge gaps to overcome differences and addresses institutional diverse positions. iv. To secure other stakeholders inclusion in the development and implementation of National Cybersecurity efforts. v. To facilitate the development and coordination of private sector groups from different critical infrastructure industries related to Cybersecurity to address common security interests collaboratively with government. vi. To create and nurture trusted forums to address common Cybersecurity challenges, national discourse and dialogue that will enhance cooperation and understanding among various groups on National Cybersecurity effort. vii. To institute fundamental arrangements between government and the private sector for Cybersecurity incidence and response management. \r   10.3.4 Implementation Vehicle for the Public-Private Partnership Management Framework i. Creation of PPP-National Technical Working Group (NTWG) for the Implementation of the PPP-Framework. ii. The mandate of the NTWG will be anchored on the implementation of PPPMF objectives with the overall mission of actualizing national adoption and operation of National Cybersecurity Strategy within the country. iii. A selection criteria for the appointment of the Members of NTWG is based on the value Impact of their respective inputs, in terms of the following; • Technical contributions • Critical Infrastructural Operators • National Platform & Backbone • Organizational Support: Structure & Coordination • Media • Non-government Organization • Multi-stakeholder Management • Understanding of Regional and Global framework for cooperation • Legal Issues • Public interest 10.3.5 The Benefit & Outcome of PPP-MF i. It provides opportunity for government to effectively engage the core stakeholders in the country while entrenching nationally acceptable National Cybersecurity Strategy at the onset. ii. Cybersecurity Strategy is a complex set of issues involving legal, socio- economic, and national security considerations. Several public institutions have significant jurisdictional claim on cybersecurity issues The PPPMF will, therefore, provide opportunities to address all the divergent positions of these stakeholders. iii. Cybersecurity strategy has a deep connection with critical information infrastructure, economy and security. Private sector provides technology innovations, critical resources and technical standards that the government needs to drive National Cybersecurity Strategy. While government provides enabling mechanisms, instruments and authorities to transform industry best practices and standards into the \r   framework of National Cybersecurity Strategy, thus, PPPMF will assist government to address structural weaknesses. iv. National Cybersecurity Strategy driven through the public-private partnership of government and private sector has greater national security implication and economy protection values, than government working alone or in partnership with multilateral and multinational institutions. v. PPPMF enables a trusted platform for strategic information sharing between government and private sector critical for the overall success of National Cybersecurity Strategy. vi. It provides partnership vehicle for National Executive Council, National Assembly and private sector to achieve mutual understanding and cooperation on the operation of Cybersecurity legislation and implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy. vii. PPPMF will facilitate structural coordination across the public and private sector, building public confidence in National Cybersecurity Strategy. viii. Government depends on a privately operated cyber infrastructure. Through the PPPMF, government engages with industry to continue building the foundation of a trusted partnership. This engagement will build value propositions that are understood by both government and industry partners for the benefit of National Cybersecurity Strategy. \r   CHAPTER ELEVEN Strategy on National Internet Safety 11.1 Introduction • The nation is building various capabilities in computer security emergency response and internet is fast becoming the mainstream for economy and interaction. The government will need to interface with ordinary citizens engaging online on protection awareness, safety consciousness, learning materials, security tools and tips shall be articulated, localized and transmitted online to safeguard the most critical asset of the nation, i.e. her people. • The Strategy on National Internet Safety is a response to the national need to plug in the National Internet Safety capability gap within the currently emerging cybersecurity in the country. • The initiative fits into the framework of National Cybersecurity Policy, National Security Strategy and National ICT policy. • The strategy is a product of intensive research, outcome of critical needs assessment, recommendations of various fora and wider consultations on the criticality of pubic internet safety and online vulnerability in Nigeria. • During the Nigeria Internet Governance Forum (NIGF 2013), it was estimated that over 95% of Nigerian on the internet are ignorant of personal security and safety responsibility online. • The weakest link within a cybersecurity chain of any country is her people. Therefore, this Strategy provides initiatives and measures that help safeguard general public internet users, provide materials and facilitate tools to help safeguard Nigerian citizens against cyber threats and unwholesome vulnerability. \r   • The Strategy is focusing on the development and implementation of National Internet Safety Initiative (NISI) under the structural framework and coordination of NCCC. 11.2 National Internet Safety Initiative • The initiative is a multi-disciplinary Initiative that help safeguard Nigerian citizens’ presence on the Internet. • This is a unique home grown government intervention vehicle which seeks to help the nation protect her citizens against her own digital vulnerability and online threats, safeguards the vulnerable groups, and re-channel her citizens online engagement towards a rewarding experience that impact the socio-economic development and healthy digital lifestyles in cyberspace. • The initiative is anchored on National Cybersecurity Strategy i.e. the strategy is expected to be built through multi-stakeholder engagement. • It addresses internet safety and online security from the perspective of local and global peculiarities. • The strategy marshalled counter-measure policy guidelines, roadmap strategy, local ideas, tested tools and materials for the delivery of the initiative. 11.3 Objective • The overall objective is to facilitate a unifying Nigeria Internet security literacy programs, open ended, with workable guidelines, and with implementation strategy that will engage Nigerians online and safeguard Nigerian public Internet users. 11.4 Scope: • The initiative scope is focused on Nigerian public internet users covering the following areas which can hamper National Security, economy growth and local innovations. i. Blacklisting Inappropriate contents ii. Online backdoor distributive channels iii. Misuse and abuse of critical internet resources iv. User abuse and exploitative materials v. Digital vandalism critical to national economic image and online presence vi. Internet security and online safety illiteracy vii. Non-alliance countermeasures \r   viii.

Development of local IT tools, materials, contents and software applications appropriate for ensuring internet security and safety of the citizens. ix. Create local Internet Safety Wall using countermeasures awareness, interactions and information sharing. \r   x. Establish response mechanism and measures for public alert system 11.6 Importance of NISI to NCCC • Today, more than ever, government sees a real urgency to get the message out to the community about the emerging threats and abuses of the citizens on the internet. It is within the purview of ONSA through the National Cybersecurity Strategy to provide guidance towards the development of home-grown innovative ideas, tools and materials that will help facilitate internet safety consciousness and online security learning aids to the citizens. • The initiative is an important focus of NCSS to help design, develop, advocate, train and sustainably deliver resources to government, corporate and individual citizens, families and key players to raise awareness on National Internet safety to make the online community a safe place for productive engagement for government, businesses, kids, young, adult people and families. • The initiative helps reawaken the nation to its statutory role within the framework of National Cybersecurity Policy towards safeguarding Nigerian Online Presence, developing and implementing local strategies, guidelines and mobilization of all stakeholders to achieve this cause through enterprise and unified platform of National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center.",
	"original document": "NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICY   \r    \r       \r       \r    FOREWORD BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER     The emergence of cyberspace, a virtual global domain, is increasingly impacting almost every   aspect of our lives. The domain is transforming our economy and security posture more than ever   before, creating opportunities for innovations and the means to improve general welfare of the   citizens. It is transforming many countries’ growth, dismantling barriers to   commerce, and allowing people across the globe to communicate, collaborate and   exchange ideas.        However, behind this increasing dependence on cyberspace lies new risks that   threaten the national economy and security. Sensitive data, networks and systems that   we now trust can be compromised or impaired, in a fashion that detection or   defence can be hard, thus undermining our confidence in a connected economy.      The Federal government is not unmindful of the diversity of implications of the nation’s risk   exposure in cyberspace, hence we have put in place cohesive measures towards addressing   national risks effectively now and in the immediate future. Furthermore, the government has   recognized that for Nigeria and its citizens to continue to benefit from the full   potential of information and communication technology revolution, we must take   the cyber-risks seriously. It is on this premise that we are determined to confront   the threats, uphold and support the openness of the cyberspace as well as   balance security with respect to privacy and fundamental rights. If we fail to   prepare now and act appropriately, we may be faced with future challenges that   will be more complex to manage.      In this context, government has developed a common framework that aggregates our collective   responses towards addressing the challenges. These are encapsulated in this National   Cybersecurity Policy. It outlines the actions government and other players alike will take   to lessen the risks and secure the gains of our continuous dependence on   cyberspace. The policy recognizes three key approaches to a successful national cybersecurity   program: public private sector partnership; multi-stakeholders engagement; and international   cooperation.         \r    Our collective vision is to see a Nigeria, where law enforcement agencies are   empowered in tackling cybercrimes; businesses and citizens are creating wealth   and conscious of what to do to protect themselves on cyber space. This requires   raising awareness on the imperatives of cybersecurity readiness as a vital component   of our lives, as no individual or organization in any sector is immune from the   consequences of cyber threat. In addition, ensuring private and public assets   online are secure and resilient; and threats to the nation’s infrastructure and   national security are proportionately dealt with.      It is in the light of the above that my office, in collaboration with other agencies of   government and key actors from the private sector are championing the urgent   need for comprehensive national cybersecurity programmes. It is my hope that   the synergy already developed between the stakeholders drawn from different   backgrounds will be sustained through all the implementation stages. My office will   continue to explore common grounds around which we can sustain this   collaboration on cybersecurity for the common good of our country.       We shall keep all channels open for close monitoring and evaluation of the   implementation of this policy, which shall be due for comprehensive review in   another five years. My office shall facilitate regular collation of feedback from   stakeholders that will enhance periodic review of the process.    I therefore wish to express my appreciation to the cross section of contributors and   stakeholders, including professional bodies, corporate leaders and captains of   industry who have contributed to our efforts towards creating an enduring safer   digital environment for our dear country.

PART 11: MISCELLANEOUS PRINCIPLES                                         \r    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     The dawn of the Internet has transformed our society in exceptional ways by   enabling economic growth and providing new means by which people connect,   interact and collaborate with one another. The convergence of components of   information and communications technology (ICT); advances in underlying   technologies fuelling reduction in costs, suggest that accessing the internet will   become increasingly inexpensive and stress-free in Nigeria. The implication is that   more and more people in Nigeria and around the globe will continuously engage in   cyberspace. As more ideas continue to drive the expansion of the cyberspace   for improved advantage and profitability, more surprises are unavoidable.     While heralding the success of the Internet, there is also a challenge in identifying   and curbing cyber threat inherent within its sphere. It is well documented that the   Internet is being used as a vehicle to carry out criminal activity within and outside   Nigeria’s borders. These activities adversely affect the country’s economy as well as   individuals and organisations within Nigeria’s physical territorial boundaries from a   financial, reputational, security and privacy perspectives.    Where external threat actors such as foreign intelligence agencies, hackers and   other online criminal syndicates are carrying out the activities, they can also threaten   the national security posture, which includes the economic, political and social fabric   of Nigeria.    This policy therefore sets out the strategic intent of the government in mitigating the   country cyber risk exposure by prioritising our needs while focusing on key areas,   curtailing escalation of cyber threats that are inimical to the national security posture   and the Nigerian economic wellbeing. This policy is a vital response element for   safeguarding the nation. It helps to enlighten the citizens on the components that are   to be used to empower the nation to understand, respond and collectively deter   cyber threat activities. The policy outlines the doctrinal framework and guiding   principles for achieving our roadmaps through a coordinated effort of all stakeholders   in the country.         \r    December 2014.   PART ONE      INTRODUCTION   \r    This part sets out the overview of the Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Policy process   and provides a background of Nigeria’s cybersecurity status in relation to the global   context. It also provides the rationale for the institution of a National Cybersecurity   Policy.      1.1 Background:    \r    Vision 2020 envisages improved socio-economic activities in Nigeria through the use   of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Similarly, recent developments   in telecommunications and Internet expansion occasioned by introduction of   undersea fibre optics, has resulted in improved use of the Internet for social and   business activities in Nigeria. The country is operating progressively and actively in   cyberspace.     \r   Cyberspace has become an essential component of 21st century activities. As critical   and non-critical activities are increasingly migrating to cyberspace, globalisation and   the increasing interdependence of nations has also put significant pressure on   nations to continuously look for ways of ensuring that the domain remains safe for   players utilising it for social, economic and development purposes.    \r   The purpose of the national cybersecurity policy is multifaceted. It considers the   versatile landscape, the various stakeholders involved, and the threats posed by   individuals and groups out there which take an undue advantage of users. Similarly,   measures necessary to address national challenges come from an articulated   approach, which must take into consideration the peculiarities and international   commitments of the country.         \r             1.2 Global Cybersecurity Context   \r    Cyberspace has become an indispensable global domain coming after Land, Sea,   Air, and Space as number five. Increasingly, nations are depending on information   and communications infrastructures in governing societies, conducting business,   exercising individual rights on interactions and freedom of communication.     \r   Cyberspace is open for diverse engagements. In contrast to land, air, sea and   space, cyberspace poses unique difficulties in terms of the Non-boundary and   universal nature of its networks. It does not recognize the conventional rules-based   international systems. State actors, organized syndicate criminals, insurgents and   terrorists are exploiting cyberspace for dubiuos purposes.    \r    The world is confronted with growing challenges of cyber threat that constantly   challenge confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace, all of which can   affect the critical functioning of nation states, including Nigeria. Global connectivity,   vulnerable technologies, and anonymous nature enable the spread of disruptive   cyber-activities that causes considerable collateral damage to a country’s national   interests. Cybersecurity is, therefore, an international challenge, which requires   international cooperation in order to successfully attain an acceptable level of   confidence and trust at national and global levels.       1.3 Nigeria National Cybersecurity Threat   \r    Five key cyber threats have been identified and listed as posing significant   challenges to Nigeria and inimical to national growth and security. They are:   a) Cybercrime    b) Cyber-espionage   c) Cyber conflict   d) Cyber-Terrorism   e) Child Online Abuse & Exploitation       \r       Activities classified under these unwholesome schemes that are taking place on the   Internet or on using information systems, have impact on the level of risk exposure,   resistance and protection of associated national critical and non-critical   infrastructure.   These threats have serious implications for the nation’s presence and active   participation in the global ecosystem. Nigeria is therefore keen to secure and protect   its cyber space in a coordinated and all-inclusive manner.   Government is striving to understand the emergent complex threat landscape and   contending with the breadth and depth of cyber attacks, especially those affiliated   with nation-states or organised crime.    Therefore, the protection, security, and sustainability of the nation’s active presence   in cyberspace are dependent on the country’s readiness to articulate a strategic   approach and engagement roadmap to secure the nation’s cyberspace.   In 2004, the Nigerian government developed a framework for cyber security following   recommendations by the Presidential Committee on Illegal Online Activities. The   strategic framework deals with the overall goal of setting a clear direction,   coordination of the nation’s engagements in cyberspace, as well protect and defend   the national interests and the sovereignty of Nigeria.   This culminated into the establishment of the Cyber Security Focal Point at the Office   of the National Security Adviser (ONSA). Various activities and initiatives have been   taken by ONSA in collaboration with various stakeholders towards ensuring security   of the country’s presence in cyberspace.             \r    PART TWO      THE NATIONAL DOCTRINES    Part 2 describes Nigeria’s cybersecurity doctrines in specific terms. It also   provides basic understanding of the doctrinal frameworks within which they are   defined.       2.1 Doctrine on Cyberspace:     \r    2.1.1 Cyberspace is an interdependent network of critical and non-critical national   information infrastructures, convergence of interconnected information and   communication resources through the use of information and communication   technologies. It encompasses all forms of digital engagements, interactions,   socializations and transactional activities; contents, contacts and resources   deployed through interconnected networks.      2.1.2 Cyberspace is recognized as a domain for non-critical and critical national   functions such as economic development, trade and commerce, social   interactions, communication, medical and health, government operations,   national security and defence.       2.2. Doctrine on Cyberspace Critical Assets & Infrastructure:    \r    2.2.1 The operation, sustaining and survival of critical national functions is anchored   on a safe and secure national critical information infrastructure, robust   policies and processes with skilled manpower to manage such critical   infrastructure.  These complements of empowered people, processes and   systems are fundamental to the cardinal objectives of Nigeria’s National   Cybersecurity Policy and its abiding principles.             \r    2.3 Doctrine on Cyber-Risk Exposure:    \r    2.3.1 National functions rely on interdependent networks of critical information   infrastructures for confidentiality, integrity, availability and accessibility.      2.3.2 Interdependent network of critical information infrastructures do not exist in   isolation of global networks, i.e. the cyberspace.    \r    2.3.3 National functions are recurrently exposed to predictable and unpredictable   risks in the cyberspace.    \r    2.3.3 Any disruption of critical national functions as a result of their exposure to   cyber risks, that compromise their confidentiality, integrity, availability and   accessibility constitute a threat to the doctrines of National Security.        2.4 Doctrine on Cybersecurity:    \r    2.4.1 National provision of sustainable proactive measures mitigates, protects,   and safeguards the nation from cyberspace risk exposures, including cyber-  threat and vulnerability. An insecure cyberspace is inimical to the nation’s   sovereignty, national security and economic development.                 \r    PART THREE      NATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSECURITY     3.1 The Goal of National Security Strategy on Cybersecurity    \r   3.1.1 The fundamental aim of the National Security Strategy as enshrined in the   National Security Policy framework seeks for a harmonized security strategy   that will respond to the dynamism of the national security threat landscape.    \r   3.1.2 One of such emergent national security threat landscape is national risk   exposure and uncoordinated presence in cyberspace.   \r    3.2.3 In the context of the immediate and future security challenges, instruments of   Nigeria’s National Cybersecurity Policy and National Cybersecurity Strategy   are intended to manage security threats in cyberspace in line with the overall   national security objective.               \r    PART FOUR      NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY ROADMAP     4.1 National Cybersecurity Vision:  A safe, secured, vibrant, resilient and trusted community that provides   opportunities for its citizenry, safeguards national assets and interests,   promote peaceful interactions and proactive engagement in cyberspace for   national prosperity.    \r    4.2  National Cybersecurity Mission:  To foster harmonious, sustainable and integrated Nigeria’s national   cybersecurity readiness and coordination capacities towards addressing and   mitigating the nation’s cyber risks exposure in cyberspace.       4.3  Policy Objectives:   \r   4.3.1 Statement of Purpose   The aim of this National Cybersecurity Policy is to chart a course towards an   assured and trusted presence in cyberspace.   \r   4.3.2 Objectives   The objectives of National Cybersecurity policy are stated as follows:    \r   i.

It is the cardinal objective of this National Cybersecurity Policy to   complement the efforts of the Federal Government of Nigeria on the   existing plans and documents relating to safeguarding and   protection of the nation’s Critical Information Infrastructure.    \r    \r    ii. The legislation on cybercrime and cybersecurity thus states that   The President may on the recommendation of the National   Security Adviser, by Order published in the Federal Gazette,   designate certain computer systems, and/or networks, whether   physical or virtual, and/or the computer programs, computer data   and/or traffic data vital to this country that the incapacity or   destruction of or interference with such system and assets would   have a debilitating impact on security, national or economic   security, national public health and safety, or any combination of   those matters as constituting Critical National Information   Infrastructure.    \r    iii. This policy recognizes that Nigeria’s well-being depends largely on   a secure and resilient critical national information infrastructure—the   systems, assets and networks that underpin our national life.    \r    iv. Therefore, this policy details how the private sector will work with   government in the identification and protection of critical   infrastructure in order to manage risks and achieve resilience to   national critical information infrastructure.        \r       7.2 Vision of National Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection Plan (NCIIPP)      The country envisions an environment where physical and cyber critical   infrastructure are secure and resilient, with vulnerabilities reduced and   consequences minimised to acceptable tolerable limits, where threats are   identified and dealt with in a coordinated response and recovery strategy.    \r   7.3  Policy Objectives of NCIIPP:   i. Detect, identify, discourage, disrupt and prepare for threats and cyber   hazards to Nigeria’s critical information infrastructure      ii. Reduce vulnerabilities of critical assets, systems and networks to   deliberate, unintentional and natural threats.   \r    \r   iii. Mitigate the potential consequences to critical infrastructure of   incidents or adverse events that do occur through advance planning   and mitigation efforts to save lives and ensure prompt recovery of   essential services.      iv. Share important and actionable information among the critical   infrastructure community in order to build awareness and provide a   risk-informed decision making.   \r    v. Promotes learning and rapid revision of NCIIPP during and after   incidents.      7.4 Strategic Readiness Plan (SRP)   \r    i. The policy shall facilitate the development of a strategic action plan   through a collaborative process involving stakeholders from all      \r    identified critical infrastructure sectors, all states of the federation and   from all levels of government and industry.    ii. Provide a clear call to action, which will leverage on the coordination,   cooperation, collaboration, and smart risk management procedures,   and focus on specific actions germane to the policy goals.      7.5 The Critical Infrastructure Sectors:     i. Policy preparatory process on NCIIPP carried out a general national   survey with the goal of identifying critical infrastructure sectors whose   strategic operational backbone rely on functional and secure National   Critical Information Infrastructure.   ii.  The policy identifies the following infrastructures.   a. Communications Sector   b. Government Facilities Sector   c. Manufacturing Sector   d. Dams Sector   e. Defence Sector   f. Chemical Sector {Oil and Gas}   g. Power and Energy Sector   h. Commercial Facilities Sector   i. Financial Services Sector   j. Food and Agriculture Sector   k. Emergency Services Sector   l. Transportation Systems Sector   m. Public Health and Healthcare Sector   n. Water & Waste Water systems   o. Information Technology Sector    \r   iii. Effective risk management requires an understanding of the   significance of assets, systems, networks, as well as the associated   dependency and interdependency of critical infrastructure.    \r   iv. Consequently, the policy encourages stakeholders to identify critical   functions and resources that impact on their businesses and      \r    communities in order to support preparedness, planning and capability   development.    \r    v. The policy describes a national unified effort to achieve critical   infrastructure security and resilience. Given the diverse authorities,   roles, and responsibilities of critical infrastructure partners, a proactive   and inclusive partnership among all levels of government and the   private and non-profit sectors is required to provide optimal critical   infrastructure security and resilience.       \r    7.6 Coordination Policy Specific to NCIIPP   i. The NCIIPP for each sector details sector level performance objectives   and feedback to the coordinating agency of government charged with   the responsibility of managing the sector.    \r    ii. The NCCC shall be empowered through legislation to provide the   following national critical information infrastructure protection  roles:      • National Coordination and Reporting Mechanism of   cybersecurity incidents for critical infrastructure.   \r    • NCCC shall facilitate development and implementation of   national criteria on best practices approach at each critical   information infrastructure sector.   \r    • NCCC shall facilitate the development of a national Critical   Information Infrastructure Measurable Program (CIIMP) as part   of the cohesive National Cybersecurity Strategy.   \r    • NCCC shall assist government and the  private sectors to   mitigate their cyber-risks   \r    • It shall provide legal framework for investigating cyber security   incidents.      \r     \r   • Promote regional and international cooperation on NCIIPP   across national boundaries and assist in determining   transnational solutions.                                                               \r       PART EIGHT      PRINCIPLES ON ASSURANCE & MONITORING      8.1 Introduction:    \r    i. Vulnerabilities exist in critical national information infrastructure for several   reasons including: technological flaws, non-existent or weak security controls,   non-compliance with defined security policies, dearth of effective mitigating   strategies and plans amongst others.     \r   ii. Absence of a feedback reporting mechanism on how effective implemented   controls are safeguarding the nation's cyberspace will lead to an assumed,   unverified and false sense of protection.    \r    iii. The policy provides for the creation of a National Assurance & Monitoring   mechanism for the nation’s cyberspace.     8.2 Focal Points:    The National Assurance & Monitoring Mechanism, under the supervision and   coordination of NCCC will achieve the following outcomes:   i. Motivate compliance to national cybersecurity standards.      ii. Ensure collection of relevant data that validates previous cyber security   initiatives, and support its' on-going improvements.      iii. Provide feedback on the status of the nations' cyber security posture,   thus enabling stakeholders, partners and policy-makers to develop sound   cyber security countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies.         \r    iv. Increase confidence that responsible stakeholders are complying with   statutory cybersecurity requirements and frameworks      v. Ensure efficient and effective solutions are deployed to protect the nation's   cyberspace.      vi. Ensure awareness of evolving threats to the nation's cyberspace thereby   enabling proactive defence measures.                \r    PART NINE      PRINCIPLES ON NATIONAL COMMITMENT & GOVERNANCE     9.1 Introduction:   i. Nigeria is committed to establishing the highest level of governance and   commitment in tackling cybercrime. To achieve this goal it will design and   implement appropriate, sustainable and effective policies and practices. The   ONSA will provide oversight responsibilities on matters relating to policies,   practices, individuals and organizations charged with the responsibility of   combating cybercrime.    \r   ii. The national commitment will ensure that these practices are continually   being reviewed and improved by benchmarking against internationally   accepted best practices and lessons learned.   \r    iii. The outcomes of the national commitment on governance are:    \r   • To give Nigerian citizens and the rest of the world comfort and   understanding of our resolve and stance on tackling cybercrime.     \r    • Allow the nation to identify progress on the key strategies that need to   be implemented   \r    • Steer the country towards efficient and transparent methods of   conducting operations for cybercrime especially where there are   conflicting objectives.    \r    iv. It is the policy of the Government of Nigeria to have and maintain principles   on national commitments and governance.     \r   v. These principles will allow the nation to foster cooperation and coordination in   the drive to maintain a positive image across local, regional and global   communities in the nation’s drive to reduce the effects of cybercrime.         \r    9.2 Nature of Commitment   \r    i. In order to ensure the fight against cybersecurity in Nigeria is sustained.   Nigeria commits to putting in place perpetual counter-measure instruments   and cybercrime fighting environment that will be sufficiently funded and which   in turn will be monitored and supported by the national security agencies.    \r   ii. It will ensure that it appoints the most suitably trained and qualified individuals   to oversee the delivery of its commitment to combat cybercrime and make it   difficult for cybercriminals to successfully operate within the nation’s   cyberspace.   \r    9.3 Nature of Governance   i. In order to ensure the fight against cybercrime is successful, the government   will commit to putting in place, effective governance and control mechanisms   to ensure its national security agencies have appropriate oversight of the   activities within its cyberspace environment.    \r    ii. This will include amongst other areas identifying the institutions and bodies   that control activities and services that can impact on its cyberspace   environment. Such organizations and bodies will include but are not limited to;    \r   • Internet Service Providers    • Domain Name Registration Body    • Telecommunications Service Providers   • Internet Exchanges; and   • Other associated bodies   \r    iii. The governance oversight will allow for centralization, prompt and effective   response to cybercrime activities.          \r    \r    \r       \r    9.4 National Legal Commitments   i. An integral part of the nation’s National Cybersecurity Policy is the adoption of   regional and international harmonized legislations against the misuse and   abuse of cyberspace for criminal and other unlawful purposes.    \r    ii. In order for Nigeria to ensure its policy on cybercrime is successful, Nigeria   commits to enacting appropriate laws relating to cybercrime.    \r    iii. The nation’s commitment will include reviewing these laws on a regular basis   so that they can be updated when the need arises. The benefit of this   approach will be that the nation’s legal landscape will be adaptable to the   changing cybercrime environment.        9.5 Regional Commitments and Governance   \r    i. To ensure its policy on cybercrime is comprehensively successful,   Government commits to fostering initiatives for the cooperation, collaboration,   information sharing and coordination of anti-cybercrime strategies with   countries, law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in the African   Region.    \r    ii. Government will build and foster partnerships with willing and participating   countries by sharing information and combining efforts to combat cybercrime.   \r    iii. Nigeria will engage in regional discourse, consultations and negotiations that   impact positively on regional cybersecurity efforts.                       \r       PART TEN      PRINCIPLES ON ONLINE CHILD ABUSE & EXPLOITATION    10: 1  Introduction:     \r   i. The Nigerian Cybersecurity Policy recognizes growing engagement of   the nation’s active young population in cyberspace.   \r    ii. The resultant impact of this engagement has contributed significantly to   digital knowledge acquisitions and economic empowerment of this   critical segment of the nation’s population.    \r   iii. Unrestricted access to digital contents, contacts and communications   through Cyberspace has raised new areas of national security concern   on vulnerability, exploitation and abuse especially as it affects this   critical segment of the nation’s population.    \r    iv. There are growing national concerns on the distribution of digital   content and materials targeted to young population which are making   them vulnerable to cyber-terrorism recruitment, child pornography,   sexual abuse, harassment, exploitation, extremism, violence and   human trafficking resulting into unpleasant outcomes.   \r   10.2 Strategic Areas of Focus:    \r   i. National Cybersecurity Policy will work within the current and future legislative   frameworks to provide countermeasure mechanisms on Online Child Abuse   and Exploitation within the nation’s cyberspace.       \r    ii. The policy provides for a partnership framework for counter-measures   towards safeguarding the safety and security of the Nigeria children online.         \r    iii. The policy seeks membership of relevant global law enforcement bodies,   which provides a 24/7 mechanism to receive reports about illegal behavior or   content from persons in member countries.     \r   iv. The policy seeks for national awareness and capacity building of Nigerian law   enforcement community and the judicial sector on countermeasures,   investigating child online abuse and exploitation as well as prosecution within   current and future legislation.      \r   v. The policy seeks for the creation of national mechanisms guaranteeing that   Child Abuse Materials found in the nation’s cyberspace are channeled   towards appropriate law enforcement apparatus within the Nigeria Police   Force.     \r   vi. The policy seeks for the development of working mechanisms to provide   means for reporting illegal content found in the country’s cyberspace, which  has the capacity to respond rapidly and have illegal materials removed or   rendered inaccessible.   \r    vii. The policy seeks for multi-stakeholder partnership, bilateral and multilateral   cooperation, collaboration and information exchanges on online crime against   children.                                     \r    PART ELEVEN       MISCELLANOUS PRINCIPLES     i. It is the policy of the Nigerian government to provide and sustain continuity of   government in the advent of cybersecurity emergency.        ii. The policy seeks citizen’s proactive and collective participatory measures   towards ensuring that national cybersecurity policy obligations are effectively   respected in regards to national security, strategic economic interest and   patriotism.                                                                 \r     \r    \r   \r     \r     \r     \r    \r   \r    \r     \r    NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY    \r    \r       \r    FOREWORD BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER        The emergence of cyberspace, a virtual global domain, is increasingly impacting almost every aspect   of our lives. The domain is transforming our economy and security posture more than ever before,   creating opportunities for innovations and the means to improve general welfare of the citizens. It is   transforming many countries’ growth, dismantling barriers to commerce, and allowing   people across the globe to communicate, collaborate and exchange ideas.        However, behind this increasing dependence on cyberspace lies new risks that threaten   the national economy and security. Sensitive data, networks and systems that we now trust   can be compromised or impaired, in a fashion that detection or defence can be hard,   thus undermining our confidence in a connected economy.      The Federal government is not unmindful of the diversity of implications of the nation’s risk exposure   in cyberspace, hence we have put in place cohesive measures towards addressing national risks   effectively now and in the immediate future. Furthermore, the government has recognized that   for Nigeria and its citizens to continue to benefit from the full potential of information   and communication technology revolution, we must take the cyber-risks seriously. It is   on this premise that we are determined to confront the threats, uphold and support   the openness of the cyberspace as well as balance security with respect to privacy   and fundamental rights. If we fail to prepare now and act appropriately, we may be   faced with future challenges that will be more complex to manage.      In this context, government has developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy as cohesive national   measures towards addressing the challenges. These measures contain strategic initiatives and   programs that are aligned with the national doctrines, principles, vision, goals and objectives as   enshrined in the National Cybersecurity Policy. The strategy recognizes three key approaches to   a successful national cybersecurity engagement: public private sector partnership; stakeholders’   collaborations and international cooperation.      Our commitment is to ensure continuity of government in the advent of cyber threat   emergency, safeguard critical information infrastructure, and nurture national   cybersecurity readiness through the engagement of all stakeholders.    It is in the light of the above that my office, in collaboration with other agencies of      \r    government and key actors from the private sector are championing the urgent   need for comprehensive national cybersecurity programmes. It is my hope that the   synergy already developed between the stakeholders drawn from different   backgrounds will be sustained through all the implementation stages. My office will   continue to explore common grounds around which we can sustain this   collaboration on cybersecurity for the common good of our country.       We shall keep all channels open for close monitoring and evaluation of the   implementation of this policy, which shall be due for comprehensive review in another   five years. My office shall facilitate regular collation of feedback from stakeholders that   will enhance periodic review of the process.    I therefore wish to express my appreciation to the cross section of contributors and   stakeholders, including professional bodies, corporate leaders and captains of industry   who have contributed to our efforts towards creating an enduring safer digital   environment for our dear country.

Digital infrastructure is the   National Information Infrastructure (NII) component that permeates the physical   infrastructural landscape supporting it to function seamlessly, endlessly and   sustainably.  The NII is the backbone of the nation’s active presence in cyberspace.   Significant disruption of its operation will undermine the confidentiality, integrity and   availability of essential national services, which will be inimical to national economy   and security.   In comparison with other industrial and commercial entities, the Internet has been with   us for a relatively short period of time. It has been responsible for the most   revolutionary and rapid changes to the way we communicate, undertake business,   perform job functions as well as boost our military strategies. We have seen the   examples in the home schooling, social media and cloud computing rising on the tails   of the Internet phenomenon.    The Internet has given the phrase “global village” an appropriate meaning, this is   driven home with the illustration that an individual in Nigeria can immediately set up an   online conference call and chat with group of people on the other side of the planet in   real-time.  The majority of users of the Internet conduct their activities in a legitimate   and above board manner, while on the other side of the internet there are individuals,   organisations, foreign intelligence agencies and state sponsored actors that have used   the very benefits of the internet, i.e. its speed, global presence and openness, to carry   out criminal activities that can cause havoc to those that are not aware, prepared or   equipped to deal with such undertakings.   This document therefore examines the strategic imperative of a national cybersecurity.   It highlights various strategies that will be used to implement the measures outlined in   the new National Cybersecurity Policy.      \r    These include the following:   • The development and implementation of appropriate legal framework, with   initiatives that will allow for the identification and prosecution of cybercrimes that   impact Nigeria regardless of whether they originate within Nigeria or are   launched from outside of the country. It encompasses training the judiciary,   security and law enforcement agencies, seeking international co-operation,   public and private sector co-operation and public awareness programmes. It   also introduces a special focus on data protection, privacy and lawful   interception.      • Establishment of a National Incidents Management Strategy which outlines the   commissioning of a National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)   and introduces the roadmap for implementing Detective, Preventative and   Response capabilities to deal with cybercrime activities.      • The strategy for Protecting Critical information Infrastructures including shared   responsibility between government and owner operators of critical infrastructure.   It also highlights the ways in which early warning, detection, reaction and crisis   management will be assessed, developed and implemented to provide a   proactive readiness to react to and deal with threats towards Nigeria’s Critical   Infrastructures.       • The strategy seeks to ensure the development of information security assurance   and monitoring plan. It includes a new national mechanism on cybersecurity   assurance, adoption of fit for purpose standards for Governance, Risk and   Control, Core Assurance Capabilities, National Enterprise Architecture   Framework. It also endorses the adoption of application security testing as well   as the adoption of a Balanced Scorecard Framework for cybersecurity.   • The introduction of a sustainable strategy to develop, maintain and ensure   Nigerians are informed and equipped to deal with cybersecurity events by   establishing a mechanism for Cybersecurity Skill and Manpower Development   initiatives. These initiatives will be driven through public-private partnership. It   introduces a model for certification of individuals to ensure quality of   competence in the field of cybersecurity relevant to the nation.       \r       • The strategy for protecting Nigerian Children from Online Child Exploitation and   Sexual Abuse includes initiatives, such as the national awareness programmes   through multi-stakeholder engagement, and international cooperation in the   countermeasures.      • The Strategy on Public-Private Partnership highlights the need for interagency   collaboration with private sector. It engages the framework for a public and   private partnership in developing a cohesive response to mitigating cyber-risk.   In conclusion, The National Internet Safety initiative is aimed at providing general   public awareness, education, and advocacy through multi-stakeholders’ engagement,   development of local tools, training software and applications in Internet safety and   security readiness. It provides mechanism for gauging the nation’s cyber security   posture.

Specific key cyber threats worldwide inimical to National interest are identified.   Such as;   i. Cybercrime   ii. Cyber-terrorism    iii. Cyber conflict   iv. Cyber espionage   v. Child online abuse and exploitation.       1.1.3 These threats have significant capability to damage the integrity of the nation,   disruption of critical information infrastructure operations, undermine   government operations and national security.       1.1.4 The NCSS articulates, coordinates and guides the country in the implementation   of National Cybersecurity Policy and cohesive counter-threat measures for the   protection, security and defence of National Cyberspace.       1.1.5 The Strategy provides various initiatives for the focused areas and national   mechanisms for developing and implementing Legal & Policy Measures,   National Incident Management, Critical Information Infrastructure Protection,   Cybersecurity Assurance Framework, Manpower Development, Child Online      \r    Abuse & Exploitation, National Internet Safety, Public Awareness, Multi-  Stakeholder Partnership and Global Cooperation on Cybersecurity.         1.2. National Cybersecurity Vision:     The National Cybersecurity Policy has set out a clear purpose, direction and   outcome of the country’s engagement in cybersecurity.       What is the Nigeria Cybersecurity Vision?      A safe, secured, vibrant, resilient and trusted community that provide   opportunities for its citizenry, safeguard national assets and interests, promote   peaceful interactions and proactive engagement in cyberspace for national   prosperity – Culled from National Cybersecurity Policy 2014          1.3. The Aim of National Cybersecurity Strategy:   The aim of the NCSS is to provide a cohesive roadmap, initiatives, and   implementation mechanism for achieving the national vision on cybersecurity.      1.4  Cyberspace Within the Context of National Prosperity & Opportunities:   1.4.1  Cyberspace offers excellent platforms and opportunities for securing and growing   the nation’s economy.    1.4.2  Every citizen that is connected to cyberspace through the internet is immeasurably   impacted and empowered for actions.    1.4.3 In the next few years, Nigeria will become a broadband economy where every   individual and corporate citizens will have unhindered wholesome access to the   internet.   1.4.4 Cyberspace will become the mainstream for national integration and digital   economy empowerment. It is a knowledge driven space with massive capacity to   bridge gaps in mobility, commerce, innovations, education, poverty reduction, and   economic empowerment.       \r    1.4.5 What is the Cyberspace?      Cyberspace is an interdependent network of critical and non-critical national   information infrastructures, convergence of interconnected information and   communication resources through the use of information and communication   technologies. It encompasses all forms of digital engagements, interactions,   socializations and transactional activities; contents, contacts and resources   deployed through interconnected networks. – Culled from National   Cybersecurity Policy 2014        1.4.6 Why is Cyberspace important to the National Government?         It has been established that we have the contemporary four (4) domains of land,   Sea, Air and Space, Nigeria recognizes Cyberspace as the fifth (5th) domain for   driving critical national functions such as economic development, commerce   and transactions, social interactions, medical and health, government   operations, national security and defense.       1.5        Impact of Cyber-Risk on National security and the Economy   1.5.1 The nation’s digital economic existence relies on the effective functioning of digital   infrastructure. In Cyberspace, the country is not isolated but interconnected to other   countries and active actors within cyberspace through interdependent networks of   information infrastructures. Thus, the country is exposed to predictable and   unpredictable risks.    1.5.2 Just as we have actors with legitimate intentions so also exist other actors with   illegitimate and malicious intentions. Within the global network of networks there   are critical structural flaws which can be exploited for criminal intents and   purposes against the country to compromise the confidentiality, integrity,   availability and accessibility of the nation information systems and critical   information infrastructure.          \r    1.5.3 Vulnerabilities exist within cyberspace that can be used to exploit national   economic interest and constitute threats to National Security. For instance, recent   compromise of some government websites, growing underground cybercrime   industry, emergence of activism through online backdoors, fraudulent practices,   incidence of online exploitation of the young segment of the population, gross   abuse of the social media for waging malicious campaign against the state, conflict   and violence perpetuated through internet, economic sabotage through distributive   denial of critical services, coordinated cyber espionage, malicious intrusion into   computer systems and other digital devices, cyber piracy and stealing of intellectual   assets, cyber-terrorism, online financial crime and money laundering, distribution of   offensive contents and child abuse materials and hosts of other malignant activities   committed through cyberspace are all inimical to the wellbeing of the country. The   economic impact is destructive to any nation.    1.6       Cybersecurity within the context of National Security Strategy:  Providing security for the critical information infrastructure and other critical   components of information system within the current state of affairs is a huge   national challenge.    National Security needs the infusion of a cohesive framework on cybersecurity to   provide holistic approach to the current and future security landscape, because the   nation security and economic terrain is fast paced and is moving towards a digitally   enabled and mobile terrain.    State and non-state actors involved in cyber-crimes are adequately equipped   with sophisticated cyber tools to cause damage with unprecedented dimension.   The security inclusion of cyberspace domain will help the country prepare and   response to such security threat and help address the country’s weakness in her   own digital vulnerability, as well as strengthening our ability to provide   countermeasures in partnership with other legitimate state and non-state actors.   This is the strategic rationale for the development of National Cybersecurity Policy   and the context within which National Cybersecurity Strategy is articulated for   national security readiness.            \r    CHAPTER TWO   UNDERSTANDING NATIONAL CYBER-RISK EXPOSURE      2.1 Introduction   In line with the national doctrine on cyber-risk exposure as reflected in the   National Cybersecurity Policy document, the country presence in cyberspace   exposes it to a new dimension of risk. Therefore, development of the country’s   Cybersecurity Strategy is approached from examining security risk exposure of   the whole country.    What Is Cyber-risk?   Cyber risk is the possibility that a threat and vulnerability exists within the   nation’s cyberspace inimical to the security and safety of information systems   and associated infrastructures. Furthermore, it is the possibility that the threat   will exploit a vulnerability to breach the safety and security of an information   system and or information networks or infrastructure.   National cyber-risk has two (2) major components:    i. Cyber-threat    ii. Vulnerability        2.2  Cyber-threat Landscape & Impacts:     2.2.1 Cyber threat is the possibility of a malicious attempt to damage or disrupt the  \r    operations of a vulnerable computer network and information system.  \r       2.2.2 The nature and the dimension of the impact of cyber-threat are diverse and it   involves a threat actor who performs a pre-mediated attack or exploit   circumstances of an accident. A threat actor is engaged by a threat source   either clandestinely or tactically. A threat source initiates a desire to breach   access to critical information or security controls with the purpose of benefiting   from the breach, for example for financial gain or competitive advantage in the   case of industry cyber espionage.  \r       \r    Sources of Cyber-threat \r    \r    \r    \r         NCSS Fig. 1  Sources \r  of \r   Cyber-­‐Threat \r    Foreign \r   States \r    Organized \r   Criminal \r   Syndicates \r    Terrorists \r  & \r   Extremist \r   Group \r    Hackctivists \r   \r    Corporate \r   Insiders \r      2.2.3 Cyber threat is escalated to cyber-attack by a threat actor where a   deliberate effort is initiated to exploit the vulnerability of computer systems,   information and communication networks, and internet driven processes for   criminal intent and malicious purpose.       2.2.4  It usually involves the use of malicious codes to alter digital codes, logic or   data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise the   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and lead to manipulation of   information systems and internetwork infrastructure.       2.2.5 Cyber-attacks may lead to the following consequences: Identity theft, fraud,   extortion, Malware, pharming, phishing, spamming, spoofing, spyware,   Trojans and viruses, manipulation of hardware, denial-of-service and   distributed denial-of-service attacks, breach of access, password sniffing,   system infiltration, website defacement, private and public web browser   exploits, instant messaging and social media abuse, and intellectual property   theft.         2.2.6 Economic Impact of Cybercrime     • Recently, a total of $388billion USD was estimated as the approximate   total financial loss to cybercrime in more 24 countries in the last six years.   • The global black market in marijuana, cocaine and heroin combined   ($288bn) and approaching the value of all global drug trafficking ($411bn).   • At $388bn, cybercrime is more than 100 times the annual expenditure of   UNICEF ($3.65 billion).1   • Physical crime are becoming digital. More criminals that were involved in   traditional crimes are moving towards the Internet. They know that it’s   easier, more profitable and the probability of being caught is lower             \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   1 \r   \r       \r    • Nigerian financial consumer loss to Cybercrime in 2010 stood at   N2,146,666,345,014.75 ($13,547,910,034.80) to cybercrime in 20122   •       2.2.7 Cyber threat landscape is diverse and diffusely driven by state and non-state  actors.   State Actor:    The State Actors are established and well organised to carry out the most  sophisticated threat in the cyberspace with the goal of exploiting computers  and information and communication networks to gather intelligence on  government, military, industrial and economic targets, and opponents of their  Regimes. They gathered intelligence data and information which can be used  for spreading falsehood and disrupting critical services. Sometimes they  install hidden malicious software on a system can be adapted to suit an  attacker’s changing objectives, lying hidden within the system in readiness for  exploitation during times of increased tension or conflict.   Non State Actors:     Organized and unorganized criminals operating in the underground  economy exploiting weakness in individual, corporate and government  systems and information infrastructure. They used different technology and  psychology method to manipulate users and engage highly sophisticated  cyber tools to infect, hijack, control and extract value information for criminal  purpose.  Financial motivation is usually the driven force of this particular non- state actor. They inflict huge financial damage on their victims. Their action  damage country reputation and inflict huge collateral damage on the country  financial system.     Terrorists and extremist engage resources of cyberspace to perpetuate  against the government; falsehood, communication, recruitment,  indoctrination, raising of fund activists and distribution of extremist contents.  They are active attackers and constitute one of the major threat to national  security.        \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   2 \r  Economic \r  Cost \r  of \r  Cyber \r  Crime \r  in \r  Nigeria \r  by \r  Gbenga \r  Sesan, \r  Babatope \r  Soremi \r  and \r  Bankole \r  Oluwafemi \r  as \r  part \r  of \r  the \r  output \r  for \r  the \r  Cyber \r   Stewards \r  Network \r  Project \r  of \r  The \r  Citizen \r  Lab, \r  Munik \r  School \r  of \r  Global \r  Affairs. \r  University \r  of \r  Toronto \r  and \r  Supported \r   \r  by \r  international \r   development \r  research \r  centre.(IDRC) \r     \r       \r    Activist with unwholesome pattern of obtaining information used against  established authorities. They operate through social media and vulnerable  backdoors, usually connecting with an insider with passive attack tendency.       2.2.8 The National Cybersecurity Policy document has identified and classified five   (5) major cyber threats as inimical to the national security strategy. These   threats have significant capability to cause considerable damage to the   integrity of the country’s economy.       2.2.9 The underlying ideology of this National Cybersecurity Strategy is to proffer   relevant strategic frameworks and mechanisms for addressing these cyber-  threats, securing the nation in the advent of cyber-attack, while preparing the   nation for a proactive engagement towards building and nurturing a safe and   secure cyberspace where trust and confidence are hallmark of Nigeria cyber-  community.        2.3 Imperative of a National Vulnerability Assessment      2.3.1 Vulnerability is the structural weaknesses of the nation’s information systems   and critical information infrastructure ranging from technical flaws, porous   measures, to human negligence.   2.3.2 The NCSS requires that national vulnerability assessment be conducted   towards determining weaknesses in government information systems,   websites, networks, data handling processes and vulnerabilities existing in the   nation’s critical information infrastructure.    2.3.3 The national vulnerability assessment helps the government appreciate the   level of her unpreparedness, the need to safeguard huge investments in   information systems and communication infrastructure and commitment made   to global partners National ICT developmental goals.    2.3.4 There are efforts aimed at addressing some of these challenges at the   sectorial levels. However, NCSS is laying a foundation for the coordination of   the country cyber-ecosystem with a unified framework on cybersecurity.       \r    2.3.5 The ultimate goal is to build a collective counter-measures mechanisms that   will facilitate the country’s capability in addressing the huge vulnerability gaps   among the states information systems, critical information infrastructure, and   protection of our presence in cyberspace.      2.4 Gauging the Impacts and Opportunities  2.4.1 There are many advantages associated with the implementation of the   national Cybersecurity strategy. Building and nurturing trust and confidence in   the use of national information systems and critical information and   communication technology is crucial to the socio-economic well-being of the   citizenry, therefore it is important to secure our nation in cyberspace thereby   infusing high level of confidence and trust in the nation digital economy.      2.4.2 The nation depends on the functioning of information and communication   technology and the operation of critical information infrastructures. Our   interactions, transportation, communication, trading and e-commerce,   financial services, mission critical services are relying on the confidentiality,   integrity and availability of information flowing through these infrastructures.      2.4.3 National enterprise security architecture is further enhanced with the inclusion   of cybersecurity strategy. A new and holistic National Security Architecture will   emerge by integrating physical and cyber security as countermeasures   against external threat, thus consolidate the country readiness capability.       2.4.4  The country’s emerging opportunities as a result of her trusted presence in   cyberspace are inclusive of the following;       •  A resilient digital economy, stimulating innovations, wholesome   engagement, development and inflow of foreign direct investment.      • An opportunity to exploit cyberspace to advance the country’s military   capability in engaging external threat, conflict, violence and terrorism.      \r    • Nigeria’s readiness to defend her citizens, safeguarding operations of   critical information infrastructures and extra-territorial jurisdiction in time of   unpredictable cyber-attack, ensures continuity of critical operations amidst   adversaries.                                                                      \r    CHAPTER THREE   NATIONAL READINESS STRATEGY      3.1 National Cybersecurity Policy Direction   3.1.1 The National Cybersecurity Strategy defines the nation’s readiness to   safeguard and prepare the whole Nation in advance for global economic   competitiveness in cyberspace.  It also addresses willingness to empower the   nation in building a comprehensive, coherent, structural and procedural   capabilities at strategic and tactical levels in mitigating cyber risks.    3.1.2 The strategy involves engagement of government and non-government   actors, employing multi-stakeholder’s principles of approach, inclusive of all   participatory and partnerships of government, industry and other   stakeholders.   3.1.3 The critical success factor of NCSS is hinged on comprehensive mobilization,   engagement and coordination of critical components towards securing our   presence in cyberspace and protecting critical information infrastructures.   3.1.4 The direction of the policy of government on cybersecurity is in agreement   with regional and global direction on securing cyberspace.    3.1.5 The paramount focus of the cybersecurity strategy is addressing our cyber risk   exposure, protection of our national critical information infrastructure,   exploiting cyberspace opportunities for national security and economic goals,   and the enthronement of a trusted cyber community remain a paramount   focus of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.          3.2. Necessity of a National Cybersecurity Strategy      3.2.1 The multi-dimensional nature of the evolving security threats is moving the   current National Security Strategy beyond the traditional scope.          \r    3.2.2 The nature of the current security threats such as cybercrime, violence,   conflict and terrorism increasingly exploits the openness and borderless   nature of cyberspace. This constitutes a threat to our growing dependence on   cyberspace.        3.2.3 Government is leading a coherent national response towards reducing the   impact and escalation of cyber threats in a manner that safeguards the   nation’s presence and guarantee trust and confidence in our connected   economy.       3.3. Objectives of National Cybersecurity Strategy     3.3.1 The Strategy aims are to set out a national roadmap with various coordinated   mechanisms; harness implementation framework; and actions that will   guarantee attainment of the National vision, mission and goals on   Cybersecurity as captured in the National Cybersecurity Policy.       3.3.2 Therefore, the Strategy is needed to achieve the following specific objectives:      i. A comprehensive cybercrime legislation and cyber-threat counter   measures that are nationally adoptable, regionally and globally relevant in   the context of securing   the nation’s cyberspace.       ii. Provision of measures that protect critical information infrastructure, as   well as reducing our national vulnerabilities through cybersecurity   assurance framework.       iii. To articulate an effective computer emergency response capability.     iv. National mechanisms on capacity building, public awareness, skills   empowerment is necessary to help strengthen our capability so as to   respond promptly and effectively to cyber-attacks.         \r    v. A trusted mechanism for engaging national multi-stakeholder and   international partners towards collectively addressing cyber threats.   vi. To deter and protect government from all forms of cyber-attacks.      vii. To coordinate cybersecurity initiatives at all levels of government in the  country.     viii. To build national capabilities against cyber threats with coherent   cooperation through public- private sector partnership and multi- stakeholder engagement.     ix. To promote national vision on cybersecurity through awareness,   partnership through shared responsibilities and a trusted community of  stakeholders.     x. To promote coordination, cooperation and collaboration of regional and   global stakeholders on cybersecurity.    3.3.2 The Strategy is further aligned with National Security Strategy and other   relevant government documents most especially National ICT policy and  National broadband plan.     3.3.3 The Strategy defines the basis for a coordinated national and globally   compatible framework for action, cooperation and approach to protecting  national critical information infrastructure against cyber threats.           3.4 Scope of National Cybersecurity Strategy       The scope of the national cybersecurity strategy covers the areas of national  priorities as well as general framework for partnership and international multi- stakeholder cooperation on cybersecurity.      3.5 Approach, Guiding Principles & National Priorities        The NCSS approach involves coordination of the nation’s cybersecurity  constituents and public-private partnership which are consistent with the  objectives and the guiding principles as encapsulated in the National  Cybersecurity Policy.     3.6 Governance Strategy      3.6.1 The implementation of the provision of the strategy will be coordinated   through the Office of National Security Adviser in collaboration with other  relevant government agencies.          \r    3.6.2 The central coordination model will operate in synergy with federated  structures toward achieving comprehensive measures on cybersecurity.     3.6.3  Central coordination model is adopted in line with international best practices   and has recommended in the global framework for cooperation on  cybersecurity     3.6.4  The sustainability and critical success factor of this governance model is   anchored on public-private sector partnership, multi-stakeholder engagement  as well as regional and international cooperation.                           \r    \r              \r    CHAPTER FOUR     LEGAL FRAMEWORK INITIATIVES      4.1 Objective     4.1.1 The objective of the Cyber Security Legal Framework is to identify the   strategy required to ensure areas defined in the Cyber security Policy are   implemented, managed, sustained and effective in combating cybercrime in   Nigeria.       4.1.2 To achieve this aim, a number of immediate and long term legal framework   initiatives will need to be developed, agreed, funded and rolled out to   accomplish success.      4.2 Approach     • The approach takes the form of referencing aspects of the Legal Framework   in the cyber security policy with a view to prescribing the initiatives that will   allow for the implementation of each of the detailed areas.        NCSS Fig 2 Initiatives Pyramid     4.3 Initiatives:    4.3.1 Initiave1: Enacting Fit for Purpose Cybercrime Legislation     Cyber \r  CrimeLegal \r   Framework \r    Judicial \r  Review \r    International \r  Cooperation \r    Public \r  Private \r  Sector \r  Collaboration \r    Raising \r  Awareness \r   \r       \r    • As prescribed in the cyber security policy, fit for purpose legislation will need   to be enacted and implemented to combat cybercrime.       • The main focus of this initiative will entail a root and branch review of Nigeria’s   current and draft cybercrime legislations.       • The objective  of this exercise will be to identify any gaps between what is   currently available and what has been proposed in the Cyber security  policy   with a view to updating any omissions or redundancies so that when the   legislation is enacted , it will be adequately  effective , workable and flexible   enough to deter and prosecute cybercrime activities      • This initiative supports a strategy to enact a number of separate and distinct   legislations that will make up the cybercrime legislative framework as opposed   to a single legislation that has the banner of cybercrime legislation.       • To the barest  minimum, the following legislations will need to be included in   the new cybercrime framework: Anti-Spam, Child Online Protection, Child   Pornography, Cookies, Computer Misuse, Cyber Blackmail, Cyber bullying   and Harassment, Cyber Espionage, Cyber Terrorism, Digital Evidence and   Preservation, Data Protection, Data Retention, Hacktivism; Identity Theft,   Information Security, Intellectual Property Rights, Lawful Interception, Online   Fraud, Privacy, tribalism and Xenophobia, Software Piracy, Security Breach   Notifications, Unauthorized System Interference etc.      • Aligned to the review and enactment of the cybercrime legislative framework   is the need to put in place measures to keep the laws up to date and effective.      • The strategy to achieve this will include the establishment of a Cyber Crime   Legislative Review Committee (CCLRC) whose purview will be to advise the   National Security Advisor, Legislature and regulatory bodies on aspects of   legislations that needs to be amended to ensure current legislations do not   become redundant, unenforceable and ineffective.      \r    • This is an immediate initiative and needs to be given special priority as it   forms the bedrock of the applicability, enforceability and prosecution of   individuals and organisations that breach key segments of the National Cyber   Security policy.      4.3.2   Initiative 2.      Preparing and Revamping the Judiciary for Cybercrime Legislations     • Nigeria’s current judicial environment is not adequately equipped to handle  sophisticated cybercrime cases. In order to ensure the new cybercrime  legislations are effective in the prosecution of alleged cybercrimes, when they  are brought before the courts, it is the strategic objective of NCSS to ensure  the Nigerian Court system is equipped to handle cybercrime cases.      • In fulfilling this strategy, the following initiatives will be undertaken     a) Capacity building for Judges and lawyers on the new cybercrime laws  b) Courts will be equipped to handle digital forensic evidence  c) Provide law enforcement agencies with the processes and procedures for   investigating cybercrime activities.  d) Capacity building for law enforcement and security agencies on digital   forensic capability.     • This will be achieved by developing a home grown fit for purpose certified  programme of training courses, capacity building, awareness programmes  and materials for current Nigerian judges and lawyers.     • The strategy will also include the incision of new cybercrime legislation  courses in institutes of higher learning so that newly qualified lawyers have a  basic understanding of Nigeria’s cybercrime framework.     • This will be a long term and on-going initiative.       4.3.3 Initiative 3: International Co-operation     • To ensure our cybercrime laws are effective and internationally harmonised,  the legal strategy is to adopt the provisions of the convention on cybercrime to  enable effective cross border law enforcement.      \r    • This will allow for the following:      I. International harmonisation of our legislations  II. Collation of all existing conventions and bilateral agreements  III. International cooperation to combat cybercrime  IV.  wider investigatory capability  V.  Capacity Building and knowledge sharing  VI. Opportunity for Nigeria to make a contribution to how cyberspace is   governed through international instruments of law.    International co-operation will also include becoming a member of recognised  bodies such as:     • The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  • Cybercrime Convention  • Interpol     It is envisaged that the processes to engage with international bodies will start  to be defined with the objective of implementing and achieving within the next  12 months.    This is an immediate initiative       4.3.4     Initiative 4: Public/Private Sector Collaboration     • Recognizing that cybercrime can impact both private and public sector  environments, the legal strategy is to adopt processes for both public and  private sector collaboration in combating cybercrime.      • As an example relationships between Communication Service Providers in  assisting law enforcement agencies in preserving communications data for  specified periods as dictated by the Data Retention legislations will be  encouraged and forged.        • This will also extend to financial institutions in ensuring they retain customer  records according to specified time lines.     • The strategy will also entail providing specific guidelines on how to meet these   requirements.        \r    • A key part of the public/private sector collaborative strategy will be to put in  place measures to reduce reliance on foreign controlled networks to store  personal information of Nigeria Citizens.      • This will have the impact of reducing the risk footprint as well as the potential  for such data to be compromised and used to the detriment of Nigerians     • This is an immediate and ongoing initiative     4.3.5 Initiative 5: Raising Awareness     • While implementing cybercrime legislations are paramount in combating  cybercrime, it is to be noted that making citizens aware of the threats and  vulnerabilities that can accrue to them when they use the internet, is a  measure that can be used to reduce the likelihood of them being victims of  cybercrime.     • Raising awareness of the new laws through high profile campaigns is an  initiative that will be used to make criminals aware of the consequences of  being in breach of these legislations once they are enacted.     • It is also part of the strategy to socialise these new laws to the wider   international community.     • This is an immediate initiative    4.4 Special Areas of Focus:     4.4.1  Data Protection, Privacy and Lawful Interception.     • Personal Information has economic and political value. The recent  identification of Nigeria as a MINT (i.e. Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and  Turkey) country not only raises its profile in monetary and economic terms, it  also raises the risk of infrastructure and systems containing Nigerian citizens  data being targeted by unscrupulous individuals, organisations and nation  states, leading to data loss, leakage as well as confidentiality, integrity and  availability compromise.     • The recent revelations of American whistle-blower Edward Snowden has  significantly raised awareness of the need for nations to put in place  appropriate measures to protect the personal information, and privacy of its  citizens.         \r    • The revelations also identified the need to protect and secure communications  of not only high ranking government and high profile individuals from mobile  phone tapping but also ordinary individuals from their everyday non-criminal  conversations being intercepted and analysed by law enforcement agencies,  organisations and foreign countries.     • To protect and legislate for criminal activities against Nigerian Citizens data   and their communications special emphasis will be given to the development  and roll out of Data Protection and Privacy laws in Nigeria.            NCSS Fig 3   Data Protection and Privacy     • The objective of this initiative will be to ensure individuals and organisations   are aware of their responsibilities when handling and processing personal   information.       • It will also allow them to be aware of what constitutes unacceptable and illegal   behaviour in relation to the use of such information and communication   streams.      • The legislative, technical and policy initiatives to fulfil this aim will consist of   the following:         \r    i. Developing and enacting fit for purpose Data Protection and Privacy   laws.      ii. Defining minimum policy and standards requirements for handling   personal information      iii. Defining data Protection requirements for outsourcing initiatives.      iv. Deploying an effective and transparent Lawful Interception regime.      v. Deploying appropriate and workable data retention periods to assist   law enforcement agencies in their investigations.      vi. Defining Data Protection Requirements for safeguarding Nigerian   Citizens details on government systems      vii. Defining minimum technical measures that need to be in place to   safeguard against personal information compromise      viii. Identifying where Nigerian Citizens Data details are held and if systems   held on are appropriately protected      ix. Identifying Data Leakage Areas with view to reducing risk      x. Developing and implementing fit for purpose guidelines      xi. Liaison with Communication service providers to provide their   customers with advice on how to protect themselves from cybercriminal   activities      xii. Liaison with both private and public sector commercial organisations to   help them understand the measures they need to take to reduce their   risks to data protection and privacy breaches         \r    xiii. Liaising with NCC , NITDA, Central Bank , Judiciary and Military to   drive data protection in Telecoms, Finance and, government   institutions and Judiciary      xiv. Establishment of a new regulatory body for adjudicating and providing   guidelines on Data Protection, Privacy and Lawful Interception      xv. Reduce reliance on foreign-hosted cloud services for storing personal   data of Nigerian Citizens.   xvi. Long-term strategy is to Partner with Nigerian Service providers to   develop capabilities to provide local cloud service capabilities.                  NCSS Fig 4: Data Protection Impact Point                      \r                               CHAPTER FIVE       NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY   5.1 Purpose:    5.1.1 The strategy on incident management is designed to effectively deter and   respond to cyber threats and cybercrime that will leverage on an efficient   emergency readiness and coordination capability.    5.1.2 The strategy will also facilitate, promote and strengthen national commitments   to regional and global partnerships and cooperation on cybersecurity.      5.2  Establishing National CERT:      5.2.1 The Nigerian Computer Emergency Team (ngCERT) shall be established to   ensure efficient response to security incidents within our cyberspace.      5.2.2 An effective computer emergency response capability is essential to monitor   and deter threats that can exploit information system vulnerabilities.       5.2.3 The Nigerian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ngCERT) will be   empowered by a legal framework through which its functions and   responsibilities are defined.         \r    5.2.4 However, where existing laws are inadequate, a review or new legislative   processes should commence to address legal vacuum that will hinder   operations of the national CERT.      5.2.5 The harmonized laws should clearly mandate it to function as of one the   strategic components of the central coordinating center for all computer   security incident management within our national cyberspace. Additionally,   incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency Monitoring   System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT.       5.2.6 Additionally, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber   Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by   ngCERT.      5.3        Implementation Approach     5.3.1 A National Incident Response Plan (NIRP) will be formulated to achieve a   coordinated emergency response protocols. It will govern both the national   and sectorial CERTs      5.3.2 The plan will set out clear definitions and procedures for incident response   that will focus on incident classification and its severance.       5.3.3 In addition, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency   Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT.   5.3.4 CEMS will classify threats that constitute a national-level cyber incident   requiring ngCERT involvement and the triggering of incident response   protocols.       5.4  Initiative 1:  Preventive Strategy   5.4.1 All key national information infrastructures shall have a preventive mechanism   for network monitoring system integrated into CEMS.      \r    5.4.2    The preventive strategy will primarily be implemented by CEMS for analysis   and detection as well as alert notification.    5.4.3   CEMS operational procedure will define the baseline security monitoring for   broad detection of malicious or anomalous network activity within our   cyberspace and specify specialized security monitoring for critical assets and   critical processes within the context of the National Critical Information   Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP).         5.5   Initiative 2: Detection Strategy   5.5.1  The Cyber Emergency Monitoring System (CEMS) will serve as the main                       provider of data   analysis and reporting to other key detection and response   partners across the incident management ecosystem.     5.5.2 Its key focus is to consistently monitor indicators within the nation’s cyber   space in order to detect potential threats and classify them according to its   severance level determined. This can serve as an alert to the trigger the next   chain of activity in the response protocols.     5.6  Initiative 3 Response Strategy:   5.6.1  After an incident is detected and validated by the CEMS, direct and     coordinated action will be implemented immediately to ensure that appropriate   actions to stop an on-going incident occur at the right time on the right   cybersecurity priorities.    5.6.2 The action plan will require identifying the scope and scale of the incident in   order to activate the relevant countermeasures procedures as outlined in   NIRP to mitigate damages.                       Investigating cybercrime incident requires a strict evidence preservation   procedures showing appropriate evidence handling procedure and      \r    established chain of custody.    Therefore, it is necessary for incident handlers to take appropriated measures   in order to preserve any artefacts that could be of evidential value by   recording, reviewing and resolving security incidents with the established   incident management processes as define in the NIRP. Additionally, ngCERT   is expected to document all such report as will be required to be submitted by   all monitored information infrastructure custodians in order to evaluate the   effectiveness of response plan through lessons learned.      5.7 Cooperation and Partnership   5.7.2 The ngCERT under the framework of National Cybersecurity Coordinating   Center will coordinate activities of other sectorial CERT and facilitates   cooperation and partnership of all cybersecurity stakeholders, including   international and multilateral organizations.       5.7.3 It is imperative to note that, sharing of action noteworthy information about   new threats and vulnerabilities with partners by ngCERT will avail them the   security status of the national cyberspace and the need to protect it      5.7.4 NgCERT also will enable both government and private sector actors through   stimulated exercises to support stakeholders understand their roles during a   crisis and better prepare for incident response scenarios. This will test   incident response capabilities and processes created to communicate,   collaborate, and restore services in the event of an incident.   5.8  Capacity Building   5.8.2 To sustain an optimal incident response readiness capability, technical and   procedural capacity building will be instituted for both law enforcement as   well as judicial officers to build their expertise and facilitate understanding of   the dynamics of cybercrime.       \r    5.8.3 Training will focus on methods of handling digital evidence to ensure that it   preserves its evidential weight and thus admissibility in Court.       5.9 National Digital Forensic Mechanism        5.9.1 The National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center shall develop a framework   for the setting up of a National Digital Forensic Laboratory as a core unit   under the coordination of NCCC.       5.9.2 The implementation and coordination of digital forensic technical and   management guidelines will help develop guide for the law enforcement and   security agency engagement in digital forensic investigation, analysis,   interpretation and reconstruction of e-crime scene.                                                 \r                                CHAPTER SIX     STRATEGY ON CRITICAL INFORMATION   INFRASTRUCTURES PROTECTION & RESILIENCE       6.1 Introduction    6.1.1 This Strategy articulates the various Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)   protection and resilience activities the Government undertakes, ranging from   how it engages with business, government (international and domestic) as   well as other stakeholders.   6.1.2 This Strategy presents the Government’s approach to Critical Information   Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIIPR).      6.1.3 It also acknowledges that CIIPR is a shared responsibility across   governments, the owners and operators of critical infrastructure.         6.2 Vision of CIIPR   • To ensure continued operation of CII in the face of all hazards, as this   critical infrastructure supports national defense and security, and   underpins our economic prosperity and social wellbeing.       \r       6.3 Mission of CIIPR   • To harness all relevant stakeholder’s CIIPR Programs into a national   holistic agenda capable of supporting the country’s national security and   ensure provision of essential services.      6.4 Strategic Objectives   i. Assess threats to, vulnerabilities of, and consequences to critical   infrastructure through an intelligent and information-led, risk   management approach.   ii. Secure CII against physical, human and cyber threats through   sustainable efforts to reduce risk.      iii. Enhance CII resilience by reducing impact of unforeseen and   unexpected incidents through advance planning and mitigation efforts,   as well as effective responses aimed at  saving lives and ensuring    rapid recovery of essential services;       iv.  Share relevant information across the CII community to build   awareness and enable a coordinated risk- informed decision making,   while promoting a learning and adaptation during and after exercises   and incidents impacting on CII.       v. These objectives will be supported by regular developments of more   specific priorities by key critical infrastructure partnerships related to   risk management and capability enhancement.      vi. Based on the vision, mission, and goals, the critical infrastructure   community will work together to set specific national priorities. National   priorities will be set considering resource availability, progress already   made, known capability gaps, and emerging trends and risks in   cybersecurity.          \r    vii. National priorities will drive implementation and will be supplemented   by sector, regional, and corporate priorities. Performance measures will   be set based on the goals and priorities of each sector, regional or   national Government.       viii. The National Annual Preparedness Report will include measurements   of progress that will help derive a common understanding of the state   of critical infrastructure security and resilient efforts.        6.5 STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO ACHIEVE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES   6.5.1 The Government recognizes the importance of critical infrastructure, including   those parts that provide essential services for everyday life (such as energy,   food, water, transport, communications, health and banking and finance). A   disruption to critical infrastructure could have a range of serious implications   for business, governments and our social wellbeing.      6.6 Initiative 1: Operate an effective business-government partnership with     critical infrastructure owners and operators.   • A significant proportion of the nation’s critical infrastructure is privately   owned or operated on a commercial basis.       • A business-government partnership will be established to help build   confidence and reliability for the continued operation of critical   infrastructure that supports national security, economic prosperity, and   social and community wellbeing.       • It is important that the business-government partnership offers value   and mutual benefit to the parties involved.         \r    6.6.1  Necessity for Trust Information Sharing Network (TISN) Activity for  NCIIPP      • There will be need for the establishment of a TISN for National Critical   Information Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP).      • This network will comprise of relevant private sector and government   representatives, to raise the awareness of risks to critical information   infrastructure, share information and techniques required to assess and   mitigate risks, and build resilience capacity within entities in the   network.    • Working with the TISN, the private sector is able to bring issues to   government that are seen as impediments to achieving critical   information infrastructure protect.       • The TISN will be the most visible component of the public-private   partnership and will provide an important mechanism to foster   cooperation between public- private stakeholders on mutually important   issues.      • The TISN will raise awareness on critical infrastructure issues,   including potential impediments to achieving CIP. Government   agencies directly involved in CIP are able to better represent   stakeholder interests in the various machineries of government that are   used to develop and implement Government policy and act as critical   infrastructure advocates in the broader policy debate.       • Accordingly, Government agencies that have a role in implementing   the CIP Strategy are able to influence or shape government policy   initiatives that have impact on critical infrastructure organizations and   their ability to achieve CIP.           \r    6.6.2 Trusted Information Sharing Network Initiative (TISN)   • The TISN will be established in the Office of the National Security Adviser   as an exclusive forum in which the owners and operators of critical   infrastructure work come together and share information on threats and   vulnerabilities as well as develop strategies and solutions to mitigate risk   to the nation’s CII.       • TISN members include owners and operators of critical infrastructure,   Federal, State and local government agency representatives as well as   departments and agencies of government.    • The TISN, through its Sector and Expert Advisory Groups, will promote   infrastructure protection to owners and operators as well as promote the   need for investment in resilient and reliable infrastructure.      6.6.3 Sector Groups   • Sector Groups form the bridge between government and the individual   owners and operators of Nigeria’s critical infrastructure.       • Their purpose is to assist owners and operators to share information on   issues relating to generic threats, vulnerabilities and to identify   appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate risk.       6.6.4 Sector Specific Plans   • There will be sector specific plans for each sector which will highlight   sector level performance objectives and feedback to the coordinating   agency of government charged with the responsibility of managing the   sector.       • For example, the sector specific plan for the Information Technology   Sector will be coordinated and managed by the Ministry of Information and   Communication Technology. In collaboration with other stakeholders      \r    (public and private sector partners), this Ministry will develop and   implement a Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) to enable assessment of national,   cross sector critical infrastructure protection and resilience plan. (Please   see appendices pages for a sample approach to implementing sector   specific plan and program).                  • Sector specific plan will be developed for other critical infrastructure   sectors including but not limited to:     Communications Sector Government Facilities Sector   Manufacturing Sector Dams Sector   Defence Sector Chemical Sector   Power and Energy Sector Commercial Facilities Sector   Financial Services Sector Food and Agriculture Sector   Emergency Services Sector Transportation Systems Sector   Public Health and Healthcare Sector Water & Waste Water systems   Information Technology Sector       6.7   Initiative 2: Identifying and Evaluating Potential Critical information  Infrastructure   6.7.1 Identification   • There will be national, sectorial and organizational approach in identifying and   refining actual and potential critical information infrastructure.       • The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Unit of the Office of   NSA (NCIIPU) will work with other government agencies, owners and      \r    operators of critical infrastructure to ensure an on-going identification of   critical information infrastructure.      • Due to infrastructure investment and expansion, advent of new technologies,   population growth and increasing interdependence of systems and   technologies, identification process will be subject to continual review.   .             6.7.2 Evaluation   • After the identification of potential critical components of information   infrastructure, there will be the need for the evaluation to understand the   mode of operation and estimate its risk levels and criticality.       • The evaluation process relies on the cooperation of infrastructure owners   and operators. Having an understanding of the estimated risk and   criticality levels is important for the government. However, this does not   replace the owner’s responsibility to develop a robust risk management   program to safeguard their assets from known and unknown threats.    6.8 Initiative 3: Enhancing Strategic Readiness of Infrastructure Owners and  Operators   • A key component of the NCIIPP is to sensitize owners and operators to   adopt best practices in their approach to planning and preparedness. This   will ensure a structured, logical and rigorous approach on the most   appropriate steps to take in order to prevent, detect, react and recover   from any incident of potential disruptive value.          \r    • Strategic readiness will enable owners and operators identify   vulnerabilities and interdependencies as well as plan redundancy   programmes including risks from acts of terrorism.      • It is suggested that owners and operators consider the following approach   in their preparedness towards enhancing the strategic readiness for   protection of critical information infrastructure.     i. Prevention and Early Warning Strategy   ii. Detection Strategy   iii. Reaction Strategy    iv. Crisis Management Strategy           READINESS APPROACH TO NCIIPP   Prevention and Early   Warning Strategy      Goal: Ensure CII are less vulnerable to disruptions and   impairment duration is short and limited in proportion.    Approach: Periodic dissemination of guidelines and best   practices on specific threats using the TSIN framework   Detection Strategy      Goal: Discover and detect emerging threats on a timely   basis   Approach: NCIIPU in collaboration with ngCERT will   identify and detect new forms of technical an non-technical   attacks    Reaction Strategy       Goal: Identification and correction of causes of disruption.    Approach: NCIIPU in collaboration with ngCERT will   maintain a 24/7 incident reporting service. Furthermore,   distribution of incident report and reaction among TISN   members to share lesson learned in improving crisis and   emergency planning    Crisis Management   Strategy   Goal: Alert key actors of CII of the interdependencies and   minimizing effects of disruptions on society.      \r     Approach: Using TSIN and ngCERT frameworks, constant   rehearsals and practice of defined crisis management   strategies            NCSS \r  Figure \r  5: \r  Four \r  Pillars \r  of \r  Critical \r  Infrastructure \r  Protection \r  [adapted \r  from \r  ITU’s \r  A \r  Generic \r   \r   National \r  Framework \r  for \r  Critical \r  Information \r  Infrastructure \r  Protection \r  (CIIP)] \r          6.9    Initiative 4:  Identify, analyse and manage cross-sectorial dependencies     • The identification and analysis of cross-sectorial dependencies assists the risk   management decision making of critical infrastructure organizations and helps   to inform the Government’s policy on CIP.       • Critical infrastructure by nature are highly interdependent, so that failure or   disruption in one sector can lead to disruptions in other sectors. For instance,   owners and operators of water infrastructure rely on electricity for pumping   and telecommunications for monitoring operations. Similarly, the   communications industry needs electricity to run their networks, and the   electricity industry needs telemetry services to run their operations and   electricity marketing.          \r    • A cross-sectorial analysis of dependencies will assist owners and operators of   critical infrastructure and the Nigerian Government to understand system-wide   risks that are beyond the purview of individual organizations or sectors.       • This increases the potential for a more effective sharing of risk to cope with   certain incidents. The Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and   Analysis (CIPMA) is proposed as a key initiative of the Nigerian Government’s   efforts to enhance the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure in   Nigeria.   6.9.1 The Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA)   • CIPMA is a computer-based capability, which uses a vast array of data and   information from a range of sources (including the owners and operators of   critical infrastructure) to model and simulate the behavior and dependency   relationships of critical infrastructure systems.      • CIPMA uses an all hazards approach to undertake computer modelling to   determine the consequences of different disasters and threats (human and   natural) to critical infrastructure.       • Owners and operators of critical infrastructure can use this information to   prevent, prepare for, respond to or recover from a natural or human-caused   hazard.       • CIPMA also helps government shape policies on national security and critical   infrastructure resilience.      • CIPMA is an important capability to support the business-government   partnership, and relies on strong support from stakeholders such as owners   and operators of critical infrastructure, Federal, State and local governments,   and government agencies for its ongoing development.          \r    • Importantly, CIPMA can show the relationships and dependencies between   critical infrastructure systems, and the cascade impacts from a failure in one   sector on the operations of critical infrastructure in other sectors.      • NCIPP unit manages CIPMA and works with ONSA-NCCC and other   technical service providers to further develop and deliver this whole-of-  government capability.              6.10 Success Criteria And Review Of CIIP Strategy   • Critical infrastructure protection and resilience is an ongoing process that   requires periodic review and fine tuning of the activities under each strategic   imperative will be required as the strategy is implemented.   6.10.1 Mechanism for Measuring Success:   Success will be measured through following mechanisms:   • Effective Critical Information Infrastructure Protection is reliant on a strong,   collaborative partnership between governments and critical infrastructure   owners and operators to deliver the Government’s policy aim of the   continued operation of critical infrastructure in the face of all cyber threats.      • Need for investment in resilient, robust infrastructure (e.g CIPMA) to   identify key cross-sectorial dependencies and vulnerabilities with respect   to both cyber and physical infrastructure.      • Businesses and governments collaborating to progress national research   and submission of curriculum inputs to training and research on CIP      • Periodic lessons from incident report and reaction exercise activities and   real life events propagated to all Sector Groups to enhance organization’s         \r    •  Understanding of protection and resilience and improve planning   arrangements.      • Coordination of Nigeria’s international engagement with periodic updates   provided to NCCC as required      • In order to ensure Government’s policy settings remain appropriate, the   CIP Strategy will undergo a comprehensive review after five years of   operation.        Chapter Seven      STRATEGY ON ASSURANCE & MONITORING      \r    7.1  Introduction   7.1.1 There is a need to address the issues of cyber threats from risks management   and process governance approaches because of the need to address the   nation's internal vulnerability and other weakest link.   7.1.2 The development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy designed to address   these issues however, is only as good as the National Cybersecurity program   that implements it.    7.1.3 The continuous monitoring and review (i.e. assessment and evaluation) of the   implementation and management of the National Cybersecurity Program, and   the surrounding context that it operates within, will be critical in providing   assurance to various stakeholders that the National Cybersecurity program is   well able, and continually so, to safeguard our vulnerability and other critical   national infrastructure.   7.2  Strategic Objective       \r    i. This strategy seeks to establish and maintain a monitoring and an   assurance framework that will ensure that the efforts put in place to secure   the nations cyberspace are in compliance with international best practices,   perform as expected by the stakeholders involved, as well as to maintain   the capabilities necessary to protect our nation's cyberspace and other   critical infrastructure.      ii. To harness, profile, harmonize and priorities various technology neutral   information security frameworks that will help determine best standards   and guidelines suitable to the national peculiarity and in line with   international best practices.      iii. To achieve coordination of information security regimes through   consensus, collaboration, and partnership with relevant stakeholders.       iv. To facilitate national awareness on the criticality of ensuring and enabling   information security conscious operational environment both in the public   and private sectors        7.3  The Cybersecurity Assurance context   • The surrounding context within which the cybersecurity assurance mechanism   will operate and monitor  include the following:      i. The National Cybersecurity Strategy     This is the foundation on which the National Cybersecurity Assurance   Program and action plans will be built, it will be periodically reviewed to   provide assurance that will continue to address evolving threats in a   dynamic threat environment.         ii. Stakeholders' Commitment to Cybersecurity          \r    • An effective and efficient National Cybersecurity Assurance   Program will require clear direction, commitment from the highest   level of Government, top management and administration executive   among others.  \r    \r    • The \"tone at the top\" will determine to a large extent the   commitment shown by others in the lower cadres as it relates to   Cybersecurity and also the resources committed to effecting the   Program. This will be periodically reviewed and adequate strategies   developed to ensure that those at the top are motivated to ensure   consistent commitment to the cause of Cybersecurity. \r    \r     \r    iii. Cybersecurity awareness level  \r    \r    • The level to which all citizens of the country become aware of, and   educated about cybersecurity issues will to a large extent determine   how strong the cybersecurity efforts of the nation will be. As security is   only as strong as its weakest link. Initiatives to continually create   awareness among the citizens will be established and continually   reviewed for effectiveness. \r    \r    iv. The Regulatory/Legal environment  \r    • The Cybersecurity bill, National Cyber Security Policy and other   laws, policies and regulations will be periodically reviewed to ensure   that they continue to be relevant, properly streamlined and serve as   a good legal foundation to support the initiatives to secure the   nation's cyberspace. \r    \r    v.  Cybersecurity Capabilities, Skills, Expertise      • The level of skills, capabilities and expertise possessed by the   personnel that will be charged with the responsibility of securing the   nation's cyberspace, who will essentially be Nigerian citizens, will   go a long way in determining how well it will be done.  \r       \r     \r    • Lack of adequately skilled personnel is a major vulnerability, and   operating a national cybersecurity program within this context will   constitute a major risk to the nation, therefore the capabilities, skills   and expertise of personnel as related to the skills required to   continually defend our nation in cyberspace will be periodically   assessed and recommendations made to address any shortcoming. \r    \r               vi.  Risk Management Program  \r    • An effective cybersecurity risk management process will enable the   nation to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to the nation's   cyberspace. These will include threat analysis both for determining   evolving threats to the nation's cyberspace and emerging trends   and threats.  \r    \r    • These information feeds   into the Cybersecurity program to ensure   that it continues to provide countermeasures that will protect the   nation against both current and future threats to the nation’s   cyberspace and also serve as a basis for prioritizing responses to   such threats based on risk/impact level. \r    \r    • The Risk Management program will be established and continually   reassessed to ensure it continues to provide relevant information to   help proactively protect our presence in cyberspace. \r       \r    v. Cooperation/Collaboration and Communication/ \r   Information sharing   \r    \r    • Level of Public-Private collaboration, intergovernmental, inter-  sectorial and international collaboration and communication will   continually be assessed to ensure that maximum benefits that leads   to a more secure cyberspace are achieved from such   collaboration/cooperation and information sharing. \r       \r     \r                 viii          \r  National Cybersecurity program  \r    Assurance activities including periodic assessment and reviews will be   carried out to provide assurance that the cybersecurity program is   achieving its objectives and that such objectives will aligned with   SMART framework i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-   focused and Time-bound             \r     \r     \r     \r     \r     \r     \r     \r    NCSS \r  Figure \r  6 \r  The \r  Cybersecurity \r  Assurance \r  context \r  -­‐ \r  It \r  shows \r  the \r  logical \r  environment \r  within \r  which \r  the \r  Cybersecurity \r   Assurance \r  mechanism \r  will \r  operate \r  and \r  monitor. \r    7.4 Focal Points    7.4.1 Monitor the implementation program for the Cyber Security Strategy to   provide assurance that the program is meeting, and will continue to meet   stakeholder's expectations within a dynamic cyber landscape.   7.4.2 Make recommendations on possible improvements in the Cyber Security   Strategy itself based on observed changes in threats profile.   7.4.3 Encourage, monitor and review the adoption of national and international best   practices as codified in the international frameworks and standards to ensure   National \r  Cybersecurity \r  Strategy \r    National \r  Cybersecurity \r  Program \r   Cooperation \r  and \r  Information \r  sharing \r    \r    Cybersecurity \r   Assurance \r   \r    (Assessment \r  and \r   Monitoring) \r     \r    Risk \r  Management \r  program \r  Stakeholders' \r  Commitment \r    Regulatory/Legal \r  environment \r   Cybersecurity \r  awareness \r  level \r    Cybersecurity \r  Capabilities, \r  Skills, \r  Expertise \r       \r    national cybersecurity practices that compare well with international standards   and practices and also serve as a basis for benchmarking our maturity level.   7.4.4 Monitor and review cybersecurity capabilities of actors at the national, state   and sectorial levels to ensure continuous improvement and development of   relevant capabilities, skills and proficiencies, enabling them to defend our   nation in the face of present and future threats to the nation’s cyberspace.   7.4.5 Monitor and review level of preparedness and capacity of various actors at the   national, state and sectorial levels to ensure their readiness to defend our   nation in the face of present and future threats to the nation’s cyberspace.   7.4.6 Ensure a continuous improvement process for cybersecurity.   7. 4.7 To develop performance measures both at the policy, strategic, tactical and   operational levels based on the proposed Cybersecurity balanced scorecard   and perform reviews based on these measures to ensure feedback on   performance of the National Cybersecurity program so that adequate   corrective and improvement changes can be made.   7.4.8 Conducting information security audits and process audits for government   entities and also coordinating and validating security audits and process   audits of self- assessment entities. \r    7.4.9 Conducting and coordinating information security risk assessment and   analysis while establishing reasonable security guidelines and measures to   protect data and systems.      7.5   Strategy   7.5.1 Initiative 1    • The National Cybersecurity Assurance Department as an arm of the NCCC   will be established to serve as a mechanism for fulfilling all Assurance and   Monitoring focal points.          \r    • The department will be charged with the responsibilities of providing   assurance as regards the National Cybersecurity program.      • The unit will be set up at the start of implementation of the National   Cybersecurity program.      7.5.2 Initiative 2   • The Strategy approach to cybersecurity governance is anchored on a sound   technology neutral framework.

This national cybersecurity strategy provides for a coherent and coordinated   cybersecurity skills and human empowerment framework as envisioned in   the National Cybersecurity Policy.      8.2  Objectives:   Cybersecurity skills development is a national priority and also a foundation   for the achievement of national cybersecurity readiness. Therefore, this   focus area aims to achieve the following objectives:   i. To provide an institutional framework anchors on public-private   partnership towards building local professional skills.   ii. To provide central coordination and regulation of skills development   within the public sector.   iii. To help build framework for public-private partnership on professional   training and capacity building in cybersecurity for private sector      \r    towards promoting common understanding on cybersecurity   challenge.   8.3  Scope    8.3.1 The scope of the national cybersecurity skills development include the   following;    i. To leverage on cybersecurity in national securi ty and economic   innovation for competi t ive advantage.       ii. To develop cybersecurity professional skills roadmap that will facilitate   emergence of local content and expertise.   iii. To harness initiatives that will stimulate emergence of cybersecurity   industry in Nigeria.         8.3.2 Therefore, this section focuses on the framework for the creation of   programmes to increase the cadre of cybersecurity professionals in   Managerial, Technical and Information Assurance areas rather than   general user awareness and education. It further advocate for re-  organization of the nation’s educational priorities to address cybersecurity   challenges and opportunities.     8.4 Initiatives  \r     \r    8.4.1 A specialized national skills development and empowerment initiative on   cybersecurity covering various level of knowledge in information assurance   will be established under the National Cybersecurity Coordinating Center.     \r    •  The initiative will be set up under the framework of Nigeria Institution of   Cybersecurity (NIOC) in partnership with stakeholders as enshrined in the   National Cybersecurity Policy. \r    \r    §  The framework will involve designing, developing, and implementing level   of skills, requirement, coordination, certifications, regulations, capabilities   and expertise to be possessed by the personnel that will be charged with      \r    the responsibility of securing and maintaining the nation's presence in   cyberspace, who will essentially be Nigerian citizens. \r    \r    § Lack of adequately skilled personnel is a major vulnerability, and operating   a national cybersecurity program within this context will constitute a major   risk to the nation, therefore the capabilities, skills and expertise of   personnel charged with the responsibility of defending our presence in   cyberspace will be periodically assessed, regulated and recommendations   made to address identified gaps. \r     \r    \r        \r   8.5 \r   \r   Roadmap \r  for \r  Nigeria \r  Cybersecurity \r  Industry: \r    \r   8.5.1 \r   In \r  Nigeria, \r   cybersecurity \r   essential \r   skills \r   at \r   the \r   public \r   institutions \r   and \r   industry \r    level \r  engagement \r  are \r  scarce. \r  The \r  scarcely \r  available \r  ones \r  are \r  extremely \r  limited \r  in \r   their \r  scope \r  and \r  capabilities \r  to \r  safeguard \r  and \r  protect \r  critical \r   industries. \r  Various \r   genuine \r  concerns \r  have \r  been \r  expressed \r  on \r  the \r  apparently \r  incapacity \r  of \r  Nigeria \r  as \r   a \r  nation \r   to \r  protect \r   itself \r  and \r  her \r   industry \r   in \r   the \r   face \r  of \r  a \r  major \r  attacks \r  on \r  her \r   Critical \r  Information \r  and \r  Related \r  Infrastructures. \r     \r   8.5.2 \r   Stakeholders \r   from \r   Industries, \r   law \r   enforcement \r   agencies, \r   academics, \r   non-­‐  governmental \r   organizations, \r   government \r  Ministries, \r  Department \r   and \r  Agencies, \r   Nigeria \r   Professionals \r   in \r   diasporas \r   should \r   emerge \r   together \r   under \r   a \r   proposed \r   framework \r  for \r  cybersecurity \r  profession \r  umbrella \r  body \r  to \r  help \r  the \r  country \r  drive \r   common \r   professional \r   synergy \r   on \r   cybersecurity \r   instrument \r   of \r   research \r   and \r   development, \r   innovations, \r   and \r   trusted \r   cooperation \r   necessary \r   for \r   a \r   national \r   cohesion \r  on \r  cybersecurity. \r     \r   8.5.3 \r   \r   The \r  proposed \r  government \r  and \r  private \r  sector \r  synergy \r  should \r  culminate \r  into \r  the \r    formation \r  of \r  Nigeria \r   Institution \r  of \r   Cybersecurity \r   (NIOC) \r   that \r  will \r   help \r  develop \r   and \r  drive \r  a \r  coherent \r  body \r  of \r  useful \r  and \r  applicable \r  knowledge \r  in \r  cybersecurity. \r   \r     \r   8.5.4 \r   The \r  NIOC \r  will \r  be \r  expected \r  to \r  be \r  built \r  on \r  nationwide \r  standards \r  with \r  the \r  aim \r  of \r    harmonizing, \r   developing, \r   promoting \r   and \r   enhancing \r   multidisciplinary \r   professional \r   skills \r   capacity \r   and \r   standards \r   in \r   the \r  development \r  of \r  Cybersecurity \r   industry, \r   while \r   providing \r   opportunity \r   for \r   the \r   citizen \r   positive \r   engagement \r   in \r   cyberspace. \r     \r   8.5.5 \r   It \r   is \r   expected \r   that \r   by \r   promoting \r   national \r   dignity, \r   preserving \r   national \r   security \r    and \r   economic \r   values, \r   including \r   international \r   standards \r   on \r   multidisciplinary \r   professionalism \r   and \r   expertise, \r   the \r   institution \r   will \r   serve \r   the \r   human \r   resources \r   needs \r   of \r   the \r   country \r   in \r   both \r   the \r   government \r   and \r   private \r   sectors \r   covering \r   all \r       \r    aspect \r   of \r   cybersecurity \r   as \r   defined \r   through \r   the \r   international \r   framework \r   of \r   cooperation \r   on \r   cybersecurity \r   and \r   other \r   widely \r   recognized

Securing Nigeria in Cyberspace:   To build an infinitely sustainable cybersecurity readiness, there is critical need to  focus on our collective strength, sense of responsibility, excellence, prudency, and  strategic appropriation of our collective ingenuity for the benefit of protecting our  common wealth in cyberspace within the current and future dispensation. \r                                \r                           CHAPTER NINE     STRATEGY ON ONLINE CHILD ABUSE & EXPLOITATIONS    9.1 Introduction:     • Cyberspace has brought huge benefits to children around the world, with the  number of connected households increasing each year. While the potential for  good is undisputed, Internet has become increasingly accessible to the critical  segment of our population i.e. Nigerian children and young people, both at  home and in schools.       • Rather than surfing the Internet passively, children and young people  participate in a dynamic online environment that allows them to generate,  manipulate and consume internet content like never before, forging their place  and identity in online communities.       • More importantly, as a result of the universal availability of Internet access  in homes, schools, libraries, mobile phones, etc., children are increasingly  becoming involved in the use of the new technological application and taking  advantage of the opportunity it provides for learning, research,  entertainment and business.       • However, the Internet has also raised new and disturbing issues of  vulnerability, especially for children.  It exposes children to potentially  negative contents.       • Children and Young Persons are the most active participants in online social  networking and therefore are potential victims of improperly disseminated  and dysfunctional contents that could cause disorientation and threaten  their survival and that of the society.      • There are growing concerns on the distribution of online child abuse materials  targeted to children which are making them vulnerable to child pornography,  sexual abuse, harassment, exploitation, extremism, brain washing for terrorist      \r    acts of violence and human trafficking resulting into unpleasant outcome of  the information age.       • In order to address these issues of child online exploitation and its disastrous  consequences, the National Cybersecurity Policy viewed it as one of the  critical areas of focus.           9.2  Rationale for COAEP     9.2.1 The National Cybersecurity Policy framework provides a rationale and  philosophy to guide development of strategy for Nigerian Child Online Abuse  and Exploitation.   9.2.2 The Principles on Child Online Abuse & Exploitation and Counter-measures  emphasized Social Media as a vital attractive channel and tool for social  interactions and productive engagements. Regrettably, the openness and  transparent nature of cyberspace have been exploited for good causes and  malicious intents.    9.2.3 Therefore, there is need for the following actions;   i. Integration of Child Online Abuse and Exploitation into National  legislation on cybercrime and cybersecurity.     ii. There is a need to establish that any act against a child which is illegal  in the real world is illegal online and that online data protection and  privacy rules for legal minor are also adequate.     iii. Ensure that a mechanism is established and is widely promoted to   provide a readily understood means for reporting illegal content found  on the internet , for example , a national hotline which has the capacity  to respond rapidly  and have illegal material removed  or rendered  inaccessible      9.2.4 It is the intention of government to harness counter-measures through a  legislative framework, policy and strategic actions to address cyber abuse and  online exploitation of Nigerian Child in a manner that will prevent and curtail  cybercriminal intents and related malicious acts inimical to the national dignity,  security and economic interests of the country.       9.3 Objectives    9.3.1 To provide common approach in the development and implementation of  National Countermeasures strategy.      \r    9.3.2 To provide robust security initiatives, action plan, and roadmap that will give  overall direction to the planning and implementation of these  countermeasures strategy within the framework of National Security.    9.3.3 The strategy addresses urgent security and law enforcement challenges,  roles and shared responsibilities and government interventions.   9.3.4  The strategy harnesses frameworks that provide coherent structure for  coordination of multi stakeholder engagement.      9.4 Strategic Approach   These objectives are anchored through the following approaches while  considering our socio-economic security peculiarity and vulnerable operating  environment for the purpose of protecting Nigerian children and young  generations on the internet.   i. The National Cybersecurity Strategy approach adopts multi-stakeholder  and multi-sectorial collaboration through partnership and alliances of  government and key actors with clearly defined and specific guidelines  for policy makers, law enforcement and security agencies.       ii. The partnership and alliances will be forged to ensure cooperation  for action and mutual awareness among stakeholders on the  consequence of improper engagement in cyberspace.   9.5 Strategy      9.5.1    Initiative 1: Focusing on National Process Mechanism     i. There shall be Infusion of Child Online Abuse and Exploitation Protection  Strategy (COAEPS) into the larger framework for National cooperation on  cybersecurity.     ii. Establishment of a unit under the National Cybersecurity  Coordinating  Center (NCCC) to handle matters relating to Child Online Abuse and  Exploitation within the scope National Cybersecurity Policy.      iii. The COAEP unit of NCCC will collaborate with industry regulators and  operators to implement a coherent Countermeasures Technical  Mechanisms (CTM) to prevent access to web sites identified as hosting      \r    contents that are offensive to children and to implement processes to enable  the removal of any child sexual abuse content posted on their own services.      iv. The Unit will provide partnership mechanism in regard to the promotion of  public awareness, messages and campaigns center on safety and security of  Nigeria children interactions online.      v. The unit will train and build the capacity of Nigerian Law enforcement officers  to conduct investigations into Internet related crimes against children and  young people and maintain a register of convicted online crime offenders.       vi. The unit will facilitate national processes which ensure that all Child Abuse  and Exploitation materials found in cyberspace are channeled towards a  centralized, national resource.         9.5.2  Initiative 2: Focusing on International Process Mechanism   i. The NCCC will drive Virtual National Taskforce (VNT) which will work with  Virtual Global Taskforce, a law enforcement body which provides a 24/7  mechanism to receive reports about illegal behavior or content from persons  across the globe. The nation will develop modality for working with this global  security platform most especially for countermeasures against terrorist  recruitment and online predators.3      ii. It is strategically essential that the Nigerian law enforcement community  becomes fully informed through training and capacity building and empower  through legislation to help make the Internet safer for children and young  people.     iii. Investing in training for law enforcement, prosecutorial and building capacity  of Nigerian Judges through collaboration with National Judiciary Institutes.  Investment will also be needed in acquiring and maintaining the facilities  necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital devices on  Child Abuse Materials.         9.6 Operational Measures        \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   \r   3 \r   www.virtualglobaltaskforce.com  \r       \r    9.6.1 NCCC will ensure that a working mechanism is established and is widely  promoted to provide a readily understood means for reporting illegal content  found on the Internet, for example, a national hotline which has the capacity to  respond rapidly and have illegal material removed or rendered inaccessible.   9.6.2 NCCC will ensure various security and law enforcement agencies in the  country implement abuse report mechanisms which will be prominently  displayed on relevant parts of any web site that allows user generated content  to appear. It should also be possible for people who feel threatened in any  way, or for people who have witnessed any worrying activity on the Internet,  to be able to report it as quickly as possible to the relevant law enforcement  agencies that need to be trained and ready to respond.      9.6.3 NCCC will promote a number of software programmes which can help screen  out unwanted material or block unwanted contacts. Utilizing some of the child  safety and filtering programmes because they are part of a computer’s  operating system or they are provided as part of a package available from an  ISP or ESP. The manufacturers of some game consoles also provide similar  tools if the device is Internet enabled. These programmes are not foolproof  but they can provide a welcome level of support, particularly in families with  younger children. These technical tools will be used as part of a broader  arsenal. Parental and/or guardian involvement is critical.      9.6.4 It is strategically essential that the Nigerian law enforcement community  becomes fully engaged with any overall strategy to help make the Internet  safer for children and young people.      9.6.5 Nigerian Law enforcement officers will be appropriately trained to conduct  investigations into Internet related crimes against children and young people.  They need the right level of technical knowledge and access to forensic  facilities to enable them to extract and interpret data obtained from computers  or the Internet.      9.6.6 NCCC will establish a clear mechanism to enable children and young people,  or any member of the public, to report any incidents or concerns they might  have about a child’s or a young person’s online safety.       9.7  National Security Response Measures        9.7.1 With escalation of cybercrime, youths based conflict and terrorist recruitment,   bombing attack in the country, the Internet has made possible a range of      \r    ways of abusing children and recruiting young people, e.g., through web  cams, chat rooms and internet blog.      9.7.2 The internet has also played a singular role in expanding the scale on which   Child Abuse Material (CAM) has become available in all parts of the world.  For these reasons, when addressing online safety concerns for children and  young people from national security perspective, the Strategy gives special  consideration to the following:     i. Outlawing “grooming” or other forms of remote enticement of legal minors   into inappropriate sexual contact or sexual activity, possession, production  and distribution of CAM, irrespective of the intent to distribute.      ii. Taking additional response steps to disrupt or reduce the traffic in CAM,  for example by establishing a national hotline and by deploying measures  which will block access to web sites and Usenet Newsgroups known to  contain or advertise the availability of CAM.      iii. Ensuring that national processes are in place which ensure that all CAM  found in a country is channeled towards a centralized, national resource.      iv. Developing strategies to address the demand for CAM particularly among  those who have convictions for such offences. It is important to build  awareness of the fact that this is not a victimless crime: children are  abused to produce the material being viewed and by intentionally viewing  or downloading CAM one is contributing directly to the abuse of the child  depicted and one is also encouraging the abuse of more children to  produce more pictures.      v. Building awareness of the fact that Nigerian children usually would not  consent to being sexually abused, whether for the production of CAM or in  any other way. Encourage people who use CAM to seek help, while at the  same time, making them aware that they will be held criminally responsible  for the illegal activity in which they engaged/are engaging.      vi. Ensuring that law enforcement crime prevention strategies as well as  school-based and social programmes include sections on cyber safety and  the risks posed by online predatory behavior, with age appropriate advice.         \r    vii. NCCC maintains a register of convicted online crime offenders. Courts  have issued judicial orders banning such offenders from using the Internet  altogether or from using parts of the Internet which are frequented by  children and young people. The problem with these orders hitherto has  been its enforcement.      viii. Consideration will be given to integrating the list of convicted sex offenders  into a block list which will prevent those on it from visiting or joining certain  web sites.   ix. Providing appropriate long term support for victims. Where children or  young people have been victimized online, where for example an illegal  image of them has appeared on the Internet, they will naturally feel very  concerned about who might have seen it and what impact this will have on  them. It could leave the child or young person feeling vulnerable to bullying  or to further sexual exploitation and abuse.      x. Ensuring that a grassroots’ reporting and intelligence gathering  mechanism is established and is widely promoted to provide a readily  understood and rapid means for reporting illegal content or illegal or  worrying online behavior e.g. a system similar to that which has been  established by the Virtual Global Taskforce. The use of the  INTERPOLi24/7 system will be encouraged.      xi. Ensuring that a sufficient number of law enforcement officials are  appropriately trained in investigating Internet and computer-based crime  and have access to appropriate forensic facilities to enable them extract  and interpret relevant digital data.      xii. Investing in training for law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial  authorities in the methods used by online criminals to perpetrate these  crimes. Investment will also be needed in acquiring and maintaining the  facilities necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital  devices.      xiii. In addition,   it will be important to establish bilateral and multilateral  collaboration and information exchanges with relevant law enforcement  authorities and investigative bodies in other countries.             \r                    CHAPTER TEN     STRATEGY ON PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP    10. 1 Introduction   • The present administration has demonstrated her commitment to the  prevailing security challenges by taking positive step to re-invigorate National  Cybersecurity Strategy as part of the National Security agenda.     • The Cybercrime legislation and the need to actualize the implementation of  National Cybersecurity Strategy requires effective machinery of public-private  partnership and management framework to drive the buildup process with  tripartite synergy of the whole nation including the government, non- government actors and international stakeholders.     • In the light of the above, this section seeks to provide the government with a  strategic public-partnership management framework approach for the  implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.       • The key elements of this strategy are as follows:  i. The PPP Management Framework to facilitate the cooperation and   partnership in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy  among the tripartite stakeholders in the country.      ii. The Nature of the PPP Framework Model, Benefit, Impact & Direction.      iii. Special Purpose Vehicle and Delivery channel through the setting up of  PPP for Cyber security (3PC).     iv. 3PC Working Document & Terms of Reference      v. 3PC Sustainable Strategy      \r       vi. Evaluation & Appraisal          10.2  The Imperative of Public-Private Partnership Framework for National  Cybersecurity Strategy   • In the current dispensation, engagement in cyberspace is central to the  existence, survivability, relevancy, as well as security and protection of the  public institutions and private sector businesses.      • The public and private sectors’ interests are enormously intertwined with a  shared responsibility for ensuring a secure cyberspace and a protected  critical economic infrastructure upon which businesses and government  services depend.     • Public-Private Partnership framework is critical to the build-up process and  overall success of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.     • Right from the commencement of the efforts on National Cybersecurity  Strategy since 2003, which was reinvigorated in 2010 and till the present  time. Most often, private sectors are usually caught unprepared in the  buildup process.     • There is a concrete evidence that the Federal government cannot succeed   in the many facets of securing National cyberspace if it works in isolation  in her build up in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.  Therefore PPPC is set to define roles and responsibilities, integrate  capabilities, and facilitate joint ownership of the problems and the  challenges towards developing holistic Cybersecurity Strategy. It is only  through such sustainable partnerships that the Country will be able to  enthrone cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution.        • Furthermore, the National Security challenge of securing cyberspace  requires an increased effort in all stakeholders’ collaborations. This effort  should seek—in continued collaboration with the private sector—to  improve the security of national interoperable networks      • The private sector, however, designs, invest, builds, owns, operates and  maintains   most of the critical information infrastructures that support  government and private users alike.     • Therefore Industry and governments share the responsibility for the      \r    security and reliability of the infrastructure and the transactions that take  place on it and should work closely together to address these  interdependencies.      • There are various approaches the NCSS take to address these  challenges, some of which require changes in law and policy.      • Thus private-sector engagement is required to help address the limitations of   law enforcement and national security. The Federal government and the  private sector have an enduring interest in assuring the security of the digital  infrastructure. Accordingly, government-industry collaboration is fundamental  to achieving National Cybersecurity Strategy.       • It is, therefore, critically important that government and private sector work  together in a proactive way. Successful government-private sector  collaboration requires three important component:      i. A clear value proposition:      • NCCC will articulate the mutual benefits to government and private  sector partners.     ii. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities.     • NCCC will develop a framework for common understanding that  will guide mutual working relation and define basis of relationship  between NCCC and private sector with clearly define roles and  responsibilities.     iii. Trust:      • This is fundamental and necessary for establishing, developing, and  maintaining sharing relationships between government and  industry.     • NCCC will develop, engender, nurture and infuse a Trust  Framework for public-private sector cooperation and understanding  on critical issues of cybersecurity assurance and monitoring,  sectorial CERT, and critical information infrastructure protection  plan.     • NCCC will provide a Trust Framework that respect and address  industry areas of concern in a manner that will not jeopardize but      \r    balance intrinsic business interest and National Interest.      10.3    Public-Private Sector Partnership Management Strategy (PPPMS)   10.3.1 The nature of the proposed PPMF Model involves the following:   • A linear build-up structural processes and national coordination through a  PPP Special Purpose Vehicle created by NCCC for this purpose   • The SPV drives and coordinates all the PPP buildup processes for the  coordination of government and industry partnership.         Fig 7 The proposed linear build-up process coordination through Special Purpose  Vehicle (SPV)    \r         Special \r  Purpose \r  Vehicle \r   (SPV)Comprising \r  Joint \r  Govt-­‐ \r    Private \r  Sector \r  National \r  Technical \r   Group \r  (NTWG) \r    Build-­‐Up \r  Processes, \r  Cordinating \r   all \r  Activities, \r  Unifying \r  Platform \r   for \r  PPP, \r  Cordination \r  of \r  all \r   National \r  Stakeholders \r    Commencement \r  of \r  Operation \r  of \r   National \r  of \r  Cybersecurity \r    Strategy \r    SPV \r   Components \r    ONSA-­‐Led \r   Govt \r  Reps \r    Muilt-­‐ International \r    Reps \r   \r   Private \r    Sectors \r  Reps \r       \r    • The ONSA through the NCCC will take the lead by establishing PPP- National  Technical Working Group (NTWG) composing of representatives from private  sector, government organizations and representatives of international  multistakeholder partners.     • The NTWG should not exceed a number needed to be sufficient  representatives of all the interests but at the same time capable of conducting  PPP-MF business.   • To assure its continued connection to the interests it is intended to represent,  provisions could be made for term limits for members.      10.3.2 The Objectives of PPP Management Framework (PPPMF)     i. To develop and implement public-private partnership action plan to  support the review and monitoring of implementation cybercrime and  cybersecurity legislation.     ii. To provide and nurture a sustainable trusted platform for National  cooperation, understanding and interactions among all stakeholders, while  managing all the build-up processes that will lead to the harmonized  agreements on National Cybersecurity among the government,  lawmakers, and the private sector.     iii. To provide a national mechanism that will unify variety of positions,   equities, and knowledge gaps to overcome differences and addresses  institutional diverse positions.     iv. To secure other stakeholders inclusion in the development and   implementation of National Cybersecurity efforts.     v. To facilitate the development and coordination of private sector groups  from different critical infrastructure industries related to Cybersecurity to  address common security interests collaboratively with government.     vi. To create and nurture trusted forums to address common Cybersecurity  challenges, national discourse and dialogue that will enhance cooperation  and understanding among various groups on National Cybersecurity effort.     vii. To institute fundamental arrangements between government and the   private sector for Cybersecurity incidence and response management.           \r    10.3.4 Implementation Vehicle for the Public-Private Partnership Management  Framework   i. Creation of PPP-National Technical Working Group (NTWG) for the  Implementation of the PPP-Framework.      ii. The mandate of the NTWG will be anchored on the implementation of  PPPMF objectives with the overall mission of actualizing national adoption  and operation of National Cybersecurity Strategy within the country.     iii. A selection criteria for the appointment of the Members of NTWG is based   on the value Impact of their respective inputs, in terms of the following;  • Technical contributions  • Critical Infrastructural Operators  • National Platform & Backbone   • Organizational Support: Structure & Coordination   • Media  • Non-government Organization   • Multi-stakeholder Management   • Understanding of Regional and Global framework for cooperation   • Legal Issues  • Public interest         10.3.5 The Benefit & Outcome of PPP-MF   i. It provides opportunity for government to effectively engage the core  stakeholders in the country while entrenching nationally acceptable  National Cybersecurity Strategy at the onset.      ii. Cybersecurity Strategy is a complex set of issues involving legal, socio- economic, and national security considerations. Several public  institutions have significant jurisdictional claim on cybersecurity issues..  The PPPMF will, therefore, provide opportunities to address all the  divergent positions of these stakeholders.      iii. Cybersecurity strategy has a deep connection with critical information   infrastructure, economy and security. Private sector provides  technology innovations, critical resources and technical standards that  the government needs to drive National Cybersecurity Strategy. While  government provides enabling mechanisms, instruments and  authorities to transform industry best practices and standards into the      \r    framework of National Cybersecurity Strategy, thus, PPPMF will assist  government to address structural weaknesses.     iv. National Cybersecurity Strategy driven through the public-private   partnership of government and private sector has greater national  security implication and economy protection values, than government  working alone or in partnership with multilateral and multinational  institutions.      v. PPPMF enables a trusted platform for strategic information sharing   between government and private sector critical for the overall success  of National Cybersecurity Strategy.      vi. It provides partnership vehicle for National Executive Council, National   Assembly and private sector to achieve mutual understanding and  cooperation on the operation of Cybersecurity legislation and  implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.        vii. PPPMF will facilitate structural coordination across the public and  private sector, building public confidence in National Cybersecurity  Strategy.      viii. Government depends on a privately operated cyber infrastructure.   Through the PPPMF, government engages with industry to continue  building the foundation of a trusted partnership. This engagement will  build value propositions that are understood by both government and  industry partners for the benefit of National Cybersecurity Strategy.                                       \r                               CHAPTER ELEVEN   Strategy on National Internet Safety   11.1 Introduction   • The nation is building various capabilities in computer security emergency  response and internet is fast becoming the mainstream for economy and  interaction.

In recent decades, Jordan’s lead has decreased over regional economies. Since Jordan is a resource poor economy and economic activity has historically been greatly based on international donors it is important for Jordan to develop independent economic competitiveness to reduce/eliminate its dependence on external donor funding. In the particular case of Jordan this can only be done through the talent, creativity and education/skill of its population. The purpose of this strategy is to provide Jordan with a defined strategy for addressing areas of specific weakness and opportunity for the purpose of improving the role of ICT in Jordan’s economic development and job creation. Robust economic development and job creation must be linked with exports. The strategy is designed to be aligned with the Government of Jordan’s Policy in the Telecommunications and IT Sectors in its recommendations This document consists of a five year strategic plan for the telecommunications and information technology sectors. It has been prepared in full partnership with the private sector. The plan should be reviewed and revised biannually. ICT provides a powerful paradigm for economic development. Telecommunications infrastructure is the means through which information technology products and services are delivered to consumers (for local consumption and exports). As such, telecommunications and information technology are inextricably intertwined. Therefore, an essential component to a healthy and sustainably competitive IT sector is a robust, modern, responsive and competitive telecommunications infrastructure. Without proper telecommunications infrastructure, IT products and services cannot be delivered locally or internationally as exports. High value added job creation is thus connected not only to the competitiveness of the actual IT sector but also to the importance of a modern telecommunications infrastructure. The economic benefits of information technology cannot be delivered to the economy and society without fast and competitive telecommunications. It is for this reason that this document addresses both telecommunications and information technology. ICT has evolved into an internationally known language/standard. A competent ICT professional in Jordan can develop products and services which can be implemented in and have value in global markets. It is this opportunity which is afforded by ICT which makes it imperative for Jordan to take as much advantage of this opportunity. Being able to take full advantage of this opportunity requires that the business environment be competitive with international economies. It is only in this manner that structural impediments can be removed allowing Jordan’s ability to compete to rest on the abilities of its people. As such, it is important that ICT infrastructure be continually maintained at the levels found in competing economies. Infrastructure provides a platform for new product and service development and innovation. Without infrastructure at international standards, the ICT industry will be handicapped. Many ICT companies may be developing products/services based on obsolete infrastructure which will not find an application outside of Jordan. These issues and challenges are avoidable as exports are required to mitigate Jordan’s chronic trade deficit. This strategy attempts to provide simple and practical recommendations to improve IT, ICT enabled and digital content companies’ exports as a means of increasing the sector’s contribution to the national economy and to provide job creation opportunities. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 7 Since the government of Jordan (GoJ) also suffers from a chronic budget deficit, it is imperative that creative means be pursued to overcome the government’s inability to finance infrastructure development. As such, the GoJ needs to develop/promote modalities (BOO, BOT, BOOST, Joint Ventures, etc.) in which private sector investment can be recruited to continually upgrade ICT infrastructure and various required E-services. This will require that Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) be developed or negotiated and that commercial partnership and licensing models be identified and agreed upon and promoted to upgrade national telecommunication infrastructure to remain competitive with global norms. ICT is a knowledge based industry. As such, education, training and certification play an important role in determining sustainable competitiveness and longevity. Jordan already is well known for its university system. However, the university system is not agile enough to remain completely relevant with the demands of the ICT sector. The ICT sector needs to develop means in which ICT graduates can continually develop their skills to remain relevant for local ICT companies and to develop competitive products. Training and certification can be done through an independent professional development institute or cooperative existing training and educational institutions in cooperation with international technology providers and international operators. The benchmark of a knowledge base industry is the industry’s ability to develop intellectual property. This strategy has provided a variety of recommendations regarding IP. The strategy promotes identifying existing but unregistered/unidentified/unrecognized intellectual property concealed in existing ICT products and services and promotes registering them. It also aims to encourage local ICT companies to develop, register and promote and commercialize their own IP. Finally, the strategy covers the issue of ICT diffusion as a necessary requirement for economic growth. The strategy explicitly calls for developing intersections between the ICT sector and competitive economic sectors like pharmaceuticals, Architecture and Engineering and Clean Technology to identify issues which can be effectively addressed by ICT to improve the competitiveness of the individual sectors. It is through the effective intersection of ICT and the individual sectors that diffusion will be facilitated. Diffusion will be facilitated because developed ICT products and services will have obvious utility to the sectors. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 8 Overview Jordan was one of the first Arab countries to introduce communication and information technology to the economy. In 1921 the Department of Post and Telegraph (DPT) was set up. It provided telegraph and post services to Trans Jordan Emirate In 1930, telecom services were further developed as well as international links. The Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony (MoPTT) was established in 1951 as the successor of the DPT. It was responsible for providing, improving and expanding the coverage of post and national telephone services across the Kingdom. In 1971, the Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) was established as a Government controlled entity responsible for the provision of various telecom services, including telephone, telegraph and telex and for regulating them 1. Jordan developed satellite communication links in the late 1970s and mobile telephone service (MTS) in the mid-1980s. International direct dialing was introduced in 1982; in 1989, Jordan had one Atlantic Ocean International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) channel, one Indian Ocean INTELSAT channel, and one Arab Satellite Organization (ARABSAT) channel2. Jordan was also one of the first Arab countries to introduce information technology (IT) to industry and the economy. The General Statistics Department installed the first mainframe in 1968 followed by Cairo Amman Bank in 1969 and the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) installed a mainframe in the early 1970s. The RSS was also outsourced to do customer billing for the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) and the Jordan Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) in the 1970s and 1980s. By the late 1980s banks and large industrial institutions (Phosphate and Potash) had computerized systems and IT departments. In the late 1980s, the national IT industry seriously developing due to the advent of affordable and powerful personal desktop computers and an increasing number of IT graduates. Technical development and growth of the ICT industry was further enhanced by privatization and liberalization of the telecommunications sector according to the timeline included in Annex 1. The Jordanian ICT sector has grown tremendously since the late 1980s and early 1990s,. In the late 1990s, the Information Technology Association of Jordan (INT@J) was formed. INT@J Played a crucial role in developing a series of national strategies (REACH 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.) and the last national strategy was developed by the sector in cooperation with the Ministry of ICT. INT@J was the first institution to start gathering meaningful sector specific data. As such, much of what is in this report is based on data gathered and collated by INT@J. Since the establishment of MoICT in 2002, the ministry became more involved and enhanced cooperation within the ICT sector by getting all relevant players involved and by leading the collective development of sector policies. The ICT sector grew in response to liberalization of telecommunications The sector’s initial reform requests were centered on deregulating the industry, lowering internet usage costs and getting the government to lead sector development trough initiating E- education and E-government. The E-Education initiative created an ICT subsector with export 1 2 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 9 potential. Three local E-education companies developed Arabic language based E-education content, E-Education content management systems and E-enabled education management systems. The education management systems and E-education content has been successfully exported to the United States, Oman, Bahrain, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco. There have been limited successes with e-Government services development. These successes could be magnified if the GoJ is able to articulate and adhere to the e-government priorities which they establish. Government E-transformation is the responsibility of all government agencies. The trend in the international arena is focusing on the whole of government, Mobile Government, E-Participation, and Open Data. It is imperative that that all government agencies approach transformation in this context. Information Technology (IT) revenues grew from USD 60,000,000 (local and export revenues) in 2000 to a high of USD 962,435,094 in 2008. IT revenues declined from 2008, reaching USD 738,055,284 in 20113. The greatest decline between 2008 and 2011 was in domestic revenues. This decline in revenues indicates a delayed impact of the global economic crisis on the private sector (locally and regionally) which started in 2007 as well as lower direct government spending, and insufficient government involvement and leadership in creating economic opportunities for the sector. Exports increased slightly from USD 226,863,277 in 2008 to USD 230,528,961 in 20114 indicating increased sector effort on developing export markets and also possibly due to the introduction of Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) such as call centers and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) as a new subsector.

The addition of new knowledge and/or innovation assists in improving the efficiencies of company/corporate processes (manufacturing, marketing, etc.) or developing new products and services to meet unmet needs or adding additional features to existing products. Adding value to existing products and services and/or creating new products and services based on new knowledge enables higher prices to be charged (improved profitability) or helps in displacing competing products or services from the market (local and export). The inability of the local economy to absorb high value added products and services are related to Jordanian corporate organizational capacity. Over 99.6% of registered companies are considered micro small or medium sized enterprises7. The small size of most Jordanian companies hinders the purchase of IT solutions. A recent EU study8 has indicated that a nation’s organizational capability, as indicated by the existence of mature corporate policies and procedures within companies, affects a company’s/nation’s ability to absorb ICT effectively. Jordanian Domestic IT Revenue (High Value Added = 35%)9 High Value Added Low Value Added 7 8 9 ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 2011 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT), Page 24 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 11 Jordanian Export IT Revenue (High Value Added = 89%)10 High Value Added Low Value Added ICT sector growth over this period has taken place in new verticals that is more consumer based than corporate based. This has been due to the large growth of both internet but more importantly mobile penetration in Jordanian society. The increase of IT consumption by regular mobile and internet users has fuelled non-traditional (technical programming) growth. This is an indication of the impact of consumerization of ICT products and service development 11. Moreover, the growth of ITES such as call centers and outsourcing has also created new untapped areas for sector growth particularly in exports. ITES services (call Centers and Business Process Outsourcing)12 Year Domestic Revenues (JD) Export Revenues (JD) Total Revenues (JD) 2011 375,311 4,556,999 4,932,310 2010 491,021 1,497,102 1,988,123 2009 435,000 1,881,608 2,316,608 The growth of ITES in Jordan indicates the ability to leverage existing HR skills and provide value added services to domestic and export markets. Because Jordan has limited human resources in terms of numbers, Jordan’s demonstrated success has been based on going up the value chain where greater and more sophisticated services can be delivered. This developmental direction in ITES will allow Jordan to extract larger revenues from proper use of its university educated population. 10 ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 2011 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT), page 24 11 12 ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbooks for years 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT) – accumulated data from ITES tables and telecommunications tables. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 12 Telecommunications Revenues (Domestic and Export)13 Year Internet (JD) Mobile (JD) PSTN (JD) Total (JD) 2011 250,000,000 697,939,916 237,162,165 1,185,102,789 2010 45,784,944 668,812,200 125,543,976 840,141,120 2009 36,305,532 660,547,716 129,813,924 826,667,172 2008 No clear segmentations between Internet, Mobile & PSTN 920,341,232 There has been steady revenue growth in both internet usage and mobile usage. PSTN revenues have also grown between 2001 and 2010 albeit at a slower rate than mobile. The growth in these subsectors of communications indicates increased usage of ICT particularly through the intersection/integration between internet and mobile telephony and particularly among regular citizens/consumers. There may be increased PSTN based commercial service delivery opportunities for non-traditional services as traditional telephony migrates to mobile networks. It is also likely that additional sector growth can be developed, if Jordanian ICT companies are able to deliver meaningful services through the cloud. The growth of mobile and internet among citizens indicates the growing utility of applications for consumers (consumerism) which are launched and used on these platforms (mobile and internet) in addition to the convergence of all hardware types with the cloud. ICT is already a common international communication delivery platform. The development of common programming languages, information technology standards (CMMI, SPOT, etc.), telecommunications standards (GSM, 3G, 4G, etc.) and the proliferation of the internet is allowing people from all around the world to create products, export and sell and communicate with each other. Moreover, with the advent of the internet and mobile telephony and mobile devices, there is now a global unified platform. Products developed on computers and mobile devices can be useful anywhere. The only limiting factor is the ability to conceptualize and develop innovative products which meet people’s or institution’s needs. This to a great extent is based on the creativity of the people in development and their understanding of the sectors or needs that they serve. Since ICT has become a common international communication platform, ICT professionals have access and opportunity to international markets without the difficulties of traditional export. Thus, the main challenge to being able to exploit this opportunity is identifying what issues (challenges and opportunities) need to be addressed in industry or among regular consumers (local, regional and international) and develop innovative solutions to address these challenges using IT technologies and deploying on one or more platforms. In Jordan opportunities exist among a number of high values added industries such as pharmaceuticals, clean technology, agriculture, architecture and engineering, medical/healthcare services, tourism and content among others. The ICT sector needs to identify specific opportunities in these sectors. This can be done by working closely with the management of these knowledge sectors or with the consulting sector that are familiar with these sectors. An EU 13 Ibid JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 13 study14 has stated that educated knowledge based sectors will be more able to exploit ICT in their businesses than non-knowledge based sectors making ICT diffusion easier. This is to a great extent due to the fact that knowledge based sectors are more likely to have developed institutional/organizational capital in the form of developed and well-articulated policies and procedures which are the basis for successful ICT diffusion into the sector. It is these policies and procedures which form the foundation for improved efficiencies in organizational management. ICT opportunities also exist in digital content creation for consumers. Jordan has witnessed a jump in growth in this highly creative field because it is easily delivered by mobile devices and the internet, it is easily understood and appreciated and because it integrates a variety of value adding components (sound, narration, film/video, music, graphics, animation, interaction design, acting, script writing, etc.). Digital content has application on mobile devices as well as the internet and has the potential for easy regional and international export as well. Jordanian companies which demonstrate innovative competency in application development, resulting from the intersection/diffusion between ICT and the specific industry vertical or digital content development will be able to successfully develop and sustain exports. Opportunities also exist in the outsourcing sector, where educated and/or certified Jordanian workers can provide value adding services to local and regional companies from call centers at the bottom of the value chain to knowledge process outsourcing which leverages Jordan’s national investment in education. 14 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 14 Alignment with the Government of Jordan’s (GoJ’s) ICT Policy and Initiatives The Statement of Government Policy 2012 on Communications, Information and Postal Sectors focuses on the establishment and execution of policies to leverage ICT as a means for social and economic development. As such, the intent of this national ICT strategy document is to use ICT as a tool to improve economic activity and job creation. GoJ policy can be an effective tool to direct national efforts towards local ICT use (diffusion), increased ICT exports and increased job creation in ICT and ICT affected or improved sectors. Moreover, effective economic development can only come about if an effective and cooperative public and private partnership is developed and maintained. The GoJ embarked on several E-Initiatives (Education, Government Services and Health). The E- Education initiative resulted in several local companies developing internationally competitive products and services. A local content management system and Education management system was developed in and has been exported to the United States, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Another local company has developed Arabic Language based E-curriculum for science and mathematics. This company has exported its E-curriculum to Algeria, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia, where it now is used in the education of over one million students. This same company has also branched off into mobile educational application development. One of the most recent E-Education applications has won a World Summit Award for mobile application development. Growth in E-Education would not have occurred without Government leadership. The E-Government initiative has resulted in less dramatic results over the past several years. The E-Government initiative needs to be aggressively reexamined. The Ministry of Public Sector Development (MoPSD) in collaboration with MoICT and other concerned government entities shall set priorities with regard to developing the public sector E-services and utilizing ICT infrastructure. MoICT needs to identify/study new modalities with which to attract private sector investment in developing and managing E-Government services. MoICT also needs to identify appropriate revenue sharing models to attract private sector (local and international) involvement in developing E-Government services. Successful development and launching of E- Government services will lead to the development of new ICT based products and service management competencies which are likely to have export potential. To enable the many important GoJ supported E-Initiatives, the GoJ initiated establishment of a national broadband network (NBN) as a private governmental network in 2003 as a means to make computers and networks more widely available to the public and to launch and enable (E- Education, E-Health and E-Government). Due to fiscal constraints, the GoJ is facing difficulties in completing the NBN project. In addition, much of the NBN investment has remained unexploited by both the government and the private sector. To achieve the GoJ policy goal of making ICT services more widely available to the public, GoJ will have to harness the financial and business capability of the private sector (local and/or international) to complete the NBN and to make effective use of this infrastructure. As such, GoJ needs to identify priorities to be implemented, identify/study cooperative modalities with the private sector and develop and continuously communicate attractive revenue sharing schemes to increase private sector interest in completing the NBN as well as exploiting its capacity for GoJ and private sector use. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 15 The GoJ passed the National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS) in September 2012. The main objective of NIACSS is to give structure and involve and empower all concerned entities to more effectively secure computer networks they own, operate, control or interact with. This will strengthen Jordan’s information and Communication infrastructure for both the public and private sectors. This was done based on the knowledge that the national ICT infrastructure needs to be robust, secure and trusted to have the desired positive impact on national economic and ICT sector growth. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 16 The Strategy15 ICT provides Jordan with a unique opportunity to develop a competitive and sustainable export oriented industry. Jordan’s strategic challenge is to focus national effort and resources (private and public sector) to extract the greatest opportunity for the country to create jobs and export driven economic growth. The national ICT strategy should focus on leveraging identified national strengths. Currently general national strengths are university educated labor, high levels of literacy, and relatively good ICT infrastructure. To maintain competitiveness in this sector, it is imperative that the public and private sector work to ensure that education and ICT infrastructure remain internationally competitive and improve. Strategically, Jordan should focus on areas of established competitiveness and sectors where value creation is possible through the facilitation of economic clustering and integration. This means identifying those economic sectors where Jordan has demonstrated ability over time to consistently provide internationally and regionally competitive services or products. Additionally, Jordan should focus on integrating and serving regional value chains as well to improve overall regional competitiveness. This can include sectors such as the oil and gas industry, water desalination and management as well as banking and finance. These are areas where Jordan does not necessarily have established competency, but can develop a capability to serve these regional market needs through such ICT services as localized content and BPO development. Over the past several decades Jordan has distinguished itself across several sectors. These sectors are: a) Pharmaceuticals b) Healthcare/medical tourism c) Architecture and Engineering d) Tourism e) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) f) Logistics g) Banking and Finance h) Education The majority of these sectors are represented in the Jordanian National Competitiveness and Innovation Council, a public private partnership, hosted at the competitiveness department at the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC). Additionally, Jordan must develop technical competence in clean technology as well as design intensive manufacturing. Both these sectors address pressing strategic national needs in terms of energy dependence and water security (clean technology) as well as job creation and export opportunities (design intensive manufacturing). These sectors provide the ICT sector with a unique opportunity to develop products and services based on their intersections. Development of industry specific products and services will help in national ICT diffusion. 15 Annexes 1,2, and 3 discuss in details the current “Limitations”, how to “Turn Challenges into Opportunities”, and “Where to Focus and Why”. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 17 Integrating Knowledge: Incorporation of knowledge into a product or service design is where value and competitiveness is created. Thus facilitating intersections between ICT and other sectors is important. Moreover, increasing cooperation between ICT companies and universities and research centers can help integrate new knowledge in the form of R&D to develop new products and services. This will require that ICT companies and/or potential users of ICT properly define their R&D requirements (desired outputs/outcomes) before engaging universities and research institutions. The ICT industry, in cooperation with management consultants and process experts will be able to identify opportunities and provide technical insight in any of the non-ICT sectors to develop products and services which will meet a pressing, identified sector need. Having a deep understanding of sector challenges and dynamics is essential to developing a high value added, competitive product and assists ICT to become a sector enabler. Once ICT solutions are developed ICT can more easily diffuse into the sector and improve sector efficiencies and competitiveness. Well-conceived and executed ICT products which address specific sector needs will improve the international competitiveness of the ICT sector because individual companies within the ICT sector will be focused on specific industries/sectors and will incorporate deep vertical knowledge of the sector which they serve. This is particularly true for products and solutions which serve highly specialized and small markets where scale economies are difficult to achieve. It is in these markets that that Jordanian ICT companies can successfully compete. Large international companies avoid these markets because they are either small or the price for their product or service will be uncompetitive and comparatively high. Training and Education: To maintain its international competitiveness, Jordan must address those factors which created its current sector competitiveness. Specifically, Jordan must develop ways to continually fuel sector growth with talented, trained and certified labor. The creation of a national ICT bridging program is being pursued through two separate initiatives. The MoICT in cooperation with the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) has launched a bridging program. INT@J and the private sector (with IFC support in developing a business plan) are also working to provide agile professional development, training and certification for ICT graduates and professionals. It is envisaged that both initiatives will eventually merge or combine at a later stage. It has also been suggested by the private sector that Jordanian universities and private sector ICT companies collaborate to identify model “CVs” for the different ICT roles needed in the market/economy. This can be supported by the ICT specific Qualification Framework intended to be developed as part of IFC support to INT@J. The purpose of a qualification framework is to provide higher education institutes, employers, present and future employees, training institutions, and other stakeholders with a guide as to what skills and competencies are needed in the labor market. Based on identification of the required skills and competencies (model CVs), the private sector would then collaborate with university faculty/ accreditation council in selecting the courses and topics required to develop the required skills and knowledge. The JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 18 private sector might be required to participate in the education by providing training and guidance. Career counselors working at high schools can take advantage of these model CVs to help students identify the most suitable career for their individual strengths and predispositions. Infrastructure: Jordan needs to maintain the competitiveness of its ICT infrastructure (national communication infrastructure and private sector IT infrastructure). There are numerous regional and international opportunities which can be exploited by Jordanian ICT companies if they maintain familiarity with new ICT infrastructure technology. Training, certification and access to modern infrastructure are required if Jordan’s ICT sector is to remain able to meet local ICT development needs/opportunities as well as remain a trusted, regional ICT talent base. It is the role of the government to create new market entry possibilities and maintain an environment that is inductive to needed and new ICT infrastructure investment opportunities for the private sector which will help facilitate growth in the economy. New economic opportunities can be created and exploited when existing infrastructure is fully accessed and utilized, particularly when the local copper is unbundled. Existing copper wire infrastructure integrated with new technologies can reduce the cost of internet penetration as well as facilitate new ICT opportunities. Moreover, it is necessary for the GoJ to adjust regulation and legislation, such as passing the E-transaction, E-Commerce, Privacy and Data Protection related laws/regulations/instructions to facilitate increased ICT enabled economic activity (E- commerce, E-logistics, E-banking, etc.). New economic opportunities can be more aggressively pursued when the Universal Service Policy is revised and the Universal Service Fund is established. The GoJ invested in establishing a national broadband network (NBN) as a private network for the government. The intent of this GoJ initiative was to bridge the digital divide between all citizens and to enable the provision of ICT services (E-Government, E-Health, E-Education, etc.) to all segments of society. NBN was also to act as a tool to enhance the development and competitiveness of local ICT companies in areas such as e-education. NBN’s required investment has proved too large for the GoJ to financially complete and exploit. To benefit from the sunk costs of the GoJ investment, the existing NBN must be completed and activated through creating bold opportunities for the private sector to develop and deliver services to consumers (E- Education and E-Health, cable television, etc.) or by creating national large scale demand/usage for E-services (E-Commerce and E-Government). Successful exploitation of NBN will require identifying national E-Government, E-Service priorities by the government (in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Sector Reform), passing the PPP law (or at least agreeing on or adopting acceptable partnership models), arriving at acceptable revenue sharing models and passing the E-transaction, E-Commerce, Privacy and Data Protection related laws/regulations/instructions. The NBN or operational usage of the NBN can be transferred to the private sector (local and/or international) for exploitation. Partial or complete handover to the private sector will greatly reduce or eliminate GoJ operational costs to run the NBN. This will free up public sector funds which can be re-directed towards developing new needed national infrastructure. National demand for NBN services and applications can be enhanced through GoJ funding (partial or through PPPs) for the construction of open access fiber optic networks. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 19 Considerable part of the funding needed for the upgrade of existing communication networks may be generated through the organization of a 4G frequency auction among interested providers to obtain for example a 15 years license. Resources generated through the auction can be allocated to MoICT for upgrading the communications infrastructure. This is common practice in various EU countries (Germany, Sweden and the UK). The United States and Singapore have also reinvested the results of spectrum auctions. Generally, these countries reinvested the financial proceeds of the auctions in Science and Technology Development (including ICT), but often governments provide the results of the auction to the national Treasury. As such, proceeds from any sale of a public good may be earmarked for infrastructure development (possibly take on debt to upgrade national infrastructure and then allocate proceeds to cover the debt). Export Development: Export development is essential to developing sustainable economic growth and job creation. The Jordanian economy is too small and poor at present to fuel substantial economic growth. Exports to larger and/or wealthier countries are required to develop and sustain job creation, as well as sustainably improve company revenues and profitability. Jordanian ICT companies will only be able to export successfully if they are able to develop competitive products and services which have high utility for their intended target markets. High utility (added value) will allow Jordanian companies to charge higher prices with higher profit margins. It is for this reason that ICT companies are recommended to develop working relationships with Jordan’s most competitive knowledge sectors such that they can identify specific needs which can be addressed through ICT product/service development and incorporate the knowledge and experience of the targeted sector. Moreover, the ICT sector can also focus efforts on the development of Arabic language based digital content targeting regional export markets. Stimulating Investment: The Telecommunications sector in Jordan has grown to a great extent because of foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI has been important not only for the investment which it brings but also for the operational expertise which accompanies the investment. If the telecommunications sector is to continue to grow and expand, the GoJ has to develop attractive investment opportunities (partially based on private sector input and initiative) which will continue to attract foreign operators and investors as well as facilitate local domestic investment. Attractive investment opportunities are based not only on the provision and management/operation of new technological infrastructure but also on the development and launching of value adding services. Investment in domestic IT companies should also be promoted. This can be done in cooperation with the JIB and INT@J, when a clear and competitive value proposition can be defined. A value proposition will be easier to define, defend and promote for investment when clear specialized utility can be demonstrated. This will be easier to do after successful intersections with other competitive economic sectors yield useful products and services. Business and Investment Environment: Attracting investment is not only an issue of identifying and promoting lucrative business opportunities but is also intimately related to providing and maintaining a competitive business JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 20 environment. Jordan needs to develop its business environment to be competitive on an international scale. Laws must be internationally competitive and equally applied across all businesses. Not doing so will facilitate greater migration of Jordanian companies, management and capital to more attractive environments. This will further increase unemployment and reduce exports, putting Jordan in an increasingly precarious economic and social position. Also taxation (direct and indirect), licensing and fee regimes need to be unambiguous, consistent and transparent. GoJ needs to publish how taxation, licensing and fee regimes are applied. This will prevent inconsistent interpretation by companies as well as government employees and provide a standard which the private sector (local and foreign) can depend upon. Moreover, publication will provide the GoJ and the private sector a reference to review and evaluate the Jordanian investment environment to maintain its regional and international competitiveness. This is extremely important for the sector, JIB and various business associations who will be responsible for promoting local and foreign investment to develop the sector. Of particular importance will be ICT and BPO investment. Once a stable and attractive investment environment secured, a strategic ICT sector investment plan should be developed between INT@J, JIB and the Chambers of Trade and Commerce which will highlight opportunities for local and foreign investors. The plan should identify target markets and potential partners for investment. Strategic intent: ICT is a platform which will enable export led economic growth in ICT and other high value added sectors, through high value added product and service development, which leverages the energy and creativity of youth and Jordan’s educated population. ICT will enable greater competitiveness in specialized economic sectors which will develop sustainable high value added job growth as well as reduce the digital divide between Jordan and more developed countries with regards to ICT development and use. Vision Statement: A collaborative Jordanian public and private ICT sector that develops and maintains a fair competitive environment that attracts and encourages further investment in the sector which translates into the development of innovative, competitive (exportable) and affordable products and services which satisfy customer needs enabling Jordan to be viewed as a regional ICT hub for the development and delivery of competitive ICT products and services. Mission Statement: ICT is Jordan’s engine of economic growth and job creation through harnessing the energy, creativity and talents of its educated youth to extend establish and maintain export markets by:  enabling local high value added (non-ICT) sectors to improve their competitiveness,  Exploiting and developing national infrastructure,  Developing international technical and business linkages and  Serving regional and international technology and operational needs. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 21 Strategic Objectives: This strategy defines six major strategic objectives and a number of strategic catalysts that expedite the achievement of these objectives. 1. Improve Business & Investment Environment by:  Enhancing the legislative and regulatory framework to increase competition, reduce barriers to market entry, and to facilitate E-commerce.  Managing Radio Spectrum Effectively to enable the creation on new market possibilities. 2. Increase foreign direct investment and bolster domestic investment by:  Identifying and marketing investment opportunities in targeted ICT verticals  Creating Techno-poles.  Promoting intellectual Property Development and Registration.  Supporting ICT Innovation Centers 3. Boost exports of IT and ICT enabled national products, services and capabilities by:  Facilitating intersections between ICT and other high value added sectors  Matching local products, services and capabilities with ICT export markets’ needs.  Developing a National Export House. 4. Maintain and develop a competitive telecommunication infrastructure to support continuous IT sector innovation and to serve local and regional ICT markets by:  Updating local ICT infrastructure.  Encouraging Infrastructure and facilities sharing.  Facilitating private sector exploitation of NBN. 5. Develop agile national professional training and certification capabilities to meet local and regional ICT sectors’ needs by:  Maintaining knowledge of what the ICT sector (locally, regionally, and globally) requires in terms of skills.  Providing agile, sector responsive technical and managerial training to address the needs of the ICT industry. 6. Stimulate the creation and development of suitable Arabic language and relevant digital content that is accessible online throughout the Arabic speaking region by:  Accelerating convergence between ICT and innovative audio visual services  Increasing awareness among potential developers and users. National Targets: JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 22 The National ICT strategy has identified the following measurable targets as an outcome of achieving the strategic objectives defined below. Target 2011 Baseline 2017 Target Investment16 (ICT) 205 M $ 450 M $ Internet Penetration (63% penetration – Q3 2012) 85% Revenues17 2.Billions $ 3.15 Billion $ Employment (direct) 15,835 20,000 16 This includes local and foreign direct investment in Telecom and IT. 17 This includes domestic and export revenues of Telecom and IT companies. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 23 Governance Structure Executing the proposed National ICT Strategy 2013 – 2017 will require integration and coordination among all relevant stakeholders to implement the recommendations and initiatives articulated in the Strategy. All of the initiatives and actions identified to implement the strategy require the cooperation of often different stakeholders. As such, it is important to subdivide the responsibility of follow up on implementing specific objectives to the participating stakeholders responsible for specific objectives as well as the defined actions. Executing the National ICT Strategy is a complex undertaking. It is important that a National Task Force, a Program Management Unit (PMU) and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) be created to be responsible for identifying, managing and overseeing the execution of highly specific tasks and activities to achieve the strategy’s defined objectives. The TSU will be responsible for developing and preparing documents and studies which identify specific tasks and actions required to develop the telecommunications sector for the purpose of facilitating economic private sector and IT sector development. Moreover, the TSU will work on prioritizing its recommendations to direct the PMU to provide rational and studied guidance to the implementing committees. The PMU would report to the National Task Force which would be comprised of stakeholders from the public, private and NGO sectors. The National Task Force would derive its authority from the cooperating stakeholders. The private sector and public sector are jointly responsible for determining and securing the annual funding requirements for the PMU and TSU and to jointly contribute to the funding of both units. The national task force is expected to be a voluntary task force made up of relevant stakeholders who fund the PMU and TSU. It is also the joint responsibility of MoICT and the ICT private sector to seek support to secure funding for the execution of the defined activities needed to achieve the stipulated objectives. GoJ support includes communicating ICT Strategic Plan objectives and activities as a national priority when seeking international donor funding and technical assistance. MoICT, MoPIC, relevant GoJ entities and the private sector are likely to have to revisit the prioritization of the defined activities and strategic objectives depending on availability of funding and define where donor technical assistance can fill needs defined by the activities and objectives. As funding is expected to remain a challenge, it is likely to consider private sector commercial investments, whenever feasible, to achieve many of the stated objectives. Execution of activities and achievement of objectives is directly related to obtaining funding allocated for specific activities and/or recruiting international technical assistance for the same purpose. Individual committees should be formed from the responsible stakeholders identified for each strategic objective to oversee and execute highly specific tasks required for each strategic objective. Each committee would be responsible for delivering/achieving the required KPI’s and would report to the Program Management Unit. Committees should meet periodically (as determined as necessary by the individual committees) to execute the specific actions at timings that are agreed upon by the individual committees. The committees would report to the Program Management Unit regarding the progress being made in implementing the specific task as well as identifying any potential obstacles that might be faced. The Program Management Unit will monitor, evaluate and report the progress and or obstacles to implementing the National ICT Strategy to the National Task Force. The National Task Force would be chaired by JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 24 the Minister of ICT and Co-Chaired by INT@J Chairman. The Program Management Unit will elect its directors based on the participating stakeholders.

Execution of activities and thus achievement of objectives is directly related to obtaining funding allocated for specific activities and/or recruiting international technical assistance for the same purpose. Annex 5 provides guidance to readers of the annual financial requirements to execute all initiatives and actions defined in the National ICT Strategy. Financial requirements identified in this strategy are estimates. Actual requirements are to be defined by responsible stakeholders prior to implementation. All the activities described in the National ICT Strategy are activities of national importance. While the majority of actions require financial resources, the most substantial are related to telecommunication infrastructure investments. With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector, such investment opportunities can only be identified as an opportunity not imposed on operators or investors. Therefore, whether such investments are actually made depends on whether investors/operators perceive the benefit of the investment. Since the GoJ is no longer active in or financially capable of making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the telecommunications and IT sector to benefit from new telecommunication investments depends on the how investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment. For this reason, it is the government responsibility to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to repeated private sector investment and which enables the ICT sector to grow and be competitive by considering proactively all legal and regulatory implications. Although the responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those related to infrastructure, education and product and service development, it is the joint responsibility of MoICT and the ICT private sector to seek support to secure funding for the execution of the defined activities needed to achieve the stipulated objectives. Activities are to be re-prioritized based on the availability of funding as funding is expected to remain a challenge which may hinder the achievement of the strategic objectives and defined targets.

JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 53 Annex 1 Timeline for Liberalizing and Privatizing the Telecommunications Sector Technical development and growth of the ICT industry was enhanced by privatization and liberalization of the telecommunications sector according to the following timeline34: In 1988, a license was granted to Jordan Paging Company to provide paging services. In 1992, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony (MoPTT) was renamed as The Ministry of Post & Communications. In 1993, Jordan initiated a national development program to increase the penetration of telephony services from 7.8 to 12 lines per 100 inhabitants. In 1993, the private sector was allowed to invest in telecommunications projects. In October 1994, Fastlink was granted the first mobile cellular license in Jordan. In 1995, The Telecommunications Law No. 13 of 1995 was passed, providing the legal basis for reform. As a result, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) was established. In 1997, the Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) was transformed into a Government- owned company operating on a commercial basis, as a first step towards its privatization, and was then renamed Jordan Telecommunications Company (JTC). In 1999, MobileCom Company was granted a license to provide mobile cellular services in the Kingdom. In 2000, Jordan became a full member of the WTO. Therefore Jordan has provided its obligations regarding the telecommunications sector within the presentations made to join the organization, which included fully liberalizing the telecommunications sector by the end of 2004. In 2000, 40% of JTC shares were sold to a consortium led by France Telecom and the Arab Bank, 8% of shares were sold to to the Social Security Corporation, and 1% to Jordan Telecom Company employees. In 2002, the Telecommunications Law No. (13) of 1995 was amended by the temporary Law No. (8) of 2002, whereby, the Ministry of Post and Communications was renamed as the \"Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MoICT)\". Also, the 2002 Telecom Law emphasized on the independence of TRC, in addition to entrusting the TRC with regulating the Telecommunications and Information Technology services in the Kingdom. In October 2002, 10.49% of the Jordan Telecom shares were sold in a public offering. In 2003, the Government Policy statement on the Information & Communications Technology sectors & Postal sector was issued, in pursuit of the implementation of Government obligations towards the WTO to liberalize the Telecommunications sector, which confirmed the government's intention to liberalize the fixed telecommunications sub- sector by the end of 2004 and put an end to the duopoly of the two mobile providers by the beginning of 2004. 34 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 54 In April 2003, XPress Company was granted the first license to provide Radio Trunking services. In late 2003, the TRC has published its Program for Further Licensing within the Mobile Telecommunications Sub-sector, presented pursuant to the Statement of Government Policy on the ICT Sectors and Postal Sector. In June 2004, the TRC published a public consultation on the future licensing in the fixed telecom sub-sector after its liberalization at the end of 2004. In August 2004, Umniah Company was granted a license to provide mobile telephone services. In October 2004, the Program of Licensing in compliance with the Government Policy on the ICT sectors and Postal Sector was issued, whereby the program clarified the two categories of licenses: individual and class, which will be granted to those willing to invest in the kingdom. In the beginning of 2005, the last stages of the National Numbering Plan were implemented in regards to mobile telecommunications services by adding a new (8th) digit and by unifying the code for all mobile services to be (07). In the beginning of 2005, the monopoly of Jordan Telecom Company in providing fixed telecom services was ended; and the fixed market was fully opened. In May 2005, Batelco company was granted the first individual license allowing the company to provide fixed telecommunications services. In 2005, (26) licensees were transitioned into the new form of Class license in accordance with the Integrated Licensing and Regulatory Regime. In 2006, Fastlink, Umniah, and XPress companies transitioned to the Integrated Licensing and Regulatory Regime. In June 2006, the government decided to sell its shares of Jordan Telecom amounting to 41.5%. These shares were sold to France Telecom and some local and regional parties, and the rest of the shares were listed in Amman Stock Exchange market. However, the sale process did not fully succeed, thus the government has retained 11.6% of company shares. In 2006, TRC issued the tender documents for the provision of (Fixed Broadband Wireless Access-FBWA) according to the Council of Ministers’ decision dated 12/9/2006, containing the approval of a \"method of General bidding\" for granting licenses for the use of radio spectrum in the area of Fixed Wireless Broadband Access Services. Later, 5 companies were granted radio spectrum licenses to provide FBWA Services . In May 2007, the Statement of Government Policy 2007 on the Information & Communications Technology & Postal sectors was approved according to the Council of Ministers’ decision dated 29/5/2007. In June 2007, the transition of non-class licensees to the Integrated Licensing and Regulatory Regime were completed the by the transition of both Jordan Telecom and MobileCom companies. In January 2008, the Government completed the sale of its Jordan Telecom shares. Such that 51% of company shares became owned by France Telecom, and the rest of the shares are distributed between the Social Security Corporation, the Noor Financial Investment Company (Noor), the armed forces and security agencies, leaving 7% available for exchange in Amman Stock Exchange market. In June 2008, TRC announced its intention to introduce 3G services in Jordan. Mid August 2009: TRC granted a third generation (3G) license to Orange Mobile Company. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 55 Annex 2 Limitations Roles of the Public and Private Sectors: A national strategy requires that both the Public and Private sectors work together to achieve its designated goals and to execute the defined activities. All the activities described in the National ICT Strategy are activities of national importance. Since the GoJ may no longer be actively involved in making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the telecommunications and IT sector to benefit from new telecommunication investments depends on the how investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment. For this reason, it will be required that the government enables the development and communication of attractive investment opportunities for the telecommunications sector, the IT sector, and the national economy to continue to grow and be competitive. Many of the actions require substantial financial commitment such as telecommunication infrastructure investment. With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector, such investment requirements can only be identified as opportunities. As such, they cannot be imposed on operators or investors. Therefore, whether such investments are actually made depends on whether investors/operators perceive the commercial viability of the investment. If the defined activities are not funded, then the objectives of the strategy will not be achieved. The public and private sector should consider approaching international corporations to invest in any opportunities which cannot be funded locally as well as jointly approach the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC) for donor contributions to help fund identified financial shortfalls in the strategy. As such, the responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those related to infrastructure, education and product and service development. It is the role of government to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to repeated private sector investment. Thus, the ability of the strategy to be implemented will be predicated on the ability of both the public and private sector to work responsibly towards its implementation. Role of Government Must Change: Although the Jordanian ICT sector shows much promise, the way in which the sector must be developed needs to change. In the past the GoJ was considered as the engine of economic growth. Most companies catered to large government consumption which was enabled and supported by external financial sources from donors. Since the late 1980s, donor funding has declined, yet many private sector companies still look to the public sector as the engine of economic growth and have not developed alternative business strategies to compensate for reduced government spending. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 56 Since the GoJ can no longer play the traditional role of economic engine (financier of growth) it must develop a new, creative and proactive role to attract investment (DDI and FDI) to update infrastructure and to facilitate economic growth. GoJ, as mentioned previously, should consider innovative licensing and partnership agreements such as BOO, BOT, BOOST, etc., as well as establishing localized technology infrastructure hubs such as technology corridors and techno poles. Moreover, GoJ should help support the private sector to develop export capability, possibly through the establishment of a single ICT focused export house, to help promote IT sales and IP reach into regional and international export markets. Moreover, the definition of national ICT should be revised to investigate expansion to include online mobile content development and outsourcing service (business process, knowledge process). Sector, support could be through provision of technical assistance to develop a category of IT marketing professionals well versed in designing and executing IT export plans which culminate in secured individual sales (through JEDCO) as well as support in identifying and attending international trade fairs (through JIB). The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) should investigate and adopt, wherever possible, advanced spectrum management principles, including but not limited to: a technology and service neutral approach to spectrum, spectrum reuse and spectrum sharing and the potential for secondary spectrum markets, except where these would be inconsistent with applicable international agreements or would create undesirable affects, and when and where market conditions allow. This is required to improve the efficiency of using spectrum which is a limited public resource and to encourage launching new services that will enhance and support the technical development and evolution of the Jordanian IT sector. Moreover, the smooth availability of new telecommunications technologies is likely to stimulate local telecommunications companies to develop and introduce new value added services in their service offerings. The development of such new value added services will in turn improve the competitiveness of the IT sector and improve the probability of IT export development and sustained job creation. Agile Infrastructure Development: Maintaining internationally relevant and competitive infrastructure (becoming/remaining an early adopter) will assist not only in providing new opportunities for the local ICT industry to grow but also can create opportunities for international operators and equipment suppliers to develop regional technical ability in Jordan. International operators can develop a competitive international/regional technical ability by utilizing Jordanian engineers and technicians. This previously happened within the ICT sector with Zain which regionally expanded their network by utilizing Jordanian engineers and technicians to install, maintain and launch GSM services in Africa, Bahrain and Syria. CISCO now has their largest technical assistance center established in Jordan using Jordanian engineers and technicians. Having access to Jordanian technicians and engineers will enable cheaper roll out as well as faster technology adoption in the region. Although the GoJ has started investment in the NBN, as a private network for the government, the investment is not complete. NBN initial scope was to provide easy access to E-enabled services. Although eight public sector universities, 643 schools in the Kingdom, 93 government JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 57 entities have been connected via the NBN, there exist more opportunities which have yet to be developed and exploited. The GoJ decided to invest in NBN prior to the development of mobile 3G technology. Although the private sector was invited to invest in NBN infrastructure, there was no private sector appetite for such an investment. This led to the GoJ undertaking the investment independently including the investment for the NBN expansion and completion. NBN needs to be completed independently by government or in cooperation with the private sector (local and/or international) and new opportunities to develop and launch new products and services need to be identified. NBN can be completed and technically exploited once service priorities have been identified. It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Sector Development (MoPSD), in collaboration with MoICT and other relevant government entities to set priorities with regards to developing the public sector and utilizing ICT for that purpose. Identified areas of priority for E-services will enable the GoJ to recruit private sector investment (local and international) and/or technical talent to deliver these E-services to identified stakeholders. How the GoJ and private sector (local and international) will agree to deliver E- services will depend on the proposed models (outright purchase, partnership, revenue sharing, etc.). Furthermore, the creation of focused, targeted infrastructure development opportunities through PPPs (BOO, BOT, licensing, etc.) by the GoJ will facilitate the next regional technology drive to originate in Jordan. This can be facilitated by international companies which are attracted to Jordanian technology pilots or demonstrators to serve Jordan and to build technical skills to serve the region. The GoJ and the private sector telecommunications sector should form a national telecommunications technology task force to determine how best to leverage existing national communication assets to deliver the desired national services. Such a task force could recommend to development of hybrid solutions building on available governmental and private sector capabilities. This type of technology intersections will be very useful in improving national technical capabilities as well as improving the robustness of the existing telecommunications systems. Company limitations within the sector: Over 99.6% of registered Jordanian companies (outside of the agricultural sector) are considered MSMEs 35 . Small size indicates that these companies have poor or non-existent corporate/company processes and procedures. Small size also indicates that it is difficult to bolster local ICT sector sales from local private sector MSME consumption. As such, there is a need to create and sustain export led growth. Since most ICT companies are MSMEs, there is a need to provide assistance to enhance their maturity, ensure their sustainability and develop sector exports. This will require Jordan 35 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 58 developing a national ICT identity which reflects the most common and dominant characteristics of the Jordanian ICT sector. The sector should consider establishing a private sector funded ICT focused export house which internationally markets and promotes the best ICT products which Jordan has to offer. The private sector could approach government sponsored funds (VC) and funding agencies as well as international donors to invest in this house. The export house would promote adherence to international standards on ICT products to be exported assisting local companies to develop and improve their current products and services. This will of course increase their international competitiveness over the long term. Currently, most Jordanian ICT companies develop products and/or services according to the intermittent demands of clients across many sectors. The discontinuous demand of Jordanian companies for ICT solutions has prevented most Jordanian companies from developing cumulative experience in any one particular sector (although they do have experience across multiple sectors). Companies are usually unable to build cumulative experience which could become a sustainable competitive advantage. Individual companies rarely productize their technical and sectoral capability. This means that companies rarely benefit from scale because they continually reinvent the proverbial wheel. As such, the ICT sector has fragmented experience across most companies. The sector needs to identify ways and means to identify and consolidate such experience to develop sustainable competitive advantage. CMMI and similar certifications across many companies might facilitate increased cooperation among ICT companies and improve harvesting of Jordan’s fragmented ICT capability to develop internationally sustainable national ICT competitiveness. Limited Labor: Jordan has large numbers of educated technical/non-technical labor. Since most established Jordanian businesses are micro, small or medium enterprises, the level of value adding which they provide is generally low. Many of Jordan’s educated demographic are currently unemployed because local companies do not need or cannot make use of educated or trained labor to add value. Although, specific low to medium value adding ICT sub-sectors such as call centers can supply job opportunities for this educated group, the reality is that Jordan’s labor force is small in absolute terms. More populated countries like Egypt and India will eventually displace Jordan, if all that is required are numbers of laborers. Because of this demographic reality, Jordan cannot focus on low cost ICT services like call centers only. National effort must focus on ICT sectors that are knowledge based, that have high added value such that Jordan can develop and/or maintain a competitive advantage. To enter in and maintain this competitive direction, Jordan has to work diligently and purposefully to build its education, professional training and certification capabilities to develop and maintain a technical edge in a few select verticals. Jordan needs to start in areas of traditional competitive strength and build cumulative capacity and capability through the development of intersections between ICT and these sectors:  Medical/Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals  Architecture and engineering JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 59  Higher education  Clean technology  Digital content  Tourism  Finance and Banking  Education JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 60 Annex 3 Turning Challenges into Opportunities Due to the intermittent demand for ICT products and services by the local Jordanian economy, the ICT sector generally lacks sector focus and deep sector knowledge, two key and necessary attributes of a competitive ICT vertical. The challenge of lack of focus arises because many Jordanian ICT companies start out as programming shops that develop competencies and marginal sector knowledge as intermittent opportunities arise instead of planning and diligently building sector relevant products, the company identity and deep sector knowledge. This may be because that most ICT companies are developed by ICT programmers, engineers and technicians instead of businesspeople. Fragmented Exports: Historically, the ICT sector has been tactically focused on maintaining cash flows instead of being strategically focused on developing, articulating and communicating deep competitive vertical knowledge in specific sectors. Most companies’ business and sales efforts have opportunistically darted between government procurement (traditionally the largest national consumer), intermittent private sector corporate needs and what medium and large enterprises see as being in vogue (ERP, CRM, etc.). Therefore, few companies have been able to develop cumulative experience in specific sectors or functions. This has led to:  No sustainable competitive advantage  No national identity which reflects national competencies or capabilities  No/few well-known companies, products or services Lack of diligent market focus has produced ICT companies with little company knowledge of market needs (companies wait for a requirement instead of being proactive and identifying what companies or sectors might need). This knowledge is needed to invest in developing products (reflecting a sector specific or functions specific focus) and to provide a competitive offer which addresses defined market/sector needs. Need for Long Term Market Focus: Jordanian ICT companies need to develop their skills to focus on marketing and market development (long term strategic effort) instead of being mostly focused on technical development and sales (both short term, reactive, tactical efforts). Only with a strategic and long term proactive ethos among ICT companies can cumulative knowledge be developed and contained within competitive products. Without such an ethos, knowledge is squandered at the company level and technical knowledge is continually reinvented when needed. This prevents ICT companies from benefitting from scale opportunities. This has led to most Jordanian companies not being able to build, demonstrate and communicate cumulative sectoral/vertical knowledge making the ICT sector’s identity and value proposition difficult to communicate. As such, the Jordanian ICT sector has been limited in its ability to articulate and communicate a defined competitive capability. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 61 Investment Promotion: The Telecommunications sector in Jordan has grown to a great extent because of foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI has been important not only for the investment which it brings but also for the operational expertise which accompanies the investment. If the telecommunications sector is to continue to grow and expand, the GoJ has to develop attractive investment opportunities (partially based on private sector input and initiative) which will continue to attract foreign operators and investors as well as facilitate local domestic investment. Attractive investment opportunities are based not only on the provision and management/operation of new technological infrastructure but also on the development and launching of value adding services. Investment in domestic IT companies should also be promoted. This can be done in cooperation with the JIB and INT@J, when a clear and competitive value proposition can be defined. A value proposition will be easier to define, defend and promote for investment when clear specialized utility can be demonstrated. This will be easier to do after successful intersections with other competitive economic sectors yield useful products and services. Attracting investment is not only an issue of identifying and promoting lucrative business opportunities but is also intimately related to providing and maintaining a competitive business environment. GoJ needs to develop a competitive investment policy for ICT and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Increasingly, many local Jordanian IT companies are relocating to more competitive business environments where laws and regulations are clear and equitably and consistently applied across all companies. Local telecommunication companies are also unhappy with the current business environment. This unhappiness will frighten off foreign investors from necessary and required telecommunications infrastructure development in Jordan. An unattractive and inconsistent business environment will prevent Jordan from maintaining a healthy and competitive telecommunications infrastructure will in turn will dramatically hurt the IT sector. Jordan needs to develop its business environment to be competitive on an international scale. Laws must be internationally competitive and equally applied across all businesses. Not doing so will facilitate greater migration of Jordanian companies, management and capital to more attractive environments. This will further increase unemployment and reduce exports, putting Jordan in an increasingly precarious economic and social position. Business and Investment Environment: Moreover, successful and sustainable sector investment (local and foreign) is intimately tied with competitiveness of the business environment. Taxation (direct and indirect), licensing and fee regimes need to be unambiguous, consistent and transparent. GoJ needs to publish how taxation, licensing and fee regimes are applied. This will prevent inconsistent interpretation by companies as well as government employees and provide a standard which the private sector (local and foreign) can depend upon. Moreover, publication will provide the GoJ and the private sector a reference to review and evaluate the Jordanian investment environment to maintain its regional and international competitiveness. This is extremely important for the sector, JIB and various business associations who will be responsible for promoting local and foreign investment to develop the sector. Of particular importance will be ICT and BPO investment. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 62 Once a stable and attractive investment environment secured, a strategic ICT sector investment plan should be developed between INT@J, JIB and the Chambers of Trade and Commerce which will highlight opportunities for local and foreign investors. The plan should identify target markets and potential partners for investment. Intellectual Property (IP) Recognition: The international ICT sector is an intellectual property (IP) driven and supported industry. Jordan has little IP registration and publication among its private sector ICT companies. There is a profound need to identify what latent IP already exists within industry, harvest what exists among Jordanian companies and publish the IP and product listings. IP publication will leverage the results of where existing ICT companies have been historically focusing effort (fragmented and opportunistic technical effort). IP publishing will help communicate and develop an international awareness of Jordan’s technical capability and competence. This should be predominantly driven by the private sector as they have the most to gain from IP registration. Regretfully, there is little awareness about the importance of IP registration and productization in the sector. There is a serious need to develop awareness of hidden and under promoted latent conceptual and technical assets. As such there is a need to create awareness among ICT companies and management about the importance of IP. Paired with awareness is also the desperate need for training which explains the procedure for IP searches and registration, including who and where such services can be obtained in Jordan (i-Park, law firms, etc.). New Paradigm is Required to Become an Early ICT Adopter: Historically, Jordan has been a regional technology leader and early technology adopter and adapter. Jordan was one of the first Arab countries to introduce mobile telephone in the 1980s with a car based MTS (Mobile Telephone System) system. Additionally, Jordan was one of the first Arab countries to develop television broadcast capability and one of the first to introduce color television broadcasting in the mid- 1970s. Jordan’s early technical adoption fueled consumption and technology adoption in other Arab countries, particularly the GCC. Jordan was among the first GSM adopters in the Arab region and one of the first Arab countries to enact a modern telecommunications law and develop a comprehensive sector policy. Jordan’s early adoption fueled the development of qualified and certified technical staff that would often facilitate regional technology adoption. Jordan’s consistent early adoption of new technologies was also fueled and supported by government investment. Over the past 20 years, Jordan has fallen behind in the early adoption leadership role. Jordan is no longer seen as a dominant source of technology enabling/facilitating labor/skills. As the government can no longer play the role of technology adoption investment engine, the relationship between the private sector and government must change. Government must evolve to become a facilitator for economic growth and technology adoption with clearly defined policies, defined growth targets and suggested national ICT projects (whether funded by GoJ or through partnerships) to support and direct sector growth. Instead of the GoJ being the lone enabler for procuring and adopting new technology (infrastructure mostly), government’s role must evolve to identify and create new market entry JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 63 possibilities, maintain an environment that is inductive to needed and new ICT infrastructure investment business opportunities for the private sector (local and international) and promote competition among players within the sector. Items such as the possibility of full foreign ownership should be investigated thoroughly. Also rules to facilitate the sharing of national infrastructure such as ducts, towers, etc., should continue to be adopted and new mechanisms for managing radio frequencies should be investigated and adopted whenever possible to encourage service providers to compete on service development. The development of new opportunities and increased competition within the sector will help build regional technical capacity for Jordanian ICT companies and long term partnership opportunities with local, regional and international operators and technology providers. Facilitating competition among operators (for example through policies which mitigate the effects of dominance and reduce the barriers to market entry) will increase competition among operators. Over the long term increased competition will facilitate the development of product partnerships between telecommunications companies and IT companies to develop improved value added services delivered over telecommunication networks. These services will of course also have export potential for the telecommunications providers. Convergence: Convergence can mean two things: 1) The convergence of ICT with different sectors of the economy and society (ICT and Healthcare/Pharmaceuticals, ICT and education, etc. ) and 2) it can be understood to mean the ability of different networks to carry similar kinds of services (e.g., voice over Internet Protocol (IP) or over circuit switched networks, video over cable television or Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) or, the ability to provide a range of services over a single network.36 For the purpose of this section, convergence will be related to point number two or the ability of different networks to carry similar services or the ability to provide a range of services over a single network. The reason convergence is important, is that communications legislation often limits the types of services which can be provided with a given license using a public asset (spectrum, fiber optics, copper, etc.) . The issue is that technological and service development is impeded through such licensing and legislative limitations. These types of impediments limit competition and therefore hinder economic and technological growth. Therefore, value added services delivered over any network should be open, if possible, to all network operators to facilitate increased competition among the operators Convergence is accelerating. Existing networks are modified to offer new services (e.g., upgrade of telephone networks to offer ADSL, alteration of electric power networks to offer broadband services, and the modification of cable networks to offer interactive services). Convergence is also possible with wireless broadband technologies. Different network infrastructures can now provide numerous new services. Cable television operators can now offer consumers voice, Internet access, and broadcast services over the network as a bundled package of services, and for a monthly fee. Mobile service providers may offer a subscriber data and video services, as well as voice services, and digital television (DTV) providers are offering interactive services. 36 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 64 Governments and regulators with limited recognition of the new opportunities derived from convergence will hinder investment, job creation and economic development opportunities. There is a list of issues which regulators now need to consider37: Issues for Regulators to Consider with Regard to Convergence 1. Does the regulatory framework facilitate the provision of different services over different platforms (e.g., technology neutrality)? 2. Does the regulatory framework support full competition? 3. Does the regulatory framework allow service providers to offer multiple services? 4. What are the regulatory policies for these new technologies and services with regard to numbering, spectrum, universal service, and interconnection? 5. Does the country’s legal framework contain the necessary legislation to support an ICT environment (e.g., intellectual property laws, computer crime, electronic transactions, data privacy and security)? 6. How much turn-around time and process is required for the country's legal framework to respond to future changes in the sector? The combinations of services delivered over the same platform challenges common perceptions about the most appropriate method to license and regulate ICT service providers. Historically, regulatory frameworks were designed when clear functional differences existed between services and infrastructure. These regulations are increasingly inadequate for dealing with today’s world. Regulators and policy-makers are responding to challenges presented by the ICT sector in a variety of ways. First, there is an increasing shift towards equal or technology-neutral regulatory treatment of different information and communications infrastructure. For example, the European Union (EU), India, and Kenya have introduced/are introducing, legal frameworks and regulations to regulate aspects of convergence through a technology neutral and flexible approach. Second, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, are modifying the structure of their regulatory authorities by authorizing them to regulate the telecommunications, broadcasting, and information technology sectors. Governments are now drafting and implementing new laws and regulations to create the necessary enabling legal framework to support the ICT sector. These laws and regulations deal with issues such as content, data protection, intellectual property, security, and computer crime. An alternative approach to convergence is to accommodate it within the existing legal and regulatory framework. This is only effectively possible in countries where there are no barriers to market entry or restrictions on the types of service being offered. Even though operators can, and do, offer multiple services over multiple platforms in fully competitive markets, it is a cumbersome process requiring multiple licenses and regulatory oversight by different institutions. 37 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 65 Spectrum Management: Spectrum management is the process of regulating the use of radio frequencies to promote efficiency and to benefit the society in general. The radio spectrum refers to the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz that can be used for wireless communication. Demand for services such as mobile telephones, mobile internet, etc., has required changes in the philosophy of spectrum management. Demand for wireless broadband has soared due to technological innovation, such as 3G and 4G mobile services, and the rapid development of wireless internet services. Historically, spectrum has been assigned through administrative licensing. Signal interference, particularly when using analog technologies, was once considered as a major problem of spectrum use because of technological limitations. As such, exclusive licensing was created to protect licensees’ signals. The practice of licensing discrete bands to groups of similar services is giving way, in many countries, to a spectrum auction model that is intended to speed technological innovation and improve the efficiency of spectrum use. During the experimental process of spectrum assignment, other approaches have also been carried out, namely, lotteries, unlicensed access and privatization of spectrum. Spectrum parity ensures a level playing field for operators and ensures that competition is based on innovation and service provision. In Jordan access to the radio frequency spectrum is the domain of the TRC. Much of the radio frequency spectrum has been released by TRC for commercial use, but much of the spectrum remains allocated for military use. As the demand for radio spectrum increases for commercial exploitation, there will be increasing demand on the military to release more of their spectrum allocation for the public good. Although improvements in frequency utilization can be achieved by going to digital transmission (instead of analog thus freeing up the spectrum for other uses ‘ “the digital dividend”), the high rate of growth of ICT opportunities will likely put pressure on TRC to attempt to release more of the available spectrum. This will require that TRC and the industry to come to some sort agreement with the military on spectrum use such that economic benefit from this public good can be maximized without compromising national security. The TRC and the military might be able to define a set of national security events or criteria (crises) in which commercially exploited radio spectrum can be temporarily returned to the military for exclusive use. ICT Security: Over the past few years, telecommunication regulators have been approached by market players expecting regulators to be increasingly involved in ICT security issues. Network and information security have always been important in telecom regulation, but the importance of security changes character with evolving technologies. Security related to current communication systems, including Internet, are broader than security issues when telephony was the most dominant service. Current information and communication technologies raise a large range of questions because Internet is a more open environment than earlier communication systems; wireless communication also raises new security problems; and networks and services are increasingly international, constituting new security issues. Today, societies are far more dependent on technology facilitated communication than before. Numerous societal, industrial and commercial processes and functions depend on efficient, JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 66 secure and well-functioning communication infrastructures and services. This relates to business- to-business transactions and interactions because they are increasingly conducted on networks and because business-to-consumer transactions/interactions are based on an increasing number of network-based applications. It also applies to residential and non-commercial communication. Seen in connection with the more open and thus more insecure communication environments, this is a significant challenge, where regulation has a role to play. To facilitate greater ICT intersection with the economy and convergence across media will require that the Jordanian national ICT system (infrastructure and standards) be seen as secure. Investors, operators and users will only rely on ICT if it is perceived and demonstrated as secure. TRC and the GoJ should consider adopting national standards for ICT security, which can be adopted and implemented by companies and operators depending on the standard of service which they will implement. This will require that the GoJ and the TRC communicate the necessity of security to the operators and users to increase their awareness and to facilitate increased ICT use in commercial and social transactions. Education, Training, Professional Development and Certification: A competitive ICT sector requires an educated, trained and certified workforce. The fast pace of change in ICT has put pressure on Jordanian universities to continually graduate individuals with relevant and useful skills. Poor agility in upgrading technical education to remain relevant and responsive to sector needs is a structural impediment to sustainable competitiveness. Many Jordanian universities have been too slow to modify their curriculum to maintain sector relevance. Universities have been unable to adapt their curriculum fast enough to keep up with sector needs. There is a pressing need for responsive and agile ICT HR development. This pressing need provides a business opportunity to establish a national ICT bridging program/academy, that would provide needed professional training in defined sector subject (technical) and functional (managerial) areas. Such a program/academy must develop a constructive and proactive working relationship with industry to help develop needed competencies in specified verticals and/or technical directions. It would facilitate and provide international certification in specific subject and technical areas. Agile and responsive HR development is needed to propel and sustain the ICT industry in a specific direction. MoICT and the Royal Scientific Society have recently launched a bridging program. The private sector in cooperation with IFC is working to develop a private sector driven bridging institute. The IFC is supporting the establishment of this institute. It is foreseen, that the MoICT led program and the private sector institute will eventually converge (merge) to serve national needs. It is deemed necessary that the ICT sector undertake the development of a bi-annual labor force study which identifies that various telecommunications and IT labor needs at a local and regional level. Such a study would help focus program and academy efforts to ensure that ICT professionals are provided with necessary skills relevant to market needs. INT@J could be tasked with this responsibility. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 67 Small/Poor local market: The Jordanian market is small and relatively poor. Many regional countries have larger populations and larger economies. The Jordanian economy is almost entirely comprised of MSMEs. MSMEs represent almost 99.6% of all registered firms (outside the agricultural sector38). Most MSMEs are owned and managed by the same individual. Most of these enterprises, at the start up stage, were composed of only the owner. Currently, 76% of them have at least two employees39. The small size of Jordanian companies (across most sectors and economic activities) means that these companies are unlikely to be able to afford investing in original (un-pirated) ICT systems and solutions. The companies are too small to have developed administrative and managerial systems and are therefore too small to benefit from implementation of ICT systems. Thus, MSMEs need to have access to technical knowledge in the form of management and business consulting to develop and implement systems within the MSMEs before embarking on an efficiency improving ICT system. Accordingly the ICT sector needs to integrate with the Jordanian management consulting sector to help develop relevant solutions for MSMEs within select Jordanian sectors. These solutions will not only provide growth opportunities for the local ICT industry but will also help improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the MSMEs across most sectors. Moreover, due to the small, fragmented and generally poor Jordanian private sector, any significant growth in the ICT sector is predestined to be export led. The ICT sector can use Jordanian sector experience to develop products and services to address needs in specific high value added industries for the ultimate purpose of export. These new products and services can serve regional markets and could be twinned with international vendors. Jordan should be promoted as a cost effective location for new product and service development to international ICT companies. 38 Jordan Human Development Report 2011, page 65: 39 Jordan Human Development Report 2011, page 66: JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 68 Annex 4 Where to Focus and Why Jordan has limited natural resources and limited market size. Most Jordanian companies are MSMEs. Limited local consumption does not provide adequate opportunity for growth. Because of limited market size most Jordanian ICT companies develop products whenever the private sector/client intermittently articulates a business need. As such, local companies jump from opportunity to opportunity to maintain necessary short term cash flow. Focusing on securing sales derived from intermittent business opportunities prevents developing deep knowledge in any single sector. Lack of deep knowledge and understanding prevents Jordanian ICT companies from developing cumulative sector specific knowledge and skills and thus developing internationally competitive technical skills. It is imperative to focus national efforts on areas that yield productive and sustainable benefits for target economic sectors in general and the ICT sector in specific over the long term. Developing International Partnerships: To overcome the shortfalls of a limited and intermittent local IT market, local IT companies should consider developing international partnerships with international tier 1 (Tier one companies are direct suppliers to OEMs) and tier 2 (Tier two companies are the key suppliers to tier one suppliers, without supplying a product directly to OEM) companies. This has already been successfully done on a limited scale with companies like CISCO. The development of multiple partnerships will facilitate global reach by local companies through the international partnerships. Infrastructure: Modern telecommunications infrastructure is essential to the sustainable and competitive growth of Jordan’s national ICT industry. Relevant competitive (cutting edge) infrastructure is needed to introduce new technologies and opportunities to the ICT community. New technologies and new opportunities facilitate innovation and sector growth/evolution in the sector. For Jordan’s ICT sector to be sustainable competitive and to be a sustainable export led economic engine requires that infrastructure be developed and maintained to remain relevant to the sector. Evolving telecommunications infrastructure provides an opportunity to develop technical skills (maintenance and management) in Jordan to serve international system/manufacturers and regional/international operators. For example, Zain, the first GSM operator license holder, used their Jordanian engineers and technicians in rolling out Zain networks in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Africa, etc. The cumulative technical experience of Jordanian companies can be used to assist regional and international telecommunication operators working regionally (GCC) and globally (CIS States, Africa, etc.). JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 69 Export Development: Export development is essential to developing sustainable economic growth and job creation. The Jordanian economy is too small and poor at present to fuel substantial economic growth. Exports to larger and/or wealthier countries are required to develop and sustain job creation, as well as sustainably improve company revenues and profitability. Jordanian ICT companies will only be able to export successfully if they are able to develop competitive products and services which have high utility for their intended target markets. High utility (added value) will allow Jordanian companies to charge higher prices with higher profit margins. It is for this reason that ICT companies are recommended to develop working relationships with Jordan’s most competitive knowledge sectors such that they can identify specific needs which can be addressed through ICT product/service development and incorporate the knowledge and experience of the targeted sector. Moreover, the ICT sector can also focus efforts on the development of Arabic language based digital content targeting regional export markets. Role of the Government (MoICT and TRC): MoICT and TRC need to evolve to become more effective and involved as facilitators of economic development. Despite the Government of Jordan’s recent fiscal and budgetary limitations, the GoJ needs to develop and implement creative ways to facilitate private investment in infrastructure development as well as the E-services such as E-health, E-government and E- education. The GoJ can implement concepts such as Build Operate Own (BOO), Build Operate Own Share Transfer (BOOST), Build Operate Transfer in addition to standard licensing. This will require the passing of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) law by Jordanian parliament. Since the GoJ and the private sector face financial limitations and constraints, GoJ should consider promoting localized infrastructure development to develop hubs of ICT competence through the establishment of local techno poles or technology corridors. The techno poles and corridors can be used as national technical development tools to create broad national ICT capacity and capability in specific sub-sectors (BPO, on-line digital content, mobile content, application development, etc.) in specified geographic areas such as what is currently being done with BPO in Irbid. An Amman based Techno pole could focus on E-education or online content for example. The creation of techno poles (localized infrastructure development) near an industrial estate would facilitate the intersection/diffusion of ICT with industry (manufacturing). ICT entrepreneurship within the techno poles or ICT corridor could be further enhanced if the techno poles/corridors benefited from the same regulatory environment as Jordan’s existing development zones regime. Such an intersection would help develop deep vertical knowledge within some ICT companies making them more innovative and internationally competitive. The GoJ through legislation and regulation has a tool to help direct ICT development in specific economic directions. For example, MoICT and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPW&H) and Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) could adopt after investigation existing, relevant international standards for smart buildings. Moreover, GoJ can investigate requiring that network conduits be included in all new road/highway construction projects undertaken by the MoPW&H as well as investigate requiring the incorporation of new cable arrays in the JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 70 upgrading/expansion of new electrical grids. This would improve the competitiveness of the construction sector and facilitate the intersection and diffusion of ICT into architecture and construction. Since clean technology is a nationally supported innovation cluster (supported by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation’s (MoPIC’s) National Competitiveness and Innovation Council), government legislation governing public and/or private buildings can facilitate the type of intersection (diffusion) between ICT, the Clean Technology sector, Architecture and Engineering sector, Healthcare sector, Financial Services sector, and Education sector to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, reduce water consumption and improve roof top based water harvesting. GoJ support through investment incentives (i.e. tax credits, certification investment tax credits, etc.) and/or Research and Development subsidies would promote the development of high value added ICT products and services which would increase the efficiency and competitiveness of some manufacturing sectors and companies. There currently exist a variety of GoJ managed funds (R&D Fund at the Ministry of Higher Education and the universal service fund (not yet functional)) which could be focused towards enhancing the intersections and diffusion between ICT and different economic sectors to increase economic growth, competitiveness and job creation. According to the R&D Fund bylaw the fund can be used to: 1. Fund scientific research and development proposed by Jordanian universities, public institutions and relevant private sector companies. 2. Fund overcoming challenges faced by Jordanian companies in developing or improving products and services which will increase their overall competitiveness in cooperation with Jordanian universities. 3. Provide financial support the utilization of science in scientific research to develop technology and promoting the results of such research. 4. Provide financial support to develop research and development capability in relation to intellectual property protection and patent registration. It is anticipated that these funds, while considering their original purpose and objectives, could also be used to direct telecommunications service development in mobile enabled services to serve E-government, E-commerce, etc. This will create development opportunities for existing companies in ICT (for development and export) as well as empower or create new and/or different business sectors in the economy. Great economic potential is hidden in existing national infrastructure. The GoJ sold the national land line network (copper lines) with the privatization of the Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) to a consortium led by France Telecom and Arab Bank on January 23, 200040. Although Jordan Telecommunications Group (JTG’s) exclusive rights of supply of fixed services ended on December 31st, 2004 and the telecommunications sector became fully liberalized, the Jordan Telecommunications Group (JTG) remains in effective control of the copper land line network. 40 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 71 The use of the copper lines needs to be fully unbundled allowing other operators to use what once was a state asset. This may require changing the regulations which govern public use of a national asset. Unbundling the copper will allow more ICT service to be developed and delivered to citizens creating economic opportunity for existing and new ICT companies. The GoJ also invested in establishing a national broadband network (NBN) as a private network for the government use. This national initiative was to bridge the digital divide among Jordanian citizens and enable the provision of ICT services (E-Government, E-Health, E-Education, etc.) to all segments of society. This enlightened investment was also to act as a tool to enhance the development and competitiveness of local ICT companies in such areas as e-education. Regretfully, the NBN investment proved too large for the GoJ to financially complete and exploit. For the local economy to benefit from the sunk costs of the GoJ investment will require that the existing NBN be completed and activated through creating bold opportunities for the private sector (local and/or international) to invest in, develop and deliver services to consumers (E- Education and E-Health, cable television, etc.) or by creating national large scale demand/usage for E-services (E-Commerce and E-Government). To start exploiting NBN will require identifying national E-Government, E-Service priorities by the government (Ministry of Public Sector Reform in cooperation with MoICT and relevant government entities), passing the PPP law (or at least agreeing on or adopting acceptable partnership models), arriving at acceptable revenue sharing models with the private sector and passing the amendments to the E-transactions law and a national privacy act. It is important to assess the private sector exploitation of NBN Partial or complete handover to the private sector of the NBN may greatly reduce or eliminate GoJ operational costs to run the NBN. This will free up public sector funds which can be directed towards developing new needed national infrastructure. Local demand for NBN services and applications can be enhanced through GoJ funding (complete funding or partial funding or through PPPs) for the construction of open access fiber optic networks. Moreover, MoICT in cooperation with the MoPW&H, based on investigation results, may require that network conduits be included in all new road projects. ICT Diffusion Economies and societies have become dependent on the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). Innovation, productivity and energy-saving, just to mention a few are key drivers of economic growth. Social networking, E-government and E-health are examples of the social use of ICT. The ability to provide products and services to a nation requires the existence of efficient ICT infrastructure and a competitive business environment which facilitates the provision of competitive and innovative ICT goods and services. Factors affecting ICT diffusion at the firm, industry and country level through different diffusion channels raises different issues for policy makers in terms of education, industry, competition policies and more generally the regulatory framework. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 72  Diffusion and ICT Infrastructure The pace of broadband growth has been exceptional over the past years. New developments resulting from the convergence of broadcasting and the Internet, the emergence of cloud computing and the eventual shift to “smart” infrastructure is likely to place further pressure on existing resources. Stimulating private investment to ensure that sufficient capacity is made available and affordable will be a fundamental step and will have several policy and regulatory implications. With the increasing use of fiber and the desire to expand the availability of improved broadband, network reach and capabilities, policy makers and regulators are seeking to stimulate increased investment, innovation and consumer choice. Following the liberalization of communication markets, competition has been a critical tool in meeting these objectives. The challenge now is how to ensure the benefits that flow from competition, will be retained and enhanced in the new environment ICT diffusion not only depends on the cost of the network investment, but also on the associated costs of communication and use. Increased competition in the telecommunications industry, owing to extensive regulatory reform, has been of particular importance in driving down these costs. Liberalization, and the competition it has generated, has brought many benefits to users. Prices have declined, and continue to do so in certain market segments, such as broadband  ICT Diffusion and Education Several factors influence the adoption of a new technology by firms. In particular a firm’s absorptive capacity depends on the level of cumulative and related knowledge. Education policies play a key role because education shapes the workforce with appropriate skills, enabling them to make use of new technologies. A good supply of qualified personnel is important, but traditional education needs to be supplemented with actions to foster lifelong learning. National policies aimed at enhancing basic literacy in ICT, at building high-level ICT skills, at lifelong learning in ICT, and at enhancing the managerial and networking skills needed for the effective use of ICT, are particularly relevant.  ICT Diffusion and the Public Sector In Jordan, the public sector has been seen as either the ultimate financer of scientific research or as the end-user of technology without any active role in the development of technology. Effective governments increasingly act as catalysts and coordinate technical resources for the benefit of end users through public technology procurement; thus affecting the direction and speed of technical change. The Public sector is more and more involved in the design, early experimentation and development of ICT applications for the benefit of a wide category of end-users, including firms, families and individual citizens. Improvements in the telecommunications sector are, for instance, a good example of the changing role of public procurement. A key role can be played by public administrations (ministries and departments) which are in a position to test new communication technologies and to develop advanced e-Government services interacting with both ICT suppliers/developers and end-users of advanced technological solutions. As an example, the integration of ICT in the customs clearing process has improved the competitiveness of several nations by facilitating a faster and less problematic customs clearance JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 73 process. The GoJ might consider engaging the private sector to develop required products at cost41. Additionally, the private sector might also consider cooperating with the public sector allowing them to cover part of the development to reduce product development risks, for the purpose of enabling them to develop and install products which have promising export potential. Such cooperation would enable the private sector to develop, deploy and demonstrate solutions which would have export potential in other countries and/or other application for other uses. Businesses, governments, consumers and key infrastructure all rely on the use of information networks which are often interconnected at a global level. This raises issues of security as these networks need to be stable and ready for safe, secure and reliable use under all conditions. Efficient and enforceable consumer protection is a basic condition to enhance consumer trust and require close collaboration between governments, business and civil society. But for any trust related tool or measure to be effective, users must be E-aware, and understand the protections afforded Governments can make the use of ICT more trust worthy by using ICT applications themselves. Tendering public services, providing digital public services, collecting taxes or procuring goods and services online can help increase government efficiency and enhance access to public services, while having the additional benefit of public confidence and strengthening demand.  ICT Diffusion and the Business environment The most important factor affecting continued ICT diffusion is the business environment. Governments need to reduce unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens on firms by creating a proactive business environment that continually promotes productive investment. This involves policies that enable firms to undertake organizational changes, that strengthen education and training systems that encourage good management practices, and that foster innovation (i.e. new applications). Moreover, policy should foster market conditions that reward the successful adoption of ICT; competition is the key in selecting firms that are able to leverage the benefits of ICT and in making them flourish and grow. Policies to foster growth in services are important as well. ICT offers a new potential for growth in the service sector, regulations that stifle change/innovation should be modified or removed. Moreover, competition needs to be strengthened. Competition not only helps lower the cost of ICT products and services, which fosters diffusion but also pressures firms to improve performance and change conservative attitudes.  Strategic Objective of ICT Diffusion Enhancing ICT diffusion in Jordan will enable economic growth through high value added product and service development, which leverages the energy and creativity of youth and Jordan’s educated population and the academic capability and capacity of Jordan’s universities and research centers. ICT will enable greater competitiveness in other specialized economic sectors which will help develop sustainable high value added job growth. 41 Result of consultation with the private sector on February 7 th , 2013 at MoICT JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 74  Pillars ICT diffusion There are four main pillars which foster ICT diffusion. They are:  ICT network Infrastructure  Education  Innovation  Business Environment Application Development: The national ICT sector needs to focus on areas where Jordan already has competitive advantage. There is an opportunity to develop sustainable national competitive advantage if the ICT sector intersects with numerous domestic economic sectors. Intersections and resulting sector diffusion will build symbiotic relationships with various sectors. This will allow for building and maintaining cumulative ICT linkages with these sectors. The ICT sector will improve its competitiveness by being able to integrate intimate technical knowledge into their ICT products and services. Participating sectors will also improve their competitiveness by having access to improved and more efficient ICT solutions. These intersections should be facilitated between the ICT sector and various competitive domestic verticals such as:  Medical/Healthcare  Architecture and engineering,  Pharmaceuticals,  Clean Technology  Agriculture  Tourism  Education  Banking and Finance (Islamic banking and finance is an interesting opportunity) Developing intersections will help ICT diffuse into these sectors securing and improving sector competitiveness. These intersections can leverage existing comparative advantages into longer term competitive advantages for the entire economy. This is particularly true with marginally competitive sectors such as manufacturing in Jordan. Once ICT companies intersect with different economic sectors, the ICT companies should focus on creating individual products (productization) instead of one-off custom software products. Productization requires investment and a long term outlook by the ICT Company. Investment will help secure the company’s cumulative knowledge in a specific vertical and will effectively demonstrate the company’s identity and capability. Productization will and allow for economies of scale to be established. New projects based on an existing foundation product will enable faster implementation and continuous quality improvement. Developing national products will also help will help define a national ICT brand identity. Business Process/Knowledge Process Outsourcing (BPO/KPO): Outsourcing has become an international business paradigm. International companies seek ways and means to reduce costs in their businesses. Recently Jordan has entered into the BPO/KPO JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 75 realm with several newly established companies serving regional airlines, international service companies and international IT companies (CISCO and HP). BPO/KPO represents an excellent opportunity for Jordan to integrate into international value chains. The fact that CISCO has one of their largest international technical assistance center in Jordan with one of the highest service delivery ratings for CISCO, indicates the level and quality of available human resources. Several Jordanian investors have established call centers to address regional needs and as such have attracted several regional airlines (Fly Dubai, Saudi (Saudi Arabian Airlines) and Emirates). BPPO/KPO demonstrates on the ability of non-traditional ICT applications to create sustainable jobs and exports by serving international business needs. Jordan should start with BPO (call centers, etc.) but needs to move up the value chain into KPO. Jordan does not possess the large workforce size as other countries (Egypt, India, etc.) which allow them to dominate the lower value added BPO/call center market. KPO leverages Jordan’s national investment in university education, allowing companies to develop and sustain competitiveness based on exploiting Jordan’s educated workforce. KPO will allow Jordan to maximize export service revenues as they provide higher value added services. KPO can be developed in small specialized verticals where Jordan can exploit and further develop its university educated workforce. Jordan can play a regional role with regards to call centers and BPO. This is largely due to the fact that Jordanian Arabic is accenting neutral (i.e. closest to classical Arabic). As such, the Jordanian accent is understood throughout the Arab world. The accent is a nuanced competitive advantage as it will allow higher cost Arab countries such as those in the GCC to benefit from Jordan as a call center or BPO service delivery location. This benefit has already been demonstrated in the Airline industry. The presence of CISCO’s and HP’s technical assistance centers in Jordan is a testament to Jordan’s KPO potential. This potential needs to be further developed and exploited by identifying likely verticals, developing and preparing the required labor force and promoting this capability regionally and internationally. Jordan can successfully enter the IT outsourcing domain through KPO. Jordan currently has one of the largest percentages of CISCO and Microsoft certified engineers, programmers and network specialists in the world (on a per capita basis). Talented individuals are the core resource for successful IT outsourcing. How Jordanian IT graduates are exploited is the domain of international IT companies and progressive IT investors. For BPO/KPO sectors to be successful, it is imperative that the BPO/KPO sector secures reliable, redundant and cost effective telecommunication infrastructure to develop this promising sector. Once competitive telecommunication infrastructure is secured and Jordan is able to provide competent and trained labor, FDI will be attracted. Currently, several Indian outsourcing companies are seeking to develop businesses in Jordan to serve the GCC market, because India does not have Arabic language capability. It is anticipated that the proposed export house will internationally market investment opportunities in the BPO/KPO domain. Digital Content: JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 76 Digital content is one of the exciting and broad areas for development in Jordan. Approximately 3% of all the content on the internet is in Arabic while the Arab world constitutes about 5% of the global population42. The Arab world is one of the most youthful global populations and one of the most likely populations to adopt new ICT technologies and services. Mobile phone and smart device penetration in the Arab world has surpassed levels found in many advanced western economies. Internet penetration is increasing but remains below western standards. Internet penetration will likely improve as mobile devices become a more dominant means of accessing the internet. Mobile devices have led to increased consumption of digital content in the form of mobile applications and mobile games. Many Jordanian developed games have found markets outside of the Arab world. The Jordanian developed mobile card game “Tricks” and “trump” have found markets in China and Russia. A Jordanian developed mobile educational application, won the World Summit Award for mobile applications. Thus mobile games and applications have regional and international market opportunity. The attractive feature of digital content is that it is a means for self-expression in all its aspects. Digital content can integrate story-telling, art, music, acting, programming, graphics, interactivity, narration, news, game design, virtual architecture, etc. to create complex, creative, high value added output. Therefore a competitive digital content sector can create sustainable economic opportunity for many individuals across many complementary sectors. Digital content can be delivered through traditional means such as television, cable television as well as through mobile devices and internet. Because of the common language, religion and culture, digital content has great regional export potential. Digital content development has the ability and opportunity to harvest the creativity of Jordan’s youth and leverage it to develop regional exports in the short term and possibly global exports in the medium to long term. Developing and distributing digital media can be seen to go through a six stage value creation process with the various stage defined inputs43: 42 43 Source: Arabian Business Consultants for Development, ICT Digital Content Report for Chemonics, 2006 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 77 Digital content is powerful because it can integrate the creative talents from many individuals across disparate sectors to create meaningful and desirable products/services which have a market of over 350 million Arabs in this region and more than422 Million Worldwide. This market exists not only because of a single common language but also because there is a shared, common culture and religion. Digital content is familiar and accessible (absorbable) to most Jordanians and Arabs, while pure programming is not. Digital content is an excellent platform for demonstrating the utility of ICT to a young Arab population seeking self-expression. Of increasing recent importance has been the growth of digital gaming in Jordan.

All the activities described in the National ICT Strategy are activities of national importance. As such, the responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those related to infrastructure, education and product and service development. The strategy also tries to make as much use of existing national infrastructure such as universities and training centres. It is the role of government to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to repeated private sector investment. Thus, the ability of the strategy to be implemented will be predicated on the ability of both the public and private sector to work responsibly towards its implementation. Many of the actions require substantial financial commitment such as telecommunication infrastructure investment. With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector, such investment opportunities can only be identified as an opportunity not imposed on operators or investors. Therefore, whether such investments are actually made depends on whether investors/operators perceive the benefit of the investment. Since the GoJ is no longer active in or financially capable of making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the telecommunications and IT sector to benefit from new telecommunication investments depends on the how investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment. For this reason, it will be required that the TRC develop and communicate attractive licensing opportunities for the telecommunications sector for the Jordanian IT sector to continue to grow and be competitive.

JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 102 Annex 7 Benchmarking With Select Asian National ICT Strategies: ICT strategies are effective tools in promoting economic growth. It is for this reason that Jordan is trying to develop and implement an effective national ICT strategy. The 1992 Nobel Laureate for Economics, Gary Becker, has pointed out that “from 1995 to 2000, almost all of the improvements in productivity (in the US) were either due to investments in information technology or advances in the output of information technology related goods”44. Becker also believes that the effect of the IT revolution is only beginning to be felt: “with long-term growth in output per worker estimated at a rate of 3 percent per year or higher for perhaps decades. Income per worker could double in 25 years or less.”45 The positive effect of IT on the economy is felt not only in the US but elsewhere as well. An empirical study on the Digital Divide indicates that a one point increase in Infostate (a country’s stock of ICT capital and labour, and their uptake and use) leads to an increase of anywhere between US$124 to US$164 in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP)46. If one looks at several Asian economies each at varying stages of development, one will recognize that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are seen to be instrumental in the development of countries. ICTs allows nations to achieve development goals faster and more efficiently. ICTs enable development in at least three key ways: 1. Enhance access to and creation and sharing of knowledge. 2. Effectively speed up the production process and facilitate financial transactions throughout the economy while reducing costs. 3. Connect individuals, groups, enterprises, communities and governments faster and more cost-effectively. The role of ICT in development is being increasingly understood. Currently, governments are focusing on improving their respective ICT infrastructures and addressing the ‘digital divide’ at the regional and global levels. A recent UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme reviewed of the ICT policies and e-strategies of nine Asian countries: India, Japan, Republic of Korea5, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. The objective of the study was to document the ICT policies (e-policies) and ICT strategies (e-strategies) of these countries and assess of how they are shaping their legal and regulatory environment to take advantage of ICTs as a developmental tool. To make relevant comparisons, the UNDP – APDIP study categorized the nine countries being evaluated into three categories: High Income (Japan, Republic of Korea and Singapore), Middle Income (Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka) and Low Income (India, Nepal and Viet Nam). For the purposes of this report, only high and middle 44 Becker, G. S. ‘The productivity boom is just warming up’, BusinessWeek, 20 Oct 2003, p. 16. 45 Ibid 46 George, S. Measuring the Digital Divide and Beyond, p. 87. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 103 income countries will be reviewed. High Income Countries: High-income countries stand out in this study because they have laid the foundation for ICT development since the 1970s. In Japan, “*t+he phrase johoka – usually translated as ‘informatization’ and signifying change to an information-oriented society – has been a slogan of Japanese government policy (since the 1970s)”47 . Singapore’s first IT master plan was formulated and implemented between 1980 and 1985. Korea’s first national computerization project was initiated in 1987. Japan, Korea and Singapore started the debate on the role of ICTs in development much earlier than the other countries in this study. They also developed and successfully implemented a number of ‘integrated’ ICT for Development (ICT4D) master plans – plans in which telecommunications and IT policies were not developed separately but constituted one coherent design. Japan The ‘e-Japan Strategy’ was a national strategy for information technology (IT) on 22 January 200148. e-Japan foresees a society “where everyone actively utilizes IT and fully enjoy its benefits”. To achieve this goal, government must “create an environment where the private sector, based on market forces, can exercise its full potential and make Japan the world’s most advanced IT nation within five years”. The specific goals of the e-Japan strategy are to:  Build an ultra-high-speed Internet network and provide constant Internet access at the earliest date possible;  Establish rules on electronic commerce;  Realize an electronic government; and  Nurture high-quality human resources for the new era. The ‘Basic IT Strategy’ (formulated in November 2000) preceded the e-Japan Strategy. The ‘Basic Law on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society’ (the ‘IT Basic Law’, enacted on 6 January 2001). The IT Basic Law calls for the “promotion of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, and providing stipulations on the development of a priority policy programme for the formation of an advanced information and telecommunications network society”. Japan launched ‘Towards an Advanced Information Society’ in 1995, which was augmented with a mid-term plan and action plans in 1996 and 199849. ‘e-Japan Strategy II’ was launched in July 2003 aiming to create a “vibrant, safe, impressive and convenient” society with the active use of IT. The new strategy proposes to implement leading measures in seven areas that are closely related to the lives of the people: medical treatment; food; life; small- and medium-sized enterprises; finance; knowledge; employment; and 47 West, J., Dedrick, J. and Kraemer, K.L. ‘Back to the Future: Japan’s NII Plans’, in Kahin and Wilson, National Information Infrastructure Initiatives, p. 66. 15 48 See 49 An Overview of ICT Policies and e-Strategies of Select Asian Economies, UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 104 government service. The strategy also seeks to advance the development of a new IT social infrastructure, which is essential for the sophisticated use of IT during this second phase.50 Korea The Korean government unveiled its fourth ICT master plan in December 2003, called ‘Broadband IT Korea Vision 2007’. The new master plan focused on improving national productivity and the quality of life through informatization. It strategy called for doubling Korea’s IT exports from US$46.3 billion in 2003 to US$100 billion in 2007. It also envisioned the commercialization of telematic applications, next-generation computers and sophisticated service robots. The strategy provided for the creation of a ‘Broadband convergence Network’ (BcN) that will increase data transmission rate by 50 percent and fuel the nation’s growth51. Korea’s third master plan, ‘e-Korea Vision 2006’, embodied the belief that “the promotion of informatization in all aspects of society would lead to increased effectiveness of all socio- economic activities, higher national performance, and higher quality of life.”52 Its designated objectives were to:  Maximize the ability of citizens to utilize ICT to actively participate in the information society;  Strengthen global competitiveness of the economy by promoting informatization in all industries;  Realize a smart government structure with high transparency and productivity through informatization efforts;  Facilitate continued economic growth by promoting the IT industry and advancing the information infrastructure; and  Become a leader in the global information society by playing a major role in international cooperation. Singapore Singapore has been a very proactive country in implementing ICT strategies. Singapore has implemented five strategies since the 1980s and is in the process of implementing a sixth strategy targeting the development of an intelligent nation. The interesting characteristic of Singapore’s strategies is that they have focused and almost uni-dimensional in nature. The first national strategy focused in computerization. The first strategy focused on computerization of the civil service, the development of the computer industry and the developing a pool of qualified computer professionals. Singapore’s second strategy focused on communications. The second strategy focused on the provision of one-stop=services through cross agency linkages. Integrating manual processes through the use of IT established sector specific networks such as TradeNet, LawNet and MedNet. Singapore’s third strategy focused on connectivity and content. The third strategy sought ways to enable everyone to access IT and envisaged the development of national information infrastructure which would evolve to become the world’s first National 50 Ibid 51 Tae-gyu, K. ‘Korea Aiming to Double IT Production by 2007’; 52 JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 105 Broad Band Network. The fourth strategy (at the turn of the millennium) was to dotcom the public, people and private sectors by putting the “e” in as many domains as possible. Numerous public services went on-line and many companies ventured into e-commerce. The fifth strategy focused on unleashing national potential and releasing capabilities by strengthening capability development, technology planning and improving the business environment53. Singapore is currently implementing ‘Connected Singapore’, the sixth strategy, with its vision of ‘infocomm’ (Information Technology and Communications) as “a key enabler, unleashing the potential of individuals, organizations and businesses to become more productive and efficient, and to create new ideas that enrich lives and produce new value”19. This, Singapore’s fifth ICT master plan, will be implemented through four ‘galvanizing strategies’:  Infocomm for Connectivity, Creativity and Collaboration – which aims to drive the development of an infocomm infrastructure for pervasive and secure access, promoting the development of useful applications for work, play, lifestyle and learning, encouraging usage of applications and services; and promoting infocomm literacy.  Digital Exchange – a strategy to develop Singapore as a leading global digital distribution and trading centre to create a new source of growth and extend Singapore’s hub status in the digital medium.  Engine of Growth – which aims to grow new economic activities and create jobs in infocomm, emphasizing opportunities that leverage Singapore’s traditional hub status.  Agent for Change – a strategy that aims to help businesses and government agencies use infocomm to achieve higher efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Middle Income: Countries in the middle-income group – Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka – have integrated ICT strategies as part of their national development strategies. The Malaysian government plays a more active role in promoting ICT development in the country. The Philippines has a more market-led approach. Sri Lanka, emerging from decades of civil war, is looking to use ICTs to develop its economy, alleviate poverty, and improve the quality of life and opportunities for all of its citizens. Malaysia The Malaysian National IT Agenda (NITA), launched in 1996, serves as the main policy statement on the development of ICT in Malaysia. The Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001), states that NITA provides “the framework for the systematic development of the country into an information and knowledge-based society by 2020”54. NITA’s theme is ‘Turning Ripples into Tidal Waves’. The ‘ripples’ are essentially specific initiatives by the government – such as the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) – that are aimed at providing the necessary environment to empower the people, who in turn are expected to bring about the ‘tidal wave’ of change55. The NITC, which is the apex 53 Building Singapore’s Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore 54 55 An Overview of ICT Policies and e-Strategies of Select Asian Economies, UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 106 ICT body in Malaysia, has formulated an NITC Strategic Agenda with five key thrust areas to enable the country to “migrate to the e-World of the new millennium”. These are:  E-Community – to enhance the quality of life of all Malaysian communities through ICT;  E-Public Services – to get the public, private and community sectors to collaborate on an ongoing basis to enable the provision of people-oriented, customer-focused services electronically;  E-Learning – to create and develop, through ICT, formal and informal learning networks for communities, with the goal of cultivating an ethos of life-long, continuous learning for individual, organizational and social advancement;  E-Economy – to oversee the optimal usage of ICT in developing a knowledge economy,  making it grow and become globally competitive;  E-Sovereignty – to focus on building a resilient national identity. It is envisioned that citizens and institutions zero in towards enhancing national identity, integrity and societal stability in the face of borderless challenges to the nation. The MSC is an important component of the Malaysian e-strategy. It is a dedicated 15 x 50 kmcorridor outside Kuala Lumpur that aims to attract global ICT companies to undertake research, develop new products and technologies, and export from this base21 . Conceptualized in 1996, the MSC was envisioned to become a global test bed for ICT applications. MSC was also envisioned to be the ideal growth environment for Malaysian ICT Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) seeking to transform themselves into world-class companies. To attract targeted companies, the Malaysian government committed to the following four promises: a Bill of Guarantees, world-class infrastructure, a suite of cyberlaws, and incentives. At the end of MSC’s three-phased development, it is anticipated that Malaysia itself would become one Multimedia Super Corridor. The Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998 also provides the following all- encompassing policy objectives:  To establish Malaysia as a major global centre and hub for communications and multimedia information and content services;  To promote civil society where information-based services will provide the basis of continuing enhancements to quality of work and life;  To grow and nurture local information resources and cultural representations that facilitate national identity and global diversity;  To regulate for the long-term benefit of the end user;  To promote a high level of consumer confidence in service delivery from the industry;  To ensure an equitable provision of affordable services over the ubiquitous national infrastructure;  To create a robust applications environment for end users;  To facilitate the efficient allocation of resources such as skilled labour, capital, knowledge and national assets;  To promote the development of capabilities and skills within Malaysia’s convergence industries; and  To ensure information security and network reliability and integrity. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 107 The Philippines In 1998, the Philippine government launched the National Information Technology Plan for the 21st Century. Named ‘IT21’, the plan describes the vision and strategy to leverage ICT to develop global competitiveness. It articulates the following goals and timeframes:  By 2000: the Philippines will have installed the infrastructure for every business, every agency of government, every school, and every home in the Philippines to have access to information technology.  By 2005: IT use will be pervasive in daily life. Philippine companies will be producing competitive IT products for world markets.  Within the first 10 years of the 21st Century: the Philippines will be a Knowledge Centre in the Asia-Pacific; a leader in IT education, in IT-assisted training, and in the application of information and knowledge to business, professional services, and the arts. A Government Information Systems Plan (GISP) was approved in July 2000 and adopted as a framework for all computerization efforts in the government (Executive Order 265). GISP was designed to create a governance system that will achieve: faster and better delivery of public goods and services; greater transparency in government operations; increased capacities of public sector organizations; and proactive participation of citizens in governance. The Information Technology and Electronic Commerce Council (ITECC), the country’s ICT policy- making body, defined its vision of the Philippines in 2003 as “an e-enabled society where empowered citizens have access to technologies that will provide quality education, efficient government service, greater source of livelihood, and a better way of life”. Its more specific goals are to:  Provide government services to stakeholders online;  Develop an IT-enabled workforce;  Develop the country as a world-class ICT services provider;  Create an enabling legal and regulatory environment; and  Provide affordable Internet access to all segments of the population. ITECC identified significant projects to be completed by 2004 for each of the five goals. For example, for the goal of developing the Philippines as a world-class ICT service provider, ITECC undertook the following projects in 2003-2004:  Setting quality standards and certification for individuals in support of IT services and IT- enabled services;  Implementing a sustainable ICT skills survey;  An International Communications and Marketing Programme;  Aggregation of IT services and IT-enabled services groups through an industry-wide portal;  Developing small and medium IT enterprises;  R&D programme for niche ICT products in Centres of Excellence; and  Enabling Capability Maturity Model for Software (CMM) certification for ICT firms. JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 108 The Philippine government created an e-Government fund in 2003. The e-Government fund amounted to approximately 4 billion pesos. Near half of the amount has been allocated to eight projects for various government agencies, including a portal for more than three million Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs); a national business registration facility; automation of import declaration; an e-library; and an e-government portal. The creation in 2004 of the Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT) as the government’s “primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, regulating and administrative entity… that will promote, develop, and regulate integrated and strategic ICT systems and reliable and cost-efficient communication facilities and services”, is an important recent development56. Sri Lanka e-Sri Lanka’s vision is to “deliver the dividends of ICT to every village, to every citizen, to every business and also transform the way Government works”23. Sri Lanka hoped to achieve this vision by 2007 through a seven-programme strategy. Programme 1 - Re-engineering Government aims to transform government business processes through the effective use of ICT, thereby making government more citizen-friendly and efficient. Included in this programme are efforts to automate proceedings and associated governing processes of the parliament; provide faster communication of documents between government offices; and encourage government leaders to use ICT in their day-to-day work. Programme 2 - Building Information Infrastructure aims to: Provide a modern information and communication infrastructure that gives user-friendly access to all citizens; establish a legal infrastructure that is internationally aligned; and Establish common standards for an information security framework and infrastructure implementation architecture. Some key initiatives under this programme are the establishment of a network of Vishva Gnana Kendras (VGKs or Tele Centres) throughout the country for ICT connectivity and access for citizens; the installation of two broadband Regional Telecommunication Networks; and the establishment of a development-conducive telecommunications regulatory environment. Programme 3 - ICT Human Resource Development aims to use ICTs to enhance education, increase the number and quality of high-level ICT professionals, and develop a computer-literate citizenry. The programme aims to build a workforce skilled in ICT use; increase the employment of graduates; strengthen teaching in primary and secondary schools, tertiary education and universities; and strengthen management and professional skills in the ICT industry. Programme 4 - ICT Investment and Private Sector Development intends to achieve major economic and employment growth in Sri Lanka by using ICTs to re-engineer the local industry and to improve Sri Lanka’s efficiency to compete effectively in the global marketplace, as well as to encourage multinational corporations to invest in Sri Lanka. Programme 5 - E-Society aims to facilitate and promote awareness, training and capacity building to empower citizens in Sri Lanka, to create a fair and equitable information society. This programme will promote the use of ICTs to empower disadvantaged /unserved groups. It will also facilitate the development of innovative ICT applications for social and economic 56 Executive Order No. 269, ‘Creating the Commission on Information and Communications Technology’, available at JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017) 109 development based on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and set up a fund to support such initiatives. Programme 6 - Technology Architectures and Security Standards aims to identify technologies, architectures, standards, security and privacy requirements of all programmes of the e-Sri Lanka initiative, including service provision, transaction processing and systems. It also aims to introduce the required technology and standards, ensure that Sri Lanka is adequately represented in international standardization efforts, and to promote research, development and excellence in the ICT sector in Sri Lanka. Programme 7 - E-Leadership and Policy-making aims to use ICTs at different levels of government, thereby ensuring that ICT promotion will be driven by the national leadership and a shared vision. How this relates to the Jordanian National ICT Strategy 2013-2017 Based on the benchmarking across the Asian countries above, it is clear that the Jordanian National ICT strategy must contain several elements to link economic development goals with ICT. Jordan’s most pressing economic challenges are those of unemployment and trade deficit. Both these challenges can be addressed by proactively facilitating growth in ICT. Areas of focus are outlined in the following table: ICT human resource development through professional training and certification. Continually developing effective ICT infrastructure to provide a fertile ground for new product/service development and delivery. Development of competitive ICT products and services facilitated by intersections with competitive Jordanian economic sectors. Development of the local business environment to effectively promote digital content development and convergence. Proactively develop exports and export opportunities for the sector. Proactively identify and promote investment opportunities for local ICT companies and for national infrastructure development. Communicate the importance of adopting/implementing ICT security standards as a means to develop trust. Aggressively and flexibly manage radio spectrum as a means to facilitate innovation and sector growth. Help create an e-empowered society by facilitating convergence through digital content development of frequently used e-government services.",

........................................................................................................................................ 109      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         6      Executive Summary   Jordan has traditionally been a regional leader in developing, adopting and utilizing information  and communication technology (ICT).  In recent decades, Jordan’s lead has decreased over  regional economies.  Since Jordan is a resource poor economy and economic activity has  historically been greatly based on international donors it is important for Jordan to develop  independent economic competitiveness to reduce/eliminate its dependence on external donor  funding.  In the particular case of Jordan this can only be done through the talent, creativity and  education/skill of its population.     The purpose of this strategy is to provide Jordan with a defined strategy for addressing areas of specific  weakness and opportunity for the purpose of improving the role of ICT in Jordan’s economic development  and job creation.  Robust economic development and job creation must be linked with exports.  The  strategy is designed to be aligned with the Government of Jordan’s Policy in the Telecommunications and  IT Sectors in its recommendations..  This document consists of a five year strategic plan for the  telecommunications and information technology sectors. It has been prepared in full partnership with the  private sector. The plan should be reviewed and revised biannually.   ICT provides a powerful paradigm for economic development.  Telecommunications  infrastructure is the means through which information technology products and services are  delivered to consumers (for local consumption and exports).  As such, telecommunications and  information technology are inextricably intertwined.  Therefore, an essential component to a  healthy and sustainably competitive IT sector is a robust, modern, responsive and competitive  telecommunications infrastructure.  Without proper telecommunications infrastructure, IT  products and services cannot be delivered locally or internationally as exports.  High value added  job creation is thus connected not only to the competitiveness of the actual IT sector but also to  the importance of a modern telecommunications infrastructure.  The economic benefits of  information technology cannot be delivered to the economy and society without fast and  competitive telecommunications.  It is for this reason that this document addresses both  telecommunications and information technology.     ICT has evolved into an internationally known language/standard.  A competent ICT professional  in Jordan can develop products and services which can be implemented in and have value in  global markets.  It is this opportunity which is afforded by ICT which makes it imperative for  Jordan to take as much advantage of this opportunity.  Being able to take full advantage of this  opportunity requires that the business environment be competitive with international  economies.  It is only in this manner that structural impediments can be removed allowing  Jordan’s ability to compete to rest on the abilities of its people.   As such, it is important that ICT infrastructure be continually maintained at the levels found in  competing economies.  Infrastructure provides a platform for new product and service  development and innovation.  Without infrastructure at international standards, the ICT industry  will be handicapped.  Many ICT companies may be developing products/services based on  obsolete infrastructure which will not find an application outside of Jordan.  These issues and  challenges are avoidable as exports are required to mitigate Jordan’s chronic trade deficit.  This  strategy attempts to provide simple and practical recommendations to improve IT, ICT enabled  and digital content companies’ exports as a means of increasing the sector’s contribution to the  national economy and to provide job creation opportunities.        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         7      Since the government of Jordan (GoJ) also suffers from a chronic budget deficit, it is imperative  that creative means be pursued to overcome the government’s inability to finance infrastructure  development.  As such, the GoJ needs to develop/promote modalities (BOO, BOT, BOOST, Joint  Ventures, etc.) in which private sector investment can be recruited to continually upgrade ICT  infrastructure and various required E-services.  This will require that Public Private Partnerships  (PPPs) be developed or negotiated and that commercial partnership and licensing models be  identified and agreed upon and promoted to upgrade national telecommunication infrastructure  to remain competitive with global norms.   ICT is a knowledge based industry.  As such, education, training and certification play an  important role in determining sustainable competitiveness and longevity.  Jordan already is well  known for its university system.  However, the university system is not agile enough to remain  completely relevant with the demands of the ICT sector.  The ICT sector needs to develop means  in which ICT graduates can continually develop their skills to remain relevant for local ICT  companies and to develop competitive products.  Training and certification can be done through  an independent professional development institute or cooperative existing training and  educational institutions in cooperation with international technology providers and international  operators.  The benchmark of a knowledge base industry is the industry’s ability to develop  intellectual property.  This strategy has provided a variety of recommendations regarding IP.  The  strategy promotes identifying existing but unregistered/unidentified/unrecognized intellectual  property concealed in existing ICT products and services and promotes registering them.  It also  aims to encourage local ICT companies to develop, register and promote and commercialize their  own IP.   Finally, the strategy covers the issue of ICT diffusion as a necessary requirement for economic  growth.  The strategy explicitly calls for developing intersections between the ICT sector and  competitive economic sectors like pharmaceuticals, Architecture and Engineering and Clean  Technology to identify issues which can be effectively addressed by ICT to improve the  competitiveness of the individual sectors.  It is through the effective intersection of ICT and the  individual sectors that diffusion will be facilitated.  Diffusion will be facilitated because developed  ICT products and services will have obvious utility to the sectors.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         8      Overview    Jordan was one of the first Arab countries to introduce communication and information  technology to the economy.  In 1921 the Department of Post and Telegraph (DPT) was set up. It  provided telegraph and post services to Trans Jordan Emirate In 1930, telecom services were  further developed as well as international links. The Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony  (MoPTT) was established in 1951 as the successor of the DPT. It was responsible for providing,  improving and expanding the coverage of post and national telephone services across the  Kingdom.  In 1971, the Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) was established as a Government  controlled entity responsible for the provision of various telecom services, including telephone,  telegraph and telex and for regulating them 1.      Jordan developed satellite communication links in the late 1970s and mobile telephone service  (MTS) in the mid-1980s.  International direct dialing was introduced in 1982; in 1989, Jordan had  one Atlantic Ocean International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) channel,  one Indian Ocean INTELSAT channel, and one Arab Satellite Organization (ARABSAT) channel2.    Jordan was also one of the first Arab countries to introduce information technology (IT) to  industry and the economy.  The General Statistics Department installed the first mainframe in  1968 followed by Cairo Amman Bank in 1969 and the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) installed a  mainframe in the early 1970s.  The RSS was also outsourced to do customer billing for the Jordan  Electricity Authority (JEA) and the Jordan Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) in the 1970s  and 1980s.  By the late 1980s banks and large industrial institutions (Phosphate and Potash) had  computerized systems and IT departments.  In the late 1980s, the national IT industry seriously  developing due to the advent of affordable and powerful personal desktop computers and an  increasing number of IT graduates.     Technical development and growth of the ICT industry was further enhanced by privatization and  liberalization of the telecommunications sector according to the timeline included in Annex 1.     The Jordanian ICT sector has grown tremendously since the late 1980s and early 1990s,.  In the  late 1990s, the Information Technology Association of Jordan (INT@J) was formed. INT@J Played  a crucial role in developing a series of national strategies (REACH 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.) and the last  national strategy was developed by the sector in cooperation with the Ministry of ICT.   INT@J  was the first institution to start gathering meaningful sector specific data.  As such, much of what  is in this report is based on data gathered and collated by INT@J.  Since the establishment of  MoICT in 2002, the ministry became more involved and enhanced cooperation within the ICT  sector by getting all relevant players involved and by leading the collective development of  sector policies.  The ICT sector grew in response to liberalization of telecommunications..     The sector’s initial reform requests were centered on deregulating the industry, lowering  internet usage costs and getting the government to lead sector development trough initiating E- education and E-government.  The E-Education initiative created an ICT subsector with export                                                     1  http://www.trc.gov.jo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=337&itemid=507&lang=english   2  http://www.mongabay.com/history/jordan/jordan-telecommunications.html      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         9      potential.  Three local E-education companies developed Arabic language based E-education  content, E-Education content management systems and E-enabled education management  systems.  The education management systems and E-education content has been successfully  exported to the United States, Oman, Bahrain, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco.      There have been limited successes with e-Government services development.  These successes  could be magnified if the GoJ is able to articulate and adhere to the e-government priorities  which they establish.  Government E-transformation is the responsibility of all government  agencies.  The trend in the international arena is focusing on the whole of government, Mobile  Government,  E-Participation, and Open Data.  It is imperative that that all government agencies  approach transformation in this context.     Information Technology (IT) revenues grew from USD 60,000,000 (local and export revenues) in  2000 to a high of USD 962,435,094 in 2008.  IT revenues declined from 2008, reaching USD  738,055,284 in 20113.  The greatest decline between 2008 and 2011 was in domestic revenues.   This decline in revenues indicates a delayed impact of the global economic crisis on the private  sector (locally and regionally) which started in 2007 as well as lower direct government spending,  and insufficient government involvement and leadership in creating economic opportunities for  the sector.  Exports increased slightly from USD 226,863,277 in 2008 to USD 230,528,961 in  20114 indicating increased sector effort on developing export markets and also possibly due to  the introduction of Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) such as call centers and  Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) as a new subsector.

The addition of new knowledge and/or innovation assists in  improving the efficiencies of company/corporate processes (manufacturing, marketing, etc.) or  developing new products and services to meet unmet needs or adding additional features to  existing products.  Adding value to existing products and services and/or creating new products  and services based on new knowledge enables higher prices to be charged (improved  profitability) or helps in displacing competing products or services from  the market (local and  export).    The inability of the local economy to absorb high value added products and services are related  to Jordanian corporate organizational capacity.  Over 99.6% of registered companies are  considered micro small or medium sized enterprises7.  The small size of most Jordanian  companies hinders the purchase of IT solutions.  A recent EU study8 has indicated that a nation’s  organizational capability, as indicated by the existence of mature corporate policies and  procedures within companies, affects a company’s/nation’s ability to absorb ICT effectively.  Jordanian Domestic IT Revenue (High Value Added =  35%)9  High Value Added  Low Value Added                                                       7  http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Jordan/Jordan_NHDR_2011.pdf   8  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/docs/eda/econ_impact_of_ict.pdf   9   ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 2011 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT), Page 24      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         11      Jordanian Export IT Revenue (High Value Added = 89%)10   High Value Added  Low Value Added    ICT sector growth over this period has taken place in new verticals that is more consumer based  than corporate based.  This has been due to the large growth of both internet but more  importantly mobile penetration in Jordanian society.  The increase of IT consumption by regular  mobile and internet users has fuelled non-traditional (technical programming) growth. This is an  indication of the impact of consumerization of ICT products and service development 11.   Moreover, the growth of ITES such as call centers and outsourcing has also created new  untapped areas for sector growth particularly in exports.       ITES services (call Centers and Business Process Outsourcing)12   Year Domestic Revenues (JD) Export Revenues (JD) Total Revenues (JD)   2011 375,311 4,556,999 4,932,310   2010 491,021 1,497,102 1,988,123   2009 435,000 1,881,608 2,316,608     The growth of ITES in Jordan indicates the ability to leverage existing HR skills and provide value  added services to domestic and export markets.  Because Jordan has limited human resources in  terms of numbers, Jordan’s demonstrated success has been based on going up the value chain  where greater and more sophisticated services can be delivered.  This developmental direction in  ITES will allow Jordan to extract larger revenues from proper use of its university educated  population.                                                          10   ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 2011 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT), page 24  11   http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/docs/eda/econ_impact_of_ict.pdf   12  ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbooks for years 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 (INT@J, Ministry of ICT) – accumulated   data from ITES tables and telecommunications tables.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         12      Telecommunications Revenues (Domestic and Export)13   Year Internet (JD) Mobile (JD) PSTN (JD) Total (JD)   2011 250,000,000 697,939,916 237,162,165 1,185,102,789   2010 45,784,944 668,812,200 125,543,976 840,141,120   2009 36,305,532 660,547,716 129,813,924 826,667,172   2008 No clear segmentations between Internet, Mobile & PSTN 920,341,232     There has been steady revenue growth in both internet usage and mobile usage.  PSTN revenues  have also grown between 2001 and 2010 albeit at a slower rate than mobile.  The growth in  these subsectors of communications indicates increased usage of ICT particularly through the  intersection/integration between internet and mobile telephony and particularly among regular  citizens/consumers.  There may be increased PSTN based commercial service delivery  opportunities for non-traditional services as traditional telephony migrates to mobile networks.   It is also likely that additional sector growth can be developed, if Jordanian ICT companies are  able to deliver meaningful services through the cloud.  The growth of mobile and internet among  citizens indicates the growing utility of applications for consumers (consumerism) which are  launched and used on these platforms (mobile and internet) in addition to the convergence of all  hardware types with the cloud.      ICT is already a common international communication delivery platform.  The development of  common programming languages, information technology standards (CMMI, SPOT, etc.),  telecommunications standards (GSM, 3G, 4G, etc.) and the proliferation of the internet is  allowing people from all around the world to create products, export and sell  and communicate  with each other.  Moreover, with the advent of the internet and mobile telephony and mobile  devices, there is now a global unified platform.  Products developed on computers and mobile  devices can be useful anywhere.  The only limiting factor is the ability to conceptualize and  develop innovative products which meet people’s or institution’s needs.  This to a great extent is  based on the creativity of the people in development and their understanding of the sectors or  needs that they serve.    Since ICT has become a common international communication platform, ICT professionals have  access and opportunity to international markets without the difficulties of traditional export.   Thus, the main challenge to being able to exploit this opportunity is identifying what issues  (challenges  and opportunities) need to be addressed in industry or among regular consumers  (local, regional and international) and develop innovative solutions to address these challenges  using IT technologies and deploying on one or more platforms.    In Jordan opportunities exist among a number of high values added industries such as  pharmaceuticals, clean technology, agriculture, architecture and engineering, medical/healthcare  services, tourism and content among others.  The ICT sector needs to identify specific  opportunities in these sectors.  This can be done by working closely with the management of  these knowledge sectors or with the consulting sector that are familiar with these sectors.  An EU                                                     13   Ibid      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         13      study14 has stated that educated knowledge based sectors will be more able to exploit ICT in  their businesses than non-knowledge based sectors making ICT diffusion easier.  This is to a great  extent due to the fact that knowledge based sectors are more likely to have developed  institutional/organizational capital in the form of developed and well-articulated policies and  procedures which are the basis for successful ICT diffusion into the sector.  It is these policies and  procedures which form the foundation for improved efficiencies in organizational management.    ICT opportunities also exist in digital content creation for consumers.  Jordan has witnessed a  jump in growth in this highly creative field because it is easily delivered by mobile devices and  the internet, it is easily understood and appreciated and because it integrates a variety of value  adding components (sound, narration, film/video, music, graphics, animation, interaction design,  acting, script writing, etc.).  Digital content has application on mobile devices as well as the  internet and has the potential for easy regional and international export as well.      Jordanian companies which demonstrate innovative competency in application development,  resulting from the intersection/diffusion between ICT and the specific industry vertical or digital  content development will be able to successfully develop and sustain exports.  Opportunities also  exist in the outsourcing sector, where educated and/or certified Jordanian workers can provide  value adding services to local and regional companies from call centers at the bottom of the  value chain to knowledge process outsourcing which leverages Jordan’s national investment in  education.                                                     14   http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/docs/eda/econ_impact_of_ict.pdf      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         14      Alignment with the Government of Jordan’s (GoJ’s) ICT Policy and Initiatives    The Statement of Government Policy 2012 on Communications, Information and Postal Sectors  focuses on the establishment and execution of policies to leverage ICT as a means for social and  economic development.  As such, the intent of this national ICT strategy document is to use ICT  as a tool to improve economic activity and job creation.  GoJ policy can be an effective tool to  direct national efforts towards local ICT use (diffusion), increased ICT exports and increased job  creation in ICT and ICT affected or improved sectors.  Moreover, effective economic  development can only come about if an effective and cooperative public and private partnership  is developed and maintained.      The GoJ embarked on several E-Initiatives (Education, Government Services and Health).  The E- Education initiative resulted in several local companies developing internationally competitive  products and services.  A local content management system and Education management system  was developed in and has been exported to the United States, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and  Syria.  Another local company has developed Arabic Language based E-curriculum for science and  mathematics.  This company has exported its E-curriculum to Algeria, Morocco, Oman and Saudi  Arabia, where it now is used in the education of over one million students.  This same company  has also branched off into mobile educational application development.  One of the most recent  E-Education applications has won a World Summit Award for mobile application development.    Growth in E-Education would not have occurred without Government leadership.    The E-Government initiative has resulted in less dramatic results over the past several years.  The  E-Government initiative needs to be aggressively reexamined.  The Ministry of Public Sector  Development (MoPSD) in collaboration with MoICT and other concerned government entities  shall set priorities with regard to developing the public sector E-services and utilizing ICT  infrastructure.   MoICT needs to identify/study new modalities with which to attract private  sector investment in developing and managing E-Government services.  MoICT also needs to  identify appropriate revenue sharing models to attract private sector (local and international)  involvement in developing E-Government services.  Successful development and launching of E- Government services will lead to the development of new ICT based products and service  management competencies which are likely to have export potential.     To enable the many important GoJ supported E-Initiatives, the GoJ initiated establishment of a  national broadband network (NBN) as a private governmental network in 2003 as a means to  make computers and networks more widely available to the public and to launch and enable (E- Education, E-Health and E-Government).  Due to fiscal constraints, the GoJ is facing difficulties in  completing the NBN project.  In addition, much of the NBN investment has remained unexploited  by both the government and the private sector.  To achieve the GoJ policy goal of making ICT  services more widely available to the public, GoJ will have to harness the financial and business  capability of the private sector (local and/or international) to complete the NBN and to make  effective use of this infrastructure.  As such, GoJ needs to identify priorities to be implemented,  identify/study cooperative modalities with the private sector and develop and continuously  communicate attractive revenue sharing schemes to increase private sector interest in  completing the NBN as well as exploiting its capacity for GoJ and private sector use.         JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         15      The GoJ passed the National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS) in  September 2012.  The main objective of NIACSS is to give structure and involve and empower all  concerned entities to more effectively secure computer networks they own, operate, control or  interact with.  This will strengthen Jordan’s information and Communication infrastructure for  both the public and private sectors.  This was done based on the knowledge that the national ICT  infrastructure needs to be robust, secure and trusted to have the desired positive impact on  national economic and ICT sector growth.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         16      The Strategy15    ICT provides Jordan with a unique opportunity to develop a competitive and sustainable export  oriented industry.  Jordan’s strategic challenge is to focus national effort and resources (private  and public sector) to extract the greatest opportunity for the country to create jobs and export  driven economic growth.  The national ICT strategy should focus on leveraging identified national  strengths.  Currently general national strengths are university educated labor, high levels of  literacy, and relatively good ICT infrastructure.  To maintain competitiveness in this sector, it is  imperative that the public and private sector work to ensure that education and ICT  infrastructure remain internationally competitive and improve.    Strategically, Jordan should focus on areas of established competitiveness and sectors where  value creation is possible through the facilitation of economic clustering and integration.  This  means identifying those economic sectors where Jordan has demonstrated ability over time to  consistently provide internationally and regionally competitive services or products.   Additionally, Jordan should focus on integrating and serving regional value chains as well to  improve overall regional competitiveness.  This can include sectors such as the oil and gas  industry, water desalination and management as well as banking and finance.  These are areas  where Jordan does not necessarily have established competency, but can develop a capability to  serve these regional market needs through such ICT services as localized content and BPO  development.      Over the past several decades Jordan has distinguished itself across several sectors.  These  sectors are:     a) Pharmaceuticals  b) Healthcare/medical tourism  c) Architecture and Engineering  d) Tourism  e) Information and Communication Technology (ICT)  f) Logistics  g) Banking and Finance  h) Education     The majority of these sectors are represented in the Jordanian National Competitiveness and  Innovation Council, a public private partnership, hosted at the competitiveness department at  the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC).  Additionally, Jordan must  develop technical competence in clean technology as well as design intensive manufacturing.   Both these sectors address pressing strategic national needs in terms of energy dependence and  water security (clean technology) as well as job creation and export opportunities (design  intensive manufacturing).  These sectors provide the ICT sector with a unique opportunity to  develop products and services based on their intersections.  Development of industry specific  products and services will help in national ICT diffusion.                                                    15   Annexes 1,2, and 3 discuss in details the current “Limitations”,  how to “Turn Challenges into Opportunities”, and   “Where to Focus and Why”.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         17        Integrating Knowledge:    Incorporation of knowledge into a product or service design is where value and competitiveness  is created.  Thus facilitating intersections between ICT and other sectors is important.  Moreover,  increasing cooperation between ICT companies and universities and research centers can help  integrate new knowledge in the form of R&D to develop new products and services.  This will  require that ICT companies and/or potential users of ICT properly define their R&D requirements  (desired outputs/outcomes) before engaging universities and research institutions.    The ICT industry, in cooperation with management consultants and process experts will be able  to identify opportunities and provide technical insight in any of the non-ICT sectors to develop  products and services which will meet a pressing, identified sector need.  Having a deep  understanding of sector challenges and dynamics is essential to developing a high value added,  competitive product and assists ICT to become a sector enabler.  Once ICT solutions are  developed ICT can more easily diffuse into the sector and improve sector efficiencies and  competitiveness.      Well-conceived and executed ICT products which address specific sector needs will improve the  international competitiveness of the ICT sector because individual companies within the ICT  sector will be focused on specific industries/sectors and will incorporate deep vertical knowledge  of the sector which they serve.  This is particularly true for products and solutions which serve  highly specialized and small markets where scale economies are difficult to achieve.  It is in these  markets that that Jordanian ICT companies can successfully compete.  Large international  companies avoid these markets because they are either small or the price for their product or  service will be uncompetitive and comparatively high.      Training and Education:    To maintain its international competitiveness, Jordan must address those factors which created  its current sector competitiveness.  Specifically, Jordan must develop ways to continually fuel  sector growth with talented, trained and certified labor.  The creation of a national ICT bridging  program is being pursued through two separate initiatives.  The MoICT in cooperation with the  Royal Scientific Society (RSS) has launched a bridging program.  INT@J and the private sector  (with IFC support in developing a business plan) are also working to provide agile professional  development, training and certification for ICT graduates and professionals.  It is envisaged that  both initiatives will eventually merge or combine at a later stage.    It has also been suggested by the private sector that Jordanian universities and private sector ICT  companies collaborate to identify model “CVs” for the different ICT roles needed in the  market/economy.  This can be supported by the ICT specific Qualification Framework intended to  be developed as part of IFC support to INT@J. The purpose of a qualification framework is to  provide higher education institutes, employers, present and future employees, training  institutions, and other stakeholders with a guide as to what skills and competencies are needed  in the labor market. Based on identification of the required skills and competencies (model CVs),  the private sector would then collaborate with university faculty/ accreditation council in  selecting the courses and topics required to develop the required skills and knowledge.  The      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         18      private sector might be required to participate in the education by providing training and  guidance.  Career counselors working at high schools can take advantage of these model CVs to  help students identify the most suitable career for their individual strengths and predispositions.      Infrastructure:  Jordan needs to maintain the competitiveness of its ICT infrastructure (national communication  infrastructure and private sector IT infrastructure).  There are numerous regional and  international opportunities which can be exploited by Jordanian ICT companies if they maintain  familiarity with new ICT infrastructure technology.  Training, certification and access to modern  infrastructure are required if Jordan’s ICT sector is to remain able to meet local ICT development  needs/opportunities as well as remain a trusted, regional ICT talent base.  It is the role of the  government to create new market entry possibilities and maintain an environment that is  inductive to needed and new ICT infrastructure investment opportunities for the private sector  which will help facilitate growth in the economy.      New economic opportunities can be created and exploited when existing infrastructure is fully  accessed and utilized, particularly when the local copper is unbundled.  Existing copper wire  infrastructure integrated with new technologies can reduce the cost of internet penetration as  well as facilitate new ICT opportunities.  Moreover, it is necessary for the GoJ to adjust regulation  and legislation, such as passing the E-transaction, E-Commerce, Privacy and Data Protection  related laws/regulations/instructions to facilitate increased ICT enabled economic activity (E- commerce, E-logistics, E-banking, etc.).   New economic opportunities can be more aggressively  pursued when the Universal Service Policy is revised and the Universal Service Fund is  established.    The GoJ invested in establishing a national broadband network (NBN) as a private network for  the government.  The intent of this GoJ initiative was to bridge the digital divide between all  citizens and to enable the provision of ICT services (E-Government, E-Health, E-Education, etc.) to  all segments of society.  NBN was also to act as a tool to enhance the development and  competitiveness of local ICT companies in areas such as e-education.  NBN’s required investment  has proved too large for the GoJ to financially complete and exploit.  To benefit from the sunk  costs of the GoJ investment, the existing NBN must be completed and activated through creating  bold opportunities for the private sector to develop and deliver services to consumers (E- Education and E-Health, cable television, etc.) or by creating national large scale demand/usage  for E-services (E-Commerce and E-Government).  Successful exploitation of NBN will require  identifying national E-Government, E-Service priorities by the government (in cooperation with  the Ministry of Public Sector Reform), passing the PPP law (or at least agreeing on or adopting  acceptable partnership models), arriving at acceptable revenue sharing models and passing the  E-transaction, E-Commerce, Privacy and Data Protection related laws/regulations/instructions.      The NBN or operational usage of the NBN can be transferred to the private sector (local and/or  international) for exploitation.  Partial or complete handover to the private sector will greatly  reduce or eliminate GoJ operational costs to run the NBN.  This will free up public sector funds  which can be re-directed towards developing new needed national infrastructure. National  demand for NBN services and applications can be enhanced through GoJ funding (partial or  through PPPs) for the construction of open access fiber optic networks.        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         19        Considerable part of the funding needed for the upgrade of existing communication networks  may be generated through the organization of a 4G frequency auction among interested  providers to obtain for example a 15 years license. Resources generated through the auction can  be allocated to MoICT for upgrading the communications infrastructure. This is common practice  in various EU countries (Germany, Sweden and the UK).  The United States and Singapore have  also reinvested the results of spectrum auctions.  Generally, these countries reinvested the  financial proceeds of the auctions in Science and Technology Development (including ICT), but  often governments provide the results of the auction to the national Treasury.  As such, proceeds  from any sale of a public good may be earmarked for infrastructure development (possibly take  on debt to upgrade national infrastructure and then allocate proceeds to cover the debt).    Export Development:    Export development is essential to developing sustainable economic growth and job creation.   The Jordanian economy is too small and poor at present to fuel substantial economic growth.   Exports to larger and/or wealthier countries are required to develop and sustain job creation, as  well as sustainably improve company revenues and profitability.  Jordanian ICT companies will  only be able to export successfully if they are able to develop competitive products and services  which have high utility for their intended target markets.  High utility (added value) will allow  Jordanian companies to charge higher prices with higher profit margins.  It is for this reason that  ICT companies are recommended to develop working relationships with Jordan’s most  competitive knowledge sectors such that they can identify specific needs which can be addressed  through ICT product/service development and incorporate the knowledge and experience of the  targeted sector.  Moreover, the ICT sector can also focus efforts on the development of Arabic  language based digital content targeting regional export markets.    Stimulating Investment:  The Telecommunications sector in Jordan has grown to a great extent because of foreign direct  investment (FDI).  FDI has been important not only for the investment which it brings but also for  the operational expertise which accompanies the investment.  If the telecommunications sector  is to continue to grow and expand, the GoJ has to develop attractive investment opportunities  (partially based on private sector input and initiative) which will continue to attract foreign  operators and investors as well as facilitate local domestic investment.  Attractive investment  opportunities are based not only on the provision and management/operation of new  technological infrastructure but also on the development and launching of value adding services.      Investment in domestic IT companies should also be promoted.  This can be done in cooperation  with the JIB and INT@J, when a clear and competitive value proposition can be defined.  A value  proposition will be easier to define, defend and promote for investment when clear specialized  utility can be demonstrated.  This will be easier to do after successful intersections with other  competitive economic sectors yield useful products and services.        Business and Investment Environment:  Attracting investment is not only an issue of identifying and promoting lucrative business  opportunities but is also intimately related to providing and maintaining a competitive business      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         20      environment.  Jordan needs to develop its business environment to be competitive on an  international scale.  Laws must be internationally competitive and equally applied across all  businesses.  Not doing so will facilitate greater migration of Jordanian companies, management  and capital to more attractive environments.  This will further increase unemployment and  reduce exports, putting Jordan in an increasingly precarious economic and social position.    Also taxation (direct and indirect), licensing and fee regimes need to be unambiguous, consistent  and transparent.  GoJ needs to publish how taxation, licensing and fee regimes are applied.  This  will prevent inconsistent interpretation by companies as well as government employees and  provide a standard which the private sector (local and foreign) can depend upon.  Moreover,  publication will provide the GoJ and the private sector a reference to review and evaluate the  Jordanian investment environment to maintain its regional and international competitiveness.   This is extremely important for the sector, JIB and various business associations who will be  responsible for promoting local and foreign investment to develop the sector.  Of particular  importance will be ICT and BPO investment.    Once a stable and attractive investment environment secured, a strategic ICT sector investment  plan should be developed between INT@J, JIB and the Chambers of Trade and Commerce which  will highlight opportunities for local and foreign investors.  The plan should identify target  markets and potential partners for investment.      Strategic intent:    ICT is a platform which will enable export led economic growth in ICT and other high value added  sectors, through high value added product and service development, which leverages the energy  and creativity of youth and Jordan’s educated population.  ICT will enable greater  competitiveness in specialized economic sectors which will develop sustainable high value added  job growth as well as reduce the digital divide between Jordan and more developed countries  with regards to ICT development and use.    Vision Statement:    A collaborative Jordanian public and private ICT sector that develops and maintains a fair  competitive environment that attracts and encourages further investment in the sector which  translates into the development of innovative, competitive (exportable) and affordable products  and services which satisfy customer needs enabling Jordan to be viewed as a regional ICT hub for  the development and delivery of competitive ICT products and services.    Mission Statement:    ICT is Jordan’s engine of economic growth and job creation through harnessing the energy,  creativity and talents of its educated youth to extend establish and maintain export markets by:    enabling local high value added (non-ICT) sectors to improve their competitiveness,    Exploiting and developing national infrastructure,    Developing international technical and business linkages and    Serving regional and international technology and operational needs.           JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         21      Strategic Objectives:    This strategy defines six major strategic objectives and a number of strategic catalysts that  expedite the achievement of these objectives.    1. Improve Business & Investment Environment by:    Enhancing the legislative and regulatory framework to increase competition,  reduce barriers to market entry, and to facilitate E-commerce.     Managing Radio Spectrum Effectively to enable the creation on new market  possibilities.      2. Increase foreign direct investment and bolster domestic investment by:    Identifying and marketing investment opportunities in targeted ICT verticals    Creating Techno-poles.    Promoting intellectual Property Development and Registration.    Supporting ICT Innovation Centers     3. Boost exports of IT and ICT enabled national products, services and capabilities by:    Facilitating intersections between ICT and other high value added sectors    Matching local products, services and capabilities with ICT export markets’ needs.    Developing a National Export House.     4. Maintain and develop a competitive telecommunication infrastructure to support continuous  IT sector innovation and to serve local and regional ICT markets by:    Updating local ICT infrastructure.    Encouraging Infrastructure and facilities sharing.    Facilitating private sector exploitation of NBN.     5. Develop agile national professional training and certification capabilities to meet local and  regional ICT sectors’ needs by:    Maintaining knowledge of what the ICT sector (locally, regionally, and globally)  requires in terms of skills.    Providing agile, sector responsive technical and managerial training to address the  needs of the ICT industry.      6. Stimulate the creation and development of suitable Arabic language and relevant digital  content that is accessible online throughout the Arabic speaking region by:    Accelerating convergence between ICT and innovative audio visual services    Increasing awareness among potential developers and users.    National Targets:      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         22      The National ICT strategy has identified the following measurable targets as an outcome of  achieving the strategic objectives defined below.    Target 2011 Baseline 2017 Target   Investment16 (ICT) 205 M $ 450 M $   Internet Penetration   (63% penetration – Q3 2012) 85%   Revenues17 2.Billions $ 3.15 Billion $   Employment (direct) 15,835 20,000                                                     16   This includes local and foreign direct investment in Telecom and IT.   17   This includes domestic and export revenues of Telecom and IT companies.       JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         23      Governance Structure     Executing the proposed National ICT Strategy 2013 – 2017 will require integration and  coordination among all relevant stakeholders to implement the recommendations and initiatives  articulated in the Strategy.  All of the initiatives and actions identified to implement the strategy  require the cooperation of often different stakeholders.  As such, it is important to subdivide the  responsibility of follow up on implementing specific objectives to the participating stakeholders  responsible for specific objectives as well as the defined actions.       Executing the National ICT Strategy is a complex undertaking.  It is important that a National Task  Force, a Program Management Unit (PMU) and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) be created to be  responsible for identifying, managing and overseeing the execution of highly specific tasks and  activities to achieve the strategy’s defined objectives.  The TSU will be responsible for developing  and preparing documents and studies which identify specific tasks and actions required to  develop the telecommunications sector for the purpose of facilitating economic private sector  and IT sector development.  Moreover, the TSU will work on prioritizing its recommendations to  direct the PMU to provide rational and studied guidance to the implementing committees.  The  PMU would report to the National Task Force which would be comprised of stakeholders from  the public, private and NGO sectors.  The National Task Force would derive its authority from the  cooperating stakeholders.  The private sector and public sector are jointly responsible for  determining and securing the annual funding requirements for the PMU and TSU and to jointly  contribute to the funding of both units.  The national task force is expected to be a voluntary task  force made up of relevant stakeholders who fund the PMU and TSU.     It is also the joint responsibility of MoICT and the ICT private sector to seek support to secure  funding for the execution of the defined activities needed to achieve the stipulated objectives.   GoJ support includes communicating ICT Strategic Plan objectives and activities as a national  priority when seeking international donor funding and technical assistance.  MoICT, MoPIC,  relevant GoJ entities and the private sector are likely to have to revisit the prioritization of the  defined activities and strategic objectives depending on availability of funding and define where  donor technical assistance can fill needs defined by the activities and objectives.  As funding is  expected to remain a challenge, it is likely to consider private sector commercial investments,  whenever feasible, to achieve many of the stated objectives.   Execution of activities and  achievement of objectives is directly related to obtaining funding allocated for specific activities  and/or recruiting international technical assistance for the same purpose.    Individual committees should be formed from the responsible stakeholders identified for each  strategic objective to oversee and execute highly specific tasks required for each strategic  objective.   Each committee would be responsible for delivering/achieving the required KPI’s and  would report to the Program Management Unit.  Committees should meet periodically (as  determined as necessary by the individual committees) to execute the specific actions at timings  that are agreed upon by the individual committees.  The committees would report to the  Program Management Unit regarding the progress being made in implementing the specific task  as well as identifying any potential obstacles that might be faced.  The Program Management  Unit will monitor, evaluate and report the progress and or obstacles to implementing the  National ICT Strategy to the National Task Force.  The National Task Force would be chaired by      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         24      the Minister of ICT and Co-Chaired by INT@J Chairman.  The Program Management Unit will  elect its directors based on the participating stakeholders.

Execution of activities and thus  achievement of objectives is directly related to obtaining funding allocated for specific activities and/or recruiting international technical  assistance for the same purpose. Annex 5 provides guidance to readers of the annual financial requirements to execute all initiatives and  actions defined in the National ICT Strategy. Financial requirements identified in this strategy are estimates. Actual requirements are to be  defined by responsible stakeholders prior to implementation.       All the activities described in the National ICT Strategy are activities of national importance.  While the majority of actions require financial  resources, the most substantial are related to telecommunication infrastructure investments. With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector,  such investment opportunities can only be identified as an opportunity not imposed on operators or investors.  Therefore, whether such  investments are actually made depends on whether investors/operators perceive the benefit of the investment. Since the GoJ is no longer  active in or financially capable of making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the telecommunications and IT sector to benefit from  new telecommunication investments depends on the how investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment.  For this  reason, it is the government responsibility to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to repeated private sector  investment and which enables the ICT sector to grow and be competitive by considering proactively all legal and regulatory implications.      Although the responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those related to infrastructure, education and product  and service development, it is the joint responsibility of MoICT and the ICT private sector to seek support to secure funding for the execution of  the defined activities needed to achieve the stipulated objectives.  Activities are to be re-prioritized based on the availability of funding as  funding is expected to remain a challenge which may hinder the achievement of the strategic objectives and defined targets.

JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         53      Annex 1   Timeline for Liberalizing and Privatizing the Telecommunications Sector   Technical development and growth of the ICT industry was enhanced by privatization and  liberalization of the telecommunications sector according to the following timeline34:      In 1988, a license was granted to Jordan Paging Company to provide paging services.    In 1992, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony (MoPTT) was renamed as The   Ministry of Post & Communications.    In 1993, Jordan initiated a national development program to increase the penetration of   telephony services from 7.8 to 12 lines per 100 inhabitants.    In 1993, the private sector was allowed to invest in telecommunications projects.    In October 1994, Fastlink was granted the first mobile cellular license in Jordan.    In 1995, The Telecommunications Law No. 13 of 1995 was passed, providing the legal basis   for reform. As a result, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) was  established.     In 1997, the Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) was transformed into a Government- owned company operating on a commercial basis, as a first step towards its privatization, and  was then renamed Jordan Telecommunications Company (JTC).     In 1999, MobileCom Company was granted a license to provide mobile cellular services in the  Kingdom.     In 2000, Jordan became a full member of the WTO. Therefore Jordan has provided its  obligations regarding the telecommunications sector within the presentations made to join  the organization, which included fully liberalizing the telecommunications sector by the end  of 2004.     In 2000, 40% of JTC shares were sold to a consortium led by France Telecom and the Arab  Bank, 8% of shares were sold to to the Social Security Corporation, and 1% to Jordan Telecom  Company employees.     In 2002, the Telecommunications Law No. (13) of 1995 was amended by the temporary Law  No. (8) of 2002, whereby, the Ministry of Post and Communications was renamed as the  \"Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MoICT)\". Also, the 2002 Telecom  Law emphasized on the independence of TRC, in addition to entrusting the TRC with  regulating the Telecommunications and Information Technology services in the Kingdom.     In October 2002, 10.49% of the Jordan Telecom shares were sold in a public offering.    In 2003, the Government Policy statement on the Information & Communications   Technology sectors & Postal sector was issued, in pursuit of the implementation of  Government obligations towards the WTO to liberalize the Telecommunications sector,  which confirmed the government's intention to liberalize the fixed telecommunications sub- sector by the end of 2004 and put an end to the duopoly of the two mobile providers by the  beginning of 2004.                                                      34   http://www.trc.gov.jo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=337&itemid=507&lang=english      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         54       In April 2003, XPress Company was granted the first license to provide Radio Trunking  services.     In late 2003, the TRC has published its Program for Further Licensing within the Mobile  Telecommunications Sub-sector, presented pursuant to the Statement of Government Policy  on the ICT Sectors and Postal Sector.     In June 2004, the TRC published a public consultation on the future licensing in the fixed  telecom sub-sector after its liberalization at the end of 2004.     In August 2004, Umniah Company was granted a license to provide mobile telephone  services.     In October 2004, the Program of Licensing in compliance with the Government Policy on the  ICT sectors and Postal Sector was issued, whereby the program clarified the two categories of  licenses: individual and class, which will be granted to those willing to invest in the kingdom.     In the beginning of 2005, the last stages of the National Numbering Plan were implemented  in regards to mobile telecommunications services by adding a new (8th) digit and by unifying  the code for all mobile services to be (07).     In the beginning of 2005, the monopoly of Jordan Telecom Company in providing fixed  telecom services was ended; and the fixed market was fully opened.     In May 2005, Batelco company was granted the first individual license allowing the company  to provide fixed telecommunications services.     In 2005, (26) licensees were transitioned into the new form of Class license in accordance  with the Integrated Licensing and Regulatory Regime.     In 2006, Fastlink, Umniah, and XPress companies transitioned to the Integrated Licensing and  Regulatory Regime.     In June 2006, the government decided to sell its shares of Jordan Telecom amounting to  41.5%. These shares were sold to France Telecom and some local and regional parties, and  the rest of the shares were listed in Amman Stock Exchange market. However, the sale  process did not fully succeed, thus the government has retained 11.6% of company shares.     In 2006, TRC issued the tender documents for the provision of (Fixed Broadband Wireless  Access-FBWA) according to the Council of Ministers’ decision dated 12/9/2006, containing  the approval of a \"method of General bidding\" for granting licenses for the use of radio  spectrum in the area of Fixed Wireless Broadband Access Services. Later, 5 companies were  granted radio spectrum licenses to provide FBWA Services .     In May 2007, the Statement of Government Policy 2007 on the Information &  Communications Technology & Postal sectors was approved according to the Council of  Ministers’ decision dated 29/5/2007.     In June 2007, the transition of non-class licensees to the Integrated Licensing and Regulatory  Regime were completed the by the transition of both Jordan Telecom and MobileCom  companies.     In January 2008, the Government completed the sale of its Jordan Telecom shares. Such that  51% of company shares became owned by France Telecom, and the rest of the shares are  distributed between the Social Security Corporation, the Noor Financial Investment Company  (Noor), the armed forces and security agencies, leaving 7% available for exchange in Amman  Stock Exchange market.     In June 2008, TRC announced its intention to introduce 3G services in Jordan.    Mid August 2009: TRC granted a third generation (3G) license to Orange Mobile Company.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         55      Annex 2   Limitations        Roles of the Public and Private Sectors:  A national strategy requires that both the Public and Private sectors work together to achieve its  designated goals and to execute the defined activities.  All the activities described in the National  ICT Strategy are activities of national importance.  Since the GoJ may no longer be actively  involved in making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the telecommunications and IT  sector to benefit from new telecommunication investments depends on the how  investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment.  For this reason, it will be  required that the government enables the development and communication of attractive  investment opportunities for the telecommunications sector, the IT sector, and the national  economy to continue to grow and be competitive.     Many of the actions require substantial financial commitment such as telecommunication  infrastructure investment.  With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector, such investment  requirements can only be identified as opportunities.  As such, they cannot be imposed on  operators or investors.  Therefore, whether such investments are actually made depends on  whether investors/operators perceive the commercial viability of the investment.  If the defined  activities are not funded, then the objectives of the strategy will not be achieved.  The public  and private sector should consider approaching international corporations to invest in any  opportunities which cannot be funded locally as well as jointly approach the Ministry of Planning  and International Cooperation (MoPIC) for donor contributions to help fund identified financial  shortfalls in the strategy.   As such, the responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those  related to infrastructure, education and product and service development.  It is the role of  government to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to repeated  private sector investment.  Thus, the ability of the strategy to be implemented will be predicated  on the ability of both the public and private sector to work responsibly towards its  implementation.     Role of Government Must Change:    Although the Jordanian ICT sector shows much promise, the way in which the sector must be  developed needs to change.  In the past the GoJ was considered as the engine of economic  growth.  Most companies catered to large government consumption which was enabled and  supported by external financial sources from donors.  Since the late 1980s, donor funding has  declined, yet many private sector companies still look to the public sector as the engine of  economic growth and have not developed alternative business strategies to compensate for  reduced government spending.        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         56      Since the GoJ can no longer play the traditional role of economic engine (financier of growth) it  must develop a new, creative and proactive role to attract investment (DDI and FDI) to update  infrastructure and to facilitate economic growth.  GoJ, as mentioned previously, should consider  innovative licensing and partnership agreements such as BOO, BOT, BOOST, etc., as well as  establishing localized technology infrastructure hubs such as technology corridors and techno  poles.  Moreover, GoJ should help support the private sector to develop export capability,  possibly through the establishment of a single ICT focused export house, to help promote IT sales  and IP reach into regional and international export markets.  Moreover, the definition of national  ICT should be revised to investigate expansion to include online mobile content development  and outsourcing service (business process, knowledge process).  Sector, support could be  through provision of technical assistance to develop a category of IT marketing professionals well  versed in designing and executing IT export plans which culminate in secured individual sales  (through JEDCO) as well as support in identifying and attending international trade fairs (through  JIB).    The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) should investigate and adopt, wherever  possible, advanced spectrum management principles, including but not limited to:  a technology  and service neutral approach to spectrum, spectrum reuse and spectrum sharing and the  potential for secondary spectrum markets, except where these would be inconsistent with  applicable international agreements or would create undesirable affects, and when and where  market conditions allow.  This is required to improve the efficiency of using spectrum which is a  limited public resource and to encourage launching new services that will enhance and support  the technical development and evolution of the Jordanian IT sector.  Moreover, the smooth  availability of new telecommunications technologies is likely to stimulate local  telecommunications companies to develop and introduce new value added services in their  service offerings.  The development of such new value added services will in turn improve the  competitiveness of the IT sector and improve the probability of IT export development and  sustained job creation.       Agile Infrastructure Development:    Maintaining internationally relevant and competitive infrastructure (becoming/remaining an  early adopter) will assist not only in providing new opportunities for the local ICT industry to  grow but also can create opportunities for international operators and equipment suppliers to  develop regional technical ability in Jordan.  International operators can develop a competitive  international/regional technical ability by utilizing Jordanian engineers and technicians.      This previously happened within the ICT sector with Zain which regionally expanded their  network by utilizing Jordanian engineers and technicians to install, maintain and launch GSM  services in Africa, Bahrain and Syria. CISCO now has their largest technical assistance center  established in Jordan using Jordanian engineers and technicians.  Having access to Jordanian  technicians and engineers will enable cheaper roll out as well as faster technology adoption in  the region.    Although the GoJ has started investment in the NBN, as a private network for the government,  the investment is not complete.  NBN initial scope was to provide easy access to E-enabled  services.  Although eight public sector universities, 643 schools in the Kingdom, 93 government      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         57      entities have been connected via the NBN, there exist more opportunities which have yet to be  developed and exploited.  The GoJ decided to invest in NBN prior to the development of mobile  3G technology.  Although the private sector was invited to invest in NBN infrastructure, there  was no private sector appetite for such an investment.  This led to the GoJ undertaking the  investment independently including the investment for the NBN expansion and completion.      NBN needs to be completed independently by government or in cooperation with the private  sector (local and/or international) and new opportunities to develop and launch new products  and services need to be identified.  NBN can be completed and technically exploited once service   priorities have been identified.  It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Sector  Development (MoPSD), in collaboration with MoICT and other relevant government entities to  set priorities with regards to developing the public sector and utilizing ICT for that purpose.  Identified areas of priority for E-services will enable the GoJ to recruit private sector investment  (local and international) and/or technical talent to deliver these E-services to identified  stakeholders.  How the GoJ and private sector (local and international) will agree to deliver E- services will depend on the proposed models (outright purchase, partnership, revenue sharing,  etc.).    Furthermore, the creation of focused, targeted infrastructure development opportunities  through PPPs (BOO, BOT, licensing, etc.) by the GoJ will facilitate the next regional technology  drive to originate in Jordan.  This can be facilitated by international companies which are  attracted to Jordanian technology pilots or demonstrators to serve Jordan and to build technical  skills to serve the region.    The GoJ and the private sector telecommunications sector should form a national  telecommunications technology task force to determine how best to leverage existing national  communication assets to deliver the desired national services.  Such a task force could  recommend to development of hybrid solutions building on available governmental and private  sector capabilities.  This type of technology intersections will be very useful in improving national  technical capabilities as well as improving the robustness of the existing telecommunications  systems.        Company limitations within the sector:    Over 99.6% of registered Jordanian companies (outside of the agricultural sector) are considered  MSMEs 35 .  Small size indicates that these companies have poor or non-existent  corporate/company processes and procedures.  Small size also indicates that it is difficult to  bolster local ICT sector sales from local private sector MSME consumption.  As such, there is a  need to create and sustain export led growth.      Since most ICT companies are MSMEs, there is a need to provide assistance to enhance their  maturity, ensure their sustainability and develop sector exports.  This will require Jordan                                                     35   http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Jordan/Jordan_NHDR_2011.pdf      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         58      developing a national ICT identity which reflects the most common and dominant characteristics  of the Jordanian ICT sector.  The sector should consider establishing a private sector funded ICT  focused export house which internationally markets and promotes the best ICT products which  Jordan has to offer.  The private sector could approach government sponsored funds (VC) and  funding agencies as well as international donors to invest in this house.  The export house would  promote adherence to international standards on ICT products to be exported assisting local  companies to develop and improve their current products and services.  This will of course  increase their international competitiveness over the long term.    Currently, most Jordanian ICT companies develop products and/or services according to the  intermittent demands of clients across many sectors.  The discontinuous demand of Jordanian  companies for ICT solutions has prevented most Jordanian companies from developing  cumulative experience in any one particular sector (although they do have experience across  multiple sectors).  Companies are usually unable to build cumulative experience which could  become a sustainable competitive advantage.      Individual companies rarely productize their technical and sectoral capability.  This means that  companies rarely benefit from scale because they continually reinvent the proverbial wheel.  As  such, the ICT sector has fragmented experience across most companies.  The sector needs to  identify ways and means to identify and consolidate such experience to develop sustainable  competitive advantage.  CMMI and similar certifications across many companies might facilitate  increased cooperation among ICT companies and improve harvesting of Jordan’s fragmented ICT  capability to develop internationally sustainable national ICT competitiveness.    Limited Labor:    Jordan has large numbers of educated technical/non-technical labor.  Since most established  Jordanian businesses are micro, small or medium enterprises, the level of value adding which  they provide is generally low.  Many of Jordan’s educated demographic are currently  unemployed because local companies do not need or cannot make use of educated or trained  labor to add value.    Although, specific low to medium value adding ICT sub-sectors such as call  centers can supply job opportunities for this educated group, the reality is that Jordan’s labor  force is small in absolute terms.  More populated countries like Egypt and India will eventually  displace Jordan, if all that is required are numbers of laborers.  Because of this demographic  reality, Jordan cannot focus on low cost ICT services like call centers only.  National effort must  focus on ICT sectors that are knowledge based, that have high added value such that Jordan can  develop and/or maintain a competitive advantage.      To enter in and maintain this competitive direction, Jordan has to work diligently and  purposefully to build its education, professional training and certification capabilities to develop  and maintain a technical edge in a few select verticals.  Jordan needs to start in areas of  traditional competitive strength and build cumulative capacity and capability through the  development of intersections between ICT and these sectors:      Medical/Healthcare    Pharmaceuticals    Architecture and engineering      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         59       Higher education    Clean technology    Digital content    Tourism    Finance and Banking    Education      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         60      Annex 3   Turning Challenges into Opportunities    Due to the intermittent demand for ICT products and services by the local Jordanian economy,  the ICT sector generally lacks sector focus and deep sector knowledge, two key and necessary  attributes of a competitive ICT vertical.  The challenge of lack of focus arises because many  Jordanian ICT companies start out as programming shops that develop competencies and  marginal sector knowledge as intermittent opportunities arise instead of planning and diligently  building sector relevant products, the company identity and deep sector knowledge.  This may be  because that most ICT companies are developed by ICT programmers, engineers and technicians  instead of businesspeople.      Fragmented Exports:    Historically, the ICT sector has been tactically focused on maintaining cash flows instead of being  strategically focused on developing, articulating and communicating deep competitive vertical  knowledge in specific sectors.  Most companies’ business and sales efforts have opportunistically  darted between government procurement (traditionally the largest national consumer),  intermittent private sector corporate needs and what medium and large enterprises see as being  in vogue (ERP, CRM, etc.).  Therefore, few companies have been able to develop cumulative  experience in specific sectors or functions.  This has led to:      No sustainable competitive advantage    No national identity which reflects national competencies or capabilities    No/few well-known companies, products or services    Lack of diligent market focus has produced ICT companies with little company knowledge of  market needs (companies wait for a requirement instead of being proactive and identifying what  companies or sectors might need).  This knowledge is needed to invest in developing products  (reflecting a sector specific or functions specific focus) and to provide a competitive offer which  addresses defined market/sector needs.    Need for Long Term Market Focus:    Jordanian ICT companies need to develop their skills to focus on marketing and market  development (long term strategic effort) instead of being mostly focused on technical  development and sales (both short term, reactive, tactical efforts).  Only with a strategic and long  term proactive ethos among ICT companies can cumulative knowledge be developed and  contained within competitive products. Without such an ethos, knowledge is squandered at the  company level and technical knowledge is continually reinvented when needed.  This prevents  ICT companies from benefitting from scale opportunities.  This has led to most Jordanian  companies not being able to build, demonstrate and communicate cumulative sectoral/vertical  knowledge making the ICT sector’s identity and value proposition difficult to communicate.  As  such, the Jordanian ICT sector has been limited in its ability to articulate and communicate a  defined competitive capability.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         61        Investment Promotion:  The Telecommunications sector in Jordan has grown to a great extent because of foreign direct  investment (FDI).  FDI has been important not only for the investment which it brings but also for  the operational expertise which accompanies the investment.  If the telecommunications sector  is to continue to grow and expand, the GoJ has to develop attractive investment opportunities  (partially based on private sector input and initiative) which will continue to attract foreign  operators and investors as well as facilitate local domestic investment.  Attractive investment  opportunities are based not only on the provision and management/operation of new  technological infrastructure but also on the development and launching of value adding services.      Investment in domestic IT companies should also be promoted.  This can be done in cooperation  with the JIB and INT@J, when a clear and competitive value proposition can be defined.  A value  proposition will be easier to define, defend and promote for investment when clear specialized  utility can be demonstrated.  This will be easier to do after successful intersections with other  competitive economic sectors yield useful products and services.      Attracting investment is not only an issue of identifying and promoting lucrative business  opportunities but is also intimately related to providing and maintaining a competitive business  environment.  GoJ needs to develop a competitive investment policy for ICT and Business Process  Outsourcing (BPO).  Increasingly, many local Jordanian IT companies are relocating to more  competitive business environments where laws and regulations are clear and equitably and  consistently applied across all companies.  Local telecommunication companies are also unhappy  with the current business environment.  This unhappiness will frighten off foreign investors from  necessary and required telecommunications infrastructure development in Jordan.  An  unattractive and inconsistent business environment will prevent Jordan from maintaining a  healthy and competitive telecommunications infrastructure will in turn will dramatically hurt the  IT sector.    Jordan needs to develop its business environment to be competitive on an international scale.   Laws must be internationally competitive and equally applied across all businesses.  Not doing so  will facilitate greater migration of Jordanian companies, management and capital to more  attractive environments.  This will further increase unemployment and reduce exports, putting  Jordan in an increasingly precarious economic and social position.    Business and Investment Environment:  Moreover, successful and sustainable sector investment (local and foreign) is intimately tied with  competitiveness of the business environment.  Taxation (direct and indirect), licensing and fee  regimes need to be unambiguous, consistent and transparent.  GoJ needs to publish how  taxation, licensing and fee regimes are applied.  This will prevent inconsistent interpretation by  companies as well as government employees and provide a standard which the private sector  (local and foreign) can depend upon.  Moreover, publication will provide the GoJ and the private  sector a reference to review and evaluate the Jordanian investment environment to maintain its  regional and international competitiveness.  This is extremely important for the sector, JIB and  various business associations who will be responsible for promoting local and foreign investment  to develop the sector.  Of particular importance will be ICT and BPO investment.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         62        Once a stable and attractive investment environment secured, a strategic ICT sector investment  plan should be developed between INT@J, JIB and the Chambers of Trade and Commerce which  will highlight opportunities for local and foreign investors.  The plan should identify target  markets and potential partners for investment.     Intellectual Property  (IP) Recognition:    The international ICT sector is an intellectual property (IP) driven and supported industry.  Jordan  has little IP registration and publication among its private sector ICT companies.  There is a  profound need to identify what latent IP already exists within industry, harvest what exists  among Jordanian companies and publish the IP and product listings.  IP publication will leverage  the results of where existing ICT companies have been historically focusing effort (fragmented  and opportunistic technical effort).  IP publishing will help communicate and develop an  international awareness of Jordan’s technical capability and competence.  This should be  predominantly driven by the private sector as they have the most to gain from IP registration.    Regretfully, there is little awareness about the importance of IP registration and productization  in the sector.  There is a serious need to develop awareness of hidden and under promoted  latent conceptual and technical assets.  As such there is a need to create awareness among ICT  companies and management about the importance of IP.  Paired with awareness is also the  desperate need for training which explains the procedure for IP searches and registration,  including who and where such services can be obtained in Jordan (i-Park, law firms, etc.).    New Paradigm is Required to Become an Early ICT Adopter:    Historically, Jordan has been a regional technology leader and early technology adopter and  adapter.  Jordan was one of the first Arab countries to introduce mobile telephone in the 1980s  with a car based MTS (Mobile Telephone System) system.  Additionally, Jordan was one of the  first Arab countries to develop television broadcast capability and one of the first to introduce  color television broadcasting in the mid- 1970s. Jordan’s early technical adoption fueled  consumption and technology adoption in other Arab countries, particularly the GCC.  Jordan was  among the first GSM adopters in the Arab region and one of the first Arab countries to enact a  modern telecommunications law and develop a comprehensive sector policy.   Jordan’s early  adoption fueled the development of qualified and certified technical staff that would often  facilitate regional technology adoption.  Jordan’s consistent early adoption of new technologies  was also fueled and supported by government investment.    Over the past 20 years, Jordan has fallen behind in the early adoption leadership role.  Jordan is  no longer seen as a dominant source of technology enabling/facilitating labor/skills.  As the  government can no longer play the role of technology adoption investment engine, the  relationship between the private sector and government must change.  Government must evolve  to become a facilitator for economic growth and technology adoption with clearly defined  policies, defined growth targets and suggested national ICT projects (whether funded by GoJ or  through partnerships) to support and direct sector growth.    Instead of the GoJ being the lone enabler for procuring and adopting new technology  (infrastructure mostly), government’s role must evolve to identify and create new market entry      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         63      possibilities, maintain an environment that is inductive to  needed and new ICT infrastructure  investment business opportunities for the private sector (local and international) and promote  competition among players within the sector.  Items such as the possibility of full foreign  ownership should be investigated thoroughly. Also rules to facilitate the sharing of national  infrastructure such as ducts, towers, etc., should continue to be adopted and new mechanisms  for managing radio frequencies should be investigated and adopted whenever possible to  encourage service providers to compete on service development.  The development of new  opportunities and increased competition within the sector will help build regional technical  capacity for Jordanian ICT companies and long term partnership opportunities with local,  regional and international operators and technology providers.  Facilitating competition among  operators (for example through policies which mitigate the effects of dominance and reduce the  barriers to market entry) will increase competition among operators.  Over the long term  increased competition will facilitate the development of product partnerships between  telecommunications companies and IT companies to develop improved value added services  delivered over telecommunication networks.  These services will of course also have export  potential for the telecommunications providers.    Convergence:  Convergence can mean two things:  1) The convergence of ICT with different sectors of the  economy and society (ICT and Healthcare/Pharmaceuticals, ICT and education, etc. ) and 2) it can  be understood to mean the ability of different networks to carry similar kinds of services (e.g.,  voice over Internet Protocol (IP) or over circuit switched networks, video over cable television or  Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) or, the ability to provide a range of services over a  single network.36  For the purpose of this section, convergence will be related to point number  two or the ability of different networks to carry similar services or the ability to provide a range  of services over a single network.      The reason convergence is important, is that communications legislation often limits the types of  services which can be provided with a given license using a public asset (spectrum, fiber optics,  copper, etc.) .  The issue is that technological and service development is impeded through such  licensing and legislative limitations.  These types of impediments limit competition and therefore  hinder economic and technological growth.  Therefore, value added services delivered over any  network should be open, if possible, to all network operators to facilitate increased competition  among the operators    Convergence is accelerating.  Existing networks are modified to offer new services (e.g., upgrade  of telephone networks to offer ADSL, alteration of electric power networks to offer broadband  services, and the modification of cable networks to offer interactive services). Convergence is  also possible with wireless broadband technologies.   Different network infrastructures can now  provide numerous new services. Cable television operators can now offer consumers voice,  Internet access, and broadcast services over the network as a bundled package of services, and  for a monthly fee.  Mobile service providers may offer a subscriber data and video services, as  well as voice services, and digital television (DTV) providers are offering interactive services.                                                      36   http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/Section.2084.html      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         64      Governments and regulators with limited recognition of the new opportunities derived from  convergence will hinder investment, job creation and economic development opportunities.    There is a list of issues which regulators now need to consider37:     Issues for Regulators to Consider with Regard to Convergence  1. Does the regulatory framework facilitate the provision of different services over different   platforms (e.g., technology neutrality)?  2. Does the regulatory framework support full competition?  3. Does the regulatory framework allow service providers to offer multiple services?  4. What are the regulatory policies for these new technologies and services with regard to   numbering, spectrum, universal service, and interconnection?  5. Does the country’s legal framework contain the necessary legislation to support an ICT   environment (e.g., intellectual property laws, computer crime, electronic transactions, data  privacy and security)?   6. How much turn-around time and process is required for the country's legal framework to respond  to future changes in the sector?   The combinations of services delivered over the same platform challenges common perceptions  about the most appropriate method to license and regulate ICT service providers.  Historically,  regulatory frameworks were designed when clear functional differences existed between  services and infrastructure.  These regulations are increasingly inadequate for dealing with  today’s world.    Regulators and policy-makers are responding to challenges presented by the ICT sector in a  variety of ways. First, there is an increasing shift towards equal or technology-neutral regulatory  treatment of different information and communications infrastructure.  For example, the  European Union (EU), India, and Kenya have introduced/are introducing, legal frameworks and  regulations to regulate aspects of convergence through a technology neutral and flexible  approach.   Second, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, are modifying the structure of their  regulatory authorities by authorizing them to regulate the telecommunications, broadcasting,  and information technology sectors.  Governments are now drafting and implementing new laws  and regulations to create the necessary enabling legal framework to support the ICT sector.   These laws and regulations deal with issues such as content, data protection, intellectual  property, security, and computer crime.    An alternative approach to convergence is to accommodate it within the existing legal and  regulatory framework. This is only effectively possible in countries where there are no barriers to  market entry or restrictions on the types of service being offered. Even though operators can,  and do, offer multiple services over multiple platforms in fully competitive markets, it is a  cumbersome process requiring multiple licenses and regulatory oversight by different  institutions.                                                     37   http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/Section.2084.html      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         65      Spectrum Management:  Spectrum management is the process of regulating the use of radio frequencies to promote  efficiency and to benefit the society in general.  The radio spectrum refers to the frequency range  from 3 kHz to 300 GHz that can be used for wireless communication. Demand for services such as  mobile telephones, mobile internet, etc., has required changes in the philosophy of spectrum  management.     Demand for wireless broadband has soared due to technological innovation, such as 3G and 4G  mobile services, and the rapid development of wireless internet services. Historically, spectrum  has been assigned through administrative licensing.  Signal interference, particularly when using  analog technologies, was once considered as a major problem of spectrum use because of  technological limitations. As such, exclusive licensing was created to protect licensees’ signals.  The practice of licensing discrete bands to groups of similar services is giving way, in many  countries, to a spectrum auction model that is intended to speed technological innovation and  improve the efficiency of spectrum use. During the experimental process of spectrum  assignment, other approaches have also been carried out, namely, lotteries, unlicensed access  and privatization of spectrum.  Spectrum parity ensures a level playing field for operators and  ensures that competition is based on innovation and service provision.    In Jordan access to the radio frequency spectrum is the domain of the TRC.  Much of the radio  frequency spectrum has been released by TRC for commercial use, but much of the spectrum  remains allocated for military use.  As the demand for radio spectrum increases for commercial  exploitation, there will be increasing demand on the military to release more of their spectrum  allocation for the public good.  Although improvements in frequency utilization can be achieved  by going to digital transmission (instead of analog thus freeing up the spectrum for other uses ‘  “the digital dividend”), the high rate of growth of ICT opportunities will likely put pressure on TRC  to attempt to release more of the available spectrum.  This will require that TRC and the industry  to come to some sort agreement with the military on spectrum use such that economic benefit  from this public good can be maximized without compromising national security.  The TRC and  the military might be able to define a set of national security events or criteria (crises) in which  commercially exploited radio spectrum can be temporarily returned to the military for exclusive  use.    ICT Security:  Over the past few years, telecommunication regulators have been approached by market players  expecting regulators to be increasingly involved in ICT security issues. Network and information  security have always been important in telecom regulation, but the importance of security  changes character with evolving technologies. Security related to current communication  systems, including Internet, are broader than security issues when telephony was the most  dominant service.  Current information and communication technologies raise a large range of  questions because Internet is a more open environment than earlier communication systems;  wireless communication also raises new security problems; and networks and services are  increasingly international, constituting new security issues.   Today, societies are far more dependent on technology facilitated communication than before.   Numerous societal, industrial and commercial processes and functions depend on efficient,      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         66      secure and well-functioning communication infrastructures and services. This relates to business- to-business transactions and interactions because they are increasingly conducted on networks  and because business-to-consumer transactions/interactions are based on an increasing number  of network-based applications. It also applies to residential and non-commercial communication.   Seen in connection with the more open and thus more insecure communication environments,  this is a significant challenge, where regulation has a role to play.    To facilitate greater ICT intersection with the economy and convergence across media will  require that the Jordanian national ICT system (infrastructure and standards) be seen as secure.   Investors, operators and users will only rely on ICT if it is perceived and demonstrated as secure.   TRC and the GoJ should consider adopting national standards for ICT security, which can be  adopted and implemented by companies and operators depending on the standard of service  which they will implement.  This will require that the GoJ and the TRC communicate the necessity  of security to the operators and users to increase their awareness and to facilitate increased ICT  use in commercial and social transactions.     Education, Training, Professional Development and Certification:    A competitive ICT sector requires an educated, trained and certified workforce.  The fast pace of  change in ICT has put pressure on Jordanian universities to continually graduate individuals with  relevant and useful skills.  Poor agility in upgrading technical education to remain relevant and  responsive to sector needs is a structural impediment to sustainable competitiveness.  Many  Jordanian universities have been too slow to modify their curriculum to maintain sector  relevance.  Universities have been unable to adapt their curriculum fast enough to keep up with  sector needs.  There is a pressing need for responsive and agile ICT HR development.    This pressing need provides a business opportunity to establish a national ICT bridging  program/academy, that would provide needed professional training in defined sector subject  (technical) and functional (managerial) areas.  Such a program/academy must develop a  constructive and proactive working relationship with industry to help develop needed  competencies in specified verticals and/or technical directions.  It would facilitate and provide  international certification in specific subject and technical areas.  Agile and responsive HR  development is needed to propel and sustain the ICT industry in a specific direction.      MoICT and the Royal Scientific Society have recently launched a bridging program.  The private  sector in cooperation with IFC is working to develop a private sector driven bridging institute.   The IFC is supporting the establishment of this institute.  It is foreseen, that the MoICT led  program and the private sector institute will eventually converge (merge) to serve national  needs.    It is deemed necessary that the ICT sector undertake the development of a bi-annual labor force  study which identifies that various telecommunications and IT labor needs at a local and regional  level.  Such a study would help focus program and academy efforts to ensure that ICT  professionals are provided with necessary skills relevant to market needs.  INT@J could be  tasked with this responsibility.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         67      Small/Poor local market:    The Jordanian market is small and relatively poor. Many regional countries have larger  populations and larger economies.  The Jordanian economy is almost entirely comprised of  MSMEs.  MSMEs represent almost 99.6% of all registered firms (outside the agricultural sector38).  Most MSMEs are owned and managed by the same individual.  Most of these enterprises, at the  start up stage, were composed of only the owner.  Currently, 76% of them have at least two  employees39.      The small size of Jordanian companies (across most sectors and economic activities) means that  these companies are unlikely to be able to afford investing in original (un-pirated) ICT systems  and solutions.  The companies are too small to have developed administrative and managerial  systems and are therefore too small to benefit from implementation of ICT systems.  Thus,  MSMEs need to have access to technical knowledge in the form of management and business  consulting to develop and implement systems within the MSMEs before embarking on an  efficiency improving ICT system.      Accordingly the ICT sector needs to integrate with the Jordanian management consulting sector  to help develop relevant solutions for MSMEs within select Jordanian sectors.  These solutions  will not only provide growth opportunities for the local ICT industry but will also help improve  the efficiency and competitiveness of the MSMEs across most sectors.    Moreover, due to the small, fragmented and generally poor Jordanian private sector, any  significant growth in the ICT sector is predestined to be export led.  The ICT sector can use  Jordanian sector experience to develop products and services to address needs in specific high  value added industries for the ultimate purpose of export.  These new products and services can  serve regional markets and could be twinned with international vendors.  Jordan should be  promoted as a cost effective location for new product and service development to international  ICT companies.                                                     38   Jordan Human Development Report 2011, page 65:   http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Jordan/Jordan_NHDR_2011.pdf  39   Jordan Human Development Report 2011, page 66:   http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Jordan/Jordan_NHDR_2011.pdf         JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         68         Annex 4   Where to Focus and Why     Jordan has limited natural resources and limited market size.  Most Jordanian companies are  MSMEs.  Limited local consumption does not provide adequate opportunity for growth.  Because  of limited market size most Jordanian ICT companies develop products whenever the private  sector/client intermittently articulates a business need.  As such, local companies jump from  opportunity to opportunity to maintain necessary short term cash flow.    Focusing on securing sales derived from intermittent business opportunities prevents developing  deep knowledge in any single sector.  Lack of deep knowledge and understanding prevents  Jordanian ICT companies from developing cumulative sector specific knowledge and skills and  thus developing internationally competitive technical skills.  It is imperative to focus national  efforts on areas that yield productive and sustainable benefits for target economic sectors in  general and the ICT sector in specific over the long term.    Developing International Partnerships:  To overcome the shortfalls of a limited and intermittent local IT market, local IT companies  should consider developing international partnerships with international tier 1 (Tier one  companies are direct suppliers to OEMs) and tier 2 (Tier two companies are the key suppliers to  tier one suppliers, without supplying a product directly to OEM) companies.  This has already  been successfully done on a limited scale with companies like CISCO.  The development of  multiple partnerships will facilitate global reach by local companies through the international  partnerships.      Infrastructure:    Modern telecommunications infrastructure is essential to the sustainable and competitive  growth of Jordan’s national ICT industry.  Relevant competitive (cutting edge) infrastructure is  needed to introduce new technologies and opportunities to the ICT community.  New  technologies and new opportunities facilitate innovation and sector growth/evolution in the  sector.  For Jordan’s ICT sector to be sustainable competitive and to be a sustainable export led  economic engine requires that infrastructure be developed and maintained to remain relevant to  the sector.       Evolving telecommunications infrastructure provides an opportunity to develop technical skills  (maintenance and management) in Jordan to serve international system/manufacturers and  regional/international operators.  For example, Zain, the first GSM operator license holder, used  their Jordanian engineers and technicians in rolling out Zain networks in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and  Africa, etc.  The cumulative technical experience of Jordanian companies can be used to assist  regional and international telecommunication operators working regionally (GCC) and globally  (CIS States, Africa, etc.).      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         69        Export Development:    Export development is essential to developing sustainable economic growth and job creation.   The Jordanian economy is too small and poor at present to fuel substantial economic growth.   Exports to larger and/or wealthier countries are required to develop and sustain job creation, as  well as sustainably improve company revenues and profitability.  Jordanian ICT companies will  only be able to export successfully if they are able to develop competitive products and services  which have high utility for their intended target markets.  High utility (added value) will allow  Jordanian companies to charge higher prices with higher profit margins.  It is for this reason that  ICT companies are recommended to develop working relationships with Jordan’s most  competitive knowledge sectors such that they can identify specific needs which can be addressed  through ICT product/service development and incorporate the knowledge and experience of the  targeted sector.  Moreover, the ICT sector can also focus efforts on the development of Arabic  language based digital content targeting regional export markets.    Role of the Government (MoICT and TRC):   MoICT and TRC need to evolve to become more effective and involved as facilitators of economic  development.  Despite the Government of Jordan’s recent fiscal and budgetary limitations, the  GoJ needs to develop and implement creative ways to facilitate private investment in  infrastructure development as well as the E-services such as E-health, E-government and E- education.  The GoJ can implement concepts such as Build Operate Own (BOO), Build Operate  Own Share Transfer (BOOST), Build Operate Transfer in addition to standard licensing.  This will  require the passing of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) law by Jordanian parliament.     Since the GoJ and the private sector face financial limitations and constraints, GoJ should  consider promoting localized infrastructure development to develop hubs of ICT competence  through the establishment of local techno poles or technology corridors.  The techno poles and  corridors can be used as national technical development tools to create broad national ICT  capacity and capability in specific sub-sectors (BPO, on-line digital content, mobile content,  application development, etc.) in specified geographic areas such as what is currently being done  with BPO in Irbid.  An Amman based Techno pole could focus on E-education or online content  for example.     The creation of techno poles (localized infrastructure development) near an industrial estate  would facilitate the intersection/diffusion of ICT with industry (manufacturing).  ICT  entrepreneurship within the techno poles or ICT corridor could be further enhanced if the techno  poles/corridors benefited from the same regulatory environment as Jordan’s existing  development zones regime.  Such an intersection would help develop deep vertical knowledge  within some ICT companies making them more innovative and internationally competitive.    The GoJ through legislation and regulation has a tool to help direct ICT development in specific  economic directions.  For example, MoICT and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing  (MoPW&H) and Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) could adopt after investigation existing,  relevant international standards for smart buildings. Moreover, GoJ can investigate requiring that  network conduits be included in all new road/highway construction projects undertaken by the  MoPW&H as well as investigate requiring the incorporation of new cable arrays in the      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         70      upgrading/expansion of new electrical grids.  This would improve the competitiveness of the  construction sector and facilitate the intersection and diffusion of ICT into architecture and  construction.       Since clean technology is a nationally supported innovation cluster (supported by the Ministry of  Planning and International Cooperation’s (MoPIC’s) National Competitiveness and Innovation  Council), government legislation governing public and/or private buildings can facilitate the type  of intersection (diffusion) between ICT, the Clean Technology sector, Architecture and  Engineering sector, Healthcare sector, Financial Services sector, and Education sector to reduce  the carbon footprint of buildings, reduce water consumption and improve roof top based water  harvesting.     GoJ support through investment incentives (i.e. tax credits, certification investment tax credits,  etc.) and/or Research and Development subsidies would promote the development of high value  added ICT products and services which would increase the efficiency and competitiveness of  some manufacturing sectors and companies.  There currently exist a variety of GoJ managed  funds (R&D Fund at the Ministry of Higher Education and the universal service fund (not yet  functional)) which could be focused towards enhancing the intersections and diffusion between  ICT and different economic sectors to increase economic growth, competitiveness and job  creation.  According to the R&D Fund bylaw the fund can be used to:     1. Fund scientific research and development proposed by Jordanian universities, public institutions   and relevant private sector companies.  2. Fund overcoming challenges faced by Jordanian companies in developing or improving products   and services which will increase their overall competitiveness in cooperation with Jordanian  universities.   3. Provide financial support the utilization of science in scientific research to develop technology and  promoting the results of such research.   4. Provide financial support to develop research and development capability in relation to  intellectual property protection and patent registration.      It is anticipated that these funds, while considering their original purpose and objectives, could  also be used to direct telecommunications service development in mobile enabled services to  serve E-government, E-commerce, etc.  This will create development opportunities for existing  companies in ICT (for development and export) as well as empower or create new and/or  different business sectors in the economy.        Great economic potential is hidden in existing national infrastructure.  The GoJ sold the national  land line network (copper lines) with the privatization of the Telecommunications Corporation  (TCC) to a consortium led by France Telecom and Arab Bank on January 23, 200040.  Although  Jordan Telecommunications Group (JTG’s) exclusive rights of supply of fixed services ended on  December 31st, 2004 and the telecommunications sector became fully liberalized, the Jordan  Telecommunications Group (JTG) remains in effective control of the copper land line network.                                                        40   http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/arb/WTDC-02/Documents/10-e.pdf      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         71      The use of the copper lines needs to be fully unbundled allowing other operators to use what  once was a state asset.  This may require changing the regulations which govern public use of a  national asset.  Unbundling the copper will allow more ICT service to be developed and delivered  to citizens creating economic opportunity for existing and new ICT companies.       The GoJ also invested in establishing a national broadband network (NBN) as a private network  for the government use.  This national initiative was to bridge the digital divide among Jordanian  citizens and enable the provision of ICT services (E-Government, E-Health, E-Education, etc.) to  all segments of society.  This enlightened investment was also to act as a tool to enhance the  development and competitiveness of local ICT companies in such areas as e-education.       Regretfully, the NBN investment proved too large for the GoJ to financially complete and exploit.   For the local economy to benefit from the sunk costs of the GoJ investment will require that the  existing NBN be completed and activated through creating bold opportunities for the private  sector (local and/or international) to invest in, develop and deliver services to consumers (E- Education and E-Health, cable television, etc.) or by creating national large scale demand/usage  for E-services (E-Commerce and E-Government).  To start exploiting NBN will require identifying  national E-Government, E-Service priorities by the government (Ministry of Public Sector Reform  in cooperation with MoICT and relevant government entities), passing the PPP law (or at least  agreeing on or adopting acceptable partnership models), arriving at acceptable revenue sharing  models with the private sector and passing the amendments to the E-transactions law and a  national privacy act.       It is important to assess the private sector exploitation of NBN..  Partial or complete handover to  the private sector of the NBN may greatly reduce or eliminate GoJ operational costs to run the  NBN.  This will free up public sector funds which can be directed towards developing new needed  national infrastructure.     Local demand for NBN services and applications can be enhanced through GoJ funding (complete  funding or partial funding or through PPPs) for the construction of open access fiber optic  networks.  Moreover, MoICT in cooperation with the MoPW&H, based on investigation results,  may require that network conduits be included in all new road projects.        ICT Diffusion  Economies and societies have become dependent on the use of Information and  Communications Technologies (ICTs). Innovation, productivity and energy-saving, just to mention  a few are key drivers of economic growth.  Social networking, E-government and E-health are  examples of the social use of ICT.  The ability to provide products and services to a nation  requires the existence of efficient ICT infrastructure and a competitive business environment  which facilitates the provision of competitive and innovative ICT goods and services.     Factors affecting ICT diffusion at the firm, industry and country level through different diffusion  channels raises different issues for policy makers in terms of education, industry, competition  policies and more generally the regulatory framework.      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         72       Diffusion and ICT Infrastructure  The pace of broadband growth has been exceptional over the past years. New developments  resulting from the convergence of broadcasting and the Internet, the emergence of cloud  computing and the eventual shift to “smart” infrastructure is likely to place further pressure on  existing resources. Stimulating private investment to ensure that sufficient capacity is made  available and affordable will be a fundamental step and will have several policy and regulatory  implications.    With the increasing use of fiber and the desire to expand the availability of improved broadband,  network reach and capabilities, policy makers and regulators are seeking to stimulate increased  investment, innovation and consumer choice. Following the liberalization of communication  markets, competition has been a critical tool in meeting these objectives. The challenge now is  how to ensure the benefits that flow from competition, will be retained and enhanced in the new  environment   ICT diffusion not only depends on the cost of the network investment, but also on the associated  costs of communication and use. Increased competition in the telecommunications industry,  owing to extensive regulatory reform, has been of particular importance in driving down these  costs. Liberalization, and the competition it has generated, has brought many benefits to users.  Prices have declined, and continue to do so in certain market segments, such as broadband    ICT Diffusion and Education  Several factors influence the adoption of a new technology by firms.  In particular a firm’s  absorptive capacity depends on the level of cumulative and related knowledge. Education  policies play a key role because education shapes the workforce with appropriate skills, enabling  them to make use of new technologies.    A good supply of qualified personnel is important, but traditional education needs to be  supplemented with actions to foster lifelong learning. National policies aimed at enhancing basic  literacy in ICT, at building high-level ICT skills, at lifelong learning in ICT, and at enhancing the  managerial and networking skills needed for the effective use of ICT, are particularly relevant.    ICT Diffusion and the Public Sector  In Jordan, the public sector has been seen as either the ultimate financer of scientific research or  as the end-user of technology without any active role in the development of technology.  Effective governments increasingly act as catalysts and coordinate technical resources for the  benefit of end users through public technology procurement; thus affecting the direction and  speed of technical change.    The Public sector is more and more involved in the design, early experimentation and  development of ICT applications for the benefit of a wide category of end-users, including firms,  families and individual citizens. Improvements in the telecommunications sector are, for  instance, a good example of the changing role of public procurement.  A key role can be played  by public administrations (ministries and departments) which are in a position to test new  communication technologies and to develop advanced e-Government services interacting with  both ICT suppliers/developers and end-users of advanced technological solutions.  As an  example, the integration of ICT in the customs clearing process has improved the  competitiveness of several nations by facilitating a faster and less problematic customs clearance      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         73      process.   The GoJ might consider engaging the private sector to develop required products at  cost41.  Additionally, the private sector might also consider cooperating with the public sector  allowing them to cover part of the development to reduce product development risks, for the  purpose of enabling them to develop and install products which have promising export potential.   Such cooperation would enable the private sector to develop, deploy and demonstrate solutions  which would have export potential in other countries and/or other application for other uses.   Businesses, governments, consumers and key infrastructure all rely on the use of information  networks which are often interconnected at a global level. This raises issues of security as these  networks need to be stable and ready for safe, secure and reliable use under all conditions.    Efficient and enforceable consumer protection is a basic condition to enhance consumer trust  and require close collaboration between governments, business and civil society. But for any  trust related tool or measure to be effective, users must be E-aware, and understand the  protections afforded   Governments can make the use of ICT more trust worthy by using ICT applications themselves.  Tendering public services, providing digital public services, collecting taxes or procuring goods  and services online can help increase government efficiency and enhance access to public  services, while having the additional benefit of public confidence and strengthening demand.    ICT Diffusion and the Business environment  The most important factor affecting continued ICT diffusion is the business environment.  Governments need to reduce unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens on firms by creating a  proactive business environment that continually promotes productive investment. This involves  policies that enable firms to undertake organizational changes, that strengthen education and  training systems that encourage good management practices, and that foster innovation (i.e.  new applications).    Moreover, policy should foster market conditions that reward the successful adoption of ICT;  competition is the key in selecting firms that are able to leverage the benefits of ICT and in  making them flourish and grow. Policies to foster growth in services are important as well.  ICT  offers a new potential for growth in the service sector, regulations that stifle change/innovation  should be modified or removed.    Moreover, competition needs to be strengthened. Competition not only helps lower the cost of  ICT products and services, which fosters diffusion but also pressures firms to improve  performance and change conservative attitudes.     Strategic Objective of ICT Diffusion  Enhancing ICT diffusion in Jordan will enable economic growth through high value added product  and service development, which leverages the energy and creativity of youth and Jordan’s  educated population and the academic capability and capacity of Jordan’s universities and  research centers.  ICT will enable greater competitiveness in other specialized economic sectors  which will help develop sustainable high value added job growth.                                                     41   Result of consultation with the private sector on February 7 th  , 2013 at MoICT      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         74       Pillars ICT diffusion  There are four main pillars which foster ICT diffusion.  They are:    ICT network Infrastructure    Education    Innovation    Business Environment    Application Development:     The national ICT sector needs to focus on areas where Jordan already has competitive advantage.   There is an opportunity to develop sustainable national competitive advantage if the ICT sector  intersects with numerous domestic economic sectors.       Intersections and resulting sector diffusion will build symbiotic relationships with various sectors.   This will allow for building and maintaining cumulative ICT linkages with these sectors.  The ICT  sector will improve its competitiveness by being able to integrate intimate technical knowledge  into their ICT products and services.  Participating sectors will also improve their competitiveness  by having access to improved and more efficient ICT solutions.  These intersections should be  facilitated between the ICT sector and various competitive domestic verticals such as:      Medical/Healthcare     Architecture and engineering,     Pharmaceuticals,     Clean Technology    Agriculture    Tourism    Education     Banking and Finance (Islamic banking and finance is an interesting opportunity)    Developing intersections will help ICT diffuse into these sectors securing and improving sector  competitiveness.  These intersections can leverage existing comparative advantages into longer  term competitive advantages for the entire economy.  This is particularly true with marginally  competitive sectors such as manufacturing in Jordan.       Once ICT companies intersect with different economic sectors, the ICT companies should focus  on creating individual products (productization) instead of one-off custom software products.   Productization requires investment and a long term outlook by the ICT Company.  Investment  will help secure the company’s cumulative knowledge in a specific vertical and will effectively  demonstrate the company’s identity and capability.  Productization will and allow for economies  of scale to be established.  New projects based on an existing foundation product will enable  faster implementation and continuous quality improvement.  Developing national products will  also help will help define a national ICT brand identity.     Business Process/Knowledge Process Outsourcing (BPO/KPO):    Outsourcing has become an international business paradigm.  International companies seek ways  and means to reduce costs in their businesses.  Recently Jordan has entered into the BPO/KPO      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         75      realm with several newly established companies serving regional airlines, international service  companies and international IT companies (CISCO and HP).       BPO/KPO represents an excellent opportunity for Jordan to integrate into international value  chains.  The fact that CISCO has one of their largest international technical assistance center in  Jordan with one of the highest service delivery ratings for CISCO,  indicates the level and quality  of available human resources.  Several Jordanian investors have established call centers to  address regional needs and as such have attracted several regional airlines (Fly Dubai, Saudi  (Saudi Arabian Airlines) and Emirates).  BPPO/KPO demonstrates on the ability of non-traditional  ICT applications to create sustainable jobs and exports by serving international business needs.     Jordan should start with BPO (call centers, etc.) but needs to move up the value chain into KPO.   Jordan does not possess the large workforce size as other countries (Egypt, India, etc.) which  allow them to dominate the lower value added BPO/call center market.  KPO leverages Jordan’s  national investment in university education, allowing companies to develop and sustain  competitiveness based on exploiting Jordan’s educated workforce.  KPO will allow Jordan to  maximize export service revenues as they provide higher value added services.  KPO can be  developed in small specialized verticals where Jordan can exploit and further develop its  university educated workforce.     Jordan can play a regional role with regards to call centers and BPO.  This is largely due to the  fact that Jordanian Arabic is accenting neutral (i.e. closest to classical Arabic).  As such, the  Jordanian accent is understood throughout the Arab world.  The accent is a nuanced competitive  advantage as it will allow higher cost Arab countries such as those in the GCC to benefit from  Jordan as a call center or BPO service delivery location.  This benefit has already been  demonstrated in the Airline industry.     The presence of CISCO’s and HP’s technical assistance centers in Jordan is a testament to  Jordan’s KPO potential.  This potential needs to be further developed and exploited by  identifying likely verticals, developing and preparing the required labor force and promoting this  capability regionally and internationally.   Jordan can successfully enter the IT outsourcing  domain through KPO.  Jordan currently has one of the largest percentages of CISCO and  Microsoft certified engineers, programmers and network specialists in the world (on a per capita  basis).  Talented individuals are the core resource for successful IT outsourcing.  How Jordanian IT  graduates are exploited is the domain of international IT companies and progressive IT investors.     For BPO/KPO sectors to be successful, it is imperative that the BPO/KPO sector secures reliable,  redundant and cost effective telecommunication infrastructure to develop this promising sector.   Once competitive telecommunication infrastructure is secured and Jordan is able to provide  competent and trained labor, FDI will be attracted.  Currently, several Indian outsourcing  companies are seeking to develop businesses in Jordan to serve the GCC market, because India  does not have Arabic language capability.  It is anticipated that the proposed export house will  internationally market investment opportunities in the BPO/KPO domain.         Digital Content:        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         76      Digital content is one of the exciting and broad areas for development in Jordan.  Approximately  3% of all the content on the internet is in Arabic while the Arab world constitutes about 5% of  the global population42.  The Arab world is one of the most youthful global populations and one  of the most likely populations to adopt new ICT technologies and services.       Mobile phone and smart device penetration in the Arab world has surpassed levels found in  many advanced western economies.  Internet penetration is increasing but remains below  western standards.  Internet penetration will likely improve as mobile devices become a more  dominant means of accessing the internet.  Mobile devices have led to increased consumption of  digital content in the form of mobile applications and mobile games.  Many Jordanian developed  games have found markets outside of the Arab world.  The Jordanian developed mobile card  game “Tricks” and “trump” have found markets in China and Russia.  A Jordanian developed  mobile educational application, won the World Summit Award for mobile applications.  Thus  mobile games and applications have regional and international market opportunity.       The attractive feature of digital content is that it is a means for self-expression in all its aspects.   Digital content can integrate story-telling, art, music, acting, programming, graphics, interactivity,  narration, news, game design, virtual architecture, etc. to create complex, creative, high value  added output.  Therefore a competitive digital content sector can create sustainable economic  opportunity for many individuals across many complementary sectors.     Digital content can be delivered through traditional means such as television, cable television as  well as through mobile devices and internet.   Because of the common language, religion and  culture, digital content has great regional export potential.  Digital content development has the  ability and opportunity to harvest the creativity of Jordan’s youth and leverage it to develop  regional exports in the short term and possibly global exports in the medium to long term.   Developing and distributing digital media can be seen to go through a six stage value creation  process with the various stage defined inputs43:                                                     42   http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm  43   Source:   Arabian Business Consultants for Development, ICT Digital Content Report for Chemonics, 2006      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         77         Digital content is powerful because it can integrate the creative talents from many individuals  across disparate sectors to create meaningful and desirable products/services which have a  market of over 350 million Arabs in this region and more than422 Million Worldwide.  This  market exists not only because of a single common language but also because there is a shared,  common culture and religion.  Digital content is familiar and accessible (absorbable) to most  Jordanians and Arabs, while pure programming is not.  Digital content is an excellent platform for  demonstrating the utility of ICT to a young Arab population seeking self-expression.  Of  increasing recent importance has been the growth of digital gaming in Jordan.      Concept   Development   & Planning   Content   Creation   Content   Integration   Content   Marketing   Content   Distribution   Consumption   Writing   Composition   Animation   Music   Sound   Graphics   Narration   Video   Programming   Recording   Sound   mixing   Video editing   Post   production   Internet   Mobile   Devices   Events   Trade   publications   Alliances   Joint-  ventures   Television   Satellite TV   Radio   Internet   Mobile devices   Print   Individuals   Institutional   Musicians   Writers   Storytellers   Game   Developers   Photographers   Film directors   Artists   Consultants   Programmers         JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         78      Annex 5   Financial Summary for the National ICT Strategy     The table below is to provide guidance to readers of the annual financial requirements to  execute all initiatives and actions defined in the National ICT Strategy.   All the activities  described in the National ICT Strategy are activities of national importance.  As such, the  responsibility of most investments falls on the private sector, particularly those related to  infrastructure, education and product and service development.  The strategy also tries to make  as much use of existing national infrastructure such as universities and training centres.  It is the  role of government to provide and maintain a business environment which is conducive to  repeated private sector investment.  Thus, the ability of the strategy to be implemented will be  predicated on the ability of both the public and private sector to work responsibly towards its  implementation.   Many of the actions require substantial financial commitment such as telecommunication  infrastructure investment.  With Jordan’s open telecommunication sector, such investment  opportunities can only be identified as an opportunity not imposed on operators or investors.   Therefore, whether such investments are actually made depends on whether  investors/operators perceive the benefit of the investment.  Since the GoJ is no longer active in  or financially capable of making infrastructure investments, the ability of both the  telecommunications and IT sector to benefit from new telecommunication investments depends  on the how investors/operators view the commercial viability of the investment.  For this reason,  it will be required that the TRC develop and communicate attractive licensing opportunities for  the telecommunications sector for the Jordanian IT sector to continue to grow and be  competitive.

JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         102      Annex 7   Benchmarking With Select Asian National ICT Strategies:     ICT strategies are effective tools in promoting economic growth.  It is for this reason that Jordan  is trying to develop and implement an effective national ICT strategy.  The 1992 Nobel Laureate  for Economics, Gary Becker, has pointed out that “from 1995 to 2000, almost all of the  improvements in productivity (in the US) were either due to investments in information  technology or advances in the output of information technology related goods”44.  Becker also  believes that the effect of the IT revolution is only beginning to be felt: “...with long-term growth  in output per worker estimated at a rate of 3 percent per year or higher for perhaps decades.   Income per worker could double in 25 years or less.”45 The positive effect of IT on the economy is  felt not only in the US but elsewhere as well. An empirical study on the Digital Divide indicates  that a one point increase in Infostate (a country’s stock of ICT capital and labour, and their  uptake and use) leads to an increase of anywhere between US$124 to US$164 in per capita Gross  Domestic Product (GDP)46.    If one looks at several Asian economies each at varying stages of development, one will recognize  that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are seen to be instrumental in the  development of countries.  ICTs allows nations to achieve development goals faster  and more  efficiently. ICTs enable development in at least three key ways:     1. Enhance access to and creation and sharing of knowledge.   2. Effectively speed up the production process and facilitate financial transactions   throughout the economy while reducing costs.   3. Connect individuals, groups, enterprises, communities and governments faster and more   cost-effectively.     The role of ICT in development is being increasingly understood.  Currently, governments are  focusing on improving their respective ICT infrastructures and addressing the ‘digital divide’ at  the regional and global levels.  A recent UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme  reviewed of the ICT policies and e-strategies of nine Asian countries:  India, Japan, Republic of  Korea5, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. The objective of the  study was to document the ICT policies (e-policies) and ICT strategies (e-strategies) of these  countries and assess of how they are shaping their legal and regulatory environment to take  advantage of ICTs as a developmental tool.  To make relevant comparisons, the UNDP – APDIP  study categorized the nine countries being evaluated into three categories: High Income (Japan,  Republic of Korea and Singapore), Middle Income (Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka) and Low  Income (India, Nepal and Viet Nam).  For the purposes of this report, only high and middle                                                     44   Becker, G.

JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         103      income countries will be reviewed.    High Income Countries:  High-income countries stand out in this study because they have laid the   foundation for ICT development since the 1970s.  In Japan, “*t+he phrase johoka – usually   translated as ‘informatization’ and signifying change to an information-oriented society – has   been a slogan of Japanese government policy (since the 1970s)”47 . Singapore’s first IT master   plan was formulated and implemented between 1980 and 1985. Korea’s first national   computerization project was initiated in 1987.   Japan, Korea and Singapore started the debate   on the role of ICTs in development much earlier than the other countries in this study. They also   developed and successfully implemented a number of ‘integrated’ ICT for Development (ICT4D)   master plans – plans in which telecommunications and IT policies were not developed separately   but constituted one coherent design.   Japan  The ‘e-Japan Strategy’ was a national strategy for information technology (IT) on 22 January  200148.   e-Japan foresees a society “where everyone actively utilizes IT and fully enjoy its  benefits”. To achieve this goal, government must “create an environment where the private  sector, based on market forces, can exercise its full potential and make Japan the world’s most  advanced IT nation within five years”.    The specific goals of the e-Japan strategy are to:     Build an ultra-high-speed Internet network and provide constant Internet access at the  earliest date possible;     Establish rules on electronic commerce;     Realize an electronic government; and     Nurture high-quality human resources for the new era.     The ‘Basic IT Strategy’ (formulated in November 2000) preceded the e-Japan Strategy.  The ‘Basic  Law on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society’  (the ‘IT Basic Law’, enacted on 6 January 2001).  The IT Basic Law calls for the “promotion of an  Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, and providing stipulations on  the development of a priority policy programme for the formation of an advanced information  and telecommunications network society”. Japan launched ‘Towards an Advanced Information  Society’ in 1995, which was augmented with a mid-term plan and action plans in 1996 and 199849.    ‘e-Japan Strategy II’ was launched in July 2003 aiming to create a “vibrant, safe, impressive and  convenient” society with the active use of IT. The new strategy proposes to implement leading  measures in seven areas that are closely related to the lives of the people: medical treatment;  food; life; small- and medium-sized enterprises; finance; knowledge; employment; and                                                     47   West, J., Dedrick, J. and Kraemer, K.L. ‘Back to the Future: Japan’s NII Plans’, in Kahin and Wilson, National  Information Infrastructure Initiatives, p. 66. 15  48   See www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/it_e.html   49  An Overview of ICT Policies and e-Strategies of Select Asian Economies, UNDP Asia Pacific Development   Information Programme      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         104      government service. The strategy also seeks to advance the development of a new IT social  infrastructure, which is essential for the sophisticated use of IT during this second phase.50   Korea  The Korean government unveiled its fourth ICT master plan in December 2003, called ‘Broadband  IT Korea Vision 2007’. The new master plan focused on improving national productivity and the  quality of life through informatization. It strategy called for doubling Korea’s IT exports from  US$46.3 billion in 2003 to US$100 billion in 2007. It also envisioned the commercialization of  telematic applications, next-generation computers and sophisticated service robots. The strategy  provided  for the creation of a ‘Broadband convergence Network’ (BcN) that will increase data  transmission rate by 50 percent and fuel the nation’s growth51.    Korea’s third master plan, ‘e-Korea Vision 2006’, embodied the belief that “the promotion of  informatization in all aspects of society would lead to increased effectiveness of all socio- economic activities, higher national performance, and higher quality of life.”52 Its designated  objectives were to:      Maximize the ability of citizens to utilize ICT to actively participate in the information  society;    Strengthen global competitiveness of the economy by promoting informatization in all  industries;    Realize a smart government structure with high transparency and productivity through  informatization efforts;      Facilitate continued economic growth by promoting the IT industry and advancing the  information infrastructure; and     Become a leader in the global information society by playing a major role in international  cooperation.   Singapore  Singapore has been a very proactive country in implementing ICT strategies.  Singapore has  implemented five strategies since the 1980s and is in the process of implementing a sixth  strategy targeting the development of an intelligent nation.  The interesting characteristic of  Singapore’s strategies is that they have focused and almost uni-dimensional in nature.  The first  national strategy focused in computerization.  The first strategy focused on computerization of  the civil service, the development of the computer industry and the developing a pool of  qualified computer professionals.  Singapore’s second strategy focused on communications.  The  second strategy focused on the provision of one-stop=services through cross agency linkages.   Integrating manual processes through the use of IT established sector specific networks such as  TradeNet, LawNet and MedNet.   Singapore’s third strategy focused on connectivity and content.   The third strategy sought ways to enable everyone to access IT and envisaged the development  of national information infrastructure which would evolve to become the world’s first National                                                     50   Ibid  51   Tae-gyu, K. ‘Korea Aiming to Double IT Production by 2007’;  http://www.times.hankooki.com/lpage/biz/200312/kt2003121717253411860.htm.  52   http://www.mic.go.kr/index.jsp      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         105      Broad Band Network.  The fourth strategy (at the turn of the millennium) was to dotcom the  public, people and private sectors by putting the “e” in as many domains as possible.  Numerous  public services went on-line and many companies ventured into e-commerce.  The fifth strategy  focused on unleashing national potential and releasing capabilities by strengthening capability  development, technology planning and improving the business environment53.    Singapore is currently implementing ‘Connected Singapore’, the sixth strategy, with its vision of  ‘infocomm’ (Information Technology and Communications)  as “a key enabler, unleashing the  potential of individuals, organizations and businesses to become more productive and efficient,  and to create new ideas that enrich lives and produce new value”19. This, Singapore’s fifth ICT  master plan, will be implemented through four ‘galvanizing strategies’:      Infocomm for Connectivity, Creativity and Collaboration – which aims to drive the  development of an infocomm infrastructure for pervasive and secure access, promoting  the development of useful applications for work, play, lifestyle and learning, encouraging  usage of applications and services; and promoting infocomm literacy.    Digital Exchange – a strategy to develop Singapore as a leading global digital distribution  and trading centre to create a new source of growth and extend Singapore’s hub status in  the digital medium.    Engine of Growth – which aims to grow new economic activities and create jobs in  infocomm, emphasizing opportunities that leverage Singapore’s traditional hub status.    Agent for Change – a strategy that aims to help businesses and government agencies use  infocomm to achieve higher efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction.     Middle Income:  Countries in the middle-income group – Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri  Lanka – have integrated ICT strategies as part of their national development strategies. The  Malaysian government plays a more active role in promoting ICT development in the country.  The Philippines has a more market-led approach. Sri Lanka, emerging from decades of civil war, is  looking to use ICTs to develop its economy, alleviate poverty, and improve the quality of life and  opportunities for all of its citizens.   Malaysia  The Malaysian National IT Agenda (NITA), launched in 1996, serves as the main policy statement  on the development of ICT in Malaysia. The Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001), states that NITA  provides “the framework for the systematic development of the country into an information and  knowledge-based society by 2020”54.  NITA’s theme is ‘Turning Ripples into Tidal Waves’.  The  ‘ripples’ are essentially specific initiatives by the government – such as the Multimedia Super  Corridor (MSC) – that are aimed at providing the necessary environment to empower the people,  who in turn are expected to bring about the ‘tidal wave’ of change55.  The NITC, which is the apex                                                     53   Building Singapore’s Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network, Infocomm Development Authority of   Singapore   54  http://www.nitc.org.my/   55  An Overview of ICT Policies and e-Strategies of Select Asian Economies, UNDP Asia Pacific Development   Information Programme      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         106      ICT body in Malaysia, has formulated an NITC Strategic Agenda with five key thrust areas to  enable the country to “migrate to the e-World of the new millennium”.  These are:      E-Community – to enhance the quality of life of all Malaysian communities through ICT;    E-Public Services – to get the public, private and community sectors to collaborate on an  ongoing basis to enable the provision of people-oriented, customer-focused services  electronically;    E-Learning – to create and develop, through ICT, formal and informal learning networks  for communities, with the goal of cultivating an ethos of life-long, continuous learning for  individual, organizational and social advancement;    E-Economy – to oversee the optimal usage of ICT in developing a knowledge economy,    making it grow and become globally competitive;    E-Sovereignty – to focus on building a resilient national identity. It is envisioned that  citizens and institutions zero in towards enhancing national identity, integrity and societal  stability in the face of borderless challenges to the nation.     The MSC is an important component of the Malaysian e-strategy. It is a dedicated 15 x 50  kmcorridor outside Kuala Lumpur that aims to attract global ICT companies to undertake  research, develop new products and technologies, and export from this base21 . Conceptualized  in 1996, the MSC was envisioned to become a global test bed for ICT applications. MSC was also  envisioned to be the ideal growth environment for Malaysian ICT Small and Medium Enterprises  (SMEs) seeking to transform themselves into world-class companies. To attract targeted  companies, the Malaysian government committed to the following four promises: a Bill of  Guarantees, world-class infrastructure, a suite of cyberlaws, and incentives. At the end of MSC’s  three-phased development, it is anticipated that Malaysia itself would become one Multimedia  Super Corridor. The Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998 also provides the following all- encompassing policy objectives:      To establish Malaysia as a major global centre and hub for communications and  multimedia information and content services;    To promote civil society where information-based services will provide the basis of  continuing enhancements to quality of work and life;    To grow and nurture local information resources and cultural representations that  facilitate national identity and global diversity;    To regulate for the long-term benefit of the end user;    To promote a high level of consumer confidence in service delivery from the industry;    To ensure an equitable provision of affordable services over the ubiquitous national  infrastructure;    To create a robust applications environment for end users;    To facilitate the efficient allocation of resources such as skilled labour, capital, knowledge  and national assets;    To promote the development of capabilities and skills within Malaysia’s convergence  industries; and     To ensure information security and network reliability and integrity.        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         107      The Philippines  In 1998, the Philippine government launched the National Information Technology Plan for the  21st Century. Named ‘IT21’, the plan describes the vision and strategy to leverage ICT to develop  global competitiveness. It articulates the following goals and timeframes:      By 2000: the Philippines will have installed the infrastructure for every business, every  agency of government, every school, and every home in the Philippines to have access to  information technology.    By 2005: IT use will be pervasive in daily life. Philippine companies will be producing  competitive IT products for world markets.    Within the first 10 years of the 21st Century: the Philippines will be a Knowledge Centre in  the Asia-Pacific; a leader in IT education, in IT-assisted training, and in the application of  information and knowledge to business, professional services, and the arts.     A Government Information Systems Plan (GISP) was approved in July 2000 and adopted as a  framework for all computerization efforts in the government (Executive Order 265).  GISP was  designed to create a governance system that will achieve: faster and better delivery of public  goods and services; greater transparency in government operations; increased capacities of  public sector organizations; and proactive participation of citizens in governance.    The Information Technology and Electronic Commerce Council (ITECC), the country’s ICT policy- making body, defined its vision of the Philippines in 2003 as “an e-enabled society where  empowered citizens have access to technologies that will provide quality education, efficient  government service, greater source of livelihood, and a better way of life”. Its more specific goals  are to:      Provide government services to stakeholders online;    Develop an IT-enabled workforce;    Develop the country as a world-class ICT services provider;    Create an enabling legal and regulatory environment; and    Provide affordable Internet access to all segments of the population.    ITECC identified significant projects to be completed by 2004 for each of the five goals.  For  example, for the goal of developing the Philippines as a world-class ICT service provider, ITECC  undertook the following projects in 2003-2004:      Setting quality standards and certification for individuals in support of IT services and IT- enabled services;    Implementing a sustainable ICT skills survey;    An International Communications and Marketing Programme;    Aggregation of IT services and IT-enabled services groups through an industry-wide portal;    Developing small and medium IT enterprises;    R&D programme for niche ICT products in Centres of Excellence; and    Enabling Capability Maturity Model for Software (CMM) certification for ICT firms.        JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         108      The Philippine government created an e-Government fund in 2003.  The e-Government fund  amounted to approximately 4 billion pesos. Near half of the amount has been allocated to eight  projects for various government agencies, including a portal for more than three million  Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs); a national business registration facility; automation of import  declaration; an e-library; and an e-government portal. The creation in 2004 of the Commission on  Information and Communications Technology (CICT) as the government’s “primary policy,  planning, coordinating, implementing, regulating and administrative entity… that will promote,  develop, and regulate integrated and strategic ICT systems and reliable and cost-efficient  communication facilities and services”, is an important recent development56.   Sri Lanka  e-Sri Lanka’s vision is to “deliver the dividends of ICT to every village, to every citizen, to every  business and also transform the way Government works”23. Sri Lanka hoped to achieve this  vision by 2007 through a seven-programme strategy.      Programme 1 - Re-engineering Government aims to transform government business processes  through the effective use of ICT, thereby making government more citizen-friendly and efficient.  Included in this programme are efforts to automate proceedings and associated governing  processes of the parliament; provide faster communication of documents between government  offices; and encourage government leaders to use ICT in their day-to-day work.    Programme 2 - Building Information Infrastructure aims to:   Provide a modern information and  communication infrastructure that gives user-friendly access to all citizens; establish a legal  infrastructure that is internationally aligned; and Establish common standards for an information  security framework and infrastructure implementation architecture.   Some key initiatives under  this programme are the establishment of a network of Vishva Gnana Kendras (VGKs or Tele  Centres) throughout the country for ICT connectivity and access for citizens; the installation of  two broadband Regional Telecommunication Networks; and the establishment of a  development-conducive telecommunications regulatory environment.    Programme 3 - ICT Human Resource Development aims to use ICTs to enhance education,  increase the number and quality of high-level ICT professionals, and develop a computer-literate  citizenry. The programme aims to build a workforce skilled in ICT use; increase the employment  of graduates; strengthen teaching in primary and secondary schools, tertiary education and  universities; and strengthen management and professional skills in the ICT industry.    Programme 4 - ICT Investment and Private Sector Development intends to achieve major  economic and employment growth in Sri Lanka by using ICTs to re-engineer the local industry  and to improve Sri Lanka’s efficiency to compete effectively in the global marketplace, as well as  to encourage multinational corporations to invest in Sri Lanka.  Programme 5 - E-Society aims to facilitate and promote awareness, training and capacity building  to empower citizens in Sri Lanka, to create a fair and equitable information society.  This  programme will promote the use of ICTs to empower disadvantaged /unserved groups. It will  also facilitate the development of innovative ICT applications for social and economic                                                     56   Executive Order No. 269, ‘Creating the Commission on Information and Communications Technology’, available at  http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no269.htm      JORDAN NATIONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY (2013-2017)         109      development based on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and set up a fund to support  such initiatives.    Programme 6 - Technology Architectures and Security Standards aims to identify technologies,  architectures, standards, security and privacy requirements of all programmes of the e-Sri Lanka  initiative, including service provision, transaction processing and systems. It also aims to  introduce the required technology and standards, ensure that Sri Lanka is adequately  represented in international standardization efforts, and to promote research, development and  excellence in the ICT sector in Sri Lanka.    Programme 7 - E-Leadership and Policy-making aims to use ICTs at different levels of government,  thereby ensuring that ICT promotion will be driven by the national leadership and a shared vision.    How this relates to the Jordanian National ICT Strategy 2013-2017  Based on the benchmarking across the Asian countries above, it is clear that the Jordanian  National ICT strategy must contain several elements to link economic development goals with  ICT.  Jordan’s most pressing economic challenges are those of unemployment and trade deficit.   Both these challenges can be addressed by proactively facilitating growth in ICT.  Areas of focus  are outlined in the following table:   ICT human resource development through  professional training and certification.   Continually developing effective ICT  infrastructure to provide a fertile  ground for new product/service  development and delivery.   Development of competitive ICT  products and services facilitated by  intersections with competitive  Jordanian economic sectors.   Development of the local business  environment to effectively promote digital  content development and convergence.   Proactively develop exports and export  opportunities for the sector.   Proactively identify and promote  investment opportunities for local ICT  companies and for national  infrastructure development.   Communicate the importance of  adopting/implementing ICT security  standards as a means to develop trust.   Aggressively and flexibly manage radio  spectrum as a means to facilitate  innovation and sector growth.   Help create an e-empowered society  by facilitating convergence through  digital content development of  frequently used e-government services.",

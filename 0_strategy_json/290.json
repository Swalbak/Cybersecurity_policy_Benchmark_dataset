But not an idea whose time has come\" Victor Hugo Beginning with the National Information Society Policy (NISP) of the Republic of Macedonia through the process of preparing the Strategy for Information Society Development and the Action Plan, the urgency for rapprochement of the Republic of Macedonia towards the Information Society is promoted, entailing national engagement of all key entities in the Republic of Macedonia. In the process of creation of the Strategy and the Action Plan we start from our reality and local environment requirements, based on realistic skills assessment, resources and potentials of all entities in the Information Society building process. Today, the globalisation courses have divided the world in two zones: stagnation and development zone, which have a decisive impact on the position of individual countries, as well as on their subjectivity. Those countries that failed in the articulation of resources needed for the development by using modern Information Communication Technologies, will nevertheless remain in the stagnation zone, failing to keep up the pace with the modern world. Where the Republic of Macedonia shall be in the following period, shall depend on the application and implementation of the Strategy for Information Society Development. The process of creation of this strategic document is supported by UNDP and FOSIM through implementation of the Project for Formulation of the National Strategy on Information Technologies for Development. The Strategy and the Action Plan have been prepared in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the Republic of Macedonia: • Declaration accepted by Member States of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, signed in Ljubljana on 4th June 2002; • Agenda for Information Society Development for the countries of Southeast Europe, adopted in Belgrade 20th October 2002; • Conclusions of the Ministerial Conference for Electronic Administration, Athens, 2003; • Declaration adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia \"E-Declaration 2002, Recommendations on accelerated development of Information Society and Digital Economy in the Republic of Macedonia as national priority\"; • Action Plan of the Committee for Information Technology 2003 - 2007; • Action Plan and Declaration of the World Summit on Information Society, Geneva, 2003; • Adopted concept for E-Government by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, 2004. In the process of preparation of the Strategy, the following EU documents and recommendations were used: 7 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • The Council of Europe, Lisbon Summit in March 2000, established the basic building blocks of e-Europe, a concept that represents an obligation not only for EU Member States, but also for candidate states for EU membership; • European Commission Action Plan, eEurope+ 2003, and • European Commission Action Plan eEurope2005; • Draft Action Plan of the European Commission, i-2010. The Strategy and the Action Plan shall be accepted and adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, on the basis of which the responsibilities shall be defined for all entities in the process of building the Information Society. This document shall contribute towards linking the activities in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) domain in the Republic of Macedonia with the programmes, projects and Structural Funds of the European Union. According to the structure, the document consists of two components: Strategy and Action Plan for Information Society Development, whereas the Strategy comprises of the basic development directions divided in 7 pillars (Infrastructure, E-business, E-Government, E-education, E-health, E- citizen, Legislation). Each of these pillars is built around the current state of affairs, objectives, strategic measures and responsible authorities with List of Priority Projects, programmes, initiatives or pilot projects. The areas relating to Public and Private Sector Reforms are a separate part of the document, as well as the priority areas for achieving sustainability of the Strategy for Information Society Development, starting from the need of having long-term sustainability of the Information Society development in the Republic of Macedonia, where the priority areas entailing actions for achieving the objectives are defined and explained. Priority projects and defined measurable indicators are provided in the Action Plan, listed according to the same timetable of the previously stated pillars. The Strategy should provide for efficient implementation and ICT practice for all entities in the Republic of Macedonia, through realisation of priority projects defined in the Action Plan. 8 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong Leif Edvinsson The key challenge in the Strategy building process is defining the economic, social and political vision of the knowledge based society, through ICT development and application in all spheres of life, thereby creating modern and efficient services for the citizens and the business community. In order to achieve the vision and mission as defined in the NISP, the following strategic objectives are envisaged to be achieved by 2007: • Entirely liberalised market for electronic-communication services (2005); • Significantly increased number of Internet users; • Established electronic public services; • Implemented priorities for the purposes of sustainability of the Information Society Development Strategy and Action Plan; • Revision of the Strategy in 2007 according to the EU recommendations of the Action Plan i-2010. The basic pre-requisite is creation of a modern, easily accessible and acceptable ICT- infrastructure, available under equal and nondiscriminatory conditions through acceptable rates for Internet access and access to other electronic communication services that will enable communication between the business entities, citizens, public administration and non-Governmental sector through precisely defined protocols. The strategy should provide a better economic development through securing improved economic efficiency, competitiveness and profitability via reorganised and improved business processes with appropriate models for e-business implementation in companies. The e-Government concept stems from the e-Europe framework, which means that the Government should be the first one to initiate the entire process in order to demonstrate determination for implementation of the underlined concept. Efficient and transparent Government, open for co- operation with citizens - that is the concept that will provide better electronic services for the citizens and the business community, a concept that will encourage economic and social prosperity. The process of creating a modern and flexible educational and research system, as well as of encouraging the ICT orientation in the education, science and culture is the most expensive and long- term process that shall increase the percentage of ICT literacy of citizens, simultaneously providing a continuous development of the National Academic Research Network as responsible authority of modern and efficient functioning of entities in the filed of education at national and global level. 11 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Establishment and improvement of communications amongst entities in the Health Sector and creation of flexible environment for continuous service improvements through building electronic services for citizens with access to a significant number of information on various diseases, from a long- term perspective, may change the paradigm - people will be more informed and will use preventive means, which will contribute towards reduction of the number of ill persons. In order to enable the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia to be factors in the Information Society, it will be necessary to create coherent policies so that all sectors will be able to offer e-services that will be unified, standardised, user-friendly, irrespective of the software platform, available for all citizens regardless of their location and social status, taking the citizens' needs into account, whilst ICT- tools shall assist the citizens in their participation in all social processes, as well as in the process of decision-making at a local and national level. An important precondition for implementation of the strategic objectives is adoption of a legislation harmonised with the international conventions and agreements to which the Republic of Macedonia had acceded to or had ratified. It is of utmost importance that a special Law on Information Society is enacted, by which an institutional framework for founding of an Information Society Agency, an Inter-ministerial Council and a National Council will be established, as well as adoption of legislation entirely harmonised with the EU Directives related to information society and knowledge- based economy. The CIT and the National Task Force for Information Society1 shall continue with coordination of activities for information society building until the previously stated institutions and bodies become operational. 1 A Task Force, established with the Project for Formulation of a National Strategy on Information Society Technologies for Development, consisting of 31 experts from Governmental institutions, the private sector, education and science, as well as the civil sector 12 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 2 DIRECTIONS 2.1 INFRASTRUCTURE Mind with its knowledge is the true capitalistic tool of reality. Thus in future ideas will create money, and not objects C. Handy 2.1.1 Current situation The existing infrastructure in the Republic of Macedonia in general terms includes the fixed public telecommunication networks, public mobile telecommunication networks and networks offering Internet access and other telecommunication signals transmission. The fixed public telecommunication network of AD \"Makedonski Telecomunikacii\" is based on 100% digital exchanges offering voice and data transmission, and a wide range of various services (voice mail, conference calls, emergency lines, 0800 lines (\"green numbers\"), 08xy (\"blue numbers\"), fixed telephony prepaid cards etc. Since October 1997 the provision of Internet services in the Republic of Macedonia has been liberalised through awarding concessions for data transmission, so that today five major Internet Service Providers are offering Internet services. There are a total of 126,000 Internet users in the Republic of Macedonia2. In the Republic of Macedonia 65 CATV concessions have been awarded. Two concessions were awarded for mobile telephony; the services are offered by the operators \"Cosmofon\" and \"Mobimak\". The total number of mobile telephony users is 776,000, which is more than the number of fixed telephony users which is about 525,0003. Credit cards usage is considered as a privilege to a small number of citizens, and those who are credit card holders hardly ever use them for payment via Internet. Usage and utilization of the basic communications infrastructure in the local self-Government units is at a minimal level. Out of a total of 124 mayors, e-mail was used by 44 of them, only 23 used web-addresses, which means that less than 35.4% have been using e-mail, and less than 18.6% were presented on a web-site4. The State Statistical Office is conducting a research on the situation regarding the Information- Communications Technologies (ICT)5, thereby providing a more realistic picture about the part referring to the situation with the information-communication technologies and their utilisation, which will provide useful information in the creation of future development plans. 2 Sector for European Integration - Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Answers to the EC Q uestionnaire, referring to the part for telecommunications and information technology 3 Sector for European Integration - Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Answers to the EC Q uestionnaire, referring to the part for telecommunications and information technology 4 Research within the frames of the Project E-governance at a local level in the Republic of Macedonia, conducted in co-operation with UNDP, Ministry of Local Self-Government, Committee for Information Technology - CIT and CSGU (Community of the Self-Government Units), 2004 5 Statistical ICT research conducted by the State Statistical Office in the Republic of Macedonia (ICT-1 for enterprises; ICT-2 for financial institutions; ICT-3 for households; ICT-4 for state bodies, institutions and organisations) 15 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 2.1.2 Objectives In the Republic of Macedonia, many state institutions, the local self-Government as well as different institutes use geographic information systems - GIS-technology; however, there are neither rulebooks nor standards for creation, keeping and maintenance of GIS-data by the state institutions. The basic activity to be implemented in the area of Infrastructure is provision of an appropriate environment for development of a modern, easily accessible and acceptable ICT infrastructure, available to all entities under equal and nondiscriminatory conditions and affordable prices. Advanced infrastructure and increased Internet usage, as well as usage of the other electronic communication services can be provided through the following: • O1.01. acceptable prices for usage of Internet and other electronic-communications services; • O1.02. continuous and sustainable ICT-infrastructure support; • O1.03. Introduction of Protocol for electronic communications between business entities, citizens, public administration and non-Governmental sector. The ICT-infrastructure is to be built around the following three pillars: • Legal infrastructure; • Technology and applications; and • Human resources. Figure No. 1 - Infrastructure pillars The effective application of the information-communication technologies shall be based on legislation harmonised with the EU legislation. The regulation should create a suitable environment for infrastructure development, stimulate the development and application of new technologies and liberalise the market for electronic and communication services. In connection with the infrastructure part, the legal regulation should provide the following: • Establishment and implementation of standards and systems for electronic records, their management and archiving; • Using a central electronic register of registries or databases (so-called register of registries); • Building the physical telecommunications infrastructure, in compliance with the principles of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness; • Encouraging web-services by using ID cards and PKI; • Linking all Governmental and public institutions. 16 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Necessary legal regulation for: Educated ICT-staff for infrastructure maintenance Educated ICT users Management staff with ICT knowledge Technology and applications Infrastructure Human resources Database Authority for certificates ID-cards ICT-management Standards Protocols Development of: - physical infrastructure; - applications and data development. Technology and applications In the part referring to network technologies, it is necessary to envisage the aspects of access, connectivity, security, management, upgrading, network expansion and user support. Human resources Apart from the technology development in infrastructure, a continuous development of the ICT- staff that manages and administers that infrastructure, is necessary. All state and local institutions should appoint a person or a team responsible for monitoring and implementation of the Strategy, for development of infrastructure and public services, for co-operation with the Information Society Agency and the other institutions responsible for implementation of the Strategy and of the projects. There is a lack of professional managers within the institutions, who will take care of the professional upgrading of the employees, of the training and education needs, of monitoring the training success. The management staff should be trained in order to use the information-communication technologies in its day-to-day operations, as well as to create favourable climate for greater use of technologies by the employees in their daily activities and communication. ICT- development priorities One of the basic priorities in the infrastructure development is the establishment of a backbone electronic communications network at the level of the Republic of Macedonia, which will connect all public and Governmental institutions. Given that infrastructure development is a long-term process, the construction of this network would be conducted in phases. According to the Action Plan, till 2007, the priority is to build a central network that will connect all ministries, Governmental institutions and agencies at a physical level, and at a level of applications, as well as for data exchange. The development of this network would be simultaneous with the development of projects from the Action Plan regarding the other pillars for e-education, e-health and e-citizens. Infrastructure development in public and Governmental institutions should contribute towards more efficient and cost-effective services for the citizens. Application usage shall contribute to redesigning of operational processes, introduction of project management for more efficient usage of the infrastructure and the services, as well as for more efficient and transparent functioning of the public administration. The National infrastructure development is to enable regional interconnection for the purposes of development of a regional e-business environment, and is also to provide access to services in the rural and underdeveloped areas in the country. It is also necessary to focus the activities on the development of human and institutional capacities, in order to secure prompt and efficient methods for responding to the requests of the rapid technological development through expert and other type of training, as well as high education for achieving the necessary competencies and skills. 17 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Infrastructure development plans in the public administration should be implemented in co- operation with the scientific institutions and Universities by using advanced technologies. Besides of the Government, MARNET should also have the leading role for this part with support of the private and public sector. Awareness raising and dissemination of knowledge related to the opportunities and advantages from ICT usage both among the public administration employees and services, and among beneficiaries, is of utmost importance for the information society development. 2.1.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities The usage of information-communication technologies shall improve the quality, availability and promptness of the public administration operations related to the citizens' needs, and with that, shall increase the efficient work of the public sector institutions. The dynamics of activities to be carried out in the infrastructure part is divided into long-term and short-term activities. Short-term activities The short-term activities have been covered with the Action Plan till 2007. First, it is necessary to create a favourable environment for construction of the necessary backbone infrastructure, and with that, of the information society development. This infrastructure should enable linking of Governmental institutions, which shall offer a variety of electronic services, i.e. create the necessary contents which will influence the increased Internet usage. The number of Internet users will increase if the citizens need and benefit from the electronic services usage, but also the possibility to access those services. The development and management of this infrastructure is responsibility of the Information Society Agency in co-operation with the National and Inter-ministerial Councils. The short-term activities include activities necessary for full market liberalisation, adoption of the necessary legal acts and secondary legislation. This particularly refers to the enforcement of obligations from the Law on Electronic Communications and the Law on Electronic Data and Electronic Signature, in the part for adoption of secondary legislation in order to provide registration of companies that have a prepared system for issuing electronic signature certificates, as accredited publishers. It is necessary to introduce services which require usage of ID-cards (registration of cars, issuing of licences, financial transactions, personal documents, tax payment…). Each Governmental institution, on its own web-site, should offer the citizens an opportunity for electronic services which will be developed and promoted on a long-term basis, thereby increasing the number of Internet users. Furthermore, it is necessary to initiate the operations of the Electronic Communications Agency as soon as possible, since the Agency is to act as a regulatory body on the market for electronic communications and services, whereas it is necessary for the Agency to be structured in an efficient manner in order to be able to meet the requests for regulation and coordination of the overall processes and changes in the electronic communications market. 18 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 19 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN The efficient regulation of the electronic communication market, as well as the legal regulation enforcement, shall create favourable climate for competition development, and with that, reduction of the Internet access rates, as well as quality service improvement. Infrastructure development is to promote partnership between the public and private sector. The advantages offered by Internet are more than evident, due to which it is necessary to carry out initiatives and actions for increasing the number of Internet users. With Internet-services implementation, the local and state administration will be enabled to unburden the traditional window desks and facilitate their operations, thereby reducing the duration of administrative procedures. In order to have a continuous infrastructure development it is necessary to keep up with the trends in the technology domain, i.e. broadband services (digital subscriber line), WDM-optic technologies, digital subscriber lines - DSL- lines, using Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, data transfer through existing protocols FR, IP, ATM, grid-infrastructure and other advanced technologies that provide service quality; increased usage of xDSL, UMTS, VoIP, VoD, VPN, WLAN and other types of technologies, as well as their implementation in projects. The infrastructure management is a continuous process and it is necessary to take into consideration all elements for information-communication solution, such as: • Hardware and applications development; • Securing a budget for infrastructure expansion and upgrading; • Introduction of standards relating to ICT; • Infrastructure safety aspects, referring to the physical equipment and the data itself; • Balanced infrastructure development, as well as professional development of the ICT-staff, employees and all persons using the infrastructure. The implementation, development, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure should be analysed from the aspect of physical infrastructure, as well as from the aspect of data and applications. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce standards, protocols, procedures that will consider these two aspects related to infrastructure, i.e. technology and applications. In order to make e-services more effective and more efficient, it is necessary to introduce ICT- infrastructure management, which will provide consistency for the e-services and users' needs, which, on the other hand, leads to greater productivity. ICT-infrastructure management should provide for the following: • Designing and planning that will provide guidelines for infrastructure development and installation, and will thereby meet the needs from all aspects of a given business; • mplementation and development according to the development plans; • Daily infrastructure maintenance; • Technical support - structure and support processes for guaranteeing the ICT-infrastructure provided services. The infrastructure introduction and implementation poses high level demands regarding security, validity, quality, standardisation, connectivity etc., which, on the other hand, will have indirect impact on the increased application of advanced IT-solutions in other sectors as well. For achieving an efficient infrastructure development, the following standards referring to the ICT-operations domain have to be adopted: ISO 12207, ISO 9126, ISO 9294, ISO 1335-5, ISO 15288, ISO17799, ISO 9001-2000. Besides of the introduction of standards, which will contribute towards common understanding between actors in the process of infrastructure development and utilisation, it is necessary to create technical-terminology vocabularies referring to the domain of information-communication technology. Long-term activities Providing funds necessary for continuous infrastructure development and building, on a state level, as well as for international network interconnection. Long-term activities are to be coordinated with the activities and tasks of the Government regarding the EU approximation. Given that these are complex tasks, a serious and responsible approach is necessary towards creation of solutions. All investors performing works related to construction of infrastructure (road, railway, pipeline etc.) and facilities are obliged to provide physical space for setting up an electronic communication infrastructure. Introduction of mechanisms for encouraging a corporate social responsibility while building the communication infrastructure, whereby priority shall be given to projects that foresee construction of infrastructure near institutions of public interest (kindergartens, schools, hospitals, libraries, pension institutions etc.). The legislation should not be considered as obstacle for development and introduction of new technologies; it is necessary to reduce the gap between the regulation and the new trends in technology, as well as greater flexibility of the legal framework in terms of adopting secondary legislation which will provide faster introduction of new technologies. Responsible Authorities The main stakeholders and responsible authorities for infrastructure development would be the following: • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • MARNET; • Ministry of Transport and Communications; • Ministry of Interior; • Ministry of Defence; • Ministry of Education and Science; • Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning; • Scientific institutes; • Universities; • Information Society Agency; • Electronic Communications Agency; • Private sector; • MASIT. 20 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 21 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR1.01 1 Activities for providing and increase in the use of fast and cost-effective Internet Infrastructure C1.01 Government of Republic of Macedonia, Information Society Agency PR1.02 1 Determining the existing capacities, planned activities in the infrastructure part in the public administration and the public enterprises and telecommunication services operators E-Government and E-education Information Society Agency PR1.03 1 Design and implementation of a backbone network for the needs of the Governmental institutions, of the public administration and the private sector E-Government, physical infrastructure Information Society Agency PR1.04 2 Assessing the necessary legal framework for the development of ICT-infrastructure Legislation and e- business Ministry of Transport and Communications PR1.05 1 Structural changes of the Telecommunications Directorate and its transformation into Agency, with monitoring of its operations E-Government, e-citizens, legislation, e-business Electronic Communications Agency PR1.06 1 Analysis for introduction of all appropriate standards connected to ICT use (data, services, infrastructure, management, security, documentation) All pillars Information Society Agency PR1.07 2 Preparation of educational CD- material for using e-services All pillars Private sector PR1.08 2 Defining the requirements for ICT- resources and human resources within the institutions E-Government, e-citizens Information Society Agency IN1.01 2 Analysing the concession obligations with AD \"Makedonski telekomunikacii\" and the possibility for reallocation of the obligations in other projects E-Government, e-citizens Ministry of Transport and Communications IN1.02 2 Review of all current projects and activities related to ICT at the level of the Republic of Macedonia Legislation, infrastructure Information Society Agency IN1.03 2 Reducing the administrative procedures for obtaining approvals necessary for construction of infrastructure of public interest (priority projects) Infrastructure and legislation Information Society Agency 2.1.4 Defined projects for infrastructure 2.2 E-BUSINESS …In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists… Eric Hoffer Electronic business stands for an innovative way of enterprise operations through active utilization of information-communication technologies and digitalization of business processes. Business and Governments in the developed countries are already undertaking steps that will ensure their own competitiveness on the national and global market through introduction of e-business. How fast the enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia introduce and react to changes in technology, partnership relations and relations with customers, shall be determined by their own success, and even their endurance in the contemporary business conditions. Attracting foreign direct investments and the export increase impose, more than ever, the Macedonian enterprises to change the way of operation, increase the ICT application and actively participate in the implementation of e-business in their operation. 2.2.1 Current situation By 31.12.2004, 165,977 business entities are registered in the Republic of Macedonia. Out of them 40,2 % are enterprises, 39,7 % are trade companies, 11,9 % are individual traders and 8,2 % others6, out of which 56,201 enterprises are operational. 98 % of these companies are small, and 2 % are large enterprises. There is no precise information on the number of enterprises that have and use the Internet access. More important facts characterizing the current situation in the e-business domain in the Republic of Macedonia are the following: • Large enterprises are implementing software solutions while making efforts to digitalize their own existing business processes at an enterprise level, whilst small enterprises implement partial solutions which digitalize certain functions or parts of functions, mostly finances and accounting; • Banks are in an initial phase of offering e-banking and providing payment transactions between banks and enterprises and between enterprises; • The number of payment cards issued by banks has increased, however, a large part of the cards cannot be used for payment via Internet; • The appropriate infrastructure for implementation of Public Key Infrastructure is existing, and the legislation for its support is in its final phase; • Several Internet-based shops have been established (office equipment, wide consumption goods…); • The new Law on Electronic Communications has adopted; 6 Source: State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia ( 22 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • Among the Macedonian enterprises, there is a great number of partners to big international ICT-companies; • Several Macedonian enterprises are developing business-software solutions for national and foreign markets; • Large part of the enterprises did not reorganise and digitalise their business processes, according to the world trends and e-business standards; • Enterprises did not define the ways for linking with their own business partners in procurement and sale; • As regards the e-business implementation possibilities and methods, there are no information for the enterprises on the market situation; • The coordination between banks, enterprises and the Government is at a low level in respect to which directions and activities for e-business implementation in enterprises shall be considered. 2.2.2 Objectives The National e-business Strategy should provide guidelines for introduction of e-business that would improve the economic development by providing better economic efficiency, competitiveness and profitability through the following: • Significantly reorganized and improved business-processes with appropriate models for e- business implementation in enterprises; and • Electronic linking among business entities, citizens, public administration and the non- Governmental sector. The targets to be achieved are as follow s: O2.01 - Established mechanism for electronic connection, electronic payment and e-business implementation between the enterprises and other participants in the business processes. By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following: mutual electronic exchange of information, offers, orders, invoices; cost reduction, improved mutual co- operation and improved possibilities for electronic co-operation with its foreign associates. O2.02 - Established centres in Macedonia which will assist the enterprises during the e- business implementation. By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following: obtaining information, advices and guidelines for initiating the enterprise preparation for e- business; reorganisation and restructuring of processes; e-business implementation; continuous improvement; linking with other enterprises and institutions. O2.03 - Established continuous information system for enterprises in Macedonia about the possibilities offered by the e-business. By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following: access to e-business information, case studies of successful e-business implementation, publishing information about successes and employed possibilities. O2.04 - E-business implementation in several enterprises in Macedonia through reorganisation and digitalisation of the internal business-processes. By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following: illustration of e-business implementation through practical examples, reduced costs, increased market competition, as well as creating a basis for continuous process improvement and market needs adjustment. 23 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 2.2.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities The e-business Strategy success also depends on the creation and implementation of appropriate reforms, measures and projects from the other pillars that would contribute in the process of creation of a new environment. This new environment will enable full e-business implementation in Macedonia, and will represent the basis for continuous changes and promotions. The strategic measures to be undertaken for the purposes of successful Strategy implementation are as follows: Appropriate e-business coverage with legislation. The Government is soon expected to create and adopt a legislation that will precisely define the electronic signature, electronic payment, digital certificates, security infrastructure, intellectual property protection, fight against computer crime, consumer protection and other legislation necessary for appropriate e-business implementation. This legislation should be created by taking into consideration the legislation of the European Union, the USA and the UN recommendations. Adapting the education for e-business. The educational institutions and enterprises should create a process for joint creation of appropriate curricula, ICT-research support, two-way knowledge transfer, establishment of ICT-labs. Appropriate and accessible infrastructure for e-business implementation. The possibilities for wireless Internet and cable broadband Internet should be developed and accessible, in the city and rural areas, which will provide all business entities with a possibility to be actively involved in the e-business. Enterprises will be able to completely use the opportunities offered by the e-business through this infrastructure, which will minimise the infrastructure obstacles and provide more space for successful realisation of the initiatives and innovations of the enterprises for e- business. Creating a body for monitoring and coordination of participants in the business processes for the purposes of appropriate e-business development and implementation in Macedonia. This body would be composed of all of the stakeholders in the e-business processes and would have an active role in the development of e-business and the information society in Macedonia. Based on the available information, this body should offer corrective guidelines and proposals for new plans, measures and actions for successful coordination of the activities in the entire information society, and for achieving and complementing the objectives of the different pillars. Appropriate and available e-banking and e-transaction methods. Banks and other financial institutions are to extend the number of electronic services offered to the enterprises. Special emphasis is to be placed on the complete development of the electronic banking, as well as on the creation of conditions by the banks so as to strongly support the e-banking application by the enterprises. The institutions and organisations that are to assist the enterprises in Macedonia in the process of appropriate e-business implementation will be the responsible authorities of all of the above stated activities: • Large enterprises in Macedonia; • Chamber of Commerce in Macedonia and other chambers; 24 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • MASIT; • Educational institutions; • Financial institutions; • Information Society Agency; • Electronic Communications Agency; • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Administration bodies; • Local self-Government; • Non-Governmental organisations. 2.2.4 Defined projects The following projects and activities have to be implemented in order to successfully achieve the objectives: 25 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR2.01 1 Defining standards for electronic invoice and electronic order e- business O2.01 Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia - MASIT PR2.02 1 Analysis of e-readiness of Macedonia for e-business e- business O2.02 and O2.03 NSPK PR2.03 2 Business-model development for reorganisation and digitalisation of the business-processes and e-business implementation e- business O2.04 and O2.01 Information Society Agency, MASIT PR2.04 2 Training for introduction of ICT and e-business in companies e- business O2.02, O2.03 and O2.01 Entrepreneurship Agency / MASIT PR2.05 3 E-business promotion in Macedonia e- business O2.03 MASIT, Information Society Agency PR2.06 Analysing the need for development of an e-business research centre e- business O2.02 and O2.03 Universities PR2.07 Guide for e-business implementation in small and medium enterprises (SME) e- business O2.01 and O2.02 Universities Consultancy Body IN2.01 Organisation and participation at forums for establishment of contacts and information exchange at a national and international level. e- business O2.03 Information Society Agency IN2.02 Establishment of an association / foundation of entities interested in realisation of particular projects e- business O2.01 and O2.03 Association/ Foundation IN2.03 Placing information for business entities in the Republic of Macedonia on the Central Registry web-site e-business O2.03 Central Registry of Republic of Macedonia 2.3 E-GOVERNMENT …Our mission is to support business transformation of the G overnment, so it can provide better and more efficient public services… Tony Blair, May 2004 E-Government is much more than application of new modern ICT-technologies, it actually represents a fundamental transformation of the Government's manner of operation and the way the public administration is reasoning and acting, in order to create high quality services for citizens, businesses and public administration. While shaping its own needs, the road towards e-Government requires active participation and partnership of all entities: Government, citizens and the private sector. Each responsible and democratic Government must make efforts for more efficient and more transparent administration operation, through client oriented services, achieving standards for better life-style quality, faster economic and social development. Service users are not interested in the structure volume, type of connection and public administration organisation. The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as priority, will provide simple electronic services for the citizens, business and the public administration. The benefits from e-Government implementation necessarily lead towards recognition of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), that would provide increased communication, exchange of experiences and knowledge between all entities in the public administration, that would lead to a higher level of transparency and efficiency of the functioning of the Government, state administration bodies and local self-Government bodies. E-Government is an expensive, long and uncertain process, the implementation of which, in case it is delayed, will be even more expensive. It is a reform process of transformation overcoming the legislative and control obstacles, financial, technological and digital divide obstacles, as well as obstacles due to resistance and conflict of interest. Lack of funds, resources and knowledge is often the case in the process of realisation of this concept. The worldwide analysis have shown that the transformation could be unsuccessful due to lack of positive energy, a large extent of knowledge, efforts, time and significant amount of funds for the purposes of creation of a favourable environment for implementation of this concept. It has to be emphasized that successful realisation requires endeavours and strong leadership from the highest state institutions. The process of e-Government introduction should be integrated with the process of public administration reform, and it is necessary to consider the potential e-Government implementation barriers on time, in order to promptly find the appropriate solutions. 2.3.1 Current situation The information systems in the Government and the ministries currently appear to be like isolated islands without a common basis that would link them. Parts of the Governmental institutions do not use local networks, and those that use it have special Internet connection. There is no computer 26 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN network that connects the Governmental institutions, and there is a great part of systems that were inherited and are incompatible. This type of organisation obstructs the efficient electronic data exchange between the Governmental institutions, apart from the e-mail usage, which is the only tool for electronic data exchange. The situation with the information systems in the local self-Government is at its minimum. Physical infrastructure exists in only a small part of the local self-Government. There is no possibility for any structural electronic data exchange between the Governmental institutions at the central and local level. There is no e-Government portal, as a single place for all transactions from the citizens and the legal entities to the Government, which would replace the current filling in of forms and applications for the needed services in the Governmental institutions. There are several reasons for this, out of which the most important ones are the following: non-existence of an infrastructure that would enable secure data collection, publishing and distribution of data by the Governmental institutions, low information system management level in the institutions, as well as management information systems. Greater part of the Governmental institutions are characterised with a low level of ICT-literacy as regards the administration employees, as well as with non-existence of a specialised ICT-staff which would implement the technical part of this concept. The ICT-equipment situation is also critical, as well as the obsoleteness of a part of the existing equipment. The basic security procedures were installed with many faults, the information system security level is unsatisfactory, and there is no standardised security infrastructure. It is necessary to mention the different types of Internet connection, and the non-existing computer network that would link the Governmental institutions. The Internet access currently represents an individual problem for each of the institutions, because MARNET-network does not meet the institutions' needs. Such approach leads to a variety of solutions for Internet-access and to increased costs, the possibility for unauthorised access, etc. In the Republic of Macedonia, there are many state institutions, local self-Government units and institutes that use GIS-technology, such as: the State Authority for Geodesic Works, Ministry of Defence, PE for Spatial and Urban Plans, State Statistical Office, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, AD \"Electric Power Company\" of Macedonia, many communal enterprises, especially water-supplying enterprises etc. There is no unified GIS-solution among the Governmental institutions which would create a unique GIS-system. Currently, the standard for protection of the information systems and the quality level of the services provided by the Government is not being applied. The necessary conditions for enforcement of the Law on Electronic Signature have not yet been created, and currently there is no possibility to accredit an institution as a certificate issuing authority. According to the researches carried out within the Project e-Governance at a local level in the Republic of Macedonia, carried out in co-operation with UNDP, the Ministry of Local Self-Government, the Committee for Information Technology and the CSGU - Community of the Self-Government Units in 2004, the situation in the local self-Government is characterised with a low level of physical infrastructure, non-existence of information systems management, lack of ICT experts, minimal Internet usage and local administration employees with a minimal or zero level of ICT-literacy. 27 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 2.3.2 Objectives Efficient and transparent Government operations that shall provide more quality electronic services for the citizens and the business-community through: 1. O3.01 participation of citizens in the information society building; 2. O3.02 satisfactory infrastructure level; 3. O3.03 legal and institutional framework for information society development; 4. O3.04 logical infrastructure for advanced ICT-solutions and network connection of Governmental institutions; 5. O3.05 electronic and online-transactions for e-Government services that encourage economic and social prosperity; 6. O3.06 increased number of ICT-experts and increased level of ICT-literacy in the public administration. 2.3.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities The e-Government concept could be successful only if the Government becomes aware and implements the activities in relation to the development priorities in the society, which will provide broader citizen support, facilitate the financing and reduce the costs. In order to remove possible problems and barriers in the e-Government implementation process, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism that would periodically measure the implementation level. The level of capability of the Government for e-Government implementation depends on the initial project financing, which would generate electronic services. It is also necessary to have a clear view of the costs, investments and assessments regarding time and methods for returning the investment. Furthermore, the employees in the public administration will have to be capable of providing e-Government services. Besides of the need for possessing information-communication technology knowledge, it is also necessary to possess project management knowledge. Figure No 2 - Physical infrastructure 28 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN InternetParliament City of Skopje State and Government Institutions Local Institutions Educational Institutions Ministries Government IP Network The analysis of the strategic measure and the responsible authorities for each of the foreseen e-Government objectives is as follows: 1. Citizen participation in the Information Society building. Citizens have a key role in the information society building process, not only as services beneficiaries, but also as participants in the process, realised through the following activities: • Web-portal design for participation of the citizens in debates, asking questions and initiating new ideas within the frames of the local and central Government (e-democracy); • Participation of experts in the process of proposing laws, by-laws and other initiatives through designing an e-legislation portal for attorneys, barristers, scientists and others (e-legislation). 2. Infrastructure at a satisfactory level. In respect to the public administration (Government, state administration bodies and local self- Government units) requires conducting specific activities for ICT-infrastructure provision, that involves the following: • Provision of advanced ICT-solution in the Governmental institutions, including ICT-hardware and software equipment and information systems; • Provision of a single computer network for electronic data exchange between the Governmental institutions and creation of pre-requisites for confidential, secure and safe communication; • Providing a centralised Internet access node; • Providing a system for electronic documents exchange and management and information exchange between the Governmental institutions; • Equipping the municipalities with ICT-equipment and connection to Internet with function of public access points; • Introduction of fast and cost-effective Internet. 3. Legal and institutional framework for Information Society development. The provision of a legal framework by adopting a Law on Information Society is the prerequisite for initiating the implementation of this Strategy. The Government is to encourage the Information Society development through: • Tax relieves for electronically provided ICT-technology services; • Stimulation measures aimed at reducing the Internet-access rate; • Introduction of standards for information systems protection ISO 17799, as well as the ISO 9001 standards for quality of services provided by the public administration in the Republic of Macedonia; • Adopting a national policy on information-communication security and security certification of ICT-systems for classified information; • Security projects for institutions; • Provision of accessibility to public information, acts, laws and documents in electronic format, accessible and free of charge for all users; • Initiatives for creating contents that would attract the usage of on-line services by the citizens. 29 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN The public administration reform in the Republic of Macedonia should commence by: • Decision of the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia for introduction of ISO 9001 standard for public administration services; • Decisions of the local self-Government councils for introduction of the ISO 9001 standard for local self-Government administration services; • Within a period of 6 months at the most, following the adoption of decisions for introduction of the ISO 9001 standard, to adopt action plans for each institution individually, by which the level of quality of provision of services for the citizens will be raised, in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard implementation. In order to have a successful implementation of the Strategy and the Action Plan, apart from the political consensus, the Government should be the leader in the implementation of the Strategy. In accordance with the Law on Information Society, an Information Society Agency shall be established, which, for the purposes of e-Government implementation, should realise the following activities: • Synchronisation and coordination of ICT-projects and investments between the Government, state administration bodies and local self-Government units; • Ensuring a quality implementation of ICT-projects; • Encouraging local development for e-Government; • Introduction of solutions for measuring and monitoring administration productivity; • Introducing measurability of effects/investment return. For the purposes of e-Government implementation, the Government will organise ICT units with adequate staff (Head of Unit and respective human resources) in each Governmental institution, and will establish a national body for information-communication security. 4. Logical infrastructure for advanced ICT-solutions and network connection between Governmental institutions. The State should always be a guarantor for the principles of information accessibility, free information flow between the public administration entities with continuous data updating and timely submission of information to other entities, according to previously defined and accepted standards. Due to that reason, the Government will undertake activities regarding the following: • Preparation of a study for identification of priority administration processes/procedures whereas by applying the advanced information-communication technologies the greatest improvements can be made (implementation of solutions for computerisation of processes, reorganisation and modernisation); • Channelling and defining the specific user requests in each state administration body by methodological approach and preparation of a functional analysis for the ICT-infrastructure; • Defining procedures and organisation for using the common existing ICT-infrastructure between the bodies of the Governmental institutions in order to provide electronic information and document exchange and to create pre-conditions for confidential, secure and safe communication; • Defining standards and architecture for e-Government applications and services; • Providing interoperability between the applications within the Governmental institutions and interoperability between the applications with the Governmental institutions. This does not mean defining of a unique platform for application design, but it means provision of a 30 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN recommendation for choices, unifying the Internet user interfaces and defining standards for documents, information and services exchange. The use of advanced technologies is recommended. Interoperability involves communication between the units of central and local Government; • Providing information systems management and Government knowledge management; • Partnership with the non-Governmental sector and the business community, which represents a key element in the process of successful implementation and achieving of efficient services. Redesigning of processes will enable the integration of new processes, on a vertical level, between the users of services and the Government, and on a horizontal level, between the state institutions. The provision of information must be in compliance with the following principles: • Each entity must guarantee equal options for access to information; • To define a registry of all registries with rights and obligations for continuous updating; • The information must be officially secured and user-friendly; • The responsibility for public information validity must be strictly defined in order to increase the information authenticity. 5. Electronic transactions for e-Government services that encourage economic and social prosperity The e-Government electronic transactions are offered by the Government, state administration bodies and the local self-Government units. This concept upholds the traditional methods of service provision, and it also establishes new channels through which the citizens, the business community and the other organisations will be served with faster, secure and more accessible services and information. New channels are identified through: call-centres, web-portals, one-stop shops, mobile devices, digital television, which must be integrated, web-technologies based. They include portal design for: • Information on activities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Preparation and managing of the Government sessions; • Prompt information on amendments and MPs' questions; • All existing services for the citizens and the business community; • e-procurement system - a transparent public procurement system; • E-taxation system - submission of data to the Public revenue Office; • E-budget system, which would enable a transparent method of planning and monitoring of budget funds allocation; • One-stop-shop for companies for their registration and day-to-day functioning. Furthermore, the electronic transactions include the following: • E-Government solutions, given that there are more mobile phone users than Internet users; • Solutions involving geographic information systems - GIS, i.e. that process information by analysing the spatial component. With this, the INSPIRE-Initiative directives would be followed, which is proposed by the European Commission for harmonisation of non- coordinated national approaches towards creation of geographic data in the Member States of the European Union in order to unify all GIS-data sources, and to enable a unified system for access and exchange of GIS-information and data from different servers throughout Europe, created and organised by various institutions and organisations; 31 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • Electronic signature implementation in the process of inter-institutional communication, through provision of certificate issuing authorities; • Electronic online data delivery to the State Statistical Office (e-statistics), as well as online data dissemination from the State Statistical Office; • Establishing a unique access to the central registry of all data bases (registries) in the state institutions; • Introduction of ID Card as Smart Card for the citizens; • Provision of services by the authorised institutions, by using an ID Card; • Providing each citizen of the Republic of Macedonia with an official e-address name.surname_xxx@ org.gov.mk (CRC - Central Registry of Citizens). 6. Increased number of ICT-experts and increased level of ICT-literacy in the public administration The Government shall organise the following activities: • Employing ICT-staff with University level education; • Providing conditions for ICT-staff training for the latest ICT-technologies and operational management techniques; • Providing conditions for ICT-training of the administration employees; • Planning investments for training the public administration employees through the Civil Servants Agency; • Providing parameters for measuring the quality of ICT-literacy of the Government officials through acceptance of world recognized standards for ICT-literacy (such as: ECDL European Computer Driving Licence; Xpert and other). Furthermore, the current challenge is the knowledge based economy, and the Government, as the leading force, must modernised in order to meet the new challenges. There are examples of different roads towards e-Government modernisation and implementation, however, the successful examples share certain common factors, such as: determination of the Government leaders to create capable administration, team work, openness and communicability with continuous connection and usage of the information sources by applying the ICT. e-Government responsible authorities • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • ministries; • Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia; • universities, technological and innovation centres; • Information Society Agency; • Civil Servants Agency; • municipalities and the City of Skopje; • State Statistical Office; • Public Revenue Office; • Central Registry; • KIBS; • NBRM; • banks; • Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia; 32 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • other chambers; • MASIT; • private sector; • non-Governmental organisations. 2.3.4 Defined projects 33 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR3.01 1 Creating a web-portal for participation of citizens in the society building process (e-democracy) E- Government O3.01 Government, General Secretariat, ministries IN3.01 1 Government measures- initiatives for reducing the tax for IT-technology web (software) services E- Government O3.03 Government PR3.02 1 Defining standards and architecture for e-Government applications and pilot-projects E- Government, Infrastructure O3.05 Government, CIT PR3.03 1 Provision of a unique programme for electronic document & workflow management E- Government O3.02 Government, CIT PR3.04 1 Project - Provision of access to free of charge information regarding all laws and legal documents E- Government O3.03 Government PR3.05 1 ID Card introduction E- Government O3.06 Ministry of Interior PR3.06 1 Web-portal design for all existing services for the citizens and the business community E- Government O3.06 Government, General Secretariat, ministries PR3.07 1 Employment and training of ICT-staff in the state administration O3.06 Government, ministries PR3.08 1 Training and certification for ICT literacy of the civil service E- Government, E- education.

Necessary preconditions for successful participation in the knowledge based society are the transformation of the educational piramide and creative use of the acquired knowledge and expertise, having also the ability to create original solutions. Therefore, the education has a central place as an indisputable key towards sustainable development, quality and competition. In this context the e- education is a new form of education focusing on the student. The innovative use of the information and communication technologies will improve the traditional system of learning by essential transformation of the curricula and the way of learning and will eliminate the boundaries among the student and the teacher and the school, the home and the place of work. This form of education is to enable skills and capacities in order to be able to function better in the modern world having global perspectives and broadmindedness. The distance learning system, the e-learning, the lifelong learning and other flexible forms of learning, as well as the possibility of development and presentation of multimedia and multilingual contents are just some of the examples illustrating the place of the information and communication technologies in the new e-education. 2.4.1 Current Situation The use of the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) in the education, science and culture in the Republic of Macedonia is at a unsatisfactory low level particularly in comparison with the developed countries in the European Union. This kind of situation is due to the lack of sufficient ICT equipment in the appropriate institutions. The larger number of the primary and high schools is neither connected to the Internet nor to any other intranet for exchange of information. Moreover, the situation is similar with the cultural institutions as well. The universities have common infrastructure and are connected to the Internet that is still on a very low level as regards the European Union standards and with the similar institutions in the wider environment. In the existing educational structure in the Republic of Macedonia the information curricula are present neither at the appropriate level nor in the appropriate form. Moreover, there is no specialised faculty profiling experts in the area of the information technologies. It is evident that such structure of the educational system is not in a position of \"producing\" ICT staff with higher education, as well as other profiles of ICT professionals that are to be responsible for the introduction and the use of the ICT in the society. There are no certificate accreditation systems for ICT programmes and there is no impetus for their use. The ICT knowledge among the teaching staff is also insufficient. The number of teachers using the information and communication technologies is very small, while the number of those using the ICT in the process of implementation of the curricula is just symbolical. The main reason is that the curricula are not adapted to the information technology and lack of the vision for the potentials of the transformations that the new technologies can promote in the education system at all. In order to be able to create a knowledge based society, the education has to change and adopt. The use of the ICT in the educational process is also identified in the National Programme for 36 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN the Development of the Education in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015 as a precondition for the improvement of the efficiency in the education. Nonetheless, there is no comprehensive and essential analysis on the ICT importance and potentials in all areas of the educational process, and in particular regarding the ICT as the moving force of the transformations in the education through its overall integration in the educational system. Currently there is neither an easily accessible, consistent and detailed source of information for all the ICT elements in the education in the Republic of Macedonia, nor access to the outcomes of the numerous activities and investments in this area up to date. The aim of the part of the National Strategy regarding the e-education is to provide an answer to the challenges for development in this area - harmonised and aligned with the contemporary trends and standards in the European Union. 2.4.2 Objectives The increased technological literacy, starting from the educational environment, shall transform the educational system, the results of which shall be productive citizens in the process of successful integration in the global information society. The realisation of the objectives of the National Strategy in the area of e-education is to contain several coordinated and mutually aligned activities as a precondition for their successful realisation: 1. Standards: a procedure of defining national and international standards in the area of e-education and harmonization of the standards with the practices and the recommendations of the European Union; 2. Legal regulation: establishment and adoption of the necessary legal framework for realisation of the necessary activities; 3. Marketing and quality control: establishing and conducting a successful marketing campaign for all the activities and monitoring the quality of their realisation. The definition of the strategy in the area of e-education and its success is greatly dependent on the realisation of the strategies in the other ICT pillars, as well as on the realisation of certain preconditions. Figure no.3 - Preconditions and objectives of the e-education Strategy 37 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Legal regulation Standards ICT staff ICT literacy and contents Educational infrastructure Marketing and quality control Strategy on the development of the information society in the e-education ADMINISTRATION REALISATION OF THE OBJECTIVES The objectives of the National Strategy for Information Society Development in the area of e- education are grouped in three groups: educational infrastructure, ICT staff and ICT literacy and contents.

In the process of realisation of the given tasks these entities will be the primary responsible authorities and/or objects for the activities to be defined: • Ministry of Education and Science; • Primary schools and high schools; • Universities, faculties and other institutions that provide a high-level education; • MASA (Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts); 38 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • Research centres and institutes; • MARNET (Macedonian Academic and Research Network); • NUL (National University Library); • District libraries; • Museum of Macedonia and district museums; • National technique of Macedonia; • Centres for continuous education; • Non-Governmental and citizens' organisations. Institutional framework Besides of the institutional framework defined in the part relating to sustainability of the National Strategy, an additional institutional support is necessary for the successful realisation of the part from the Strategy in connection with e-education. • To redefine the status of the existing educational institutions (branches) which profile ICT- staff, as well as to transform those institutions into independent faculties. • To establish a body for accreditation of centres and institutions for promoting and issuing certificates in the field of ICT-education. • To establish a centre for e-technologies, which would perform researches regarding the quality and certification of all implemented solutions in the ICT domain in the State. • Underline the importance of MARNET, and find solutions for institutional and sustainable responsibilities and mechanisms for its proper functioning. Strategic measures In order to successfully realise the set objectives, the realisation of the following strategic measures is necessary according to the Programme defined in the Action plan: Proteus-portal for sublimation of all activities in the e-education domain. Existence of many donations and numerous projects for increasing the ICT use in all segments of education, which are often uncoordinated and non-standardised, imposes a great need of coordinating and following of these activities from one central point from where you can get all information for different ongoing activities, as well as for those which should be initiated for implementation of the Strategy in place. This situation will be improved by creating the Proteus-portal, which would be the outline of all ICT-activities to be carried out in the education field. In the field of educational infrastructure: Better connection among entities from the field of education, science and culture. The modern and technologically developed states have a developed ICT-infrastructure, especially as regards entities in the filed of education. Having a continuous and fast Internet as communication tool with other educational institutions is one of the issues to which special attention is being paid. Within the frames of that context, it is necessary to provide continuous development of the academic and university research network - MARNET on a national and international level, as well as providing it with an appropriate compatibility with the Pan-European networks. This development would be accomplished by improving the organisational structure, further equipping, professionalisation, increasing the transparency and provision of financial stability of MARNET (through providing allocated funds from the Government). MARNET, reorganised in such a manner, should provide a continuous, cost-effective and quality information transfer between the entities in the state, as well as with the other educational entities worldwide. 39 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Increasing and standardisation of the hardware and software equipment within the stated entities and provision of interoperability… As a qualitative measure for the achieved results, we should strive towards the following: providing a fast and cost-effective Internet-access for all legal and natural entities participating in the educational process. Special emphasis is to be made on the need for meeting the standards and the positive practice for Internet-accessibility in the education. To find and propose forms for free Internet access in the education as institutional benefit and as centres for web-culture and literacy dissemination. Special emphasis is on MARNET on the academic and research level. Improving the operations of the research and innovation centres and the technology transfer centres. Sublimating the actual situation, expertise and scientific-research and application capacities of the research centres in the ICT domain. Promoting the priorities and coordination of directions for development of research centres and encouraging the development in the priority defined areas. Encouraging the technology transfer centres with specific assistance, through establishment of incubator-enterprises within the high-education institutions. Implementation of up to date information systems for the educational environment at all levels and providing their interoperability… Creating and implementing information management systems and defining standards on interoperability and electronic connection of the administration between the institutions of the educational system on the appropriate levels (primary, high school, university). Defining the administrative tasks from and to the local and central Government centres, as well as the specialised institutions (State Statistical Office). Integrating the existing networks of the local libraries, museums and cultural institutions, as well as the networks of the National Technology Development Centres Associations (\"Narodna tehnika\") and NGO of Macedonia for ICT-education - free Internet access through public e-points and establishment of clubs for contents development To encourage establishment of centres with ICT-infrastructure as responsible authorities of the activities for implementation of the Strategy objectives in the part for ICT-literacy and contents development within the existing network of institutions in the following three areas (libraries, cultural museums and institutions and organisational units of the National Technology Development Centres Associations (\"Narodna tehnika\")). In the field of ICT in the education system, we should strive towards the following: Increasing the ICT presence in the primary schools and high schools. It is necessary to introduce IT at early stages in the primary school and to define the quantitative and qualitative ICT presence in the educational system of the primary and high school education. Priority revision of the curricula in the field of ICT-education in primary and high school education. The curricula for the IT in the primary and high school education have to be coordinated with the general objectives of the Strategy, and have to be compatible with the international norms and recommendations. It is necessary to define new subjects and programmes, as well as to introduce structural and contents' changes in the existing ones. 40 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN The organisation of the ICT-areas curricula should enable their easy and dynamical adjustment, by following the dynamics of recent events in the ICT-domain as a whole. It is necessary to define legal conditions which are to be implemented through engaging ICT- experts in the educational system, as well as to prepare the teaching staff for ICT-education within the system (primary, secondary, obligatory, optional). The introduction of ICT-education in the primary school and increasing the number of subject courses in all high schools (irrespective of their basic occupation) represent steps to be undertaken within those entities dealing with formal education. Coordination and development of education in the high-education institutions dealing with ICT-areas. Profiling the future ICT-experts is of key importance for the overall development of the information society. It is necessary to introduce distinction of applicative and research education for ICT-experts. It is necessary to encourage educational profiles of ICT-experts at more levels (graduate, post-graduate, certified) and to harmonise the expertise by areas. For the purposes of successful realisation of these measures it is necessary to redefine the status of the existing educational institutions that profile ICT-staff, and to transform them into independent faculties. The introduction of obligatory ICT-education in all universities in the Republic of Macedonia with adjusted curricula for ICT-literacy is also important. Integration of flexible forms of learning and forms for lifelong learning by using ICT in the existing system and encouraging their use. To stimulate the use and development of distance learning systems, lifelong learning and flexible forms of learning by using ICT in all segments of the education process. To adjust or to create a legal framework for their implementation and accreditation. To provide conditions for encouraging the activities of the centres for flexible forms of learning by using ICT, distance learning and obtaining ICT-domain knowledge. In the field related to ICT-literacy and contents development, we should strive towards the following: Enabling the ICT-literacy building as part of the civil education. One of the supplementary measures regarding the activities for higher citizen participation level in the overall social processes through improved ICT use relates to the increasing of their capacity for simple and efficient use of e-services. To encourage the activities for increasing the ICT-literacy through promoting and support with courses, materials and flexible forms of science, as well as forms of lifelong learning. Special attention shall be paid to the accessibility of these activities to persons with special needs for their facilitated integration in the society with and through ICT use. Providing a continuous digital literacy for all professions by making adjustments towards specific professional needs. The information society development, as well as the knowledge based society development implies educated people. Due to the substantial information technology development within the past couple of years, there is a great part of the population that hardly ever has contacts with that technology. Prejudice and ignorance represent the basic constraints for the creation of the information- communication technology. A project, such as this one, would be with an objective to increase the information technology use in the daily operations, by educating all population structures. Certified institutions should introduce free of charge courses for those not involved in the formal education, which would provide them with an opportunity of gaining the basic knowledge necessary for the information technology use. 41 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Promoting the ICT-areas certified knowledge concept. Encouraging the use of European and national certificates through including the commitment for owning certificates for ICT-literacy as an obligatory element in the process of employment in the civil service (such as, through the Civil Servants Agency). Determining the minimum elements to be contained in the certificate and opening the space for competitive presence of national and European certificate-programmes. Creating the ICT-literature in Macedonian language and in other local languages in areas with the appropriate legal framework. One of the measures that will have positive impact on increasing the ICT-literacy of the citizens will be the creation of a literature in Macedonian language and in other local languages, which will facilitate the access of the beneficiaries to the information related to methods of ICT use and its advantages. It is necessary to define measures that will encourage the creation of ICT-literature, such as: tax relieves for its publishing and increasing the motivation for the authors through regulation and appropriate enforcement of the Law on Copyright and Related Rights. Encouraging the creation and use of digital information - library funds and areas related to education: museums etc. The existing library and museum collections in Macedonia perform their educational function in a predominantly traditional way. The new standards and trends in these areas impose intensive ICT use in the operations of the institutions themselves, and especially as regards the performing of their educational function; digitalisation and interoperability of the National and of the University library, and the local libraries. Encouraging the creation and use of digital contents as teaching tools (multimedia and Multilanguage) in the primary and secondary education ICT use in the educational process is the key factor for fast and efficient transformation towards an education which has the student in its centre, and whose objectives refer to obtaining participatory experience during the learning process. ICT-contents encourage the interactivity, creativity and participation at students, and in many cases represent the only answer to the challenges in order to meet the up to date language and methodological standards. Macedonian explanatory vocabulary The lack of standardisation for explaining the different phrases related to the ICT field, which we daily encounter, creates confusion and makes its implementation more difficult. Through the implementation of a project such as this one, a public debate would be opened for defining the standards regarding all phrases that are ICT-related, as well as regarding their explanation in Macedonian language and in other local languages in areas with appropriate legal framework for that purpose. 42 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 43 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR4.01 1 Proteus-portal sublimating all activities in the field on e- education e- education (O1) Information Society Agency PR4.02 1 Broadband connection between the scientific-research, educational and cultural institutions, and connection of MARNET to the European academic network GEANT and the global Internet e- education, infrastructure (O1, O3) MARNET -universities PR4.03 1 Equipping all educational, scientific and cultural institutions with appropriate ICT and introduction of standards for information exchange e-education, infrastructure (O2) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.04 1 Development of e-contents for the curricula e- education (O15, O16) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.05 1 Transforming the existing ICT high educational institutions into faculties e- education, legislation (O10) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.06 1 e-technologies centre e- education, all other pillars (O2, O5, O6, O11, O14) Universities (ICT-faculties) PR4.07 1 Digitalisation and presentation of the cultural, historical, archaeological and ethnological inheritance (eMuseums) e- education (O15, O16) Ministry of Culture PR4.08 1 Development of systems and tools for distance learning and open forms of education e- education (O9) Information Society Agency PR4.09 2 Macedonian Educational Management Information System and portal design e- education, infrastructure (O4) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.10 2 ICT- education for everyone e- education (O12, O13) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.11 2 Introduction of national, European certificates e- education (O14) Information Society Agency PR4.12 3 Redefining the ICT curricula and contents in the formal education e- education (O7, O8) Ministry of Education and Science 2.4.4 Defined projects 44 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR4.13 3 Virtual digital libraries e- education (O15,O16) Ministry of Culture PR4.14 3 Encouraging the development of ICT-literature in Macedonian language and the languages used in the education e- education (O12,O13, O15) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.15 1 Electronic registration for admission in primary and secondary schools e- education (O4) Ministry of Education and Science PR4.16 1 Macedonian ICT explanatory vocabulary e- education (O13, O15) Metamorphosis Foundation PR4.17 1 Centres for ICT-technology transfer e- education (O5, O11) Universities PR4.18 1 Electronic registration for admission at Universities or for the purposes of obtaining fellowships, located in student centres e- education (O4) Ministry of Education and Science 2.5 E-HEALTH  The world created so far has problems which cannot be solved if one thinks in the way he used to think at a time the world was created… Albert Einstein 2.5.1 Current situation Development of the Macedonian Health Information System (MHIS), including the establishing electronic procedures and securing electronic services, shall be accompanied with the institutional organisation and development plans of the Health sector in the Republic of Macedonia, presented on the graph below: The Ministry of Health (MH) has a central role in the system, which creates and implements the policy in the health sector through respective agencies and institutions. The Republic Health Insurance Fund (HIF) is responsible for: 1. executing the policies in respect to the health insurance established by the MH, and 2. collecting funds and payment of the health care related expenses to the insured beneficiaries. In future, it is probable that an additional private health insurance shall take place, through setting-up of private health insurance funds. The MH, with participation of all relevant stakeholders shall manage introduction of electronic services in the health sector. 45 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN SHSI Medical Chamber Empolyment Bureau Employers Insured beneficiaries Health Care Institutions Dentist Chamber Pharmaceut. Chamber Bureau for Medicines Food Agency inistry of Health Private Health Insurance Fund 1 Republic Health Insurance Fund State Pension Insurance Fund Private Pension Insurance Fund 1 Pharmacies Private Health I nsurance Fund 2 Private Health Insurance Fund Public Health Institute Statistics Offiice Ministry of Finance The Macedonian health care system shall ensure a centralised electronic database of health related data of the population of the Republic of Macedonia, which in compliance with the Data Protection Law, shall be accessible to: 1. HIF for executing of the payments and monitoring over the expenses; 2. Health care institutions for an insight into the history of the patients (anamnesis) and keeping of medical and financial records; 3. Public Health Care Institute (PHCI) for keeping of health care statistics and proposing, i.e. monitoring of health policies; 4. Other participants in the health care system that need and are allowed to have a controlled access to medical and to the health-financial data. MH shall provide for a centralised database for: 1. Accredited health care institutions and pharmacies; 2. licensed professional medical personnel; 3. nomenclature of diseases, health care services and other; 4. Register of registered medicines. HIF shall provide for electronic databases for: 1. information on various insurance packages, in compliance with the established policies of the MH; 2. Register of health care institutions with which the HIF has concluded contracts; 3. Register if insured persons; 4. Register of employers and/or other health insurance paying parties. HIF and PHCI shall continue with their current functions, however, with increased efficacy, as a result to the improved insight into the health care and in the financial records. 2.5.2 Objectives O5.01 - quick access for the patients to the health care services; O5.02 - quick access to the medical history (anamnesis) of the patient from any location, i.e. health care institution; O5.03 - up-dated overview of the health-financial data for the purpose of improvement of the liquidity and the control over the expenses, with ultimate objective - improvement of the financial performances of the HIF; O5.04 - electronic exercising of rights regarding health insurance; O5.05 - increasing of the quality of services through electronic following of the medical records and the treatment (evidence based decision-making); O5.06 - improvement of quality of medical statistics and efficiency in the implementation of health care policies; O5.07 - securing of high quality information for the needs of education, researches and development of medical professionals; O5.08 - harmonising of the quality and the standards of the health care system and of the he health care services with those of the European Union. The information technology that shall be introduced in the health care system, should meet the following standards: • interoperability of the systems and standard protocols for exchange of data; • application of the widely adopted and unified nomenclature and encoding systems; 46 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • interoperability with the external users, for instance State Statistics Office, Ministry of Finance; • application of the international, and especially, EU standards and recommendations; • application of standard, widely accepted technologies, infrastructure and applied software; Negative factors Personnel - the MH does not have the relevant personnel, nonetheless, an IT team must be established which is going to manage the technical aspects of the implementation of the health care information system. Financial - the health care system is over-indebted, which makes the investment in development projects difficult. It is expected that with the successful continuation of the projects underway, especially with the Project for Health Sector Management, to gradually decrease the indebtedness. Infrastructure - the existing infrastructure in the MH, HIF and PHCI, the health care institutions and other stakeholders in the health care sector are below the required level, therefore, significant investments are necessary for the purpose of achieving of the set objective. Positive factors The Project for Health Sector Management, which is conducted in co-operation with the World Bank and the possibility to secure other donations, including the European integration funds, represents a good starting position for implementation of the needed information technology infrastructure. The inclusion of the private sector is a possibility for establishing of new qualitative norms for that portion of the health care institutions, and possibly for the health care insurance. Introduction of Electronic Identity Cards can eventually be used in the improvement of the health care records and identification among the insured parties and the health care institutions, at the same time, securing reduction of the expenses and of the introduction. The prices of the information technology are going down, which can contribute to introduction of integrated solutions of high quality for the health care information technology system in conditions of limited resources for new projects. 2.5.3 Strategic tasks and Stakeholders The Republic of Macedonia has an excellent position to capitalise on the experiences of the countries that have introduced health care IT systems and from the eligible funds from the World Bank projects and from other donors. The project for introduction of new documents for personal identification is also an opportunity to be used for improvement of the records and the identification of the users of the health care services - the citizens. Through the World Bank Project for the Health Sector Management, the major providers of health care services, HIF and MH, shall be encompassed. With that the quality of the biggest portion of the services as well as the largest part of the expenses in the health care sector, shall be under control. 47 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Introduction of an electronic health care card, on the example of the EU Member States, shall enable a single-sign identification, reduction of the misuses and quick access to the data regarding the health of the patients. With that, a quick and significant progress in the quality of the health care services as well as control and reduction of the expenses in the health care sector shall be achieved. Health care IT systems shall be introduced in the health care institutions, which shall enable medical and financial following of the patients, as well as electronic charging for the health care services. The MH shall propose amendments to the existing health related legislation, which shall provide the basis for introduction of: • electronic exchange of documents among the entities in the health care system; • protection of the privacy of the personal health care data; • optimised system of health care insurance through various packages of health care services accessible to various categories of insured beneficiaries; • keeping and access to the health care data of the patients in electronic form; • forms of electronic invoicing and payments between the health care institutions and HIF, and later on, the private HIF; • encoding systems and accessibly to data for services, medicines, medical personnel, health care institutions, insurance companies, insured beneficiaries, and so forth; • possibility for introduction of an additional health care insurance at a later stage. 2.5.4 Defined projects From the aspect of the Action Plan, priority shall be given to the projects that bring to a visible progress in cost reduction and service quality improvement in the health care sector. 48 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area(s) Stakeholders and Participants PR5.01 1 Creation of a Development Strategy of the IS in the health care sector O5.01- O5.08 MH PR5.02 1 Introduction of a unique encoding system; O5.02, O5.03, O5.06, O5.08 MH, HIF PR5.03 1 Introduction of an electronic health care card, O5.01, O5.02, O5.04 MH, HIF PR5.04 1 Hospital IT systems in the biggest health care institutions O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08 MH PR5.05 2 Electronic appointment making, electronic informing, and notifying of the patients-citizens O5.01, O5.08 MH PR5.06 3 Hospital IT systems in the rest of the health care institutions, including the private ones O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08 MH PR5.07 3 Information Systems in health care institutions of the primary level of health care, including the private ones O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08 MH, Private health care institutions PR5.08 3 E-Pharmacies O5.04 Pharmacies 2.6 E- CITIZENS . . . One cannot asses the greatness and the power of his mind . . . Hegel E-services that shall take into account the needs of the citizens, are one of the fundamental reasons for the overall transformation towards a knowledge-based society. They shall bring a genuine improvement in the quality of the life of the citizens, as well as their increased participation. At the same time, the reforms that shall be indirectly initiated shall have a positive impact on the communication culture of the authorities both at all levels, and among all sectors in the society. 2.6.1 Current Situation Given the data provided by ITU7, the level of Internet users in the Republic of Macedonia is 49 on 1000 persons, which just by itself is an unsatisfactory data. Although the new Law on Electronic Communication provides for a favourable environment, it is in the interest of all of us to find out a quick and efficient manner of increasing the number of Internet users. This is also in correlation with the general level of knowledge among the citizens of the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and as well as in correlation with the political will for securing a favourable environment for this growth. With the increase of the number of citizens who shall seek their services through ICT, the savings shall be increased in the public administration, the unnecessary expenses in the business sector shall be reduced, and the transparency, responsibility and accountability in the process of communication with the citizens and with the non-Governmental organisations shall be increased. At the moment of preparation of this Strategy, the number of e-points8 is unsatisfactorily small and the entire infrastructure is not functionally developed. In accordance with the analysis of the Metamorphosis foundation9, the elementary knowledge of the citizens in respect to computer usage as a precondition for functioning of the e-services is at the level of 50,3%. However, it should be noted that in the group of citizens that do not poses elementary knowledge predominate the citizens with lower level of education, the unemployed, those older than 40 years of age, the inhabitants of rural areas as well as citizens of similar target groups. This fact reveals a realistic hazard for widening of the digital divide for this group of people that amounts to over 1 million inhabitants in a period of transformation towards a knowledge-based society. A positive fact is that over 60% of them have expressed readiness for learning of ICT. The broadband access to Internet (one of the basic preconditions for growth of the number of Internet users), in the regions in which these citizens live, is either technically or financially unfeasible. Bearing that in mind, the e-points seem to be the only realistic solution for this target group at this moment. Bringing of the Law on Free Access to Public Information represents a sound basis for protection of the rights of the citizens related to the access to information. In the course of 2005, as a legal obligation the institutions shall have to make the public documents and information also 7 International Telecommunications Union (ITU) - gives the data for December 2002. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia in the responses to the Questionnaire of the EC had provided the following data: \"below 5%\", which in general sense corresponds with the stated data. The breakdown of internet penetration by states according to ITU is available at: mk 8 Public Internet Access Points 9 In the course of 2004 Strategic Marketing and Media Research Institute from Skopje had conducted a research ordered by the Metamorphosis foundation, the findings from which are available in the publication \"General Data on the ICT Situation in the Republic of Macedonia 2003-2004\" 49 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN accessible in an electronic format. Bearing in mind the current situation with the development of the document management systems, and in particular, the use of the non-standard and closed formats of documents and systems for interpersonal communication, it is necessary to stress again the effort made in the interest of the citizens - to have the public data accessible in an open and standardised10 format in order for the users to have unimpeded communication irrespective of the software platform they have. This imposes the necessary definition of minimum standards (technical, as well as in terms of business policy). This is not just an effort, but also a responsibility of the Republic of Macedonia as a future member of the EU11. It is necessary to support the use of the free software and the open code12 software as a public good accessible to all citizens, especially through the freedom of choice of a platform in the formal and informal ICT education. ICT- tools enable even greater and more efficient integration of the will of the citizens in the democratic processes of decision-making and law making. At the moment, there is an absence of coherent policy and practice at all levels for inclusion of the citizens in the two-way communication with the institutions of the state and of the local authority via the Internet (consultation and participation in the decision-making). The current lack of Public Key Infrastructure13, i.e. security certificates, which is recognised in the Government and judiciary systems, does not enable more advanced level of e-services. There are no clear rules for privacy policy and for storing of personal and classified data in electronic form, especially for the private sector, which opens the possibilities for data misuse. There is a high level of public awareness of the citizens' associations (NGO) in respect to the social processes and the public interests. With the transition of the Macedonian society towards a knowledge-based society, the civil sector is one of the key agents for increase of the knowledge of the public and running of the public campaigns addressing the citizens. The overcoming of the digital divide and the inclusion of the community in the decision-making process with the help of ICT, is solely possible through a more intensive partnership with the associations. Currently, in the Republic of Macedonia there is no one-stop-shop system available, however, with the obligations stemming from the integration into the European Union, these reforms shall be conducted in parallel with the implementation of the Strategy for Information Society Development. The current status of the web-sites of the public institutions, with the level of offered information and with the non-unified approach regarding the presentation level of the portals (in general sense, also as it was mentioned, especially in the policy of accessibility, of standardisation of formats and ICT-tools for mutual communication), does not meet the desired standard. There is no publicly stated policy regarding the quality and level of service, there is no publicly accessible Book of Rules on the obligations regarding the deadlines and surveillance of the quality of the responses as well as the level of satisfaction of the users with the responses received from the civil servants on the posed questions and requests. The laws of the Republic of Macedonia are not publicly accessible for the citizens in electronic format, since for the access to these resources a subscription is charged. 10 The definitions and schemes for open standards of documents and e-services that are recommended by the EU are accessible on the web page of the international body for standardisation OASIS ( 11 The European Commission / IDABC proscribe the standard for the e-services and the types of documents for all members of the Union in the documents that are a part of the Framework for the European Interoperability which and represent a precondition for a successful functioning of the Union at inter-Governmental level, as well as in respect to the inclusion of the citizens. - 12 By free software is meant \"Free and Open Source Software\", in accordance with the standards and policies of the European Union (the above stated footnote) (the definition and information could be found on 13 PKI - Public Key Infrastructure. 50 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 2.6.2 Objectives In order for the citizens and their associations to be responsible authorities in the information society it is necessary to support the implementation of the following objectives: O6.01 Support of the local communities in the creation of local sustainable policies for ICT; O6.02 Building coherent policies in order for all sectors to be able to offer e-services that shall be unified, standardised, accessible, secure, of high quality, user-friendly and aware of the needs of the citizens, irrespective of their location and social status. It is necessary to formalise the obligations, the interoperability, the deadlines, and the quality of the service or any e- service that involves mutual communication at several levels of authority; O6.03 Enabling accessible e-services irrespective of the software platform, which shall use open standardised formats14 of documentation and exchange of information; O6.04 Creation of favourable environment and practice of good governance in order for the citizens to be able to participate in the overall social process, as well as in the process of decision-making at the local and at the national level with the assistance of the ICT tools; O6.05 Overcoming of the digital divide through solutions, continual training for increasing of public awareness, as well as the knowledge of ICT and e-citizens' education;' O6.06 Support of the development of the local contents, as one of the agents for increase in the number of Internet users. 2.6.3 Strategic Measures and Responsible Authorities In order for this Strategy to be translated into reality, apart form the political will and consensus, it is necessary to establish a substantive and more active partnership among the responsible authorities of this Strategy, who shall enable the citizens to be involved not only as beneficiaries of e-services, but also as participants in the decision-making process. The following responsible authorities shall be involved in the realisation of the strategic measures: • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Public enterprises, agencies and services; • Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia; • Local Self-Government Units; • Information Society Agency; • Civil Servants Agency; • The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia • Civil Society Organisations; • Education institutions; • Media; • Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning • The business sector; • Donors and foreign foundations. 14 In accordance with the present and further recommendations of the European Union. Also, while standardising, it is necessary to take into account the future widening of the fund of e-services towards the citizens initiated with the process of accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union. 51 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN The strategic efforts shall be implemented through activities and implementation of the following measures: 1. Sustainable development plans and ICT policies for the local self-Government units (this measure addresses the objective for support of the local communities in the creation of local sustainable ICT policies). Integration of the local self-Government units in the system of offering of e-services for the citizens shall be possible only of the transfer of knowledge, expertise and creation of respective polices and development programmes at local level is supported, which on one hand, shall reflect the local ambience and the needs, and on the other hand, shall initiate the application of ICT in providing for the economic development of the local community, as well as growth of the number and quality of the e-services accessible to the citizens at the level of access that is most natural - the local community. 2. E-points15 (this measure addresses the objectives: quality of the e-services, efforts for participation of the citizens, provision of continuous training for the citizens, and support for the local community) The local self-Government units in partnership with the other sectors shall ensure for the citizens to communicate with the institutions via electronic way, through the publicly accessible e-points. The employees in the e-points shall assist those citizens who are not technically ready, to acquire the essential skills. The local self-Governments shall make sure that it covers the biggest possible percentage of the distant locations with e-points, thus assisting the development of the rural area. 3. Public campaigns and training (this measure addresses the needs of the continuous training of the citizens for overcoming of the digital divide and providing support for the local communities). It is necessary to train the citizens and to sensitise them to the idea and to the need of creating the demand for e-services from the authorities. This shall be achieved through series of campaigns, training, modification of education curricula, and in partnership with the non-Governmental organisations. It is in the interest of the public, apart from the reforms in the educational system, to cover also those citizens who have completed their education, and do not posses knowledge of Information and Communication Technologies. It is necessary to acquaint the citizens with the basic knowledge of ICT, as well as with their rights and opportunities offered through the usage of e-services. In co-operation with the non-Governmental organisations, the public sector shall place a special focus on the target groups that are at great risk to be by-passed by the transformation of the system due to regional, social, educational cultural and other reasons. The NGO sector has a special role in the communication with these citizens. 4. Citizen's portal (this measure addresses the following objectives: quality of e-services, efforts made for participation of the citizens, good governance, continuous campaigns) The citizens' portal at all levels of Government represents a unified system of offers of e-services to the citizens with a single point of access and standardised layout. The citizens' portal shall respect the standards mentioned in this Strategy. 15 E-point - public Internet access point. 52 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN With the standardisation, unification and public accessibility of the services, the citizens shall be enabled to use these services without the need of repetitive training with each addition of a new module. At the same time, the services shall be accessible to the citizens at one point - the citizens' portal - the beginning and the end of each browsing for information or permits. 5. Standards and favourable environment (this measure addressees the following objectives: the quality of e-services, continuous creation of favourable environment for good governance) With the establishing of public, open and accessible standards regarding the format of the documents, no service user shall be restricted irrespective of his/her software platform. While defining these standards for access to information, it is necessary to transpose the directives and the decisions of the European Union, which also is our obligation as its future member. The large number of mobile terminals foreseen in the second phase of implementation of the electronic services shall initiate introduction of M-services (mobile phone services). Introduction of standards on the quality of the services for the citizens (ISO), books of rules on the good practices of communicating with the citizens, as well as efforts made to involve directly the interest groups in the communication with the responsible authorities, shall yield an increased number of satisfied and proactive citizens. The monitoring of the quality of the communication is much more simplified due to the technology that allows an insight into the clear communication paths and into the dynamics of communication, that can be used both for internal, and for external analysis of the percentage of increase in the efficiency of the state and local administration. At the same time, this system shall provide for analysis of bottlenecks and overcoming of the same. With this, the system becomes self-corrective and reduces its own entropy. It is necessary to define the whole environment and the good practice of respect of privacy of data. At the same time, it is necessary to establish a common system of co-ordination of the efforts for fight against e-crime, which is expected to grow in the coming years - with the arrival of new technologies. It is necessary to define clear standards for security, to educate and employ professionals in the area of security in the public institutions, to secure all networks of the institutions, and to set clear rules for storage of data for the business sector. The Law on Free Access to Public Information, imposes publishing of all documents of public interest. At the same time, it is necessary to create rules and practice of good governance which will enable the citizens via internet to make proposals and to express their opinions regarding a specific decision, law or other public document or act, and to initiate debates and provide opinions on a specific topic or - proposal of a law by using ICT tools, as well as to propose initiatives by themselves. The two-way communication between the citizens and the authorities shall be the basis for e- democracy. 6. Local contents (measures that address the objective regarding the creation of local contents as one of the forms of increasing of the number of Internet users) One of the reasons for the citizens to decide to purchase ICT equipment and/or Internet access is also the rich local Internet contents. It is necessary to make efforts to facilitate the increase of the quantity and the quality of information accessible on the local languages placed on the Internet. At the same time, it is necessary for the responsible institutions to publish clear rules for translation of the computer and Internet terminology by publishing an explanatory dictionary (Ref. e-education). 53 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 7. Information systems for monitoring of the parameters of the environment (measure that addresses the objective: participation of the citizens) The need of transparency as well as accessibility to ICT-tools (like the GIS, the spatial information system), the obligations for compliance with international standards for protection of the environment, waste management, participation of the NGO sector in the monitoring of the results, imposes the need of creation of public information system accessible to all interested parties, which is going to monitor the environmental parameters and shall offer resources for future activities. 2.6.4 Defined projects 16 The project is approved and the responsible authority had secured the initial budget. 54 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Stakeholders and Participants PG6.01 1 E-citizens' participation E-citizens e-Government MDW/USAID & Metamorphosis Foundation16 PR6.01 3 E-citizens' portal E-citizens e-Government Government of the Republic of Macedonia / General Secretariat (state level) and the local self-Government (local level) PR6.02 2 Civil initiatives for information society (Overcoming digital divide initiative) E-citizens ISA PR6.03 5 Measures for support of the local contents E-citizens e-business ISA PG6.02 4 E-security E-citizens e-business e-Government ISA PR6.04 5 Environmental Information System E-citizens e-Government sustainable development Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning 2.7 LEGISLATION . . . It is pointless to tell the river to stop running, it would be better if you learn how to swim . . . 2.7.1 Current Situation Following the long tradition of the former Yugoslav law, the positive legislation of the Republic of Macedonia is under strong influence of the continental European law. Nonetheless, the Anglo-Saxon law and the legal doctrine are more and more strongly influencing it, and, thus, certain institutes are incorporated into our legal system. It can be concluded that a portion of the Macedonian legislation still contains specific solutions which were characteristic of the old system of the socio-political order. Although the new legal solutions in essence are in the spirit of the new social relations (market economy, competition, plural political party system, and alike), still it could be noted that the legislation takes a slow course in changing and it looks as if it looses pace with the new social and economic relations. Also, some lack of harmonisation between the laws can be noted. The Macedonian judiciary system cannot fully respond to the challenges of today. For that reason, it is necessary to introduce an urgent reform of all segments and institutions of the court system (courts, public prosecutor's offices, public attorney, lawyers, notaries, etc.). From the moment of the making the decisions for accession to the World Trade Organisation and to the European Union, and especially after the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and entering the World Trade organisation, it is notable that the responsible authorities show a higher level of accountability in the preparation and passing of the laws, and their harmonisation with the international conventions and agreements ratified by our country. This is especially valid for the harmonisation of our legislation with the legislation of the European Union. Although the Republic of Macedonian had decided to follow the directives of the European Union, meaning that it will strive towards a knowledge based information society and economy, still the creation of adequate and complete legal frameworks is falling behind. Namely, in the Republic of Macedonia there is neither Law on Information Society, nor a Law on Electronic Trading. In the course of 2001 and especially in 2002, the initial steps were made towards regulation of the usage of new technologies (Law on Electronic data and Electronic Signature, Law on Obligations, Criminal Code, Customs Law, Law on Electronic Communications, Law on Protection of Personal Data, Consumer Protection Law, Law on Notaries). However, some of the acts were not sufficiently developed with the passing of the secondary legislation, and in the majority of the cases the introduced changes were insufficient, inadequate and did not yield positive results. This is characteristic for all areas, the infrastructure, the business sector, the state administration (the Government, the stated administrative bodies and the local self-Government bodies), education, health protection, as well as for the services that address the everyday life and the work of the citizens. 55 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN In the past several years evident efforts were made regarding specific activities stipulated in the laws, to establish an obligation for the subjects which are deemed to perform those activities, to use information technology, and especially in respect to establishing of specific databases, storing of various records, registers, classified information and their protection, processing and usage of personal data, survey and cadastre data on immovable property, statistics data, performing swift money transfer services, electronic trading, and so forth. (Law on Classification of Information, Decree on Information Security and Classified Information, Law on Protection of Personal Data, Law on Ratification of the Convention for Protection of Persons in Respect to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, Law on Performing of Series of Swift Money Transfer, and the Book of Rules for keeping of the register of service providers for swift money transfers, Law on Trade, Consumer Protection Law, Law on Identification and Registration of Live-Stock, Company Law, Book of Rules on keeping of the Trade Register and of entering data into the Trade Register, and so forth). 2.7.2 Objectives The legislation, de lege ferenda, should create a legal framework that shall provide impetus for development and application of new technologies and services stemming from them. The legislation that regulates the information society is a very wide concept and addresses and influences all spheres of the society and of the legal system. The contents of the legislation depends on the objectives, the measures and the project activities defined in the projects on infrastructure, e-business, e-Government, e-education, e-health and e-citizens. It shall represent a legal framework for development of the information society. E-legislation shall be in compliance with, however it should also follow the trends of the UNICITRAL rules, WTO-TRIPS Agreement, the agreements and conventions administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, and the EU directives on ICT, e-business and intellectual property. E-legislation, de lege ferenda, can be grouped as: (1) legislation that should provide for institutional framework; (2) legislation that addresses the substantive law in specific areas; and (3) legislation that refers to the proceedings. It should provide for: • liberalisation of the market of electronic communication services; • prevention of the misuse of the monopoly position and limitation of competition; • establishing and implementation of standards and systems for digital records, for their management and storing; • establishing, development and usage of state and local databases (registers), mutual interconnection and exchange of information from the databases by the interested persons, the Government, the administrative bodies and the local self-Government; • forming of a Certification Agency, as the basis for usage of PKI; • employment of competent human resources, especially in the Government, in the administrative bodies, and in the local self-Government, providing their continuous education; • better and more efficient solutions for the administrative and court proceedings, simplification of the processes and cost reduction; • forming of research centres and technology transfer centres and their co-operation with renowned international centres; • changes in the education system; • development of the systems for distance learning, lifelong learning and flexible forms of learning for and of usage of ICT; • establishing and development of digital libraries in the education, science and culture; 56 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • development of unique encoding system; • computerisation of the primary health care, special hospitals; • establishing of electronic health card and web services for making appointments for physical exams; • establishing a system of electronic ID card with an electronic certificate for the citizens; • standardisation of the services for exchange of information and documents with the European systems; • observe the principles of accessibility, multi-language, security, privacy, and subsidiary of the e-services in all sectors of the society; • protection of the intellectual property rights, databases, security of information and privacy of the data; • protection against computer crime; • establishing of electronic business operation. 2.7.3 Strategic Measures and Responsible Authorities Since legislation, the task of which is to establish and to develop the knowledge based information society and economy, refers to all areas of the social, political and economic system, it can be said that there is no subject - individual, group, party, organisation, municipality and so forth - which is going to be left outside the process of developing and passing of the e-legislation. Moreover, the responsible authorities of these activities shall be: • Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, • Government; • CIT; • Ministry of Justice; • Ministry of Economy; • Ministry of Transport and Communications; • Ministry of Finance; • Ministry of Education and Science; • Ministry of Culture; • Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia; • other chambers; • MASIT; • Civil Servants Agency; • Industrial Property Institute; • Bar Association; • Notary Association; • Universities; • MARNET; • Consumers' Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia; • Citizens' associations, and other; The above stated objectives shall be ensured through (1) passing of new laws, and (2) harmonisation of the existing and other legislation. The primary goal of the e-legislation shall be to bring the Law on Information Society and the Law on Electronic Trading, as well as to form a Certification Agency, and to bring the secondary legislation, in accordance with the Law on Electronic Data and Electronic Signature. 57 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN The Law on Information Society in a unique systemic fashion should regulate the basic principles for development of information society and technology, financing, institutional framework for development of the information society, measures for monitoring and implementation of the Law. In that way, adequate harmonisation of the various laws and other acts that regulate this substance shall be ensured in accordance with the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia as well as with the European Union acquis. The Law on Electronic Trading should regulate the conditions for performing wholesale and retail through communication means. This Law should be based on the UNICITRAL's Model-Law on Electronic Trading. The passing of the above stated laws shall result in the need to propose adequate amendments and additions to the existing laws and other regulations that regulate specific aspects of the information society in the areas covered in this Strategy. The short-term goal shall be the implementation of the Law on Electronic Communication and passing of the secondary legislation foreseen in this law. The mid-term goal shall be reforming of the judiciary, for the purpose of an efficient and effective protection against misuse, especially of the privacy and of the security of data. At the same time, amendments to the laws should be made in the field of: health, education, trade, economy, finances, banking, taxes, customs, court proceedings, intellectual property, databases, privacy, safety of data, and alike. The above state objectives shall be accomplished through public campaigns, massive training of all entities, and especially of the civil servants, the judges, the prosecutors, the public attorneys, the lawyers, and the employees in the institutions in the field of health, education, culture, science, and other public services. At the same time, the utilisation of the new technology and services should be stimulated by offering a lower customs rate, tax, priority resolving of the cases submitted electronically, etc. 2.7.4 Defined projects 58 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PG7.01 1 Brining of the Law on Information Society Legislation, O7.01 Ministry of Transport and Communications PG7.02 1 Bringing of Law on Electronic Trading Legislation, O7.02 Ministry of Finance PG7.03 2 Harmonisation of the laws and of other regulations in respect to and have influence on the information society Legislation O7.01 and O7.02 Ministry of Justice PG7.04 5 Training of civil servants, judges, prosecutors, public attorneys, lawyers and the employees in the institutions in the field of health care, education, culture, science and other public services Legislation, O7.01, O7.02 and O7.03 Ministry of Justice 3 PRIORITY AREAS ENABLING STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY Starting from the need the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia to have along-term sustainability, this part of the Strategy has as its aim to define and to explain the priority areas in which it is necessary to undertake activities in order to achieve that objective. 3.1.1 Current Situation In the Republic of Macedonia there is no precisely defined framework for development of the information society, nor are the sources of financial means defined, as well as the funds aimed at financing and building of the infrastructure, nor other projects aimed at development of the information society, there is low level of awareness of the need and of the importance of the information society, and finally, there is almost no monitoring and/or evaluation of the achievements so far. Hence, one meaningful conclusion comes to the fore: the creation of the foundations that should lead towards a sustainability of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia, is something that should be made from the very beginning 3.1.2 Objectives The basic objectives of the strategy are defining also the objectives of the laying down the foundations and the priority areas that should enable sustainability of the building and further development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia: • on short-term - establishing the basic assumptions and preconditions necessary for the onset of the development of the information society; • on long-term - creation of entire environment which shall enable and shall stimulate the development of the economy of the Republic of Macedonia as a knowledge based economy, i.e. as an economy whose competitive capacity and dynamics shall be based on creativity, inventions and innovations. Segmenting of the objectives on short-term and long-term ones is done with the purpose to refer to specific measures and tasks necessary for their accomplishment. At the same time, the short - term refers to the period until 2007, i.e. until that point of time all basic assumptions, which shall enable the impetus for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia should be completely formed and already articulated in the practice. On the other hand, for the long-term, there are no concrete time limits, given that this is a relatively permanent development process, which shall have its own sub-phases that are going to be achieved in the course of time. In 2007 it is planned to revise the Strategy, in order to harmonise it with the objectives of the Draft-Action Plan of the European Commission \"i-2010\". This Chapter of the Strategy covers primarily the changes and the elements that are achievable in short-term. 61 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 3.1.3 Strategic Measures Starting form the theoretical knowledge of the basic assumptions for the sustainability of the implementation of the reforms and change management, as well as the experiences in the development of the information society in other countries (\"the best practices\"), five specific areas of measures and programmes are determined which are necessary to be addressed for the purpose of establishing the basis for sustainability of the information society. Those measures are: • Creation of the legal framework for development of the information society; • Creation of complete institutional framework, responsible for the development of the information society; • Public awareness raising regarding the need and the importance of the information society; • Creation of possibilities for a wide (for all citizens) accessibility to internet; • Defining of mechanisms for securing funds for financing of the development of the information society; and • Establishing of continuous monitoring and evaluation of the development process of the information society. 1. Legal framework, as a rule, represents a very important part that enables sustainability of the development processes. Hence, the creation and bringing of a separate Law on Information Society in the Republic of Macedonia is an imperative for the sustainability of this process in the future. This Law, apart form other elements, has to separately regulate the following issues: • Constituting an institution (Agency) which is going to conduct the activities for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia; • Constituting of other parts of the institutional infrastructure needed for the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia; • The basic principles and obligations of all public institutions in the development of the information society; • Bringing of secondary legislation defining technical and other standards on which the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be based; • the manners (mechanisms) of financing of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia The improvement of the legal framework for development of information society, apart from bringing of the Law on Information Society, also entails other (already existing) laws that contain provisions in this area. They should be brought in complete mutual compliance, which should be done in the shortest possible period (by the end of 2005). The deadline for preparation and bringing of the Law on Information Society is latest by October 2005. 2. The institutional framework that stimulates and co-ordinates the development process of the information society also represents a very important part for achieving sustainability. The institutional framework should contain: clear definition and clear delineation of the competences of all existing and future institutions that shall be part and parcel of it. The delineation of the competences between the institutions within the institutional framework, through which the process of development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be stimulated and co-ordinated, is represented in the scheme below, and in respect to the definition of their competences, it is necessary to differ among institutions that would: 62 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN • define the policy and its priorities; • perform the advisory function; • implement policies and activities; and • perform the function of a regulator of the market and of the work. In that sense, the institutional framework for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be composed of the following institutions: a) for defining of the policy and its priorities, as well as for co-ordination of the implementation of this Strategy and its individual projects, shall be formed: Interministerial Council It shall be chaired by the President of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and the members shall be the Deputy of the President of the Government responsible of the European Integration and the Minister of Transport and Communications, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister of Interior, Minister of Justice, Minister of Economy, Minister of Finance, Minister of Labour and Social Policy, and Minister of Local Self-Government. The competences of the Interministerial Council are as follows: • Defining of the basic guidelines and priorities of the policy; • Linking of the policies for development of the information society with the other development policies in the Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities of various parties - participants in the process; • Adopting of the evaluation reports on the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia and on the implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan. 63 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia Counselling Council Guide- lines Account- ability Interministerial Council National Council Information Society Agency Ministry of Transport and Communications IT-Sectors of the Ministries, state bodies, local self-Government units Policy Creation Implementation Regulation Advisory function IT- sectors Regulatory bodies Agency for electronic commu- nication Competition Commission Account- ability IT- sectors IT- sectors b) For the purpose of performing the advisory function, shall be formed: National Council for Information Society of the Republic of Macedonia It shall consist of 25 members selected by the Parliament, as well as representatives from the private and from the public sector, from the Universities and the non-Governmental organisations. The members of this Council should be re-known experts from various areas, as experts in the working group responsible for the preparation of the Strategy. The competences of the National Council for Information Society of the Republic of Mcedonia are: • Providing guidelines and recommendations regarding the basic trends and priorities of the policy; • Preparation of opinions regarding the manners of linking of the policies for development of the information society with the other development policies in the Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities of various parties - participants in the process; • Performing the monitoring of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia and of the implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan. The Interministerial and the National Council shall also work together as a partnership between the public, private and the civil sector. c) for conducting of the policies and activities for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia, a central implementation institution shall be established: Information Society Agency for of the Republic of Macedonia This Agency shall be a legal entity established with the Law on Information Society. The management of the Agency shall be under the competency of the Managing Board, and the operation shall be under the competence of a Director. The Parliament shall appoint the members of the Managing Board, and it will be composed with a dominant participation of the representatives from the private and the non-Governmental sector. The Agency should operate in accordance with an annual programme, for which the National Council for Information Society shall provide the recommendation, and the Government shall provide approval. The basic competences and the activities of the Agency shall be: • Operational processing and archiving of data and information as a public good; • Implementation of the adopted projects for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities that shall be implemented by the IT sectors in the Ministries and in the other state agencies, organisations and bodies; • Co-ordinated management and development of integrated backbone network for the needs of the Governmental institutions and the public administration; • Certification of the usage of the PKI; • Creation and management of the funds of the Information Society Development Fund of the Republic of Macedonia; • Making endeavours for public awareness raising and education in respect to the importance of the development of the information society. The Law on Information Society shall define concretely all of the competences of the Agency. The financing of the functioning of this Agency shall be done with the funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia as well as from own incomes of the Agency, coming from various services that it would provide. The creation and the issuing of the \"smart cards\" (electronic personal documents) is an example of a service that should be provided by this Agency. The control over the spending of the funds shall be secured through planning of the expenses ahead of each year, and by accounting (reports) to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, at least once a year. The deadline for creation of this institution is the end of 2007. 64 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Implementation of portion of activities for development of the information society in concrete domains shall be also in the competence of: IT-sector of the General Secretariat of the Government and of the IT-sectors in the ministries, state bodies and other state and public institutions. In that sense, the General Secretariat of the Government, each ministry and state institution should have an IT-sector17, by bearing in mind of the advantages and disadvantages of engaging a greater number of external employees in respect to performing of the tasks on contractual basis. The concrete competencies of each IT-sector should be specified with the documents that define the functions of each individual institution, in accordance with the Law on Information Society. At local level, each municipality in the Republic of Macedonia should create a Programme for information society development at the level of the municipality, as well as to create an IT-sector, the management of which shall be under the competencies of the Council of the local self-Government unit and/or the Mayor. In essence, the competencies of those IT-sectors shall address the implementation of various activities and projects for development of the information society at the level of the municipality. At the same time, those sectors should cooperate among themselves and with the Information Society Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. d) for performing of the regulatory function already specific institutions exist, and also others shall be formed, in accordance with the needs in specific areas. 3. The building (i.e. the raising) of the public awareness regarding the need and the importance of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia is also necessary in the context of the establishing of foundations for a long-term sustainability and development of the process. On the other hand, the building of the public awareness has a component of self-sustainability, which means that the most important issue is to commence with that process, and further on the progress shall by itself contribute to further building of the public awareness. In that sense, two issues are of importance: • creation and definition of a project composed of set of campaigns, the aim of which is raising the level of public awareness - in fact, this is a process of creating a \"public passion\" for inclusion of the citizens in the building of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia, and especially in respect to the usage of the Internet network. The campaigns shall be adequately adjusted to the objectives. The implementation shall commence in the first half of 2005; • defining and undertaking other activities aimed at raising of the level of the public awareness in respect to benefit of building of an information society in the Republic of Macedonia - as examples the following can be mentioned: organisation of various events related to the promotion of the development of the information society, awarding rewards for best solutions in this field, organising series of speeches and articles, through which the importance of the development of the information society for solving of the problems of the citizens shall be promoted, and especially, pointing out good and successful examples that exist and are going to be developed in the course of time in the Republic of Macedonia. This is especially important in the context of the sustainability. This activity shall commence in the course of 2005, however it has a more lasting character than the campaign itself. 17 An obligation undertaken with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 65 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN 4. Creation of the possibility for a wider (for all citizens) accessibility to the Internet also means setting of the basic assumptions and preconditions that are necessary for the outset of the development of the information society. At the same time, without neglecting the economic (i.e. the financial) side of this activity, the starting ground in this sense is the realisation of the idea that the access to the Internet today is a part of the set of human rights, which in essence means that the access to the Internet has a characteristics of a public good. An effort should be made that this service is accessible to all under equal, low-priced, yet economically sustainable parameters. This measure shall lead towards narrowing of the current gap (digital divide) among the population of the Republic of Macedonia, in respect to the usage of information technology products. Several options exist in this respect: • usage of public centres for access to internet ('e-points') in the local self-Government units; • undertaking legal (regulatory) and other measures of the policy that shall create competition on the market, which shall result in decrease in the prices of use of Internet. These activities shall commence at the beginning of 2006. 5. Defining of the mechanisms for securing funds for financing of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia also represents a crucial factor for the sustainability of the process. In that sense, in essence, there are several options that could be used: • including of the expenses for purchasing of the information technology (as a legal obligation) in the regular planning of the central budget and in the budgets of the local self-Government units. In this respect, it is necessary, in legal sense (with the Law on Information Society), to define also a specific threshold, i.e. a criterion - from 0,5 up to 1% of the total budget expenses in the course of the next five years; • directing part (percentage) of the income from the sale of the public enterprises (or their funds) in covering of the expenses for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia. This obligation should be legally defined with the Law on Information Society. The economic justification of this measure, again is the fact that the funds from the sale of public capital subjects should be spent on creation of the foundations of the future economic development, and this is the development of the information society. The deadline for commencing with the implementation of this measure is immediately after passing of the new law; • Forming of an Information Society Development Fund in the Republic of Macedonia. With the money from this Fund primarily shall be financed development of the public centres for training on information technology usage, or for public centres for access to Internet. Apart from the Government, the private sector should participate in the Fund, meaning that also the possibility should be considered for specific fiscal alleviation for the enterprises which invest (i.e. donate) in this Fund. The deadline for commencing with the implementation of this measure is the end of 2005; • Defining of a set of separate measures that are going to influence the attraction of foreign direct investments in the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia. The possibilities for provision of specific alleviation to foreign investors should be considered, although this should not be the only measure. The implementation of this measure should commence immediately after the adoption of the Strategy. 66 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Spending of the funds for information society development in the Republic of Macedonia shall be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and priorities defined by the Interministerial Council, upon recommendations and opinions provided by the National Council on Information Society. Their realisation, in accordance with the legally entrusted competences, in part, shall be performed through the Information Society Agency, and in the other part, through the ministries and other state institutions and agencies. 6. Continuous monitoring an evaluation of the information society development also represents an important part of the sustainability. Two different types of monitoring and evaluation are in question: 1) of the process of implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan, and 2) of the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia on the whole. For conducting both types of monitoring and evaluation it is necessary to establish and to define the following: • indicators (benchmarking) of the evaluation; • methodology for evaluation (to use the methodologies that are applied in other countries); • periods of evaluation (annually); • to authorise an institution which is going to be responsible to consider and to adopt the evaluations and the reports. In respect to the defining of the indicators, the methodology for evaluation and the periods of assessment, one short-term project is defined (to be completed before the end of 2005), with which they shall be created and subsequently shall be adopted by Interministerial Council and by the National Council. The responsibilities for adoption of the evaluation and monitoring reports lays with the Interministerial Council, as well as the responsibility for providing guidelines for future development, while the National Council for Information Society should provide its own opinion and recommendations based on those reports. The Councils also have the responsibility to propose amendments in the domains where weaknesses in the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia occur. The implementation of this measure commences immediately after the adoption of the Strategy. 3.1.4 Priority Projects 67 NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN Project Priority Activity Area Responsible authorities and stakeholders PR8.01 1 Defining of the organisational structure and the necessary capacities of the Agency for civil society Sustainability CIT PR8.02 3 Campaigns for raising of the public awareness for information society Sustainability CIT PR8.03 2 Forming of a fund for information society development based on the principles of partnership between the public and the private sector Sustainability Government of the Republic of Macedonia PR8.04 5 Defining of the indicators and methodology for evaluation of the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia Sustainability CIT, Government of the Republic of Macedonia 4 ACTION PLAN This Action Plan entails all projects, pilot projects, initiatives or programmes, divided by the previously stated pillars, where in an identical manner they are represented, linked to the realisation of a specific objective from the Strategy, responsible authority of the activity, other participants in the realisation, the time of implementation, financial projection, as well as critical factors for the implementation, the sources of financing and potential risks in respect to the Expected O utcomes.

But not an   idea whose time has come...\"   Victor Hugo   Beginning with the National Information Society Policy (NISP) of the Republic of Macedonia through the process of preparing the Strategy for Information Society Development and the Action Plan, the urgency for rapprochement of the Republic of Macedonia towards the Information Society is promoted, entailing national engagement of all key entities in the Republic of Macedonia.   In the process of creation of the Strategy and the Action Plan we start from our reality and local environment requirements, based on realistic skills assessment, resources and potentials of all entities in the Information Society building process.   Today, the globalisation courses have divided the world in two zones: stagnation and development zone, which have a decisive impact on the position of individual countries, as well as on their subjectivity. Those countries that failed in the articulation of resources needed for the development by using modern Information Communication Technologies, will nevertheless remain in the stagnation zone, failing to keep up the pace with the modern world.  Where the Republic of Macedonia shall be in the following period, shall depend on the application and implementation of the Strategy for Information Society Development.  The process of creation of this strategic document is supported by UNDP and FOSIM through implementation of the Project for Formulation of the National Strategy on Information Technologies for Development.  The Strategy and the Action Plan have been prepared in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the Republic of Macedonia:   • Declaration accepted by Member States of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, signed in Ljubljana on 4th June 2002;   • Agenda for Information Society Development for the countries of Southeast Europe, adopted in Belgrade 20th October 2002;  • Conclusions of the Ministerial Conference for Electronic Administration, Athens, 2003;  • Declaration adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia \"E-Declaration 2002,   Recommendations on accelerated development of Information Society and Digital Economy in the Republic of Macedonia as national priority\";  • Action Plan of the Committee for Information Technology 2003 - 2007; • Action Plan and Declaration of the World Summit on Information Society, Geneva, 2003; • Adopted concept for E-Government by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, 2004.   In the process of preparation of the Strategy, the following EU documents and recommendations were used:  7  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • The Council of Europe, Lisbon Summit in March 2000, established the basic building blocks of e-Europe, a concept that represents an obligation not only for EU Member States, but also for candidate states for EU membership;   • European Commission Action Plan, eEurope+ 2003, and • European Commission Action Plan eEurope2005; • Draft Action Plan of the European Commission, i-2010.  The Strategy and the Action Plan shall be accepted and adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, on the basis of which the responsibilities shall be defined for all entities in the process of building the Information Society. This document shall contribute towards linking the activities in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) domain in the Republic of Macedonia with the programmes, projects and Structural Funds of the European Union.   According to the structure, the document consists of two components: Strategy and Action Plan for Information Society Development, whereas the Strategy comprises of the basic development directions divided in 7 pillars (Infrastructure, E-business, E-Government, E-education, E-health, E- citizen, Legislation). Each of these pillars is built around the current state of affairs, objectives, strategic measures and responsible authorities with List of Priority Projects, programmes, initiatives or pilot projects. The areas relating to Public and Private Sector Reforms are a separate part of the document, as well as the priority areas for achieving sustainability of the Strategy for Information Society Development, starting from the need of having long-term sustainability of the Information Society development in the Republic of Macedonia, where the priority areas entailing actions for achieving the objectives are defined and explained. Priority projects and defined measurable indicators are provided in the Action Plan, listed according to the same timetable of the previously stated pillars.   The Strategy should provide for efficient implementation and ICT practice for all entities in the Republic of Macedonia, through realisation of priority projects defined in the Action Plan.   8  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN      1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INFORMATION   SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT  ....It is better to be roughly   right than precisely wrong...   Leif Edvinsson   The key challenge in the Strategy building process is defining the economic, social and political  vision of the knowledge based society, through ICT development and application in all spheres of life,  thereby creating modern and efficient services for the citizens and the business community.   In order to achieve the vision and mission as defined in the NISP, the following strategic  objectives are envisaged to be achieved by 2007:  • Entirely liberalised market for electronic-communication services (2005);  • Significantly increased number of Internet users;  • Established electronic public services;  • Implemented priorities for the purposes of sustainability of the Information Society   Development Strategy and Action Plan;  • Revision of the Strategy in 2007 according to the EU recommendations of the Action Plan i-2010.  The basic pre-requisite is creation of a modern, easily accessible and acceptable ICT-  infrastructure, available under equal and nondiscriminatory conditions through acceptable rates for  Internet access and access to other electronic communication services that will enable communication  between the business entities, citizens, public administration and non-Governmental sector through  precisely defined protocols.   The strategy should provide a better economic development through securing improved  economic efficiency, competitiveness and profitability via reorganised and improved business processes  with appropriate models for e-business implementation in companies.   The e-Government concept stems from the e-Europe framework, which means that the  Government should be the first one to initiate the entire process in order to demonstrate determination  for implementation of the underlined concept. Efficient and transparent Government, open for co-  operation with citizens - that is the concept that will provide better electronic services for the citizens  and the business community, a concept that will encourage economic and social prosperity.   The process of creating a modern and flexible educational and research system, as well as of  encouraging the ICT orientation in the education, science and culture is the most expensive and long-  term process that shall increase the percentage of ICT literacy of citizens, simultaneously providing a  continuous development of the National Academic Research Network as responsible authority of  modern and efficient functioning of entities in the filed of education at national and global level.  11  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Establishment and improvement of communications amongst entities in the Health Sector and creation of flexible environment for continuous service improvements through building electronic services for citizens with access to a significant number of information on various diseases, from a long- term perspective, may change the paradigm - people will be more informed and will use preventive means, which will contribute towards reduction of the number of ill persons.   In order to enable the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia to be factors in the Information Society, it will be necessary to create coherent policies so that all sectors will be able to offer e-services that will be unified, standardised, user-friendly, irrespective of the software platform, available for all citizens regardless of their location and social status, taking the citizens' needs into account, whilst ICT- tools shall assist the citizens in their participation in all social processes, as well as in the process of decision-making at a local and national level.   An important precondition for implementation of the strategic objectives is adoption of a legislation harmonised with the international conventions and agreements to which the Republic of Macedonia had acceded to or had ratified. It is of utmost importance that a special Law on Information Society is enacted, by which an institutional framework for founding of an Information Society Agency, an Inter-ministerial Council and a National Council will be established, as well as adoption of legislation entirely harmonised with the EU Directives related to information society and knowledge- based economy.  The CIT and the National Task Force for Information Society1 shall continue with coordination of activities for information society building until the previously stated institutions and bodies become operational.  1 A Task Force, established with the Project for Formulation of a National Strategy on Information Society Technologies for Development, consisting     of 31 experts from Governmental institutions, the private sector, education and science, as well as the civil sector   12  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN      2 DIRECTIONS   2.1 INFRASTRUCTURE  ...Mind with its knowledge is the true  capitalistic tool of reality. Thus in future  ideas will create money, and not objects...   C. Handy  2.1.1 Current situation  The existing infrastructure in the Republic of Macedonia in general terms includes the fixed public telecommunication networks, public mobile telecommunication networks and networks offering Internet access and other telecommunication signals transmission.   The fixed public telecommunication network of AD \"Makedonski Telecomunikacii\" is based on 100%  digital exchanges offering voice and data transmission, and a wide range of various services (voice mail, conference calls, emergency lines, 0800 lines (\"green numbers\"), 08xy (\"blue numbers\"), fixed telephony prepaid cards etc.   Since October 1997 the provision of Internet services in the Republic of Macedonia has been liberalised through awarding concessions for data transmission, so that today five major Internet Service Providers are offering Internet services. There are a total of 126,000 Internet users in the Republic of Macedonia2.  In the Republic of Macedonia 65 CATV concessions have been awarded. Two concessions were awarded for mobile telephony; the services are offered by the operators \"Cosmofon\" and \"Mobimak\". The total number of mobile telephony users is 776,000, which is more than the number of fixed telephony users which is about 525,0003.  Credit cards usage is considered as a privilege to a small number of citizens, and those who are credit card holders hardly ever use them for payment via Internet.  Usage and utilization of the basic communications infrastructure in the local self-Government units is at a minimal level. Out of a total of 124 mayors, e-mail was used by 44 of them, only 23 used web-addresses, which means that less than 35.4%  have been using e-mail, and less than 18.6%  were presented on a web-site4.  The State Statistical Office is conducting a research on the situation regarding the Information- Communications Technologies (ICT)5, thereby providing a more realistic picture about the part referring to the situation with the information-communication technologies and their utilisation, which will provide useful information in the creation of future development plans.  2 www.sei.gov.mk Sector for European Integration - Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Answers to the EC Q uestionnaire, referring to the  part for telecommunications and information technology   3 www.sei.gov.mk Sector for European Integration - Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Answers to the EC Q uestionnaire, referring to the  part for telecommunications and information technology   4 Research within the frames of the Project E-governance at a local level in the Republic of Macedonia, conducted in co-operation with UNDP,  Ministry of Local Self-Government, Committee for Information Technology - CIT and CSGU (Community of the Self-Government Units), 2004   5 Statistical ICT research conducted by the State Statistical Office in the Republic of Macedonia (ICT-1 for enterprises; ICT-2 for financial institutions;  ICT-3 for households; ICT-4 for state bodies, institutions and organisations)     15  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    2.1.2 Objectives  In the Republic of Macedonia, many state institutions, the local self-Government as well as different institutes use geographic information systems - GIS-technology; however, there are neither rulebooks nor standards for creation, keeping and maintenance of GIS-data by the state institutions.   The basic activity to be implemented in the area of Infrastructure is provision of an appropriate environment for development of a modern, easily accessible and acceptable ICT infrastructure, available to all entities under equal and nondiscriminatory conditions and affordable prices. Advanced infrastructure and increased Internet usage, as well as usage of the other electronic communication services can be provided through the following:   • O1.01. acceptable prices for usage of Internet and other electronic-communications services; • O1.02. continuous and sustainable ICT-infrastructure support; • O1.03. Introduction of Protocol for electronic communications between business entities,   citizens, public administration and non-Governmental sector.  The ICT-infrastructure is to be built around the following three pillars:   • Legal infrastructure; • Technology and applications; and • Human resources.   Figure No. 1 - Infrastructure pillars  The effective application of the information-communication technologies shall be based on legislation harmonised with the EU legislation. The regulation should create a suitable environment for infrastructure development, stimulate the development and application of new technologies and liberalise the market for electronic and communication services.  In connection with the infrastructure part, the legal regulation should provide the following:  • Establishment and implementation of standards and systems for electronic records, their  management and archiving;  • Using a central electronic register of registries or databases (so-called register of registries); • Building the physical telecommunications infrastructure, in compliance with the principles of  transparency, efficiency and effectiveness; • Encouraging web-services by using ID cards and PKI; • Linking all Governmental and public institutions.  16  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Necessary legal  regulation for:  Educated ICT-staff  for infrastructure maintenance  Educated ICT users  Management staff with ICT knowledge   Technology and  applications    Infrastructure  Human resources   Database   Authority for   certificates  ID-cards   ICT-management   Standards  Protocols  Development of:  - physical infrastructure;  - applications and    data development.    Technology and applications  In the part referring to network technologies, it is necessary to envisage the aspects of access, connectivity, security, management, upgrading, network expansion and user support.  Human resources  Apart from the technology development in infrastructure, a continuous development of the ICT- staff that manages and administers that infrastructure, is necessary. All state and local institutions should appoint a person or a team responsible for monitoring and implementation of the Strategy, for development of infrastructure and public services, for co-operation with the Information Society Agency and the other institutions responsible for implementation of the Strategy and of the projects.  There is a lack of professional managers within the institutions, who will take care of the professional upgrading of the employees, of the training and education needs, of monitoring the training success.  The management staff should be trained in order to use the information-communication technologies in its day-to-day operations, as well as to create favourable climate for greater use of technologies by the employees in their daily activities and communication.  ICT- development priorities  One of the basic priorities in the infrastructure development is the establishment of a backbone electronic communications network at the level of the Republic of Macedonia, which will connect all public and Governmental institutions. Given that infrastructure development is a long-term process, the construction of this network would be conducted in phases. According to the Action Plan, till 2007, the priority is to build a central network that will connect all ministries, Governmental institutions and agencies at a physical level, and at a level of applications, as well as for data exchange. The development of this network would be simultaneous with the development of projects from the Action Plan regarding the other pillars for e-education, e-health and e-citizens.  Infrastructure development in public and Governmental institutions should contribute towards more efficient and cost-effective services for the citizens. Application usage shall contribute to redesigning of operational processes, introduction of project management for more efficient usage of the infrastructure and the services, as well as for more efficient and transparent functioning of the public administration.  The National infrastructure development is to enable regional interconnection for the purposes of development of a regional e-business environment, and is also to provide access to services in the rural and underdeveloped areas in the country.  It is also necessary to focus the activities on the development of human and institutional capacities, in order to secure prompt and efficient methods for responding to the requests of the rapid technological development through expert and other type of training, as well as high education for achieving the necessary competencies and skills.   17  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Infrastructure development plans in the public administration should be implemented in co- operation with the scientific institutions and Universities by using advanced technologies. Besides of the Government, MARNET should also have the leading role for this part with support of the private and public sector.  Awareness raising and dissemination of knowledge related to the opportunities and advantages from ICT usage both among the public administration employees and services, and among beneficiaries, is of utmost importance for the information society development.  2.1.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities  The usage of information-communication technologies shall improve the quality, availability and promptness of the public administration operations related to the citizens' needs, and with that, shall increase the efficient work of the public sector institutions.  The dynamics of activities to be carried out in the infrastructure part is divided into long-term and short-term activities.  Short-term activities  The short-term activities have been covered with the Action Plan till 2007. First, it is necessary to create a favourable environment for construction of the necessary backbone infrastructure, and with that, of the information society development. This infrastructure should enable linking of Governmental institutions, which shall offer a variety of electronic services, i.e. create the necessary contents which will influence the increased Internet usage. The number of Internet users will increase if the citizens need and benefit from the electronic services usage, but also the possibility to access those services.   The development and management of this infrastructure is responsibility of the Information Society Agency in co-operation with the National and Inter-ministerial Councils.  The short-term activities include activities necessary for full market liberalisation, adoption of the necessary legal acts and secondary legislation. This particularly refers to the enforcement of obligations from the Law on Electronic Communications and the Law on Electronic Data and Electronic Signature, in the part for adoption of secondary legislation in order to provide registration of companies that have a prepared system for issuing electronic signature certificates, as accredited publishers.  It is necessary to introduce services which require usage of ID-cards (registration of cars, issuing of licences, financial transactions, personal documents, tax payment…). Each Governmental institution, on its own web-site, should offer the citizens an opportunity for electronic services which will be developed and promoted on a long-term basis, thereby increasing the number of Internet users.  Furthermore, it is necessary to initiate the operations of the Electronic Communications Agency as soon as possible, since the Agency is to act as a regulatory body on the market for electronic communications and services, whereas it is necessary for the Agency to be structured in an efficient manner in order to be able to meet the requests for regulation and coordination of the overall processes and changes in the electronic communications market.  18  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    19  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  The efficient regulation of the electronic communication market, as well as the legal regulation enforcement, shall create favourable climate for competition development, and with that, reduction of the Internet access rates, as well as quality service improvement.  Infrastructure development is to promote partnership between the public and private sector. The advantages offered by Internet are more than evident, due to which it is necessary to carry out initiatives and actions for increasing the number of Internet users. With Internet-services implementation, the local and state administration will be enabled to unburden the traditional window desks and facilitate their operations, thereby reducing the duration of administrative procedures.  In order to have a continuous infrastructure development it is necessary to keep up with the trends in the technology domain, i.e. broadband services (digital subscriber line), WDM-optic technologies, digital subscriber lines - DSL- lines, using Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, data transfer through existing protocols FR, IP, ATM, grid-infrastructure and other advanced technologies that provide service quality; increased usage of xDSL, UMTS, VoIP, VoD, VPN, WLAN and other types of technologies, as well as their implementation in projects.  The infrastructure management is a continuous process and it is necessary to take into consideration all elements for information-communication solution, such as:  • Hardware and applications development; • Securing a budget for infrastructure expansion and upgrading; • Introduction of standards relating to ICT; • Infrastructure safety aspects, referring to the physical equipment and the data itself; • Balanced infrastructure development, as well as professional development of the ICT-staff,   employees and all persons using the infrastructure.  The implementation, development, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure should be analysed from the aspect of physical infrastructure, as well as from the aspect of data and applications. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce standards, protocols, procedures that will consider these two aspects related to infrastructure, i.e. technology and applications.  In order to make e-services more effective and more efficient, it is necessary to introduce ICT- infrastructure management, which will provide consistency for the e-services and users' needs, which, on the other hand, leads to greater productivity.  ICT-infrastructure management should provide for the following:  • Designing and planning that will provide guidelines for infrastructure development and  installation, and will thereby meet the needs from all aspects of a given business;  • mplementation and development according to the development plans; • Daily infrastructure maintenance; • Technical support - structure and support processes for guaranteeing the ICT-infrastructure   provided services.  The infrastructure introduction and implementation poses high level demands regarding security, validity, quality, standardisation, connectivity etc., which, on the other hand, will have indirect impact on the increased application of advanced IT-solutions in other sectors as well.    For achieving an efficient infrastructure development, the following standards referring to the  ICT-operations domain have to be adopted: ISO 12207, ISO 9126, ISO 9294, ISO 1335-5, ISO  15288, ISO17799, ISO 9001-2000. Besides of the introduction of standards, which will contribute  towards common understanding between actors in the process of infrastructure development and  utilisation, it is necessary to create technical-terminology vocabularies referring to the domain of  information-communication technology.  Long-term activities  Providing funds necessary for continuous infrastructure development and building, on a state   level, as well as for international network interconnection.  Long-term activities are to be coordinated with the activities and tasks of the Government   regarding the EU approximation. Given that these are complex tasks, a serious and responsible  approach is necessary towards creation of solutions.  All investors performing works related to construction of infrastructure (road, railway, pipeline etc.)  and facilities are obliged to provide physical space for setting up an electronic communication  infrastructure.  Introduction of mechanisms for encouraging a corporate social responsibility while building   the communication infrastructure, whereby priority shall be given to projects that foresee   construction of infrastructure near institutions of public interest (kindergartens, schools,   hospitals, libraries, pension institutions etc.).  The legislation should not be considered as obstacle for development and introduction of new  technologies; it is necessary to reduce the gap between the regulation and the new trends in  technology, as well as greater flexibility of the legal framework in terms of adopting secondary  legislation which will provide faster introduction of new technologies.  Responsible Authorities  The main stakeholders and responsible authorities for infrastructure development would be the  following:  • Government of the Republic of Macedonia;  • MARNET;  • Ministry of Transport and Communications;  • Ministry of Interior;  • Ministry of Defence;  • Ministry of Education and Science;  • Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning;  • Scientific institutes;  • Universities;  • Information Society Agency;  • Electronic Communications Agency;  • Private sector;  • MASIT.  20  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    21  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders   PR1.01 1 Activities for providing and increase in the use of fast and cost-effective Internet  Infrastructure C1.01  Government of Republic of Macedonia, Information Society Agency  PR1.02 1 Determining the existing capacities, planned activities in the infrastructure part in the public administration and the public enterprises and telecommunication services operators  E-Government and E-education  Information Society Agency  PR1.03 1 Design and implementation of a backbone network for the needs of the Governmental institutions, of the public administration and the private sector  E-Government, physical infrastructure  Information Society Agency  PR1.04 2 Assessing the necessary legal framework for the development of ICT-infrastructure  Legislation and e- business  Ministry of Transport and Communications   PR1.05 1 Structural changes of the Telecommunications Directorate and its transformation into Agency, with monitoring of its operations  E-Government,  e-citizens, legislation, e-business  Electronic Communications Agency  PR1.06 1 Analysis for introduction of all appropriate standards connected to ICT use (data, services, infrastructure, management, security, documentation)  All pillars Information Society Agency  PR1.07 2 Preparation of educational CD- material for using e-services  All pillars Private sector  PR1.08 2 Defining the requirements for ICT- resources and human resources within the institutions  E-Government,  e-citizens  Information Society Agency  IN1.01 2 Analysing the concession obligations with AD \"Makedonski telekomunikacii\" and the possibility for reallocation of the obligations in other projects  E-Government,  e-citizens  Ministry of Transport and Communications  IN1.02 2 Review of all current projects and activities related to ICT at the level of the Republic of Macedonia  Legislation, infrastructure  Information Society Agency  IN1.03 2 Reducing the administrative procedures for obtaining approvals necessary for construction of infrastructure of public interest (priority projects)  Infrastructure and legislation  Information Society Agency  2.1.4 Defined projects for infrastructure    2.2 E-BUSINESS  …In a time of drastic change it is the  learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists…  Eric Hoffer  Electronic business stands for an innovative way of enterprise operations through active utilization of information-communication technologies and digitalization of business processes.   Business and Governments in the developed countries are already undertaking steps that will ensure their own competitiveness on the national and global market through introduction of e-business.  How fast the enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia introduce and react to changes in technology, partnership relations and relations with customers, shall be determined by their own success, and even their endurance in the contemporary business conditions.   Attracting foreign direct investments and the export increase impose, more than ever, the Macedonian enterprises to change the way of operation, increase the ICT application and actively participate in the implementation of e-business in their operation.   2.2.1 Current situation  By 31.12.2004, 165,977 business entities are registered in the Republic of Macedonia. Out of them 40,2 % are enterprises, 39,7 % are trade companies, 11,9 % are individual traders and 8,2 % others6, out of which 56,201 enterprises are operational. 98 % of these companies are small, and 2 % are large enterprises. There is no precise information on the number of enterprises that have and use the Internet access.   More important facts characterizing the current situation in the e-business domain in the Republic of Macedonia are the following:  • Large enterprises are implementing software solutions while making efforts to digitalize their own existing business processes at an enterprise level, whilst small enterprises implement  partial solutions which digitalize certain functions or parts of functions, mostly finances and accounting;  • Banks are in an initial phase of offering e-banking and providing payment transactions  between banks and enterprises and between enterprises;  • The number of payment cards issued by banks has increased, however, a large part of the  cards cannot be used for payment via Internet;  • The appropriate infrastructure for implementation of Public Key Infrastructure is existing, and the legislation for its support is in its final phase;  • Several Internet-based shops have been established (office equipment, wide consumption  goods…);  • The new Law on Electronic Communications has adopted;  6 Source: State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia (http://www.stat.gov.mk)  22  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • Among the Macedonian enterprises, there is a great number of partners to big international ICT-companies;  • Several Macedonian enterprises are developing business-software solutions for national  and foreign markets;  • Large part of the enterprises did not reorganise and digitalise their business processes,  according to the world trends and e-business standards;  • Enterprises did not define the ways for linking with their own business partners in  procurement and sale;  • As regards the e-business implementation possibilities and methods, there are no  information for the enterprises on the market situation;  • The coordination between banks, enterprises and the Government is at a low level in  respect to which directions and activities for e-business implementation in enterprises shall  be considered.  2.2.2 Objectives  The National e-business Strategy should provide guidelines for introduction of e-business that would improve the economic development by providing better economic efficiency, competitiveness and profitability through the following:  • Significantly reorganized and improved business-processes with appropriate models for e- business implementation in enterprises; and   • Electronic linking among business entities, citizens, public administration and the non- Governmental sector.  The targets to be achieved are as follow s: O2.01 - Established mechanism for electronic connection, electronic payment and e-business  implementation between the enterprises and other participants in the business processes. By  achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following: mutual electronic exchange of information, offers, orders, invoices; cost reduction, improved mutual co- operation and improved possibilities for electronic co-operation with its foreign associates.  O2.02 - Established centres in Macedonia which will assist the enterprises during the e- business implementation. By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following:  obtaining information, advices and guidelines for initiating the enterprise preparation for e- business; reorganisation and restructuring of processes; e-business implementation;  continuous improvement; linking with other enterprises and institutions.   O2.03 - Established continuous information system for enterprises in Macedonia about the  possibilities offered by the e-business.  By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following:  access to e-business information, case studies of successful e-business implementation,  publishing information about successes and employed possibilities.  O2.04 - E-business implementation in several enterprises in Macedonia through  reorganisation and digitalisation of the internal business-processes.  By achieving this objective the enterprises in Macedonia would be enabled for the following:  illustration of e-business implementation through practical examples, reduced costs, increased market competition, as well as creating a basis for continuous process improvement and  market needs adjustment.  23  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    2.2.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities  The e-business Strategy success also depends on the creation and implementation of appropriate reforms, measures and projects from the other pillars that would contribute in the process of creation of a new environment. This new environment will enable full e-business implementation in Macedonia, and will represent the basis for continuous changes and promotions.  The strategic measures to be undertaken for the purposes of successful Strategy implementation are as follows:  Appropriate e-business coverage with legislation. The Government is soon expected to create and adopt a legislation that will precisely define  the electronic signature, electronic payment, digital certificates, security infrastructure, intellectual property protection, fight against computer crime, consumer protection and other legislation necessary for appropriate e-business implementation. This legislation should be created by taking into consideration the legislation of the European Union, the USA and the UN recommendations.   Adapting the education for e-business. The educational institutions and enterprises should create a process for joint creation of  appropriate curricula, ICT-research support, two-way knowledge transfer, establishment of ICT-labs.  Appropriate and accessible infrastructure for e-business implementation. The possibilities for wireless Internet and cable broadband Internet should be developed and  accessible, in the city and rural areas, which will provide all business entities with a possibility to be actively involved in the e-business. Enterprises will be able to completely use the opportunities offered by the e-business through this infrastructure, which will minimise the infrastructure obstacles and provide more space for successful realisation of the initiatives and innovations of the enterprises for e- business.  Creating a body for monitoring and coordination of participants in the business  processes for the purposes of appropriate e-business development and implementation in Macedonia. This body would be composed of all of the stakeholders in the e-business processes and would  have an active role in the development of e-business and the information society in Macedonia. Based on the available information, this body should offer corrective guidelines and proposals for new plans, measures and actions for successful coordination of the activities in the entire information society, and for achieving and complementing the objectives of the different pillars.  Appropriate and available e-banking and e-transaction methods. Banks and other financial institutions are to extend the number of electronic services offered to  the enterprises. Special emphasis is to be placed on the complete development of the electronic banking, as well as on the creation of conditions by the banks so as to strongly support the e-banking application by the enterprises.  The institutions and organisations that are to assist the enterprises in Macedonia in the process of appropriate e-business implementation will be the responsible authorities of all of the above stated activities:  • Large enterprises in Macedonia;  • Chamber of Commerce in Macedonia and other chambers;   24  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • MASIT; • Educational institutions; • Financial institutions; • Information Society Agency; • Electronic Communications Agency; • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Administration bodies; • Local self-Government; • Non-Governmental organisations.  2.2.4 Defined projects  The following projects and activities have to be implemented in order to successfully achieve the objectives:  25  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders   PR2.01 1 Defining standards for electronic invoice and electronic order  e- business O2.01  Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia - MASIT  PR2.02 1 Analysis of e-readiness of Macedonia for e-business  e- business O2.02 and O2.03  NSPK  PR2.03 2 Business-model development for reorganisation and digitalisation of the business-processes and  e-business implementation  e- business O2.04 and O2.01  Information Society Agency, MASIT  PR2.04 2 Training for introduction of ICT and e-business in companies  e- business O2.02, O2.03 and O2.01  Entrepreneurship Agency / MASIT  PR2.05 3 E-business promotion in Macedonia  e- business O2.03  MASIT, Information Society Agency   PR2.06 Analysing the need for development of an e-business research centre  e- business O2.02 and O2.03  Universities  PR2.07 Guide for e-business implementation in small and medium enterprises (SME)  e- business O2.01 and O2.02  Universities Consultancy Body  IN2.01 Organisation and participation at forums for establishment of contacts and information exchange at a national and international level.  e- business O2.03  Information Society Agency  IN2.02 Establishment of an association / foundation of entities interested in realisation of particular projects  e- business O2.01 and O2.03  Association/ Foundation  IN2.03 Placing information for business entities in the Republic of Macedonia on the Central Registry web-site  e-business  O2.03  Central Registry of Republic of Macedonia    2.3 E-GOVERNMENT  …Our mission is to support business  transformation of the G overnment, so it can  provide better and more efficient public services…   Tony Blair, May 2004   E-Government is much more than application of new modern ICT-technologies, it actually represents a fundamental transformation of the Government's manner of operation and the way the public administration is reasoning and acting, in order to create high quality services for citizens, businesses and public administration.  While shaping its own needs, the road towards e-Government requires active participation and partnership of all entities: Government, citizens and the private sector. Each responsible and democratic Government must make efforts for more efficient and more transparent administration operation, through client oriented services, achieving standards for better life-style quality, faster economic and social development.   Service users are not interested in the structure volume, type of connection and public administration organisation. The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as priority, will provide simple electronic services for the citizens, business and the public administration. The benefits from e-Government implementation necessarily lead towards recognition of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), that would provide increased communication, exchange of experiences and knowledge between all entities in the public administration, that would lead to a higher level of transparency and efficiency of the functioning of the Government, state administration bodies and local self-Government bodies.   E-Government is an expensive, long and uncertain process, the implementation of which, in case it is delayed, will be even more expensive. It is a reform process of transformation overcoming the legislative and control obstacles, financial, technological and digital divide obstacles, as well as obstacles due to resistance and conflict of interest. Lack of funds, resources and knowledge is often the case in the process of realisation of this concept. The worldwide analysis have shown that the transformation could be unsuccessful due to lack of positive energy, a large extent of knowledge, efforts, time and significant amount of funds for the purposes of creation of a favourable environment for implementation of this concept. It has to be emphasized that successful realisation requires endeavours and strong leadership from the highest state institutions.  The process of e-Government introduction should be integrated with the process of public administration reform, and it is necessary to consider the potential e-Government implementation barriers on time, in order to promptly find the appropriate solutions.  2.3.1 Current situation  The information systems in the Government and the ministries currently appear to be like isolated islands without a common basis that would link them. Parts of the Governmental institutions do not use local networks, and those that use it have special Internet connection. There is no computer  26  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    network that connects the Governmental institutions, and there is a great part of systems that were inherited and are incompatible. This type of organisation obstructs the efficient electronic data exchange between the Governmental institutions, apart from the e-mail usage, which is the only tool for electronic data exchange. The situation with the information systems in the local self-Government is at its minimum. Physical infrastructure exists in only a small part of the local self-Government. There is no possibility for any structural electronic data exchange between the Governmental institutions at the central and local level.  There is no e-Government portal, as a single place for all transactions from the citizens and the legal entities to the Government, which would replace the current filling in of forms and applications for the needed services in the Governmental institutions. There are several reasons for this, out of which the most important ones are the following: non-existence of an infrastructure that would enable secure data collection, publishing and distribution of data by the Governmental institutions, low information system management level in the institutions, as well as management information systems.  Greater part of the Governmental institutions are characterised with a low level of ICT-literacy as regards the administration employees, as well as with non-existence of a specialised ICT-staff which would implement the technical part of this concept. The ICT-equipment situation is also critical, as well as the obsoleteness of a part of the existing equipment. The basic security procedures were installed with many faults, the information system security level is unsatisfactory, and there is no standardised security infrastructure.  It is necessary to mention the different types of Internet connection, and the non-existing computer network that would link the Governmental institutions. The Internet access currently represents an individual problem for each of the institutions, because MARNET-network does not meet the institutions' needs. Such approach leads to a variety of solutions for Internet-access and to increased costs, the possibility for unauthorised access, etc.  In the Republic of Macedonia, there are many state institutions, local self-Government units and institutes that use GIS-technology, such as: the State Authority for Geodesic Works, Ministry of Defence, PE for Spatial and Urban Plans, State Statistical Office, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, AD \"Electric Power Company\" of Macedonia, many communal enterprises, especially water-supplying enterprises etc. There is no unified GIS-solution among the Governmental institutions which would create a unique GIS-system.  Currently, the standard for protection of the information systems and the quality level of the services provided by the Government is not being applied.  The necessary conditions for enforcement of the Law on Electronic Signature have not yet been created, and currently there is no possibility to accredit an institution as a certificate issuing  authority.  According to the researches carried out within the Project e-Governance at a local level in the Republic of Macedonia, carried out in co-operation with UNDP, the Ministry of Local Self-Government, the Committee for Information Technology and the CSGU - Community of the Self-Government Units in 2004, the situation in the local self-Government is characterised with a low level of physical infrastructure, non-existence of information systems management, lack of ICT experts, minimal Internet usage and local administration employees with a minimal or zero level of ICT-literacy.  27  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    2.3.2   Objectives  Efficient and transparent Government operations that shall provide more quality electronic services for the citizens and the business-community through:  1. O3.01 participation of citizens in the information society building; 2. O3.02 satisfactory infrastructure level; 3. O3.03 legal and institutional framework for information society development; 4. O3.04 logical infrastructure for advanced ICT-solutions and network connection of   Governmental institutions; 5. O3.05 electronic and online-transactions for e-Government services that encourage   economic and social prosperity; 6. O3.06 increased number of ICT-experts and increased level of ICT-literacy in the public   administration.  2.3.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities  The e-Government concept could be successful only if the Government becomes aware and implements the activities in relation to the development priorities in the society, which will provide broader citizen support, facilitate the financing and reduce the costs.  In order to remove possible problems and barriers in the e-Government implementation process, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism that would periodically measure the implementation level.   The level of capability of the Government for e-Government implementation depends on the initial project financing, which would generate electronic services. It is also necessary to have a clear view of the costs, investments and assessments regarding time and methods for returning the investment.   Furthermore, the employees in the public administration will have to be capable of providing e-Government services. Besides of the need for possessing information-communication technology knowledge, it is also necessary to possess project management knowledge.  Figure No 2 - Physical infrastructure  28  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  InternetParliament  City of Skopje  State and Government  Institutions  Local Institutions  Educational Institutions  Ministries  Government  IP Network    The analysis of the strategic measure and the responsible authorities for each of the foreseen e-Government objectives is as follows:  1. Citizen participation in the Information Society building.  Citizens have a key role in the information society building process, not only as services beneficiaries, but also as participants in the process, realised through the following activities:  • Web-portal design for participation of the citizens in debates, asking questions and  initiating new ideas within the frames of the local and central Government (e-democracy);   • Participation of experts in the process of proposing laws, by-laws and other initiatives through  designing an e-legislation portal for attorneys, barristers, scientists and others (e-legislation).  2. Infrastructure at a satisfactory level.  In respect to the public administration (Government, state administration bodies and local self- Government units) requires conducting specific activities for ICT-infrastructure provision, that involves the following:  • Provision of advanced ICT-solution in the Governmental institutions, including ICT-hardware and software equipment and information systems;  • Provision of a single computer network for electronic data exchange between the  Governmental institutions and creation of pre-requisites for confidential, secure and safe  communication;  • Providing a centralised Internet access node; • Providing a system for electronic documents exchange and management and information   exchange between the Governmental institutions; • Equipping the municipalities with ICT-equipment and connection to Internet with function of  public access points; • Introduction of fast and cost-effective Internet.  3. Legal and institutional framework for Information Society development.  The provision of a legal framework by adopting a Law on Information Society is the prerequisite for initiating the implementation of this Strategy. The Government is to encourage the Information Society development through:   • Tax relieves for electronically provided ICT-technology services; • Stimulation measures aimed at reducing the Internet-access rate; • Introduction of standards for information systems protection ISO 17799, as well as the ISO  9001 standards for quality of services provided by the public administration in the Republic of Macedonia;  • Adopting a national policy on information-communication security and security certification of ICT-systems for classified information;  • Security projects for institutions; • Provision of accessibility to public information, acts, laws and documents in electronic   format, accessible and free of charge for all users; • Initiatives for creating contents that would attract the usage of on-line services by  the citizens.   29  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    The public administration reform in the Republic of Macedonia should commence by:  • Decision of the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia for introduction of ISO 9001  standard for public administration services;  • Decisions of the local self-Government councils for introduction of the ISO 9001 standard  for local self-Government administration services;  • Within a period of 6 months at the most, following the adoption of decisions for  introduction of the ISO 9001 standard, to adopt action plans for each institution  individually, by which the level of quality of provision of services for the citizens will be  raised, in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard implementation.  In order to have a successful implementation of the Strategy and the Action Plan, apart from the political consensus, the Government should be the leader in the implementation of the Strategy. In accordance with the Law on Information Society, an Information Society Agency shall be established, which, for the purposes of e-Government implementation, should realise the following activities:   • Synchronisation and coordination of ICT-projects and investments between the  Government, state administration bodies and local self-Government units;  • Ensuring a quality implementation of ICT-projects; • Encouraging local development for e-Government; • Introduction of solutions for measuring and monitoring administration productivity; • Introducing measurability of effects/investment return.   For the purposes of e-Government implementation, the Government will organise ICT units with adequate staff (Head of Unit and respective human resources) in each Governmental institution, and will establish a national body for information-communication security.  4. Logical infrastructure for advanced ICT-solutions and network connection between  Governmental institutions.  The State should always be a guarantor for the principles of information accessibility, free information flow between the public administration entities with continuous data updating and timely submission of information to other entities, according to previously defined and accepted standards. Due to that reason, the Government will undertake activities regarding the following:  • Preparation of a study for identification of priority administration processes/procedures  whereas by applying the advanced information-communication technologies the greatest  improvements can be made (implementation of solutions for computerisation of processes, reorganisation and modernisation);  • Channelling and defining the specific user requests in each state administration body by  methodological approach and preparation of a functional analysis for the ICT-infrastructure;  • Defining procedures and organisation for using the common existing ICT-infrastructure  between the bodies of the Governmental institutions in order to provide electronic  information and document exchange and to create pre-conditions for confidential, secure  and safe communication;   • Defining standards and architecture for e-Government applications and services; • Providing interoperability between the applications within the Governmental institutions and  interoperability between the applications with the Governmental institutions. This does not  mean defining of a unique platform for application design, but it means provision of a   30  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    recommendation for choices, unifying the Internet user interfaces and defining standards  for documents, information and services exchange. The use of advanced technologies is  recommended. Interoperability involves communication between the units of central and  local Government;  • Providing information systems management and Government knowledge management; • Partnership with the non-Governmental sector and the business community, which   represents a key element in the process of successful implementation and achieving of  efficient services. Redesigning of processes will enable the integration of new processes, on a vertical level, between the users of services and the Government, and on a horizontal  level, between the state institutions.  The provision of information must be in compliance with the following principles:  • Each entity must guarantee equal options for access to information; • To define a registry of all registries with rights and obligations for continuous updating; • The information must be officially secured and user-friendly; • The responsibility for public information validity must be strictly defined in order to increase  the information authenticity.  5. Electronic transactions for e-Government services that encourage economic and  social prosperity   The e-Government electronic transactions are offered by the Government, state administration bodies and the local self-Government units. This concept upholds the traditional methods of service provision, and it also establishes new channels through which the citizens, the business community and the other organisations will be served with faster, secure and more accessible services and information. New channels are identified through: call-centres, web-portals, one-stop shops, mobile devices, digital television, which must be integrated, web-technologies based. They include portal design for:  • Information on activities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Preparation and managing of the Government sessions; • Prompt information on amendments and MPs' questions; • All existing services for the citizens and the business community; • e-procurement system - a transparent public procurement system; • E-taxation system - submission of data to the Public revenue Office; • E-budget system, which would enable a transparent method of planning and monitoring of  budget funds allocation; • One-stop-shop for companies for their registration and day-to-day functioning.  Furthermore, the electronic transactions include the following:  • E-Government solutions, given that there are more mobile phone users than Internet users; • Solutions involving geographic information systems - GIS, i.e. that process information by   analysing the spatial component. With this, the INSPIRE-Initiative directives would be  followed, which is proposed by the European Commission for harmonisation of non- coordinated national approaches towards creation of geographic data in the Member  States of the European Union in order to unify all GIS-data sources, and to enable a  unified system for access and exchange of GIS-information and data from different servers  throughout Europe, created and organised by various institutions and organisations;  31  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • Electronic signature implementation in the process of inter-institutional communication,  through provision of certificate issuing authorities;  • Electronic online data delivery to the State Statistical Office (e-statistics), as well as online  data dissemination from the State Statistical Office;  • Establishing a unique access to the central registry of all data bases (registries) in the state  institutions;  • Introduction of ID Card as Smart Card for the citizens; • Provision of services by the authorised institutions, by using an ID Card; • Providing each citizen of the Republic of Macedonia with an official e-address   name.surname_xxx@ org.gov.mk (CRC - Central Registry of Citizens).  6. Increased number of ICT-experts and increased level of ICT-literacy in the public  administration  The Government shall organise the following activities:   • Employing ICT-staff with University level education; • Providing conditions for ICT-staff training for the latest ICT-technologies and operational   management techniques; • Providing conditions for ICT-training of the administration employees; • Planning investments for training the public administration employees through the Civil   Servants Agency; • Providing parameters for measuring the quality of ICT-literacy of the Government officials   through acceptance of world recognized standards for ICT-literacy (such as: ECDL  European Computer Driving Licence; Xpert and other).  Furthermore, the current challenge is the knowledge based economy, and the Government, as the leading force, must modernised in order to meet the new challenges. There are examples of different roads towards e-Government modernisation and implementation, however, the successful examples share certain common factors, such as: determination of the Government leaders to create capable administration, team work, openness and communicability with continuous connection and usage of the information sources by applying the ICT.   e-Government responsible authorities  • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • ministries; • Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia; • universities, technological and innovation centres; • Information Society Agency; • Civil Servants Agency; • municipalities and the City of Skopje; • State Statistical Office; • Public Revenue Office; • Central Registry; • KIBS; • NBRM; • banks; • Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia;  32  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • other chambers; • MASIT; • private sector; • non-Governmental organisations.  2.3.4 Defined projects  33  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders   PR3.01 1 Creating a web-portal for participation of citizens in the society building process (e-democracy)  E- Government O3.01  Government, General Secretariat, ministries  IN3.01 1 Government measures- initiatives for reducing the tax for IT-technology web (software) services  E- Government O3.03  Government  PR3.02 1 Defining standards and architecture for e-Government applications and pilot-projects  E- Government, Infrastructure O3.05  Government, CIT  PR3.03 1 Provision of a unique programme for electronic document & workflow management  E- Government O3.02  Government, CIT  PR3.04 1 Project - Provision of access to free of charge information regarding all laws and legal documents  E- Government O3.03  Government  PR3.05 1 ID Card introduction E- Government O3.06  Ministry of Interior  PR3.06 1 Web-portal design for all existing services for the citizens and the business community  E- Government O3.06  Government, General Secretariat, ministries  PR3.07 1 Employment and training of ICT-staff in the state administration  O3.06 Government, ministries   PR3.08 1 Training and certification for ICT literacy of the civil service  E- Government, E- education.

We are drowning in information,  but still we are hungry for knowledge...  John Nesbit  The current concept of knowledge based society increseases the need of professionals who, besides the needed expertise in certain field, posses good communication and social skills, are well informed, always ready to learn and are in position to manage the new situations.  Necessary preconditions for successful participation in the knowledge based society are the transformation of the educational piramide and creative use of the acquired knowledge and expertise, having also the ability to create original solutions. Therefore, the education has a central place as an indisputable key towards sustainable development, quality and competition. In this context the e- education is a new form of education focusing on the student. The innovative use of the information and communication technologies will improve the traditional system of learning by essential transformation of the curricula and the way of learning and will eliminate the boundaries among the student and the teacher and the school, the home and the place of work. This form of education is to enable skills and capacities in order to be able to function better in the modern world having global perspectives and broadmindedness.  The distance learning system, the e-learning, the lifelong learning and other flexible forms of learning, as well as the possibility of development and presentation of multimedia and multilingual contents are just some of the examples illustrating the place of the information and communication technologies in the new e-education.  2.4.1 Current Situation   The use of the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) in the education, science and culture in the Republic of Macedonia is at a unsatisfactory low level particularly in comparison with the developed countries in the European Union. This kind of situation is due to the lack of sufficient ICT equipment in the appropriate institutions. The larger number of the primary and high schools is neither connected to the Internet nor to any other intranet for exchange of information. Moreover, the situation is similar with the cultural institutions as well. The universities have common infrastructure and are connected to the Internet that is still on a very low level as regards the European Union standards and with the similar institutions in the wider environment.  In the existing educational structure in the Republic of Macedonia the information curricula are present neither at the appropriate level nor in the appropriate form. Moreover, there is no specialised faculty profiling experts in the area of the information technologies. It is evident that such structure of the educational system is not in a position of \"producing\" ICT staff with higher education, as well as other profiles of ICT professionals that are to be responsible for the introduction and the use of the ICT in the society. There are no certificate accreditation systems for ICT programmes and there is no impetus for their use.   The ICT knowledge among the teaching staff is also insufficient. The number of teachers using the information and communication technologies is very small, while the number of those using the ICT in the process of implementation of the curricula is just symbolical. The main reason is that the curricula are not adapted to the information technology and lack of the vision for the potentials of the transformations that the new technologies can promote in the education system at all.   In order to be able to create a knowledge based society, the education has to change and adopt. The use of the ICT in the educational process is also identified in the National Programme for  36  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    the Development of the Education in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015 as a precondition for the improvement of the efficiency in the education. Nonetheless, there is no comprehensive and essential analysis on the ICT importance and potentials in all areas of the educational process, and in particular regarding the ICT as the moving force of the transformations in the education through its overall integration in the educational system.  Currently there is neither an easily accessible, consistent and detailed source of information for all the ICT elements in the education in the Republic of Macedonia, nor access to the outcomes of the numerous activities and investments in this area up to date.   The aim of the part of the National Strategy regarding the e-education is to provide an answer to the challenges for development in this area - harmonised and aligned with the contemporary trends and standards in the European Union.   2.4.2 Objectives  The increased technological literacy, starting from the educational environment, shall transform the educational system, the results of which shall be productive citizens in the process of successful integration in the global information society. The realisation of the objectives of the National Strategy in the area of e-education is to contain several coordinated and mutually aligned activities as a precondition for their successful realisation:   1. Standards: a procedure of defining national and international standards in the area  of e-education and harmonization of the standards with the practices and the  recommendations of the European Union;  2. Legal regulation: establishment and adoption of the necessary legal framework for  realisation of the necessary activities;  3. Marketing and quality control: establishing and conducting a successful marketing  campaign for all the activities and monitoring the quality of their realisation.  The definition of the strategy in the area of e-education and its success is greatly  dependent on the realisation of the strategies in the other ICT pillars, as well as on the  realisation of certain preconditions.  Figure no.3 - Preconditions and objectives of the e-education Strategy  37  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Legal regulation  Standards  ICT staff ICT literacy   and contents  Educational  infrastructure  Marketing  and quality   control  Strategy on the development   of the information society   in the e-education  ADMINISTRATION  REALISATION OF THE OBJECTIVES    The objectives of the National Strategy for Information Society Development in the area of e- education are grouped in three groups: educational infrastructure, ICT staff and ICT literacy and contents. The realisation of the defined objectives for each of the groups will be performed by focusing on specific areas and activities.  Objectives in the area of the educational infrastructure: O.1. Better connection of the entities in the area of education, science and culture; O.2. Increase and standardisation of hardware and software equipment among the relevant  entities in the area of education, science and culture;  O.3. Fast and cost-effective access to Internet for all legal and natural entities participating in  the educational process; O.4. Development of management information system for education; O.5. Creation and support of the existing research and innovation centres and technology  transfer centres; O.6. Introduction of e-technologies certification centres.  Objectives in the area of ICT staff: O.7. Overview of the ICT presence in the primary and secondary school education; O.8. Promotion of the ICT contents in the primary and secondary school education,   curricula and profiling of the staff; O.9. Distance learning systems, e-learning, lifelong learning and flexible way of learning by  using ICT; O.10. Coordination and promotion of the ICT education in the higher education institutions,  specialised faculties and ICT curricula; O.11. Diminishing of the brain-drain of the newly educated staff;  Objectives in the area of ICT literacy and contents: O.12. Adjustment of the civil education with the aim of educating the citizens to use   the e-services; O.13. Provision of acquiring continuous digital literacy (ICT literacy) for all, by adapting to   certain professional needs; O.14. Introduction of national and foreign certificates for acquired ICT knowledge; O.15. Publishing ICT literature in standard and multimedia format; O.16. Creation and use of information in electronic form - library stocks also in the areas   related to the education: research institutions, museums and cultural institutions and  provision of virtual working environments.   2.4.3 Strategic measures and responsible authorities  Entities and responsible authorities for implementation of activities  In order to have a successful implementation of the National Strategy, coordination and participation of all relevant entities in the field of education is necessary. In the process of realisation of the given tasks these entities will be the primary responsible authorities and/or objects for the activities to be defined:  • Ministry of Education and Science; • Primary schools and high schools; • Universities, faculties and other institutions that provide a high-level education; • MASA (Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts);  38  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • Research centres and institutes; • MARNET (Macedonian Academic and Research Network); • NUL (National University Library); • District libraries; • Museum of Macedonia and district museums; • National technique of Macedonia; • Centres for continuous education; • Non-Governmental and citizens' organisations.  Institutional framework  Besides of the institutional framework defined in the part relating to sustainability of the National Strategy, an additional institutional support is necessary for the successful realisation of the part from the Strategy in connection with e-education.  • To redefine the status of the existing educational institutions (branches) which profile ICT- staff, as well as to transform those institutions into independent faculties.  • To establish a body for accreditation of centres and institutions for promoting and issuing  certificates in the field of ICT-education.  • To establish a centre for e-technologies, which would perform researches regarding the  quality and certification of all implemented solutions in the ICT domain in the State.  • Underline the importance of MARNET, and find solutions for institutional and sustainable  responsibilities and mechanisms for its proper functioning.   Strategic measures  In order to successfully realise the set objectives, the realisation of the following strategic measures is necessary according to the Programme defined in the Action plan:  Proteus-portal for sublimation of all activities in the e-education domain.  Existence of many donations and numerous projects for increasing the ICT use in all segments  of education, which are often uncoordinated and non-standardised, imposes a great need of coordinating and following of these activities from one central point from where you can get all information for different ongoing activities, as well as for those which should be initiated for implementation of the Strategy in place. This situation will be improved by creating the Proteus-portal, which would be the outline of all ICT-activities to be carried out in the education field.   In the field of educational infrastructure:   Better connection among entities from the field of education, science and culture.  The modern and technologically developed states have a developed ICT-infrastructure, especially  as regards entities in the filed of education. Having a continuous and fast Internet as communication tool with other educational institutions is one of the issues to which special attention is being paid.  Within the frames of that context, it is necessary to provide continuous development of the academic and university research network - MARNET on a national and international level, as well as providing it with an appropriate compatibility with the Pan-European networks.  This development would be accomplished by improving the organisational structure, further equipping, professionalisation, increasing the transparency and provision of financial stability of MARNET (through providing allocated funds from the Government). MARNET, reorganised in such a manner, should provide a continuous, cost-effective and quality information transfer between the entities in the state, as well as with the other educational entities worldwide.   39  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Increasing and standardisation of the hardware and software equipment within the  stated entities and provision of interoperability…  As a qualitative measure for the achieved results, we should strive towards the following:  providing a fast and cost-effective Internet-access for all legal and natural entities  participating in the educational process. Special emphasis is to be made on the need for meeting the standards and the positive practice  for Internet-accessibility in the education. To find and propose forms for free Internet access in the education as institutional benefit and as centres for web-culture and literacy dissemination. Special emphasis is on MARNET on the academic and research level.  Improving the operations of the research and innovation centres and the technology  transfer centres. Sublimating the actual situation, expertise and scientific-research and application capacities of  the research centres in the ICT domain. Promoting the priorities and coordination of directions for development of research centres and encouraging the development in the priority defined areas. Encouraging the technology transfer centres with specific assistance, through establishment of incubator-enterprises within the high-education institutions.  Implementation of up to date information systems for the educational environment at all levels and providing their interoperability…  Creating and implementing information management systems and defining standards on  interoperability and electronic connection of the administration between the institutions of the educational system on the appropriate levels (primary, high school, university). Defining the administrative tasks from and to the local and central Government centres, as well as the specialised institutions (State Statistical Office).  Integrating the existing networks of the local libraries, museums and cultural institutions, as well as the networks of the National Technology Development Centres Associations  (\"Narodna tehnika\") and NGO of Macedonia for ICT-education - free Internet access  through public e-points and establishment of clubs for contents development  To encourage establishment of centres with ICT-infrastructure as responsible authorities of the  activities for implementation of the Strategy objectives in the part for ICT-literacy and contents development within the existing network of institutions in the following three areas (libraries, cultural museums and institutions and organisational units of the National Technology Development Centres Associations (\"Narodna tehnika\")).   In the field of ICT in the education system, we should strive towards the following:  Increasing the ICT presence in the primary schools and high schools. It is necessary to introduce IT at early stages in the primary school and to define the quantitative  and qualitative ICT presence in the educational system of the primary and high school education.   Priority revision of the curricula in the field of ICT-education in primary and high  school education. The curricula for the IT in the primary and high school education have to be coordinated with  the general objectives of the Strategy, and have to be compatible with the international norms and recommendations.  It is necessary to define new subjects and programmes, as well as to introduce structural and contents' changes in the existing ones.  40  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    The organisation of the ICT-areas curricula should enable their easy and dynamical adjustment, by following the dynamics of recent events in the ICT-domain as a whole.  It is necessary to define legal conditions which are to be implemented through engaging ICT- experts in the educational system, as well as to prepare the teaching staff for ICT-education within the system (primary, secondary, obligatory, optional).  The introduction of ICT-education in the primary school and increasing the number of subject courses in all high schools (irrespective of their basic occupation) represent steps to be undertaken within those entities dealing with formal education.   Coordination and development of education in the high-education institutions dealing with ICT-areas. Profiling the future ICT-experts is of key importance for the overall development of the  information society. It is necessary to introduce distinction of applicative and research education for ICT-experts. It is necessary to encourage educational profiles of ICT-experts at more levels (graduate, post-graduate, certified) and to harmonise the expertise by areas.  For the purposes of successful realisation of these measures it is necessary to redefine the status of the existing educational institutions that profile ICT-staff, and to transform them into independent faculties.  The introduction of obligatory ICT-education in all universities in the Republic of Macedonia with adjusted curricula for ICT-literacy is also important.   Integration of flexible forms of learning and forms for lifelong learning by using ICT in the existing system and encouraging their use.  To stimulate the use and development of distance learning systems, lifelong learning and  flexible forms of learning by using ICT in all segments of the education process. To adjust or to create a legal framework for their implementation and accreditation. To provide conditions for encouraging the activities of the centres for flexible forms of learning by using ICT, distance learning and obtaining ICT-domain knowledge.  In the field related to ICT-literacy and contents development, we should strive towards  the following:  Enabling the ICT-literacy building as part of the civil education.  One of the supplementary measures regarding the activities for higher citizen participation  level in the overall social processes through improved ICT use relates to the increasing of their capacity for simple and efficient use of e-services. To encourage the activities for increasing the ICT-literacy through promoting and support with courses, materials and flexible forms of science, as well as forms of lifelong learning.   Special attention shall be paid to the accessibility of these activities to persons with special needs for their facilitated integration in the society with and through ICT use.   Providing a continuous digital literacy for all professions by making adjustments  towards specific professional needs. The information society development, as well as the knowledge based society development  implies educated people. Due to the substantial information technology development within the past couple of years, there is a great part of the population that hardly ever has contacts with that technology. Prejudice and ignorance represent the basic constraints for the creation of the information- communication technology.  A project, such as this one, would be with an objective to increase the information technology use in the daily operations, by educating all population structures. Certified institutions should introduce free of charge courses for those not involved in the formal education, which would provide them with an opportunity of gaining the basic knowledge necessary for the information technology use.  41  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Promoting the ICT-areas certified knowledge concept. Encouraging the use of European and national certificates through including the commitment  for owning certificates for ICT-literacy as an obligatory element in the process of employment in the civil service (such as, through the Civil Servants Agency). Determining the minimum elements to be contained in the certificate and opening the space for competitive presence of national and European certificate-programmes.   Creating the ICT-literature in Macedonian language and in other local languages in  areas with the appropriate legal framework. One of the measures that will have positive impact on increasing the ICT-literacy of the citizens  will be the creation of a literature in Macedonian language and in other local languages, which will facilitate the access of the beneficiaries to the information related to methods of ICT use and its advantages.  It is necessary to define measures that will encourage the creation of ICT-literature, such as: tax relieves for its publishing and increasing the motivation for the authors through regulation and appropriate enforcement of the Law on Copyright and Related Rights.  Encouraging the creation and use of digital information - library funds and areas  related to education: museums etc. The existing library and museum collections in Macedonia perform their educational function  in a predominantly traditional way. The new standards and trends in these areas impose intensive ICT use in the operations of the institutions themselves, and especially as regards the performing of their educational function; digitalisation and interoperability of the National and of the University library, and the local libraries.  Encouraging the creation and use of digital contents as teaching tools (multimedia and Multilanguage) in the primary and secondary education  ICT use in the educational process is the key factor for fast and efficient transformation towards  an education which has the student in its centre, and whose objectives refer to obtaining participatory experience during the learning process. ICT-contents encourage the interactivity, creativity and participation at students, and in many cases represent the only answer to the challenges in order to meet the up to date language and methodological standards.   Macedonian explanatory vocabulary  The lack of standardisation for explaining the different phrases related to the ICT field, which  we daily encounter, creates confusion and makes its implementation more difficult. Through the implementation of a project such as this one, a public debate would be opened for defining the standards regarding all phrases that are ICT-related, as well as regarding their explanation in Macedonian language and in other local languages in areas with appropriate legal framework for that purpose.  42  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    43  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders   PR4.01 1 Proteus-portal sublimating all activities in the field on e- education  e- education (O1)  Information Society Agency  PR4.02 1 Broadband connection between the scientific-research, educational and cultural institutions, and connection of MARNET to the European academic network GEANT and the global Internet   e- education, infrastructure (O1, O3)  MARNET -universities   PR4.03 1 Equipping all educational, scientific and cultural institutions with appropriate ICT and introduction of standards for information exchange   e-education, infrastructure (O2)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.04 1 Development of e-contents for the curricula  e- education (O15, O16)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.05 1 Transforming the existing ICT high educational institutions into faculties   e- education, legislation (O10)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.06 1 e-technologies centre e- education, all other pillars (O2, O5, O6, O11, O14)  Universities (ICT-faculties)  PR4.07 1 Digitalisation and presentation of the cultural, historical, archaeological and ethnological inheritance (eMuseums)  e- education (O15, O16)  Ministry of Culture  PR4.08 1 Development of systems and tools for distance learning and open forms of education  e- education (O9)  Information Society Agency  PR4.09 2 Macedonian Educational Management Information System and portal design  e- education, infrastructure (O4)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.10 2 ICT- education for everyone e- education (O12, O13)   Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.11 2 Introduction of national, European certificates  e- education (O14)  Information Society Agency  PR4.12 3 Redefining the ICT curricula and contents in the formal education  e- education (O7, O8)  Ministry of Education and Science  2.4.4 Defined projects    44  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders   PR4.13 3 Virtual digital libraries e- education (O15,O16)  Ministry of Culture   PR4.14 3 Encouraging the development of ICT-literature in Macedonian language and the languages used in the education  e- education (O12,O13, O15)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.15 1 Electronic registration for admission in primary and secondary schools  e- education (O4)  Ministry of Education and Science  PR4.16 1 Macedonian ICT explanatory vocabulary  e- education (O13, O15)  Metamorphosis Foundation   PR4.17 1 Centres for ICT-technology transfer  e- education (O5, O11)   Universities  PR4.18 1 Electronic registration for admission at Universities or for the purposes of obtaining fellowships, located in student centres  e- education (O4)  Ministry of Education and Science    2.5  E-HEALTH   ...

The Republic Health Insurance Fund (HIF) is responsible for:  1. executing the policies in respect to the health insurance established by the MH, and 2. collecting funds and payment of the health care related expenses to the insured   beneficiaries.  In future, it is probable that an additional private health insurance shall take place, through setting-up of private health insurance funds.  The MH, with participation of all relevant stakeholders shall manage introduction of electronic services in the health sector.  45  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  SHSI  Medical Chamber Empolyment Bureau  Employers  Insured beneficiaries  Health Care Institutions  Dentist Chamber  Pharmaceut.

Public Health Institute  Statistics Offiice  Ministry of Finance    The Macedonian health care system shall ensure a centralised electronic database of health related data of the population of the Republic of Macedonia, which in compliance with the Data Protection Law, shall be accessible to:  1. HIF for executing of the payments and monitoring over the expenses; 2. Health care institutions for an insight into the history of the patients (anamnesis) and keeping  of medical and financial records; 3. Public Health Care Institute (PHCI) for keeping of health care statistics and proposing, i.e.   monitoring of health policies; 4. Other participants in the health care system that need and are allowed to have a controlled  access to medical and to the health-financial data.  MH shall provide for a centralised database for: 1. Accredited health care institutions and pharmacies; 2. licensed professional medical personnel; 3. nomenclature of diseases, health care services and other; 4. Register of registered medicines.  HIF shall provide for electronic databases for: 1. information on various insurance packages, in compliance with the established policies of  the MH; 2. Register of health care institutions with which the HIF has concluded contracts; 3. Register if insured persons; 4. Register of employers and/or other health insurance paying parties.  HIF and PHCI shall continue with their current functions, however, with increased efficacy, as a result to the improved insight into the health care and in the financial records.  2.5.2 Objectives  O5.01 - quick access for the patients to the health care services; O5.02 - quick access to the medical history (anamnesis) of the patient from any location, i.e.  health care institution; O5.03 - up-dated overview of the health-financial data for the purpose of improvement of   the liquidity and the control over the expenses, with ultimate objective - improvement of the financial performances of the HIF;  O5.04 - electronic exercising of rights regarding health insurance; O5.05 - increasing of the quality of services through electronic following of the medical   records and the treatment (evidence based decision-making); O5.06 - improvement of quality of medical statistics and efficiency in the implementation of   health care policies; O5.07 - securing of high quality information for the needs of education, researches and   development of medical professionals; O5.08 - harmonising of the quality and the standards of the health care system and of the   he health care services with those of the European Union.  The information technology that shall be introduced in the health care system, should meet the following standards:  • interoperability of the systems and standard protocols for exchange of data; • application of the widely adopted and unified nomenclature and encoding systems;  46  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • interoperability with the external users, for instance State Statistics Office, Ministry of Finance; • application of the international, and especially, EU standards and recommendations; • application of standard, widely accepted technologies, infrastructure and applied software;  Negative factors  Personnel - the MH does not have the relevant personnel, nonetheless, an IT team must be established which is going to manage the technical aspects of the implementation of the health care information system.  Financial - the health care system is over-indebted, which makes the investment in development projects difficult. It is expected that with the successful continuation of the projects underway, especially with the Project for Health Sector Management, to gradually decrease the indebtedness.  Infrastructure - the existing infrastructure in the MH, HIF and PHCI, the health care institutions and other stakeholders in the health care sector are below the required level, therefore, significant investments are necessary for the purpose of achieving of the set objective.  Positive factors  The Project for Health Sector Management, which is conducted in co-operation with the World Bank and the possibility to secure other donations, including the European integration funds, represents a good starting position for implementation of the needed information technology infrastructure.  The inclusion of the private sector is a possibility for establishing of new qualitative norms for that portion of the health care institutions, and possibly for the health care insurance.  Introduction of Electronic Identity Cards can eventually be used in the improvement of the health care records and identification among the insured parties and the health care institutions, at the same time, securing reduction of the expenses and of the introduction.  The prices of the information technology are going down, which can contribute to introduction of integrated solutions of high quality for the health care information technology system in conditions of limited resources for new projects.  2.5.3 Strategic tasks and Stakeholders   The Republic of Macedonia has an excellent position to capitalise on the experiences of the countries that have introduced health care IT systems and from the eligible funds from the World Bank projects and from other donors.  The project for introduction of new documents for personal identification is also an opportunity to be used for improvement of the records and the identification of the users of the health care services - the citizens.  Through the World Bank Project for the Health Sector Management, the major providers of health care services, HIF and MH, shall be encompassed. With that the quality of the biggest portion of the services as well as the largest part of the expenses in the health care sector, shall be under control.  47  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Introduction of an electronic health care card, on the example of the EU Member States, shall enable a single-sign identification, reduction of the misuses and quick access to the data regarding the health of the patients. With that, a quick and significant progress in the quality of the health care services as well as control and reduction of the expenses in the health care sector shall be achieved.  Health care IT systems shall be introduced in the health care institutions, which shall enable medical and financial following of the patients, as well as electronic charging for the health care services.  The MH shall propose amendments to the existing health related legislation, which shall provide the basis for introduction of:  • electronic exchange of documents among the entities in the health care system; • protection of the privacy of the personal health care data; • optimised system of health care insurance through various packages of health care services  accessible to various categories of insured beneficiaries; • keeping and access to the health care data of the patients in electronic form; • forms of electronic invoicing and payments between the health care institutions and HIF, and  later on, the private HIF; • encoding systems and accessibly to data for services, medicines, medical personnel, health  care institutions, insurance companies, insured beneficiaries, and so forth; • possibility for introduction of an additional health care insurance at a later stage.  2.5.4 Defined projects  From the aspect of the Action Plan, priority shall be given to the projects that bring to a visible progress in cost reduction and service quality improvement in the health care sector.  48  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area(s) Stakeholders and Participants  PR5.01 1 Creation of a Development Strategy of the IS in the health care sector  O5.01- O5.08 MH  PR5.02 1 Introduction of a unique encoding system;  O5.02, O5.03, O5.06, O5.08  MH, HIF  PR5.03 1 Introduction of an electronic health care card,  O5.01, O5.02, O5.04  MH, HIF  PR5.04 1 Hospital IT systems in the biggest health care institutions  O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08  MH  PR5.05 2 Electronic appointment making, electronic informing, and notifying of the patients-citizens   O5.01, O5.08 MH  PR5.06 3 Hospital IT systems in the rest of the health care institutions, including the private ones  O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08  MH  PR5.07 3 Information Systems in health care institutions of the primary level of health care, including the private ones  O5.01, O5.03, O5.05 - O5.08  MH, Private health care institutions  PR5.08 3 E-Pharmacies O5.04 Pharmacies    2.6 E- CITIZENS  . . . One cannot asses the greatness  and the power of his mind . . .  Hegel  E-services that shall take into account the needs of the citizens, are one of the fundamental reasons for the overall transformation towards a knowledge-based society. They shall bring a genuine improvement in the quality of the life of the citizens, as well as their increased participation. At the same time, the reforms that shall be indirectly initiated shall have a positive impact on the communication culture of the authorities both at all levels, and among all sectors in the society.  2.6.1 Current Situation  Given the data provided by ITU7, the level of Internet users in the Republic of Macedonia is 49 on 1000 persons, which just by itself is an unsatisfactory data. Although the new Law on Electronic Communication provides for a favourable environment, it is in the interest of all of us to find out a quick and efficient manner of increasing the number of Internet users. This is also in correlation with the general level of knowledge among the citizens of the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and as well as in correlation with the political will for securing a favourable environment for this growth. With the increase of the number of citizens who shall seek their services through ICT, the savings shall be increased in the public administration, the unnecessary expenses in the business sector shall be reduced, and the transparency, responsibility and accountability in the process of communication with the citizens and with the non-Governmental organisations shall be increased. At the moment of preparation of this Strategy, the number of e-points8 is unsatisfactorily small and the entire infrastructure is not functionally developed.   In accordance with the analysis of the Metamorphosis  foundation9, the elementary knowledge of the citizens in respect to computer usage as a precondition for functioning of the e-services is at the level of 50,3%. However, it should be noted that in the group of citizens that do not poses elementary knowledge predominate the citizens with lower level of education, the unemployed, those older than 40 years of age, the inhabitants of rural areas as well as citizens of similar target groups. This fact reveals a realistic hazard for widening of the digital divide for this group of people that amounts to over 1 million inhabitants in a period of transformation towards a knowledge-based society. A positive fact is that over 60% of them have expressed readiness for learning of ICT. The broadband access to Internet (one of the basic preconditions for growth of the number of Internet users), in the regions in which these citizens live, is either technically or financially unfeasible. Bearing that in mind, the e-points seem to be the only realistic solution for this target group at this moment.  Bringing of the Law on Free Access to Public Information represents a sound basis for protection of the rights of the citizens related to the access to information. In the course of 2005, as a legal obligation the institutions shall have to make the public documents and information also   7 International Telecommunications Union (ITU) - http://www.itu.int, gives the data for December 2002.  The Government of the Republic of Macedonia in the responses to the Questionnaire of the EC had provided the following data: \"below 5%\", which in general sense corresponds with the stated data.   The breakdown of internet penetration by states according to ITU is available at: http://www.internetworldstats.com/europa2.htm# mk  8 Public Internet Access Points  9 In the course of 2004 Strategic Marketing and Media Research Institute from Skopje had conducted a research ordered by the Metamorphosis foundation, the findings from which are available in the publication \"General Data on the ICT Situation in the Republic of Macedonia 2003-2004\"  http://metamorphosis.org.mk/mak_vesti_detal.asp?id=100.             49  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    accessible in an electronic format. Bearing in mind the current situation with the development of the document management systems, and in particular, the use of the non-standard and closed formats of documents and systems for interpersonal communication, it is necessary to stress again the effort made in the interest of the citizens - to have the public data accessible in an open and standardised10 format in order for the users to have unimpeded communication irrespective of the software platform they have. This imposes the necessary definition of minimum standards (technical, as well as in terms of business policy). This is not just an effort, but also a responsibility of the Republic of Macedonia as a future member of the EU11.  It is necessary to support the use of the free software and the open code12 software  as a public good accessible to all citizens, especially through the freedom of choice of a platform in the formal and informal ICT education.  ICT- tools enable even greater and more efficient integration of the will of the citizens in the democratic processes of decision-making and law making. At the moment, there is an absence of coherent policy and practice at all levels for inclusion of the citizens in the two-way communication with the institutions of the state and of the local authority via the Internet (consultation and participation in the decision-making).  The current lack of Public Key Infrastructure13, i.e. security certificates, which is recognised in the Government and judiciary systems, does not enable more advanced level of e-services. There are no clear rules for privacy policy and for storing of personal and classified data in electronic form, especially for the private sector, which opens the possibilities for data misuse.   There is a high level of public awareness of the citizens' associations (NGO) in respect to the social processes and the public interests. With the transition of the Macedonian society towards a knowledge-based society, the civil sector is one of the key agents for increase of the knowledge of the public and running of the public campaigns addressing the citizens. The overcoming of the digital divide and the inclusion of the community in the decision-making process with the help of ICT, is solely possible through a more intensive partnership with the associations.  Currently, in the Republic of Macedonia there is no one-stop-shop system available, however, with the obligations stemming from the integration into the European Union, these reforms shall be conducted in parallel with the implementation of the Strategy for Information Society Development. The current status of the web-sites of the public institutions, with the level of offered information and with the non-unified approach regarding the presentation level of the portals (in general sense, also as it was mentioned, especially in the policy of accessibility, of standardisation of formats and ICT-tools for mutual communication), does not meet the desired standard. There is no publicly stated policy regarding the quality and level of service, there is no publicly accessible Book of Rules on the obligations regarding the deadlines and surveillance of the quality of the responses as well as the level of satisfaction of the users with the responses received from the civil servants on the posed questions and requests. The laws of the Republic of Macedonia are not publicly accessible for the citizens in electronic format, since for the access to these resources a subscription is charged.   10 The definitions and schemes for open standards of documents and e-services that are recommended by the EU are accessible on the web page of the international body for standardisation OASIS (http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php).         11 The European Commission / IDABC proscribe the standard for the e-services and the types of documents for all members of the Union in the  documents that are a part of the Framework for the European Interoperability which and represent a precondition for  a successful functioning of the  Union at inter-Governmental level, as well as in respect to the inclusion of the citizens. - http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/3473/5585.     12 By free software is meant \"Free  and Open Source Software\", in accordance with the standards and policies of the European Union (the above stated  footnote) (the definition and information could be found on http://www.slobodensoftver.org.mk, http://www.opensource.org, http://www.fsf.org)     13 PKI - Public Key Infrastructure.  50  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    2.6.2 Objectives  In order for the citizens and their associations to be responsible authorities in the information society it is necessary to support the implementation of the following objectives:  O6.01 Support of the local communities in the creation of local sustainable policies for ICT;  O6.02 Building coherent policies in order for all sectors to be able to offer e-services that shall be unified, standardised, accessible, secure, of high quality, user-friendly and aware of the  needs of the citizens, irrespective of their location and social status. It is necessary to formalise the obligations, the interoperability, the deadlines, and the quality of the service or any e- service that involves mutual communication at several levels of authority;  O6.03 Enabling accessible e-services irrespective of the software platform, which shall use  open standardised formats14 of documentation and exchange of information;  O6.04 Creation of favourable environment and practice of good governance in order for the citizens to be able to participate in the overall social process, as well as in the process of  decision-making at the local and at the national level with the assistance of the ICT tools;  O6.05 Overcoming of the digital divide through solutions, continual training for increasing of public awareness, as well as the knowledge of ICT and e-citizens' education;'  O6.06 Support of the development of the local contents, as one of the agents for increase in the number of Internet users.  2.6.3 Strategic Measures and Responsible Authorities  In order for this Strategy to be translated into reality, apart form the political will and consensus, it is necessary to establish a substantive and more active partnership among the responsible authorities of this Strategy, who shall enable the citizens to be involved not only as beneficiaries of e-services, but also as participants in the decision-making process. The following responsible authorities shall be involved in the realisation of the strategic measures:  • Government of the Republic of Macedonia; • Public enterprises, agencies and services; • Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia; • Local Self-Government Units; • Information Society Agency; • Civil Servants Agency; • The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia • Civil Society Organisations; • Education institutions; • Media; • Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning • The business sector; • Donors and foreign foundations.  14 In accordance with the present and further recommendations of the European Union.  Also, while standardising, it is necessary to take into account the   future widening of the fund of e-services towards the citizens initiated with the process of accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union.  51  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    The strategic efforts shall be implemented through activities and implementation of the following measures:  1. Sustainable development plans and ICT policies for the local self-Government units (this measure addresses the objective for support of the local communities in the  creation of local sustainable ICT policies). Integration of the local self-Government units in the system of offering of e-services for the  citizens shall be possible only of the transfer of knowledge, expertise and creation of respective polices and development programmes at local level is supported, which on one hand, shall reflect the local ambience and the needs, and on the other hand, shall initiate the application of ICT in providing for the economic development of the local community, as well as growth of the number and quality of the e-services accessible to the citizens at the level of access that is most natural - the local community.  2. E-points15 (this measure addresses the objectives: quality of the e-services, efforts  for  participation of the citizens, provision of continuous training for the citizens, and  support for the local community) The local self-Government units in partnership with the other sectors shall ensure for the  citizens to communicate with the institutions via electronic way, through the publicly accessible e-points. The employees in the e-points shall assist those citizens who are not technically ready, to acquire the essential skills. The local self-Governments shall make sure that it covers the biggest possible percentage of the distant locations with e-points, thus assisting the development of the rural area.  3. Public campaigns and training (this measure addresses the needs of the continuous training of the citizens for overcoming of the digital divide and providing support for  the local communities). It is necessary to train the citizens and to sensitise them to the idea and to the need of creating  the demand for e-services from the authorities. This shall be achieved through series of campaigns, training, modification of education curricula, and in partnership with the non-Governmental organisations.  It is in the interest of the public, apart from the reforms in the educational system, to cover also those citizens who have completed their education, and do not posses knowledge of Information and Communication Technologies. It is necessary to acquaint the citizens with the basic knowledge of ICT, as well as with their rights and opportunities offered through the usage of e-services.  In co-operation with the non-Governmental organisations, the public sector shall place a special focus on the target groups that are at great risk to be by-passed by the transformation of the system due to regional, social, educational cultural and other reasons. The NGO sector has a special role in the communication with these citizens.  4. Citizen's portal (this measure addresses the following objectives: quality of e-services, efforts made for participation of the citizens, good governance, continuous campaigns)  The citizens' portal at all levels of Government represents a unified system of offers of e-services  to the citizens with a single point of access and standardised layout. The citizens' portal shall respect  the standards mentioned in this Strategy.  15 E-point - public Internet access point.   52  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    With the standardisation, unification and public accessibility of the services, the citizens shall  be enabled to use these services without the need of repetitive training with each addition of a new  module. At the same time, the services shall be accessible to the citizens at one point - the citizens'  portal - the beginning and the end of each browsing for information or permits.  5. Standards and favourable environment (this measure addressees the following   objectives: the quality of e-services, continuous creation of favourable environment for  good governance) With the establishing of public, open and accessible standards regarding the format of the  documents, no service user shall be restricted irrespective of his/her software platform. While defining  these standards for access to information, it is necessary to transpose the directives and the decisions  of the European Union, which also is our obligation as its future member. The large number of mobile  terminals foreseen in the second phase of implementation of the electronic services shall initiate  introduction of M-services (mobile phone services).  Introduction of standards on the quality of the services for the citizens (ISO), books of rules on  the good practices of communicating with the citizens, as well as efforts made to involve directly the  interest groups in the communication with the responsible authorities, shall yield an increased number  of satisfied and proactive citizens. The monitoring of the quality of the communication is much more  simplified due to the technology that allows an insight into the clear communication paths and into the  dynamics of communication, that can be used both for internal, and for external analysis of the  percentage of increase in the efficiency of the state and local administration. At the same time, this  system shall provide for analysis of bottlenecks and overcoming of the same. With this, the system  becomes self-corrective and reduces its own entropy.  It is necessary to define the whole environment and the good practice of respect of privacy of  data. At the same time, it is necessary to establish a common system of co-ordination of the efforts for  fight against e-crime, which is expected to grow in the coming years - with the arrival of new  technologies. It is necessary to define clear standards for security, to educate and employ professionals  in the area of security in the public institutions, to secure all networks of the institutions, and to set clear  rules for storage of data for the business sector.  The Law on Free Access to Public Information, imposes publishing of all documents of public  interest. At the same time, it is necessary to create rules and practice of good governance which will  enable the citizens via internet to make proposals and to express their opinions regarding a specific  decision, law or other public document or act, and to initiate debates and provide opinions on a  specific topic or - proposal of a law by using ICT tools, as well as to propose initiatives by themselves.  The two-way communication between the citizens and the authorities shall be the basis for e-  democracy.  6. Local contents (measures that address the objective regarding the creation of local   contents as one of the forms of increasing of the number of Internet users) One of the reasons for the citizens to decide to purchase ICT equipment and/or Internet access  is also the rich local Internet contents. It is necessary to make efforts to facilitate the increase of the  quantity and the quality of information accessible on the local languages placed on the Internet. At the  same time, it is necessary for the responsible institutions to publish clear rules for translation of the  computer and Internet terminology by publishing an explanatory dictionary (Ref. e-education).  53  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    7. Information systems for monitoring of the parameters of the environment (measure  that addresses the objective: participation of the citizens) The need of transparency as well as accessibility to ICT-tools (like the GIS, the spatial  information system), the obligations for compliance with international standards for protection of the  environment, waste management, participation of the NGO sector in the monitoring of the results,  imposes the need of creation of public information system accessible to all interested parties, which is  going to monitor the environmental parameters and shall offer resources for future activities.  2.6.4 Defined projects  16 The project is approved and the responsible authority had secured the initial budget.  54  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Stakeholders and  Participants  PG6.01 1 E-citizens' participation E-citizens  e-Government  MDW/USAID & Metamorphosis  Foundation16  PR6.01 3 E-citizens' portal E-citizens  e-Government  Government of the Republic of Macedonia / General Secretariat (state level) and the local self-Government (local level)  PR6.02 2 Civil initiatives for information society (Overcoming digital divide initiative)  E-citizens ISA  PR6.03 5 Measures for support of the local contents  E-citizens  e-business  ISA  PG6.02 4 E-security E-citizens  e-business e-Government  ISA  PR6.04 5 Environmental Information System E-citizens  e-Government sustainable development  Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning    2.7 LEGISLATION  . . . It is pointless to tell the river   to stop running, it would be better   if you learn how to swim . . .  2.7.1 Current Situation  Following the long tradition of the former Yugoslav law, the positive legislation of the Republic  of Macedonia is under strong influence of the continental European law. Nonetheless, the Anglo-Saxon  law and the legal doctrine are more and more strongly influencing it, and, thus, certain institutes are  incorporated into our legal system.  It can be concluded that a portion of the Macedonian legislation still contains specific solutions  which were characteristic of the old system of the socio-political order. Although the new legal solutions  in essence are in the spirit of the new social relations (market economy, competition, plural political  party system, and alike), still it could be noted that the legislation takes a slow course in changing and  it looks as if it looses pace with the new social and economic relations. Also, some lack of  harmonisation between the laws can be noted.   The Macedonian judiciary system cannot fully respond to the challenges of today. For that  reason, it is necessary to introduce an urgent reform of all segments and institutions of the court system  (courts, public prosecutor's offices, public attorney, lawyers, notaries, etc.).  From the moment of the making the decisions for accession to the World Trade Organisation  and to the European Union, and especially after the signing of the Stabilisation and Association  Agreement and entering the World Trade organisation, it is notable that the responsible authorities  show a higher level of accountability in the preparation and passing of the laws, and their  harmonisation with the international conventions and agreements ratified by our country. This is  especially valid for the harmonisation of our legislation with the legislation of the European Union.  Although the Republic of Macedonian had decided to follow the directives of the European  Union, meaning that it will strive towards a knowledge based information society and economy, still  the creation of adequate and complete legal frameworks is falling behind. Namely, in the Republic of  Macedonia there is neither Law on Information Society, nor a Law on Electronic Trading. In the course  of 2001 and especially in 2002, the initial steps were made towards regulation of the usage of new  technologies (Law on Electronic data and Electronic Signature, Law on Obligations, Criminal Code,  Customs Law, Law on Electronic Communications, Law on Protection of Personal Data, Consumer  Protection Law, Law on Notaries). However, some of the acts were not sufficiently developed with the  passing of the secondary legislation, and in the majority of the cases the introduced changes were  insufficient, inadequate and did not yield positive results. This is characteristic for all areas, the  infrastructure, the business sector, the state administration (the Government, the stated administrative  bodies and the local self-Government bodies), education, health protection, as well as for the services  that address the everyday life and the work of the citizens.  55  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    In the past several years evident efforts were made regarding specific activities stipulated in the laws, to establish an obligation for the subjects which are deemed to perform those activities, to use information technology, and especially in respect to establishing of specific databases, storing of various records, registers, classified information and their protection, processing and usage of personal data, survey and cadastre data on immovable property, statistics data, performing swift money transfer services, electronic trading, and so forth. (Law on Classification of Information, Decree on Information Security and Classified Information, Law on Protection of Personal Data, Law on Ratification of the Convention for Protection of Persons in Respect to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, Law on Performing of Series of Swift Money Transfer, and the Book of Rules for keeping of the register of service providers for swift money transfers, Law on Trade, Consumer Protection Law, Law on Identification and Registration of Live-Stock, Company Law, Book of Rules on keeping of the Trade Register and of entering data into the Trade Register, and so forth).  2.7.2 Objectives   The legislation, de lege ferenda, should create a legal framework that shall provide impetus for development and application of new technologies and services stemming from them. The legislation that regulates the information society is a very wide concept and addresses and influences all spheres of the society and of the legal system.  The contents of the legislation depends on the objectives, the measures and the project activities defined in the projects on infrastructure, e-business, e-Government, e-education, e-health and e-citizens. It shall represent a legal framework for development of the information society.  E-legislation shall be in compliance with, however it should also follow the trends of the UNICITRAL rules, WTO-TRIPS Agreement, the agreements and conventions administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, and the EU directives on ICT, e-business and intellectual property.  E-legislation, de lege ferenda, can be grouped as: (1) legislation that should provide for institutional framework; (2) legislation that addresses the substantive law in specific areas; and (3) legislation that refers to the proceedings. It should provide for:  • liberalisation of the market of electronic communication services; • prevention of the misuse of the monopoly position and limitation of competition; • establishing and implementation of standards and systems for digital records, for their   management and storing; • establishing, development and usage of state and local databases (registers), mutual   interconnection and exchange of information from the databases by the interested persons, the Government, the administrative bodies and the local self-Government;  • forming of a Certification Agency, as the basis for usage of PKI; • employment of competent human resources, especially in the Government, in the   administrative bodies, and in the local self-Government, providing their continuous education; • better and more efficient solutions for the administrative and court proceedings,   simplification of the processes and cost reduction; • forming of research centres and technology transfer centres and their co-operation with   renowned international centres; • changes in the education system; • development of the systems for distance learning, lifelong learning and flexible forms of   learning for and of usage of ICT; • establishing and development of digital libraries in the education, science and culture;  56  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • development of unique encoding system; • computerisation of the primary health care, special hospitals; • establishing of electronic health card and web services for making appointments for   physical exams; • establishing a system of electronic ID card with an electronic certificate for the citizens; • standardisation of the services for exchange of information and documents with the   European systems; • observe the principles of accessibility, multi-language, security, privacy, and subsidiary of   the e-services in all sectors of the society; • protection of the intellectual property rights, databases, security of information and privacy   of the data; • protection against computer crime; • establishing of electronic business operation.  2.7.3 Strategic Measures and Responsible Authorities  Since legislation, the task of which is to establish and to develop the knowledge based information society and economy, refers to all areas of the social, political and economic system, it can be said that there is no subject - individual, group, party, organisation, municipality and so forth - which is going to be left outside the process of developing and passing of the e-legislation.  Moreover, the responsible authorities of these activities shall be:  • Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia,  • Government; • CIT; • Ministry of Justice; • Ministry of Economy; • Ministry of Transport and Communications; • Ministry of Finance; • Ministry of Education and Science; • Ministry of Culture; • Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia; • other chambers; • MASIT; • Civil Servants Agency; • Industrial Property Institute; • Bar Association; • Notary Association; • Universities; • MARNET; • Consumers' Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia; • Citizens' associations, and other;  The above stated objectives shall be ensured through (1) passing of new laws, and (2) harmonisation of the existing and other legislation.  The primary goal of the e-legislation shall be to bring the Law on Information Society and the Law on Electronic Trading, as well as to form a Certification Agency, and to bring the secondary legislation, in accordance with the Law on Electronic Data and Electronic Signature.  57  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    The Law on Information Society in a unique systemic fashion should regulate the basic principles for development of information society and technology, financing, institutional framework for development of the information society, measures for monitoring and implementation of the Law. In that way, adequate harmonisation of the various laws and other acts that regulate this substance shall be ensured in accordance with the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia as well as with the European Union acquis.  The Law on Electronic Trading should regulate the conditions for performing wholesale and retail through communication means. This Law should be based on the UNICITRAL's Model-Law on Electronic Trading.  The passing of the above stated laws shall result in the need to propose adequate amendments and additions to the existing laws and other regulations that regulate specific aspects of the information society in the areas covered in this Strategy.  The short-term goal shall be the implementation of the Law on Electronic Communication and passing of the secondary legislation foreseen in this law.  The mid-term goal shall be reforming of the judiciary, for the purpose of an efficient and effective protection against misuse, especially of the privacy and of the security of data. At the same time, amendments to the laws should be made in the field of: health, education, trade, economy, finances, banking, taxes, customs, court proceedings, intellectual property, databases, privacy, safety of data, and alike.  The above state objectives shall be accomplished through public campaigns, massive training of all entities, and especially of the civil servants, the judges, the prosecutors, the public attorneys, the lawyers, and the employees in the institutions in the field of health, education, culture, science, and other public services. At the same time, the utilisation of the new technology and services should be stimulated by offering a lower customs rate, tax, priority resolving of the cases submitted electronically, etc.  2.7.4 Defined projects  58  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area  Responsible authorities and stakeholders  PG7.01 1 Brining of the Law on Information Society  Legislation, O7.01  Ministry of Transport and Communications  PG7.02 1 Bringing of Law on Electronic Trading  Legislation, O7.02  Ministry of Finance  PG7.03 2 Harmonisation of the laws and of other regulations in respect to and have influence on the information society  Legislation O7.01 and O7.02  Ministry of Justice  PG7.04 5 Training of civil servants, judges, prosecutors, public attorneys, lawyers and the employees in the institutions in the field of health care, education, culture, science and other public services  Legislation, O7.01, O7.02 and O7.03  Ministry of Justice      3  PRIORITY AREAS ENABLING  STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY  Starting from the need the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia to have along-term sustainability, this part of the Strategy has as its aim to define and to explain the priority areas in which it is necessary to undertake activities in order to achieve that objective.  3.1.1 Current Situation  In the Republic of Macedonia there is no precisely defined framework for development of the information society, nor are the sources of financial means defined, as well as the funds aimed at financing and building of the infrastructure, nor other projects aimed at development of the information society, there is low level of awareness of the need and of the importance of the information society, and finally, there is almost no monitoring and/or evaluation of the achievements so far. Hence, one meaningful conclusion comes to the fore: the creation of the foundations that should lead towards a sustainability of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia, is something that should be made from the very beginning  3.1.2 Objectives  The basic objectives of the strategy are defining also the objectives of the laying down the foundations and the priority areas that should enable sustainability of the building and further development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia:  • on short-term - establishing the basic assumptions and preconditions necessary for the onset of the development of the information society;  • on long-term - creation of entire environment which shall enable and shall stimulate the  development of the economy of the Republic of Macedonia as a knowledge based economy, i.e. as an economy whose competitive capacity and dynamics shall be based on creativity,  inventions and innovations.   Segmenting of the objectives on short-term and long-term ones is done with the purpose to refer to specific measures and tasks necessary for their accomplishment. At the same time, the short - term refers to the period until 2007, i.e. until that point of time all basic assumptions, which shall enable the impetus for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia should be completely formed and already articulated in the practice. On the other hand, for the long-term, there are no concrete time limits, given that this is a relatively permanent development process, which shall have its own sub-phases that are going to be achieved in the course of time. In 2007 it is planned to revise the Strategy, in order to harmonise it with the objectives of the Draft-Action Plan of the European Commission \"i-2010\". This Chapter of the Strategy covers primarily the changes and the elements that are achievable in short-term.   61  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    3.1.3 Strategic Measures   Starting form the theoretical knowledge of the basic assumptions for the sustainability of the implementation of the reforms and change management, as well as the experiences in the development of the information society in other countries (\"the best practices\"), five specific areas of measures and programmes are determined which are necessary to be addressed for the purpose of establishing the basis for sustainability of the information society. Those measures are:  • Creation of the legal framework for development of the information society; • Creation of complete institutional framework, responsible for the development of the   information society; • Public awareness raising regarding the need and the importance of the information society; • Creation of possibilities for a wide (for all citizens) accessibility to internet; • Defining of mechanisms for securing funds for financing of the development of the   information society; and • Establishing of continuous monitoring and evaluation of the development process of the   information society.  1. Legal framework, as a rule, represents a very important part that enables sustainability of the development processes. Hence, the creation and bringing of a separate Law on Information Society  in the Republic of Macedonia is an imperative for the sustainability of this process in the future. This Law, apart form other elements, has to separately regulate the following issues:  • Constituting an institution (Agency) which is going to conduct the activities for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia;  • Constituting of other parts of the institutional infrastructure needed for the development of  the information society in the Republic of Macedonia;  • The basic principles and obligations of all public institutions in the development of the  information society;  • Bringing of secondary legislation defining technical and other standards on which the  development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be based;  • the manners (mechanisms) of financing of the development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia  The improvement of the legal framework for development of information society, apart from bringing of the Law on Information Society, also entails other (already existing) laws that contain provisions in this area. They should be brought in complete mutual compliance, which should be done in the shortest possible period (by the end of 2005). The deadline for preparation and bringing of the Law on Information Society is latest by October 2005.   2. The institutional framework that stimulates and co-ordinates the development process of the information society also represents a very important part for achieving sustainability. The institutional framework should contain: clear definition and clear delineation of the competences of all existing and future institutions that shall be part and parcel of it. The delineation of the competences between the institutions within the institutional framework, through which the process of development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be stimulated and co-ordinated, is represented in the scheme below, and in respect to the definition of their competences, it is necessary to differ among institutions that would:   62  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    • define the policy and its priorities; • perform the advisory function; • implement policies and activities; and • perform the function of a regulator of the market and of the work.  In that sense, the institutional framework for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia shall be composed of the following institutions:   a) for defining of the policy and its priorities, as well as for co-ordination of the implementation of this Strategy and its individual projects, shall be formed:  Interministerial Council It shall be chaired by the President of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and the  members shall be the Deputy of the President of the Government responsible of the European Integration and the Minister of Transport and Communications, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister of Interior, Minister of Justice, Minister of Economy, Minister of Finance, Minister of Labour and Social Policy, and Minister of Local Self-Government.  The competences of the Interministerial Council are as follows: • Defining of the basic guidelines and priorities of the policy; • Linking of the policies for development of the information society with the other development  policies in the Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities of various parties - participants in the process; • Adopting of the evaluation reports on the development of the information society in the   Republic of Macedonia and on the implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan.  63  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Parliament of the  Republic of Macedonia  Counselling  Council  Guide- lines  Account- ability  Interministerial Council  National Council  Information Society Agency  Ministry of Transport  and Communications   IT-Sectors of the Ministries,  state bodies,   local self-Government units   Policy Creation  Implementation Regulation  Advisory function  IT- sectors  Regulatory bodies  Agency for  electronic commu- nication  Competition Commission  Account- ability  IT- sectors  IT- sectors    b) For the purpose of performing the advisory function, shall be formed:  National Council for Information Society of the Republic of Macedonia It shall consist of 25 members selected by the Parliament, as well as representatives from the  private and from the public sector, from the Universities and the non-Governmental organisations. The members of this Council should be re-known experts from various areas, as experts in the working group responsible for the preparation of the Strategy.   The competences of the National Council for Information Society of the Republic of Mcedonia are: • Providing guidelines and recommendations regarding the basic trends and priorities of the   policy; • Preparation of opinions regarding the manners of linking of the policies for development of  the information society with the other development policies in the Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities of various parties - participants in the process; • Performing the monitoring of the development of the information society in the Republic of   Macedonia and of the implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan. The Interministerial and the National Council shall also work together as a partnership between the public, private and the civil sector.  c) for conducting of the policies and activities for development of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia, a central implementation institution shall be established:  Information Society Agency for of the Republic of Macedonia This Agency shall be a legal entity established with the Law on Information Society. The  management of the Agency shall be under the competency of the Managing Board, and the operation shall be under the competence of a Director. The Parliament shall appoint the members of the Managing Board, and it will be composed with a dominant participation of the representatives from the private and the non-Governmental sector. The Agency should operate in accordance with an annual programme, for which the National Council for Information Society shall provide the recommendation, and the Government shall provide approval. The basic competences and the activities of the Agency shall be:  • Operational processing and archiving of data and information as a public good; • Implementation of the adopted projects for development of the information society in the   Republic of Macedonia; • Co-ordination of the activities that shall be implemented by the IT sectors in the Ministries   and in the other state agencies, organisations and bodies; • Co-ordinated management and development of integrated backbone network for the needs  of the Governmental institutions and the public administration; • Certification of the usage of the PKI; • Creation and management of the funds of the Information Society Development Fund of the  Republic of Macedonia; • Making endeavours for public awareness raising and education in respect to the importance  of the development of the information society.  The Law on Information Society shall define concretely all of the competences of the Agency. The financing of the functioning of this Agency shall be done with the funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia as well as from own incomes of the Agency, coming from various services that it would provide. The creation and the issuing of the \"smart cards\" (electronic personal documents) is an example of a service that should be provided by this Agency. The control over the spending of the funds shall be secured through planning of the expenses ahead of each year, and by accounting (reports) to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, at least once a year. The deadline for creation of this institution is the end of 2007.  64  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Implementation of portion of activities for development of the information society in concrete domains shall be also in the competence of:  IT-sector of the General Secretariat of the Government and of the IT-sectors in the ministries,  state bodies and other state and public institutions.  In that sense, the General Secretariat of the Government, each ministry and state institution should have an IT-sector17, by bearing in mind of the advantages and disadvantages of engaging a greater number of external employees in respect to performing of the tasks on contractual basis. The concrete competencies of each IT-sector should be specified with the documents that define the functions of each individual institution, in accordance with the Law on Information Society.  At local level, each municipality in the Republic of Macedonia should create a Programme for information society development at the level of the municipality, as well as to create an IT-sector, the management of which shall be under the competencies of the Council of the local self-Government unit and/or the Mayor. In essence, the competencies of those IT-sectors shall address the implementation of various activities and projects for development of the information society at the level of the municipality. At the same time, those sectors should cooperate among themselves and with the Information Society Agency of the Republic of Macedonia.  d) for performing of the regulatory function already specific institutions exist, and also others shall be formed, in accordance with the needs in specific areas.  3. The building (i.e. the raising) of the public awareness regarding the need and the importance of the information society in the Republic of Macedonia is also necessary in the context of the establishing of foundations for a long-term sustainability and development of the process. On the other hand, the building of the public awareness has a component of self-sustainability, which means that the most important issue is to commence with that process, and further on the progress shall by itself contribute to further building of the public awareness. In that sense, two issues are of importance:   • creation and definition of a project composed of set of campaigns, the aim of which is raising the level of public awareness - in fact, this is a process of creating a \"public passion\" for  inclusion of the citizens in the building of the information society in the Republic of  Macedonia, and especially in respect to the usage of the Internet network. The campaigns  shall be adequately adjusted to the objectives. The implementation shall commence in the  first half of 2005;  • defining and undertaking other activities aimed at raising of the level of the public awareness in respect to benefit of building of an information society in the Republic of Macedonia - as examples the following can be mentioned: organisation of various events related to the  promotion of the development of the information society, awarding rewards for best solutions in this field, organising series of speeches and articles, through which the importance of the development of the information society for solving of the problems of the citizens shall be  promoted, and especially, pointing out good and successful examples that exist and are  going to be developed in the course of time in the Republic of Macedonia. This is especially important in the context of the sustainability. This activity shall commence in the course of  2005, however it has a more lasting character than the campaign itself.  17 An obligation undertaken with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.   65  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    4. Creation of the possibility for a wider (for all citizens) accessibility to the Internet also means  setting of the basic assumptions and preconditions that are necessary for the outset of the development  of the information society. At the same time, without neglecting the economic (i.e. the financial) side  of this activity, the starting ground in this sense is the realisation of the idea that the access to the  Internet today is a part of the set of human rights, which in essence means that the access to the Internet  has a characteristics of a public good. An effort should be made that this service is accessible to all  under equal, low-priced, yet economically sustainable parameters. This measure shall lead towards  narrowing of the current gap (digital divide) among the population of the Republic of Macedonia, in  respect to the usage of information technology products. Several options exist in this respect:  • usage of public centres for access to internet ('e-points') in the local self-Government units;  • undertaking legal (regulatory) and other measures of the policy that shall create competition  on the market, which shall result in decrease in the prices of use of Internet.  These activities shall commence at the beginning of 2006.  5. Defining of the mechanisms for securing funds for financing of the development of the  information society in the Republic of Macedonia also represents a crucial factor for the sustainability  of the process. In that sense, in essence, there are several options that could be used:  • including of the expenses for purchasing of the information technology (as a legal obligation)  in the regular planning of the central budget and in the budgets of the local self-Government  units. In this respect, it is necessary, in legal sense (with the Law on Information Society), to   define also a specific threshold, i.e. a criterion - from 0,5 up to 1% of the total budget   expenses in the course of the next five years;  • directing part (percentage) of the income from the sale of the public enterprises (or their   funds) in covering of the expenses for development of the information society in the Republic  of Macedonia. This obligation should be legally defined with the Law on Information Society.  The economic justification of this measure, again is the fact that the funds from the sale of   public capital subjects should be spent on creation of the foundations of the future economic  development, and this is the development of the information society. The deadline for   commencing with the implementation of this measure is immediately after passing of the new law;  • Forming of an Information Society Development Fund in the Republic of Macedonia. With   the money from this Fund primarily shall be financed development of the public centres for   training on information technology usage, or for public centres for access to Internet. Apart  from the Government, the private sector should participate in the Fund, meaning that also   the possibility should be considered for specific fiscal alleviation for the enterprises which   invest (i.e. donate) in this Fund. The deadline for commencing with the implementation of this  measure is the end of 2005;  • Defining of a set of separate measures that are going to influence the attraction of foreign   direct investments in the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia. The  possibilities for provision of specific alleviation to foreign investors should be considered,   although this should not be the only measure. The implementation of this measure should   commence immediately after the adoption of the Strategy.  66  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN    Spending of the funds for information society development in the Republic of Macedonia shall be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and priorities defined by the Interministerial Council, upon recommendations and opinions provided by the National Council on Information Society. Their realisation, in accordance with the legally entrusted competences, in part, shall be performed through the Information Society Agency, and in the other part, through the ministries and other state institutions and agencies.   6. Continuous monitoring an evaluation of the information society development also represents an important part of the sustainability. Two different types of monitoring and evaluation are in question: 1) of the process of implementation of the Strategy and of the Action Plan, and 2) of the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia on the whole. For conducting both types of monitoring and evaluation it is necessary to establish and to define the following:  • indicators (benchmarking) of the evaluation; • methodology for evaluation (to use the methodologies that are applied in other countries); • periods of evaluation (annually); • to authorise an institution which is going to be responsible to consider and to adopt the   evaluations and the reports.  In respect to the defining of the indicators, the methodology for evaluation and the periods of assessment, one short-term project is defined (to be completed before the end of 2005), with which they shall be created and subsequently shall be adopted by Interministerial Council and by the National Council.  The responsibilities for adoption of the evaluation and monitoring reports lays with the Interministerial Council, as well as the responsibility for providing guidelines for future development, while the National Council for Information Society should provide its own opinion and recommendations based on those reports. The Councils also have the responsibility to propose amendments in the domains where weaknesses in the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia occur.  The implementation of this measure commences immediately after the adoption of the Strategy.  3.1.4 Priority Projects  67  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT AND ACTION PLAN  Project Priority Activity Area Responsible  authorities and stakeholders  PR8.01 1 Defining of the organisational structure and the necessary capacities of the Agency for civil society  Sustainability CIT  PR8.02 3 Campaigns for raising of the public awareness for information society  Sustainability CIT  PR8.03 2 Forming of a fund for information society development based on the principles of partnership between the public and the private sector  Sustainability Government of the Republic of Macedonia  PR8.04 5 Defining of the indicators and methodology for evaluation of the information society development in the Republic of Macedonia  Sustainability CIT,  Government of the Republic of Macedonia      4 ACTION PLAN  This Action Plan entails all projects, pilot projects, initiatives or programmes, divided by the previously stated pillars, where in an identical manner they are represented, linked to the realisation of a specific objective from the Strategy, responsible authority of the activity, other participants in the realisation, the time of implementation, financial projection, as well as critical factors for the implementation, the sources of financing and potential risks in respect to the Expected O utcomes.

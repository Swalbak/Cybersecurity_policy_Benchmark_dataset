Driven by increased connectivity and wide adoption of digital technologies, cyberspace has become the new nervous system supporting the functioning and delivery of services to citizens by Kenyan Government and businesses. As digital technologies continue to offer enormous socio-economic opportunities to our nation and citizens, we are faced with increasing cybersecurity risks and challenges. Cyberspace, with its unlimited borders, has therefore become the most active threat domain providing cyber threats with unparalleled opportunities to harm our nation. Kenya like many countries, is now exposed to dangers posed by foreign and domestic cyber criminals who are state and non-state actors, capable of disrupting provision of essential services, engaging in espionage, and threatening safety and security of our nation. My Government has identified cybersecurity as a key enabler for digital economy. To protect our digital economy, we are committed to safety and security in all spheres including the cyber domain. Notably, Kenya has adapted various policies, operational and administrative initiatives to improve our national cybersecurity. In strengthening the cybersecurity legislative framework, we enacted the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018 that established the National Computer and Cybercrimes Coordination Committee to coordinate cybersecurity matters. Further, we have enacted the Data Protection Act 2019 to ensure privacy of our data. I note that a robust National defense and protection of Kenya requires integrity of our physical borders and cyberspace. Therefore, measures to keep our people safe, our critical infrastructure protected and our economy growing are of high priority. My government has therefore developed this second National Cybersecurity Strategy to renew our efforts of building a secure and resilient cyberspace through a coordinated approach while maximizing on the benefits of a digital economy. As we continue leading in the digital economy in Africa, we aspire to showcase leadership in cybersecurity in the continent. This will be achieved through a coordinated national cybersecurity governance, and investing more in capabilities and capacity. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and this Strategy therefore calls all of us to participate in its implementation towards achieving our vision of a safe and trusted cyberspace for people of Kenya. His Excellency, Hon. Uhuru Kenyatta, C.G.H. President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces HE, HON. UHURU KENYATTA, C.G.H. President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya iv PREAMBLE Cybersecurity continues to draw considerable attention from Governments across the world. This is because, most services today are dispensed through ICT systems that are in use in all sectors of our economy. The adoption of these technologies has also seen steady growth in cybercrime in the recent times. Notably, the dynamic nature of cyberspace and constantly evolving tactics of perpetrators continue to pose serious risks to peace and stability of our nation. To respond to this, it has become increasingly necessary for the Government of Kenya to secure her cyberspace. The Government thus, has continued to develop and implement initiatives to combat increasing cybercrimes and strengthen the safety and resilience of our national critical systems. The initiatives include policy formulation and reviews, enactments of laws and regulations, strengthening of governance structures, capacity building, increased awareness programmes and fostering collaboration. To sustain these cybersecurity efforts, the Government has developed the second National Cybersecurity Strategy setting our priority areas, goals and key interventions. The strategy recognizes the cross-cutting nature of cyberspace and the need for coordinated and collective action from all sectors. In this regard, all stakeholders are encouraged to cooperate and support the Government in creating a more secure environment for our business and day to day activities. Dr. Fred Okengo Matiang’i, E.G.H. Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National Government DR. FRED OKENGO MATIANG’I, E.G.H. Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National Government Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya v MESSAGE The Kenyan government recognizes ICT sector as a key contributor and enabler in attainment of the Vision 2030 to transform Kenya into a digital economy. Guided by key policy documents including the Digital Economy Blueprint, National ICT Policy and National Digital Masterplan, the ICT sector has continued to be a key contributor to the GDP and source of national economic growth. The ICT sector has been instrumental in providing digital tools and innovations necessary to implement the development agenda including the Big Four Agenda as well as building resilience against the effects of economic shocks such as the Covid-19 Pandemic. To build a robust ICT ecosystem, the Kenyan government in collaboration with businesses is investing in the key pillars for digital economy: Digital Infrastructure; Digital Government services; Digital Business; Digital Skills; Digital Innovations as well as enhancing the policy, legal and regulatory framework. This has seen Kenya register significant progress in adoption of ICT in the delivery of services on digital platforms by government and businesses. The number of e-services for government and businesses has increased making them accessible, convenient and affordable to Kenyan citizens. Similarly, we have enhanced digital connectivity linking the entire government, counties, sub-counties, hospitals, schools and other public service organizations across the Republic of Kenya. Further, we have established more local data centres to ensure strategic data is localized and stored with minimal risk and at low cost. With increased capacity and capability, Kenya has ultimately increased the levels of mobile, Internet penetration and digital innovations in the country. Despite these notable achievements, Kenya faces increased cybersecurity challenges and risks that threaten the national security and our digital transformation agenda. With increased digital connectedness, Kenya is now more prone to cyber-criminal activities from any part of the world. Our expanded digitalization programmes coupled with investment in digital and data infrastructure present new challenges that require renewed efforts to enhance Kenya’s capacity and capability to support the growth of digital economy. Therefore, the Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs and in collaboration with other stakeholders will continue to prioritize formulation and review of policies, laws and regulations and implementation of key initiatives aimed at building a safe and secure cyberspace as envisioned by this National Cybersecurity Strategy.

The Strategy establishes foundations and pillars for effective cybersecurity for public and private sector by combining good governance with a set of initiatives and interventions. The Strategy commences with an in-depth background of Kenya’s cybersecurity landscape that highlights existing policy, legal and regulatory frameworks as well as outlining the challenges and threats facing Kenya’s cyberspace. The Strategy’s vision is a safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya; and a mission to build a secure and resilient cyberspace through a coordinated approach while maximizing on the benefits of a digital economy. The Strategy further provides a framework to defend and protect the cyberspace of the Republic of Kenya guided by the following strategic pillars: 1. Cybersecurity governance; 2. Cybersecurity policies, laws, regulations and standards; 3. Critical Information Infrastructures Protection (CIIP); 4. Cybersecurity capability and capacity building; 5. Cyber-Risks & Cyber-Crimes Management; and 6. Co-operation and collaboration The Strategy also has an implementation matrix which outlines the strategic interventions related to the Strategic Pillars. The matrix assigns roles and responsibilities to various cybersecurity actors to be performed within specified timelines as well as estimated costing of the initiatives. Monitoring and Evaluation of this Strategy is integrated with the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System (NIMES) in order to maintain clear linkages between the implementation of this Strategy and the Vision 2030. A mid- term review of this Strategy will be conducted after three (3) years and a final review after five (5) years. Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya x Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya 1 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Cyberspace is fundamental to the functioning of national and international security systems, trade networks, emergency services, basic communications, and other public and private activities. Cyberspace comprises of the network that connects various Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) infrastructure and includes: Internet, telecommunication networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), various computer systems, mobile communications, and interactions between virtual space and people constituted by information and data. Cyberspace has become a second space for human production and life and stands in juxtaposition to the real spaces of land, sea, air and outer space as the fifth largest strategic space. However, the wide adoption and the evolving nature of cyberspace primarily driven by emerging technologies has created new risks. These risks expose individuals, businesses, national infrastructure and government to cyber threats emanating from a wide variety of sources (state and non-state) and which manifest themselves in disruptive activities. Their effects carry significant risk to public safety, security of the nation and stability of the globally linked economy. The Government of Kenya (GoK) continues to initiate and promote numerous cybersecurity policy and legal initiatives. For instance, the Government developed and enacted various policy, legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at leveraging the opportunities of digital transformation to improve Kenya’s economic development while ensuring digital safety of its people, businesses and interests. Key ICT policies, legal and regulatory frameworks include: Kenya Information and Communications Act, 1998; National Cybersecurity Strategy 2014; National Broadband Strategy 2018; Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (CMCA), 2018; Data Protection Act (DPA), 2019; National ICT Policy Guidelines 2020; and National Digital Master Plan 2022. Kenya developed her first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2014, with the vision, key objectives, and commitment to support national priorities by encouraging ICT growth and proactive protection of critical information infrastructures. Through the 2014 Strategy; Kenya established Kenya Computer Incident Response Team and coordination Centre (KE-CIRT/CC) and the National Digital Forensics Laboratory at the National Police Service under Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya 2 Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). In regard to legislation, the Government enacted the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act-2018 which is currently the overarching law for protection of Critical Information Infrastructures and management of cybercrime in Kenya. To achieve its objectives, the Act establishes and mandates the National Computer and Cybercrimes Co-ordination Committee (NC4) and the Secretariat, as the national authority to spearhead and coordinate cybersecurity matters. The Committee comprises of Principal Secretary in charge of internal security, Principal Secretary in charge of ICT, Attorney-General (AG), Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces (CDF), Inspector-General of NPS, Director-General NIS, Director-General CA, Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Governor CBK, and Director NC4 Secretariat. To initialize CII protection as provided by the CMCA, GoK designated sectors and critical systems that facilitate provision of essential services and are strategic to national security as Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) vide the Gazette Notice No.1043 of 31 January 2022. These are systems whose disruption would result in: interruption of life sustaining service; an adverse effect on the economy of the Republic of Kenya; an event that would result in massive casualties or fatalities; failure or disruption of money market of the Republic of Kenya; and adverse and severe effect on the security of the Republic of Kenya including Intelligence and Military services. This affirms the Republic of Kenya’s commitment to safeguard and protect Kenya’s sovereignty and its people. 1.2 Cybersecurity Strategy Rationale The Republic of Kenya identifies cybersecurity as a national economic and security challenge. The most prevalent cybersecurity challenges in Kenya include exploitation of the new operating environment by adversaries to conduct war like activities such as disruption of operations of critical infrastructure. Most ICT infrastructure and users in the Republic of Kenya have prioritized efficiency, cost and convenience and overlooked security during development and implementation. Interconnected ICTs have inherent vendor/manufacturer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries and expose Kenyan citizens, businesses and government to global threats. Despite a growing number of incidents, governance of cyberspace has remained uncoordinated with no clear structure. While Kenya has enacted various policies and laws, regular review and update is necessary in order to effectively address emerging risks and Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya 3 Cyber Threats and Risks Cyber Warfare Cyber espionage Cyber sabotage Cyber terrorism Cyber subversion /activism Data breaches Figure 1: Threats and Actors threats. Further, cybersecurity awareness of government employees and the general public is assessed to be low thus increasing susceptibility to cybersecurity threats. On the other hand, Kenya increasingly continues to face cybersecurity threats (see figure 1) leveraging on the above-mentioned challenges. Nation states and corporate entities have used cyber espionage to gain access to sensitive/classified data for financial gain, political reasons and to gain competitive advantage. Further, as ICTs become more interconnected, systems become susceptible to sabotage through deliberate and malicious acts that may disrupt normal processes and functions or destroy/damage equipment and information. Similarly, Cyber subversion through propaganda, fake news and misinformation may undermine trust in the government, authority and competence of leaders thus posing a threat to Kenya’s stability. In addition, terror groups continue to leverage on ICTs (virtual private networks, internet, global applications, social media platforms and websites) for recruitment, radicalization, incitement, financing, training, planning and execution of attacks. Also, there has been an increase in cyber fraud cases through banking/finance, sim swaps and online scams such as digital Ponzi schemes, job scams, fake websites & lotteries, Crypto and Forex Scams, “Tuma kwa Hii Namba” syndicates among others Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya 4 Total Cyber Threats Detected Cybersecurity statistics indicate that the number of cyber threats detected in Kenya has significantly increased in the last three years. For instance, 143,040,599 cyber threats were detected in July-September 2021 as compared to 4589 threats detected in July-September 2017 (see figure 2). To facilitate actualization of GoK cybersecurity initiatives, and address the above challenges and threats, this Strategy aims to enhance institutional framework for cybersecurity governance and coordination; strengthen cybersecurity policy, legal and regulatory frameworks; enhance the protection and resilience of CIIs; strengthen cybersecurity capability and capacity; minimize cybersecurity risks and crimes and foster national and international cooperation and collaboration. GoK will spearhead its main responsibility of defending the Republic of Kenya’s cyberspace from all threats, to protect Kenyan citizens and the economy from harm, and to establish domestic and international frameworks to safeguard national interests, protect fundamental rights, and prosecute offenders. Similarly, Critical Information Infrastructure owners/operators, businesses and organizations in Kenya have the obligation of implementing measures to protect their critical systems and services by adopting a risk-based approach towards cybersecurity, managing vendor cybersecurity risks, adopting minimum cybersecurity baseline standards and supporting the government through reporting and response to cybersecurity matters.

That involves taking all reasonable precautions to protect not only the hardware – phones, computers and other gadgets, but also the data, software, and systems that provide freedom, flexibility, and convenience in their personal and professional lives. 1.3 Strategy Development and Implementation Process Kenya Cybersecurity Strategy 2022 development and implementation process entailed five phases; initiation, stocking and analysis, production, implementation and Monitoring & Evaluation (see figure 3) in line with Kenya’s public policy formulation approach and international best practices. NC4 initiated the Strategy formulation by establishing the National Cybersecurity Strategy Steering Committee who developed a work plan with major steps and activities, key stakeholders, timelines, human, and financial resource requirements. During stocking and analysis, the national cybersecurity capacity status was used to collect data on the strategic national cybersecurity posture and risk landscape that informed drafting of the Strategy. The production phase entailed several meetings and multi-stakeholder workshops that generated this Strategy. The implementation phase entails involving multi-stakeholders to support the execution of the identified initiatives in this strategy. While Monitoring and Evaluation phase is based on the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System (NIMES) framework.

	"original document": "NATIONAL  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY  2022  THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  iii  FOREWORD My fellow Kenyans: The Republic of Kenya recognizes cyberspace as  a new strategic high ground in the envisioned fifth  industrial revolution that represent much more  advanced collaborative interactions between  humans, machines, processes and systems. Driven  by increased connectivity and wide adoption of  digital technologies, cyberspace has become the  new nervous system supporting the functioning  and delivery of services to citizens by Kenyan  Government and businesses.  As digital technologies continue to offer enormous  socio-economic opportunities to our nation and  citizens, we are faced with increasing cybersecurity  risks and challenges. Cyberspace, with its unlimited  borders, has therefore become the most active  threat domain providing cyber threats with  unparalleled opportunities to harm our nation.  Kenya like many countries, is now exposed to  dangers posed by foreign and domestic cyber   criminals who are state and non-state actors, capable of disrupting provision of  essential services, engaging in espionage, and threatening safety and security of  our nation.  My Government has identified cybersecurity as a key enabler for digital economy.  To protect our digital economy, we are committed to safety and security in all  spheres including the cyber domain. Notably, Kenya has adapted various policies,  operational and administrative initiatives to improve our national cybersecurity. In  strengthening the cybersecurity legislative framework, we enacted the Computer  Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018 that established the National Computer and  Cybercrimes Coordination Committee to coordinate cybersecurity matters.  Further, we have enacted the Data Protection Act 2019 to ensure privacy of our  data.  I note that a robust National defense and protection of Kenya requires integrity  of our physical borders and cyberspace. Therefore, measures to keep our people  safe, our critical infrastructure protected and our economy growing are of high  priority. My government has therefore developed this second National Cybersecurity  Strategy to renew our efforts of building a secure and resilient cyberspace  through a coordinated approach while maximizing on the benefits of a digital  economy. As we continue leading in the digital economy in Africa, we aspire  to showcase leadership in cybersecurity in the continent. This will be achieved  through a coordinated national cybersecurity governance, and investing more  in capabilities and capacity. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and this  Strategy therefore calls all of us to participate in its implementation towards  achieving our vision of a safe and trusted cyberspace for people of Kenya.  His Excellency, Hon. Uhuru Kenyatta, C.G.H. President of the Republic of Kenya  and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces  HE, HON. UHURU KENYATTA, C.G.H. President of the Republic of Kenya  and Commander-in-Chief of the   Defence Forces    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  iv  PREAMBLE  Cybersecurity continues to draw considerable  attention from Governments across the world.  This is because, most services today are  dispensed through ICT systems that are in use  in all sectors of our economy. The adoption of  these technologies has also seen steady growth  in cybercrime in the recent times. Notably, the  dynamic nature of cyberspace and constantly  evolving tactics of perpetrators continue to  pose serious risks to peace and stability of our  nation.   To respond to this, it has become increasingly  necessary for the Government of Kenya to  secure her cyberspace. The Government thus,  has continued to develop and implement  initiatives to combat increasing cybercrimes  and strengthen the safety and resilience of  our national critical systems. The initiatives  include policy formulation and reviews, enactments of laws and regulations,  strengthening of governance structures, capacity building, increased awareness  programmes and fostering collaboration.   To sustain these cybersecurity efforts, the Government has developed the  second National Cybersecurity Strategy setting our priority areas, goals and key  interventions. The strategy recognizes the cross-cutting nature of cyberspace  and the need for coordinated and collective action from all sectors. In this regard,  all stakeholders are encouraged to cooperate and support the Government in  creating a more secure environment for our business and day to day activities.  Dr. Fred Okengo Matiang’i, E.G.H. Cabinet Secretary,  Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination  of National Government   DR. FRED OKENGO MATIANG’I, E.G.H. Cabinet Secretary,   Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination  of National Government    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  v  MESSAGE The Kenyan government recognizes ICT sector as  a key contributor and enabler in attainment of  the Vision 2030 to transform Kenya into a digital  economy. Guided by key policy documents  including the Digital Economy Blueprint, National  ICT Policy and National Digital Masterplan, the  ICT sector has continued to be a key contributor  to the GDP and source of national economic  growth. The ICT sector has been instrumental in  providing digital tools and innovations necessary  to implement the development agenda including  the Big Four Agenda as well as building resilience  against the effects of economic shocks such as   the Covid-19 Pandemic. To build a robust ICT ecosystem, the Kenyan  government in collaboration with businesses is  investing in the key pillars for digital economy:  Digital Infrastructure; Digital Government   services; Digital Business; Digital Skills; Digital Innovations as well as enhancing the  policy, legal and regulatory framework. This has seen Kenya register significant  progress in adoption of ICT in the delivery of services on digital platforms by  government and businesses. The number of e-services for government and  businesses has increased making them accessible, convenient and affordable to  Kenyan citizens. Similarly, we have enhanced digital connectivity linking the entire  government, counties, sub-counties, hospitals, schools and other public service  organizations across the Republic of Kenya. Further, we have established more  local data centres to ensure strategic data is localized and stored with minimal  risk and at low cost. With increased capacity and capability, Kenya has ultimately  increased the levels of mobile, Internet penetration and digital innovations in the  country. Despite these notable achievements, Kenya faces increased cybersecurity  challenges and risks that threaten the national security and our digital  transformation agenda. With increased digital connectedness, Kenya is now  more prone to cyber-criminal activities from any part of the world. Our expanded  digitalization programmes coupled with investment in digital and data  infrastructure present new challenges that require renewed efforts to enhance  Kenya’s capacity and capability to support the growth of digital economy. Therefore, the Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs and in collaboration with  other stakeholders will continue to prioritize formulation and review of policies,  laws and regulations and implementation of key initiatives aimed at building  a safe and secure cyberspace as envisioned by this National Cybersecurity  Strategy.

The Strategy establishes  foundations and pillars for effective cybersecurity for public and private sector  by combining good governance with a set of initiatives and interventions. The  Strategy commences with an in-depth background of Kenya’s cybersecurity  landscape that highlights existing policy, legal and regulatory frameworks as well  as outlining the challenges and threats facing Kenya’s cyberspace.   The Strategy’s vision is a safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya;  and a mission to build a secure and resilient cyberspace through a coordinated  approach while maximizing on the benefits of a digital economy. The Strategy  further provides a framework to defend and protect the cyberspace of the  Republic of Kenya guided by the following strategic pillars:    1. Cybersecurity governance;  2. Cybersecurity policies, laws, regulations and standards;  3. Critical Information Infrastructures Protection (CIIP);  4. Cybersecurity capability and capacity building;  5. Cyber-Risks & Cyber-Crimes Management; and  6. Co-operation and collaboration  The Strategy also has an implementation matrix which outlines the strategic  interventions related to the Strategic Pillars. The matrix assigns roles and  responsibilities to various cybersecurity actors to be performed within specified  timelines as well as estimated costing of the initiatives.    Monitoring and Evaluation of this Strategy is integrated with the National  Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System (NIMES) in order to maintain clear  linkages between the implementation of this Strategy and the Vision 2030. A mid- term review of this Strategy will be conducted after three (3) years and a final  review after five (5) years.    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  x    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  1  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Cyberspace is fundamental to the functioning of national and  international security systems, trade networks, emergency services,  basic communications, and other public and private activities.  Cyberspace comprises of the network that connects various Information,  Communication and Technology (ICT) infrastructure and includes:  Internet, telecommunication networks, the Internet of Things (IoT),  various computer systems, mobile communications, and interactions  between virtual space and people constituted by information and data.  Cyberspace has become a second space for human production and life  and stands in juxtaposition to the real spaces of land, sea, air and outer  space as the fifth largest strategic space.   However, the wide adoption and the evolving nature of cyberspace  primarily driven by emerging technologies has created new risks.  These risks expose individuals, businesses, national infrastructure and  government to cyber threats emanating from a wide variety of sources  (state and non-state) and which manifest themselves in disruptive  activities. Their effects carry significant risk to public safety, security of  the nation and stability of the globally linked economy.   The Government of Kenya (GoK) continues to initiate and promote  numerous cybersecurity policy and legal initiatives. For instance, the  Government developed and enacted various policy, legal and regulatory  frameworks aimed at leveraging the opportunities of digital transformation  to improve Kenya’s economic development while ensuring digital safety of  its people, businesses and interests. Key ICT policies, legal and regulatory  frameworks include: Kenya Information and Communications Act, 1998;  National Cybersecurity Strategy 2014; National Broadband Strategy 2018;  Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (CMCA), 2018; Data Protection  Act (DPA), 2019; National ICT Policy Guidelines 2020; and National Digital  Master Plan 2022.  Kenya developed her first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2014, with the vision, key  objectives, and commitment to support national priorities by encouraging  ICT growth and proactive protection of critical information infrastructures.  Through the 2014 Strategy; Kenya established Kenya Computer Incident  Response Team and coordination Centre (KE-CIRT/CC) and the National  Digital Forensics Laboratory at the National Police Service under     Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  2  Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). In regard to legislation, the  Government enacted the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act-2018  which is currently the overarching law for protection of Critical Information  Infrastructures and management of cybercrime in Kenya. To achieve its  objectives, the Act establishes and mandates the National Computer  and Cybercrimes Co-ordination Committee (NC4) and the Secretariat,  as the national authority to spearhead and coordinate cybersecurity  matters. The Committee comprises of Principal Secretary in charge of  internal security, Principal Secretary in charge of ICT, Attorney-General  (AG), Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces (CDF), Inspector-General of NPS,  Director-General NIS, Director-General CA, Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP), Governor CBK, and Director NC4 Secretariat.  To initialize CII protection as provided by the CMCA, GoK designated sectors  and critical systems that facilitate provision of essential services and are  strategic to national security as Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs)  vide the Gazette Notice No.1043 of 31 January 2022. These are systems  whose disruption would result in: interruption of life sustaining service;  an adverse effect on the economy of the Republic of Kenya; an event  that would result in massive casualties or fatalities; failure or disruption of  money market of the Republic of Kenya; and adverse and severe effect  on the security of the Republic of Kenya including Intelligence and Military  services. This affirms the Republic of Kenya’s commitment to safeguard  and protect Kenya’s sovereignty and its people.  1.2 Cybersecurity Strategy Rationale  The Republic of Kenya identifies cybersecurity as a national economic and  security challenge. The most prevalent cybersecurity challenges in Kenya  include exploitation of the new operating environment by adversaries  to conduct war like activities such as disruption of operations of critical  infrastructure. Most ICT infrastructure and users in the Republic of Kenya  have prioritized efficiency, cost and convenience and overlooked security  during development and implementation. Interconnected ICTs have  inherent vendor/manufacturer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by  adversaries and expose Kenyan citizens, businesses and government  to global threats. Despite a growing number of incidents, governance  of cyberspace has remained uncoordinated with no clear structure.  While Kenya has enacted various policies and laws, regular review and  update is necessary in order to effectively address emerging risks and     Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  3  Cyber  Threats   and Risks   Cyber  Warfare  Cyber  espionage  Cyber  sabotage  Cyber  terrorism  Cyber  subversion  /activism  Data  breaches  Figure 1: Threats and Actors  threats. Further, cybersecurity awareness of government employees and  the general public is assessed to be low thus increasing susceptibility to  cybersecurity threats.  On the other hand, Kenya increasingly continues to face cybersecurity  threats (see figure 1) leveraging on the above-mentioned challenges.  Nation states and corporate entities have used cyber espionage to gain  access to sensitive/classified data for financial gain, political reasons  and to gain competitive advantage. Further, as ICTs become more  interconnected, systems become susceptible to sabotage through  deliberate and malicious acts that may disrupt normal processes and  functions or destroy/damage equipment and information. Similarly,  Cyber subversion through propaganda, fake news and misinformation  may undermine trust in the government, authority and competence of  leaders thus posing a threat to Kenya’s stability. In addition, terror groups  continue to leverage on ICTs (virtual private networks, internet, global  applications, social media platforms and websites) for recruitment,  radicalization, incitement, financing, training, planning and execution of  attacks. Also, there has been an increase in cyber fraud cases through  banking/finance, sim swaps and online scams such as digital Ponzi  schemes, job scams, fake websites & lotteries, Crypto and Forex Scams,  “Tuma kwa Hii Namba” syndicates among others    Vision: Safe and trusted cyberspace for the people of Kenya  4                 Total Cyber Threats Detected    Cybersecurity statistics indicate that the number of cyber threats  detected in Kenya has significantly increased in the last three years. For  instance, 143,040,599 cyber threats were detected in July-September  2021 as compared to 4589 threats detected in July-September 2017 (see  figure 2).  To facilitate actualization of GoK cybersecurity initiatives, and address the  above challenges and threats, this Strategy aims to enhance institutional  framework for cybersecurity governance and coordination; strengthen  cybersecurity policy, legal and regulatory frameworks; enhance the  protection and resilience of CIIs; strengthen cybersecurity capability and  capacity; minimize cybersecurity risks and crimes and foster national  and international cooperation and collaboration.  GoK will spearhead its main responsibility of defending the Republic  of Kenya’s cyberspace from all threats, to protect Kenyan citizens and  the economy from harm, and to establish domestic and international  frameworks to safeguard national interests, protect fundamental rights,  and prosecute offenders.   Similarly, Critical Information Infrastructure owners/operators, businesses  and organizations in Kenya have the obligation of implementing measures  to protect their critical systems and services by adopting a risk-based  approach towards cybersecurity, managing vendor cybersecurity risks,  adopting minimum cybersecurity baseline standards and supporting the  government through reporting and response to cybersecurity matters.

That involves taking all reasonable precautions  to protect not only the hardware – phones, computers and other gadgets,  but also the data, software, and systems that provide freedom, flexibility,  and convenience in their personal and professional lives.  1.3 Strategy Development and Implementation  Process  Kenya Cybersecurity Strategy 2022 development and implementation  process entailed five phases; initiation, stocking and analysis, production,  implementation and Monitoring & Evaluation (see figure 3) in line  with  Kenya’s public policy  formulation approach and international best  practices. NC4 initiated the Strategy formulation by establishing the  National Cybersecurity Strategy Steering Committee who developed a  work plan with major steps and activities, key stakeholders, timelines,  human, and financial resource requirements. During stocking and  analysis, the national cybersecurity capacity status was used to collect  data on the strategic national cybersecurity posture and risk landscape  that informed drafting of the Strategy. The production phase entailed  several meetings and multi-stakeholder workshops that generated this  Strategy. The implementation phase entails involving multi-stakeholders  to support the execution of the identified initiatives in this strategy.

They have had positive impact on the economy, enabling its growth and efficiencies on service delivery. Through the envisaged National Broadband Strategy (NBS), the Government of Botswana would like to further enhance the role of ICT, particularly cyberspace in socio-economic and political aspects of the country. However, the Government is conscious of the risks, threats and vulnerabilities to the citizens and the country posed by misuse of cyberspace. It is for this reason that the Government, working in concert with the private sector, developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy to provide a framework for a secure cyberspace in Botswana. The Strategy is aimed at the public, to raise awareness and build capacity among them to safeguard against cyber threats, for the industry and Government to always be prepared to prevent, defend and act against any cyber-attacks. The development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) will enable the Government of Botswana and other stakeholders, to establish appropriate measures that will ensure Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of networks, systems and data of the information communicated, processed and stored through electronic or equivalent means. Because cyber-attacks are not limited by national boundaries, passing through multiple networks in different countries, it is important to engage with all relevant stakeholders in developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. It is essential that cyber security requirements are ―bake it in‖ in initial design and development of the ICT systems rather than to be ―bolted on‖ at the later stage of the development cycle. The development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy was led by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and it included all the relevant stakeholders from the Private Sector, relevant Ministries, Regulator, and Academia. The Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) assisted with the development of the National Cyber Security Strategy with funding from the United Kingdom of Great Britain Government’s Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO). The United Kingdom of Great Britain further contributed by providing comments on the draft strategy. In addition, the project team which developed National Cyber Security Strategy benefited from inputs and comments from the United States of America (USA) State Department, through the technical consultant from MITRE and Carnegie Melon University. On behalf of the Government of Botswana. I would like to thank all who assisted with the development this strategy. The main aim of the National Cybersecurity Strategy is to have a high-level top down approach cyber security framework that clearly establishes national objectives, sets priorities, specifies timeframes and outlines the roles of the various stakeholders. Cyber threats by their nature do not discriminate between big and small institutions 6 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy and individuals; there are many examples of cyber incidents against multi-national corporations and individuals. Cyber threats can be complex. Therefore, ordinary individuals with less sophistication and means may require to be continuously assisted and educated, to keep up with evolving threats. These threats and risks are ever presents. Therefore, it is very important that Government and other key stakholders, play an active role in addressing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. To ensure effective implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, an implementation plan with clear key performance indicators has been developed to monitor and validate that the objectives of the strategy are achieved. The appropriate mechanisms and framework will be put in place to ensure that the key performance indicators and desired outcomes are realised. As the Ministry responsible for ICT, we believe that the National Cyber Security Strategy will provide appropriate guidance in addressing the issues of Cyber Security which require a multi-stakeholder approach. ………………………………………… Honourable Minister Onkokame Kitso Mokaila MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 7 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Information and Communications Technology (ICT), is increasingly transforming societies and enabling the growth of the global economy. The adoption of ICT within a country’s economy provides enormous benefits through improved efficiencies and effectiveness in service delivery, cost savings, improved productivity, transparency as well as accountability. Digital infrastructures are emerging as the backbone of a successful economy, a vibrant research community, a transparent state as well as a free society. Botswana is gradually leveraging ICTs in its critical areas such as communications, governance, utility provision, healthcare, financial and transport sectors. This has led to the emergence of possible threats and risks against the National Critical Information Infrastructure. The risks and threats must be mitigated against. Cybersecurity is now taking centre stage in ensuring that critical infrastructure is protected through continuous risk assessment, putting in place appropriate mitigations, creating appropriate collaborations, having in place relevant and effective cyber security capabilities, accompanied by cybersecuritry awareness. It’s for this purpose that Botswana developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategy addresses the current challenges within Botswana and proposes strategic action areas to improve our cybersecurity maturity. The objective of this strategy is to create a cohesive and inclusive approach to delivering a safe, secure and resilient cyberspace and a comprehensive framework to facilitate coordinated responses by Government, the private sector, and other partners to address issues of cyber security. The National Cybersecurity strategy is organised as follows: - Introduction section provides the background information, situational analysis in relation to the Cybersecurity and also provides the rationale and justification for the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. Section 2 contextualises issues of Cybersecurity in relation to Botswana in terms of the benefits, risks and threats arise in the cyberspace. The strategic goals and objectives are discussed in section three and the final section discusses the implementation, roles and responsibility, monitoring and evaluation issues. 8 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The National Cybersecurity Strategy sets out how Botswana intends to create a resilient, safe and secure ICT operational environment. The strategy is aimed towards the members of the public, industry, international partners and the Government. The strategy aims to provide awareness to members of the public on threats, risks in the cyberspace and interventions. For the Government and Industry, it’s a call to arms, for them to take action and provide necessary resources. The strategy also lays out its principles, which will help Botswana to collaborate and cooperate with interested international partners with similar values. The rapid proliferation and adoption of ICT services and infrastructure in Botswana is transforming how citizens, the private sector, and the Government interact, inform themselves, participate and contribute to the well-functioning of society. However, this has also resulted in the introduction of new types of risks, in the form of cyber threats or attacks. These threats affect service provision and trust in the use of ICT. The increase in cybercrime sophistication and occurrence requires a proactive approach to ensure that risks are continually assessed and mitigations put in place. While most Batswana have taken up technology, there has not been a corresponding rise in public education and awareness on cyber security issues. Cybersecurity has been identified as a critical issue in Botswana. The National Development Plan 11 covering the years 2017-2023, states that cyberspace threats and risks should be dealt with during the NDP implementation. The NDP 11 further notes that since cybersecurity threats are imminent and worrisome, it is appropriate for legislation to combat cybersecurity to be developed during NDP 11. Under NDP 11 headings of ICT and Secure Cyber Space, secure cyber space is identified as one of the factors that would support the economy, in particular key priority areas of water, agriculture, power, tourism and job creation. Botswana has done relatively well in providing formal education to its population and provision of necessary infrastructure that facilitates communications and service delivery through Information and Communication Technologies. The country, however, has limited capacity on Cyber Security expertise. The issues of Cyber Security require a multi-stakeholder approach due to the diverse nature of the cyberspace. Currently, in Botswana there is no coordinated framework for addressing the cyber security issues among the various stakeholders. One of the objectives of this strategy is to clarify the roles of the various key stakeholders, both public and private, in addressing the country’s cybersecurity challenges. ICT sector or cyberspace depends on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) that can be accessed via internet or otherwise, and also goes beyond territorial boundaries. This makes protecting this infrastructure more complex, given that it also brings in third parties in the form of other countries. It is for this reason that 9 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy international cooperation and collaboration plays a central role in the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS). An open and free internet, the protection of personal data as well as the integrity of interconnected networks are critical for overall prosperity, security and the promotion of human rights in Botswana. This strategy provides a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring the safety, security and reliability of Botswana’s cyberspace. 1.2 Situational Analysis In 2012 the country carried out cyber security assessment assisted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) to assess the country’s readiness for establishing a National Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), which will assist in responding to the cyber security threats1. The study found that Botswana has a well-developed ICT infrastructure with fibre-optic cables linking the major population centres. In addition the country has international connectivity through WACS, SEACOM and EASSY undersea cables. The community is well connected with mobile network covering more than 90% of the population. Internet usage is increasing throughout the country with many people using the mobile services to access the Internet, more especially the social media; the country’s mobile broadband subscription was 1 409,274 as of Dec 2016. 1.2.1 Summary of the Key Findings of the Assessment i) Cyber security is not allocated sufficient priority in policy making and on the on- going ICT projects. Also, Cyber security principles are not adopted by government in all the projects related to ICT. ii) Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) has not been identified and there is no defined cyber security strategy in place to manage and mitigate cyber security incidents in case of a coordinated cyber-attack on the critical national information infrastructure. It was recommended that the Country should develop a National Cyber Security Strategy that will clearly define roles of the various stakeholders and develop measures and procedures for the protection of CNII iii) Appropriate legislation, policies and regulations on cyber security are inadequate to address the current cyber security challenges. iv) Training, specifically in the area of cyber security needs to be improved; all stakeholders such as regulators, Law Enforcement Agencies, Judiciary, Prosecutors, Service providers, Financial Institutions, service providers need to have adequate capacity and capability to handle matters related to cyber security. 1 The Full report of ITU/Impact CIRT Readiness assessment Report can be assessed at 10 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy v) There is no proper coordination or mechanism dealing with monitoring, detection, tracking and mitigation of cyber-attacks and cyber threats at national level . There is no coordination on cyber security issues public awareness. It was recommended that the country should establish a National Computer Emergency Response to monitor and detect cyber threats, as well as educate the public. vi) The report noted that the country has had reported cases of some cybercrime activities and threats such as Money laundering, online Scams, Hacking, Malwares, Viruses and worms, Identity Theft, Frauds, SPAM etc. Most of these were addressed on ad hoc basis by various institutions vii) The study recommended that the country should develop and implement awareness campaigns to educate users, law enforcement officers and policy makers about cyber laws, the impact of cybercrime and measures of combating it. 11 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 1.3 Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework Botswana has developed a number of policies, regulatory and legislative instruments which currently provide direction and guidelines on cybersecurity. The country has no data protection and privacy law. Neither does it have any national governance roadmap for cybersecurity. Some of the legislations and policies currently in place that address cybersecurity related issues are:  Cybercrime and Computer Related Crimes Act No. 22 of 2007 which is intended to: combat cybercrime and computer related crimes, repress criminal activities perpetrated through computer systems and to facilitate the collection of electronic evidence. The Act is currently being reviewed to address the latest technology changes and related cybercrimes.  Communications Regulatory Authority Act No. 19 of 2012, which provides for the regulation of the communication sector, comprising telecommunications, Internet, Radio communications, Broadcasting, Postal services and related matters.  Electronic Communications and Transactions Act No. 14 of 2014 is intended to provide for the facilitation and regulation of electronic communications and transactions. It is to provide specifically for electronic commerce and electronic signatures as well as for matters incidental and connected thereto. The associated secondary legislation (regulations) have also been developed.  “Electronic Records (Evidence) Act No. 13 of 2014. The Act provides for the admissibility of electronic evidence in legal proceedings and authentication of electronic evidence. The associated secondary legislation (regulations) have also been developed.  The National Information and Communications Technology Policy commonly called (Maitlamo)” has also been adopted by the Country to guide the development of ICT throughout the country. 1.4 Rationale Cyber security is a global challenge. Thus, a co-ordinated multi-sector response provides a route to building public confidence and trust in the use of ICTs. These efforts rely on national actions among countries of the world, Botswana included. One of the key challenges that the Government of Botswana is facing in this information age is to ensure that the nation is secure against cyber threats. Botswana is experiencing a growing dependence on Cyberspace for the delivery of services essential to people’s daily lives, commerce, National security, innovation and the general free flow of information. The increasing dependency on ICTs by both public and private sectors, makes protection and sharing of information more critical in order to protect the economic interests and security of Botswana and her citizens. 12 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy A number of new and major risks exist in cyberspace such as: organised crime in cyberspace, hacktivism, cyberattacks, unplanned disruptions to network integrity and security due to human errors or factors, cyber terrorism, abuse of personal data, child online pornography, loss of money or data due to activities in cyberspace, etc. With the increase in sophistication of these cyber threats, risks, and cybercrime over the years, the necessity of developing a coherent approach to effectively detect, prevent and mitigate both current and future Cyber threats arises, hence the motivation to develop a National Cybersecurity Strategy for Botswana. The strategy will help initiate a systematic national programme to defend cyberspace from threats irrespective of their origin. Critically, the strategy prioritises cyber threats and risks as well as allocation of responsibilities, to ensure that all relevant stakeholders accept responsibility for and take appropriate steps to enhance cybersecurity. As a result, the strategy aims to improve security by creating stakeholders awareness on relevant risks, preventive measures and effective responses. 13 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 2.0 CONTEXT – SOCIO-ECONOMIC, RISKS AND THREATS 2.1 Society Cyberspace has developed into a vital area of activity for the state, the economy, science and society in general. Everything in the information age is connected to the Internet and everything is connected to each other. This promotes innovation and enhances productivity. It is estimated that there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020 enabling them to communicate with each other (compared to 15 billion today)2. By the end of 2015, there were more than 3.2 billion Internet users globally, with a sizeable population of Batswana amongst them. Cybersecurity is an ecosystem that goes beyond the use of technology. It includes non- technical measures such as delivery of timely and appropriate policy and regulatory responses, capacity building and consumer awareness. The main objective of the National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ensure that Citizens have access to an open cyberspace with confidence that their data will be protected. Batswana use social media for advocacy on socioeconomic and political issues. It is also a platform reach out to target audience instantaneously, at a fraction of the cost of traditional media advertising. Examples include entertainment industry reaching out to audience beyond border and government delivering the public services (e-gov services) through the online platforms. Therefore, it is important to ensure that cyberspace is secure to guarantee public confidence and integrity on the Internet. 2.2 Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) Cyberspace has developed into a market place of strategic importance in a relatively short period of time. The country has enacted the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act in order to facilitate e-commerce and is in the process of developing an e-commerce strategy. Some businesses are already trading online and also use the Internet to market their products on the global market. While Botswana’s participation in online market is still at its infancy stage, it is expected to grow once the country has developed and implemented an e-Commerce strategy. It is important for Botswana to be part of the digital economy, using e-commerce to drive the economic diversification. 2.3 e- Government Services The Internet plays an important role in facilitating the communication between Government and society. The Government has developed an e-government strategy to provide online services. Cyberspace has an impact on the relationship between the Government and society. The Government portal is already online. Social media 2 Source: A collaborative report by DHL and Cisco ( innovation/DHLTrendReport_Internet_of_things.pdf) 14 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy such as Facebook and twitter are used to disseminate information and interact with citizens. Usage of cyberspace to deliver e-government services improves the relationship between the Government and society, allowing an open and transparent platform for political participation and expression. Parliament has online initiatives such as ―Botswanaspeaks”, through which the electorates can raise their issues via ICTs and have Members of Parliament attend to them. Citizens can now interact with their political leaders and provide input on issues of National interest without the need to wait for “Kgotla‖ meetings. 2.4 Risks and Threats While ICTs have improved the lives of ordinary Batswana, there are risks and threats in the cyberspace that can potentially harm citizens. Because of its global connectedness, Internet has a wide range of risks and threats that go beyond Botswana’s borders. The types of threats and risks range from relatively low level ones such as fake news to high level risks such as financial crimes and even interference of the country’s ICT systems. There is, therefore, need for Batswana to be more vigilant and well informed on how they can protect their data in the cyberspace. ICT enabled Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) such as electricity, water, transportation, telecommunications, commerce and health are susceptible to various cyber risks and threats since they rely on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to deliver their services. Cyber-attacks on CNI could have negative consequences for national security, the economy or the well-being of citizens of the country. This Strategy contains a series of measures and procedures to strengthen and have a coordinated approach to protect the Critical National Infrastructure against the risks and threats of the cyberspace. Cybercrimes are not only from within the country, they are cross border. They may come from non-state actors (such as hacktivists who may not agree in principle with a position Botswana has taken or terrorists wreaking havoc on states that hold opposing views), state actors (countries with competing interest to those of Botswana or in conflict with Botswana) and organised crime. There is a broad spectrum of new challenging risks and threats in the cyberspace, which includes: cyber bullying, revenge porn, child pornography, identity fraud, or misuse of the Internet for extremism. Some cybercrimes are increasingly becoming common; these include distribution of sexual materials, child pornography, identity theft, recruitment into the use and distribution of illicit substances especially among minors, human. Multi-stakeholder cooperation between the governmental and relevant non- governmental bodies at national, regional and International level is essential in order to combat cyber threats as a whole and this Strategy advocates for that. 15 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.0 STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS 3.1 Vision & Mission Statement 3.2 Core Values The core values represent the attitudes, behaviours and characters required to create an enabling and conducive environment for the successful realisation of the National Cyber Security Strategy objectives: VISION Cybersecurity for all by 2022 and beyond MISSION STATEMENT Exist to protect information infrastructure, provide information security assurance, build capacity and capabilities to prevent and respond to cyber threats in order to enhance the socio-economic development of Botswana 16 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy  Accountability - All organisations/institutions responsible for various strategic actions will make decisions in a responsible manner and utilise the resources efficiently and effectively.  Integrity – The integrity of the infrastructure will be assured and data transmitted over the networks will not be altered or deleted without authority.  Confidentiality – Privacy and fundamental rights of individuals will be preserved when implementing the various Cyber Security strategic initiatives and adherence to internationally acceptable governance principles will be maintained.  Collaboration - Collaboration and cooperation will be established with all relevant multi-stakeholders including nationally and internationally institutions to share information and experiences in addressing Cyber Security challenges. 17 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.3 Strategic Objectives Strategic Objectivel 1 To make Botswana more secure and resilient to Cyber attacks Strategic Objective 2 To build Cyber Security capacity and capability in Botswana Strategic Objective 3 To raise and promote Cyber Security awareness among the general public Strategic Objective 4 To foster Cyber Security research and development Strategic Objective 5 To enhance collaboration and cooperation on Cyber Security issues at national, regional and International level Strategic Objective 6 To harness or leverage Botswana’s Cyberspace for socio- economic development 18 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.4 Strategic Objectives and Initiatives Strategic objectives and initiatives have been summarised in tabular form as shown below: Strategic Objective: To achieve a secure and resilient Cyberspace Strategic Initiative Key Milestones Expected Outcome Responsibility 1.1 Develop and review appropriate policies and legislation that promotes a secure cyberspace 1.1.1 Enact legislative, policy and regulatory framework for establishing National CIRT, National Cyber Security Operation Centre, Digital Forensic Labs and Research Centres.

The National Executive should identify national business priorities and provide monetary and human resources needed to implement the strategy. In addition, the importance of this strategy needs to be understood across all sectors.  Cybersecurity Risk Assessment - The incorporation of risk management as a delivery area within the executive management (both public and private enterprises) provides a strong foundation for Cybersecurity implementation—covering the areas of people, process and technology. The security of digital infrastructure and information must be understood as vital and incorporated within all organisational functionality beyond technical solutions.  Resource Prioritisation - Identification and prioritization of key resources aimed at improving the country’s security, resilience, operational capacities to effectively manage and respond to cyber incidents as well as protect against ever persistent threats is crucial. Embedded within this area is the need to continuously improve operational capabilities to keep abreast with the level of sophistication of cybercrime as well as advanced persistent threats.  Human Capital - Efficient implementation of Cybersecurity requires highly qualified and skilled human resource across all sectors. The ability of institutions in both Public and Private sector to attain and retain skilled human resource is therefore important for maintaining and ensuring a strong protection approach against cyber threats especially with operators of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).  Multi-stakeholder Approach - Managing compliance of all key stakeholders and actors within both the public and private sector provides assurance on improving the nation’s Cybersecurity maturity. This requires deliberate effort and initiative from each stakeholder to meet their obligations. A proper coordination of efforts is required with a view to conducting cyber drills among sectors and to ensure that national response and sector response are coordinated. Information sharing is also 29 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy key. The ability to build trust and relationships with key stakeholders (industry, international Cybersecurity organizations and sovereign states) is important due to the fact that cyber threats span various jurisdictions.  International Cooperation - The nature of cyber space is borderless and complex; this implies that managing risk is a shared responsibility beyond Government alone. Various key players besides GoB including NCII operators, businesses, private sector, academia, civil society and citizenry should share this responsibility based on harmonious collaboration. International collaboration is therefore key in ensuring presence of capacity and mechanisms to handle cyber threats from a foreign adversary as well as provide assistance to international allies when required. 4.2 Governance Framework There shall be a governance structure, which will oversee the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. It is recommended that a multi-stakeholder National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) , comprising representatives from the private sector and relevant Government institutions and agencies, should be established. The Advisory Council will oversee the operations of Botswana Computer Incidence Response Team (BWCIRT) and overall implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The BWCIRT will act as the Secretariat of the National Cybersecurity Advisory Council. In addition it is also recommended that a specialised function, separate from mainstream BWCIRT duties, of a Cybersecurity Operation Centre (COC) be established in order to ensure that the country is well prepared for all Cyber threats. The COC should deal with the threats and attacks of the highest level. These should be those attacks, the objective of which threatens the security, sovereignty and economy of the republic of Botswana. Such threats could be either state sponsored (such as espionage, cyber conflict) or non-state actor activities such as terrorism. Because of the nature of its assignment, COC should be established and managed by the National Security agencies. The strategy also recommends the establishment of Digital Forensic Laboratory (DFL) to assist with processing and analysis of the electronic evidence. It is recommended that Botswana Police Service is mandated to take the lead in establishment of the DFL. Various sectorial CIRTs may also be established in order to assist the various sectors in responding to the Cyber Security challenges. The coordination and sharing of information of the sectorial CIRTs will be done through the BWCIRT. 30 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy The diagram below summarises the proposed governance structure for the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy: Figure 1 : NCS Governance Structure 4.3 Roles and Responsibilities The role of Government in Cybersecurity is extensive;this is to be expected given the vital role of ICTs in the nation, the wide range of threats and vulnerabilities and the cross-sector nature of Cybersecurity. The Government will assume a variety of roles including national level policy-making and citizen level capacity-building. However, it should be noted that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility. Various stakeholders, particularly private and independent sectors, play a leading and key role in ensuring security in the cyberspace. 4.3.1 Ministry of Transport and Communications The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is responsible for developing relevant policies and strategies, and supports the development of relevant laws Ministry of Transport and Communications National Cybersecurity Advisory Council BWCIRT Sectorial CIRTs (e.g. Financail CiRT, Government CIRT etc.) Digital Forensic Laboratory Cyber Security operational Centre Ministry of Defence, Justice and Security 31 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy governing the ICT sector in Botswana. It also coordinates their implementation through National, regional and global collaborative efforts that harness local resources, talent and innovation. Equally, MTC is responsible for the general oversight of the ICT sector including cybersecurity. This role was further pronounced through a recent Presidential directive, giving MTC the mandate for the overall coordination and oversight of ICT, through its ICT roadmap. This was a direct result of consultation and participation of the different Ministries, which supported this clarification of roles for the ICT sector. 4.3.2 Ministry of Defence Justice and Security The Ministry of Defence Justice and Security (MDJS) is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the country, both in the physical space and in the cyberspace. The Ministry and its various agencies continually assess the cyberspace landscape to identify threats and risks to Botswana’s National Security and work together with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and other security services to combat cyber terrorism and maintain law and order during nationwide cyber-attacks or emergencies. The Ministry is responsible for overseeing the justice system and law enforcement of Cybersecurity related laws, and would play a key role in the fight against cybercrime, especially investigation detection, and prosecution. In addition the judiciary also has to be kept abreast about the latest challenges and development on Cybersecurity for appropriate justice to be dispatched. Criminal laws, procedures and policies needs to be constantly updated to address Cybersecurity incidents and respond to cybercrime. 4.3.3 National Cybersecurity Advisory Council The coordination and implementation of Botswana’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) would be led by the proposed National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) in collaboration with the relevant Ministries, Agencies or Departments. The central coordination is cognisant of public private partnerships towards ensuring a robust national Cybersecurity approach. NCAC will provide strategic leadership for the BWCIRT. The key stakeholders that will be represented in the National Cybersecurity Advisory Council are: a) Ministry of Transport and Communications b) Ministry of Justice Defence and Security c) Law Enforcement Agencies d) BOCRA e) Non-banking financial institutions f) Banking institutions g) Public Telecommunications Operators h) Internet Service Providers i) National Critical Infrastructure Providers j) Academia k) Consumers 32 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy l) ICT Industry 33 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy 4.3.4 National Computer Incident Response Team (BWCIRT) The role of the proposed National CIRT is to act as the trusted point of contact as well as provide central operational coordination for incident response at National level. This entails ensuring partnership with international CIRTs to ensure presence of mechanisms for cross-border incident handling as well as coordinating all sector specific country response teams. Taking into consideration that Cybersecurity issues are increasing and that it may take a long time for the realisation of some of the strategic actions and approval of the strategy, it is recommended that as a matter of urgency the country starts with the National CIRT so that it can assist in monitoring the cyber threats and consumer awareness. The main responsibilities of the National CIRT cover amongst others the following areas: i) Providing incident response support to all relevant stakeholders via established, trusted, authorised and centrally coordinated initiatives at the national level; ii) Dissemination of critical information such as early warnings and alert notifications, security advisory, and upholding security best practices; iii) Acting as a single point of contact for cyber incident reporting and coordination; iv) Detecting and identifying anomalous activity; v) Analysing cyber threats and disseminating cyber threat warning information; vi) Analysing and synthesizing incident and vulnerability information disseminated by others such as vendors to provide an assessment for interested stakeholders; vii) Establishing trusted communications mechanisms and facilitating communications among stakeholders to share information and address cyber security issues; viii) Developing mitigation and response strategies and coordinating incident response; ix) Sharing data and information about the incident and corresponding responses; x) Coordinating international cooperation on cyber incidents; and Building capacity in all the above areas using advanced technology and techniques, establishing methods, and researching threat analyses and mitigations. 4.3.5 Law Enforcement Agencies Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Security Forces play a key role in investigating cybercrimes and enforcing Cybersecurity related laws. They also play a vital role in ensuring collaboration with a wide range of partners to combat cybercrimes with international dimensions and/ or span multiple jurisdictions. Further, these agencies play a vital role in keeping law and order during nation-wide cyber-attacks and 34 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy emergencies. The law enforcement agencies will establish collaboration with international institutions such as Interpol and the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) on child abuse material to address Cybersecurity. 4.3.6 Regulatory Authorities (BOCRA, NBIFIRA, Bank of Botswana etc.) The regulators are mainly responsible for the consumer protection, therefore it will play an important in the implementation of the national Cybersecurity strategy. For example BOCRA provides regulatory oversight over the communications sector as aligned to the MTC policy direction. Further, BOCRA, in collaboration with MTC, ensures compliance within the communications sector; that operators adhere to national Cybersecurity laws, policies and standards 4.3.7 National Critical Information Infrastructure Owners NCII owners are keys to Botswana’s efforts to maintain Cybersecurity as they continually assess and address threats and vulnerabilities as well as ensure various mitigation measures are well implemented. They also ensure compliance with relevant National Cybersecurity laws, policies, standards, procedures, frameworks, etc. The following sectors are identified as national critical infrastructure sectors with regard to the cybersecurity: finance, communications, energy, water, emergency services, food, public safety, health, public services and e-government 4.3.8 Consumers & General Public Effective implementation of security at individual level involves some level of understanding with cyber security threats (e.g. viruses, spam, etc.) and the adoption of appropriate technical safeguards (e.g. updating anti-virus software, firewalls, etc.). The national cybersecurity strategy has to focus on the dissemination of appropriate basic cybersecurity awareness information to the general public. For example consumers have to be made aware that they cannot share information such as password, PIN, online with unknown persons and regularly they have to change their passwords and update the anti-virus. 4.3.9 Service Providers The regulator (BOCRA) has to ensure that service providers implement appropriate technical measures, procedures and standards to enhance the information security through their networks. A cybersecurity technical measures framework needs to be developed and implemented that would incorporate technical (e.g., standards, software), procedural (e.g., guidelines, standards, or mandatory regulations) and 35 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy personnel (e.g., best practices) safeguards. For example measures may include promoting government and private sector to adopt international standards related to cyber security (e.g., ISO 27001 on Information Security Management System). 4.3.10 Academia Academic institutions will play an important role in the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy. Academic institutions educate the technical, management and information assurance experts required to execute cyber security strategies. In addition, research and development (R&D) activities, need to be carried out on cybersecurity and the protection of information infrastructures. Through partnerships with the private sector and governments the Academia can assist in the development of cybersecurity related technologies, techniques, standards and processes that further the national cybersecurity agenda. The Academia institutions may also have cybersecurity forensics laboratories which may assist on the investigation and enforcement of cybersecurity legislations 4.3.11 Civil Society Civil society will play an important role in ensuring that there is a right balance in terms of protection civil liberties, privacy and human rights etc. as we implement the national cyber security strategy. The civil society needs to form part of the stakeholders in order to provide confidence and integrity that the national cybersecurity strategy implementation does not tramp on civil liberties. For example monitoring cyberspace has to be done in a manner which does not invade personal privacy. Internationally a number of civil society not-for profit organisations have also been established around the issue of cybersecurity and cybercrime for example those dealing with child online protection (COP). Therefore it is very important that collaboration is established with international civic society to assist also on the consumer education. 4.3.12 Private Sector (Industry) Businesses are expected to implement an adequate level of cyber security safeguards into their business operation and practices. Such safeguards typically involve the installation of technical solutions and the adoption of best practice secure business processes. For example, the financial and banking sector, with its dependency on international clearing and central banking, and its links to international financial market systems, cyber security concerns should be accorded high priority. On a collective level, the private sector has an important role to play in its own right and in cooperation with government in developing cyber security business norms, standards and codes of conduct, as well as in identifying and encouraging the adoption of good practices. By taking part in relevant forums or standards-development 36 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy organizations, industry plays a critical role in agreeing on technical standards to protect security. Equipment suppliers within the cyber security defence industry provide technical solutions towards protection of digital infrastructure and information. The specific role for vendors is to cooperate with the Botswana’s National CIRT (BWCIRT) in providing vulnerability information These would help support incident response and ensure compliance with the minimum cybersecurity standards for vendors’ products and services 4.4 Funding Resources Funding and adequate resourcing will be fundamental to the implementation of this strategy. Given that cybersecurity is a key to the realisation of Botswana’s goals and vision, the government and the private sector should ensure that National Cybersecurity Strategy and implementation programmes are adequately funded and resourced. Funding of International cooperation partners should also be sourced to assist with the implementation of the strategy recommendation. Establishment budget estimate at a high-level is summarised in the table below: Table 1 : NCS Establishment Budget Budgetary Activities Estimated Amount Establishment of CIRT Phase 1: Basic CIRT services P5 Million Phase 2: Enhanced CIRT services P3 Million Phase 3: Advanced CIRT Services P 2 Million Sub-total for BWCIRT P 10 Million Establishment of cybersecurity operation centre P15 Million Capacity building programmes P 15 Million Consume awareness programs P 5 Million Digital forensic laboratory P 16 Million Cybersecurity Research programme P 4.5 Million TOTAL P65.5 Million 4.5 Monitoring and Evaluation Until National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) is established MTC and BOCRA could collaborate and employ the approaches mentioned below to develop and provide a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework. Once the NCC is established, NCC in coordination with MTC will provide operational monitoring and evaluation for the implementation of this strategy. 37 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy A comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework shall be developed to determine the long-term impact and outcome of the strategy across all sectors based on periodic reviews (which would include a midterm review at the 3 year milestone and a long term review at the 5 year milestone). The M&E framework shall consider the following areas:  Alignment to Government of Botswana performance assessment approach;  Use of an external evaluator to undertake the long-term impact assessment (at 5 years); and  Assessment of the progress towards attainment of level 5 of the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model. The key elements of the M&E approaches are:  Setting performance targets for various ministerial or governmental departments, groups or individuals responsible for specific aspects or actions of the strategy;  Establishing performance plans which establish a common understanding of what is to be achieved, how it is to be achieved and managing resources to guarantee success in implementation;  Monitoring and reporting performance;  Evaluating departments, groups or individual performance against established performance targets. 38 | P a g e National Cybersecurity Strategy GLOSSARY Critical Information Infrastructure refers to the digital infrastructure whose disruption or damage negatively affects the well-functioning of the economy.

They have had positive impact on the economy, enabling its growth and   efficiencies on service delivery. Through the envisaged National Broadband Strategy   (NBS), the Government of Botswana would like to further enhance the role of ICT,   particularly cyberspace in socio-economic and political aspects of the country.   However, the Government is conscious of the risks, threats and vulnerabilities to the   citizens and the country posed by misuse of cyberspace. It is for this reason that the   Government, working in concert with the private sector, developed a National   Cybersecurity Strategy to provide a framework for a secure cyberspace in Botswana.   The Strategy is aimed at the public, to raise awareness and build capacity among   them to safeguard against cyber threats, for the industry and Government to always   be prepared to prevent, defend and act against any cyber-attacks.    The development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) will enable the   Government of Botswana and other stakeholders, to establish appropriate measures   that will ensure Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of networks, systems   and data of the information communicated, processed and stored through electronic   or equivalent means. Because cyber-attacks are not limited by national boundaries,   passing through multiple networks in different countries, it is important to engage   with all relevant stakeholders in developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. It is   essential that cyber security requirements are ―bake it in‖ in initial design and   development of the ICT systems rather than to be ―bolted on‖ at the later stage of   the development cycle.    The development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy was led by the Ministry of  Transport and Communications and it included all the relevant stakeholders from the  Private Sector, relevant Ministries, Regulator, and Academia.   The Commonwealth  Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) assisted with the development of the  National Cyber Security Strategy with funding from the United Kingdom of Great  Britain Government’s Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO). The United Kingdom of  Great Britain further contributed by providing comments on the draft strategy. In  addition, the project team which developed National Cyber Security Strategy  benefited from inputs and comments from the United States of America (USA) State  Department, through the technical consultant from MITRE and Carnegie Melon  University. On behalf of the Government of Botswana. I would like to thank all who  assisted with the development this strategy.   The main aim of the National Cybersecurity Strategy is to have a high-level top down  approach cyber security framework that clearly establishes national objectives, sets  priorities, specifies timeframes and outlines the roles of the various stakeholders.  Cyber threats by their nature do not discriminate between big and small institutions     6 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         and individuals; there are many examples of cyber incidents against multi-national  corporations and individuals. Cyber threats can be complex. Therefore, ordinary  individuals with less sophistication and means may require to be continuously  assisted and educated, to keep up with evolving threats. These threats and risks are  ever presents. Therefore, it is very important that Government and other key  stakholders, play an active role in addressing the National Cybersecurity Strategy.   To ensure effective implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, an  implementation plan with clear key performance indicators has been developed to  monitor and validate that the objectives of the strategy are achieved. The  appropriate mechanisms and framework will be put in place to ensure that the key  performance indicators and desired outcomes are realised.    As the Ministry responsible for ICT, we believe that the National Cyber Security  Strategy will provide appropriate guidance in addressing the issues of Cyber Security  which require a multi-stakeholder approach.                    …………………………………………..   Honourable Minister Onkokame Kitso Mokaila   MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS         7 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     Information and Communications Technology (ICT), is increasingly transforming   societies and enabling the growth of the global economy. The adoption of ICT within   a country’s economy provides enormous benefits through improved efficiencies and   effectiveness in service delivery, cost savings, improved productivity, transparency   as well as accountability. Digital infrastructures are emerging as the backbone of a   successful economy, a vibrant research community, a transparent state as well as a   free society.   Botswana is gradually leveraging ICTs in its critical areas such as communications,   governance, utility provision, healthcare, financial and transport sectors. This has led   to the emergence of possible threats and risks against the National Critical   Information Infrastructure. The risks and threats must be mitigated against.   Cybersecurity is now taking centre stage in ensuring that critical infrastructure is   protected through continuous risk assessment, putting in place appropriate   mitigations, creating appropriate collaborations, having in place relevant and   effective cyber security capabilities, accompanied by cybersecuritry awareness. It’s   for this purpose that Botswana developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy. The   strategy addresses the current challenges within Botswana and proposes strategic   action areas to improve our cybersecurity maturity.   The objective of this strategy is to create a cohesive and inclusive approach to   delivering a safe, secure and resilient cyberspace and a comprehensive framework to   facilitate coordinated responses by Government, the private sector, and other   partners to address issues of cyber security.    The National Cybersecurity strategy is organised as follows: - Introduction section   provides the background information, situational analysis in relation to the   Cybersecurity and also provides the rationale and justification for the development of   a National Cybersecurity Strategy. Section 2 contextualises issues of Cybersecurity in   relation to Botswana in terms of the benefits, risks and threats arise in the   cyberspace. The strategic goals and objectives are discussed in section three and the   final section discusses the implementation, roles and responsibility, monitoring and   evaluation issues.           8 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         1.0 INTRODUCTION    1.1 Background   The National Cybersecurity Strategy sets out how Botswana intends to create a   resilient, safe and secure ICT operational environment. The strategy is aimed   towards the members of the public, industry, international partners and the   Government. The strategy aims to provide awareness to members of the public on   threats, risks in the cyberspace and interventions. For the Government and Industry,   it’s a call to arms, for them to take action and provide necessary resources. The   strategy also lays out its principles, which will help Botswana to collaborate and   cooperate with interested international partners with similar values.    The rapid proliferation and adoption of ICT services and infrastructure in Botswana   is transforming how citizens, the private sector, and the Government interact, inform   themselves, participate and contribute to the well-functioning of society. However,   this has also resulted in the introduction of new types of risks, in the form of cyber   threats or attacks. These threats affect service provision and trust in the use of ICT.   The increase in cybercrime sophistication and occurrence requires a proactive   approach to ensure that risks are continually assessed and mitigations put in place.   While most Batswana have taken up technology, there has not been a corresponding   rise in public education and awareness on cyber security issues.   Cybersecurity has been identified as a critical issue in Botswana. The National   Development Plan 11 covering the years 2017-2023, states that cyberspace threats   and risks should be dealt with during the NDP implementation. The NDP 11 further   notes that since cybersecurity threats are imminent and worrisome, it is appropriate   for legislation to combat cybersecurity to be developed during NDP 11. Under NDP   11 headings of ICT  and Secure Cyber Space, secure cyber space is identified as one   of the factors that would support the economy, in particular key priority areas of   water, agriculture, power, tourism and job creation.    Botswana has done relatively well in providing formal education to its population and   provision of necessary infrastructure that facilitates communications and service   delivery through Information and Communication Technologies. The country,   however, has limited capacity on Cyber Security expertise. The issues of Cyber   Security require a multi-stakeholder approach due to the diverse nature of the   cyberspace. Currently, in Botswana there is no coordinated framework for   addressing the cyber security issues among the various stakeholders. One of the   objectives of this strategy is to clarify the roles of the various key stakeholders, both   public and private, in addressing the country’s cybersecurity challenges.    ICT sector or cyberspace depends on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) that   can be accessed via internet or otherwise, and also goes beyond territorial   boundaries. This makes protecting this infrastructure more complex, given that it   also brings in third parties in the form of other countries. It is for this reason that     9 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         international cooperation and collaboration plays a central role in the National   Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS). An open and free internet, the protection of personal   data as well as the integrity of interconnected networks are critical for overall   prosperity, security and the promotion of human rights in Botswana. This strategy   provides a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring the safety, security and   reliability of Botswana’s cyberspace.    1.2 Situational Analysis   In 2012 the country carried out cyber security assessment assisted by the   International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and International Multilateral   Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) to assess the country’s readiness for   establishing a National Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), which will assist   in responding to the cyber security threats1. The study found that Botswana has a   well-developed ICT infrastructure with fibre-optic cables linking the major population   centres. In addition the country has international connectivity through WACS,   SEACOM and EASSY undersea cables. The community is well connected with mobile   network covering more than 90% of the population. Internet usage is increasing   throughout the country with many people using the mobile services to access the   Internet, more especially the social media; the country’s mobile broadband   subscription was 1 409,274 as of Dec 2016.     1.2.1  Summary of the Key Findings of the Assessment    i) Cyber security is not allocated sufficient priority in policy making and on the on- going ICT projects. Also, Cyber security principles are not adopted by  government in all the projects related to ICT.   ii) Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) has not been identified and  there is no defined cyber security strategy in place to manage and mitigate  cyber security incidents in case of a coordinated cyber-attack on the critical  national information infrastructure. It was recommended that the Country should  develop a National Cyber Security Strategy that will clearly define roles of the  various stakeholders and develop measures and procedures for the protection of  CNII   iii) Appropriate legislation, policies and regulations on cyber security are inadequate  to address the current cyber security challenges.   iv) Training, specifically in the area of cyber security needs to be improved; all  stakeholders such as regulators, Law Enforcement Agencies, Judiciary,  Prosecutors, Service providers, Financial Institutions, service providers need to  have adequate capacity and capability to handle matters related to cyber  security.                                            1  The Full report of ITU/Impact CIRT Readiness assessment Report can be assessed at   www.bocra.org.bw    http://www.bocra.org.bw/   10 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         v) There is no proper coordination or mechanism dealing with monitoring,  detection, tracking and mitigation of cyber-attacks and cyber threats at national  level . There is no coordination on cyber security issues public awareness. It was  recommended that the country should establish a National Computer Emergency  Response to monitor and detect cyber threats, as well as educate the public.   vi) The report noted that the country has had reported cases of some cybercrime  activities and threats such as Money laundering, online Scams, Hacking,  Malwares, Viruses and worms, Identity Theft, Frauds, SPAM etc. Most of these  were addressed on ad hoc basis by various institutions   vii) The study recommended that the country should develop and implement  awareness campaigns to educate users, law enforcement officers and policy  makers about cyber laws, the impact of cybercrime and measures of combating  it.         11 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         1.3 Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework    Botswana has developed a number of policies, regulatory and legislative instruments   which currently provide direction and guidelines on cybersecurity. The country has   no data protection and privacy law. Neither does it have any national governance   roadmap for cybersecurity. Some of the legislations and policies currently in place   that address cybersecurity related issues are:    Cybercrime and Computer Related Crimes Act No. 22 of 2007 which is  intended to: combat cybercrime and computer related crimes, repress  criminal activities perpetrated through computer systems and to facilitate  the collection of electronic evidence. The Act is currently being reviewed to  address the latest technology changes and related cybercrimes.    Communications Regulatory Authority Act No. 19 of 2012, which  provides for the regulation of the communication sector, comprising  telecommunications, Internet, Radio communications, Broadcasting, Postal  services and related matters.     Electronic Communications and Transactions Act No. 14 of 2014 is  intended to provide for the facilitation and regulation of electronic  communications and transactions. It is to provide specifically for electronic  commerce and electronic signatures as well as for matters incidental and  connected thereto. The associated secondary legislation (regulations) have  also been developed.      “Electronic Records (Evidence) Act No. 13 of 2014. The Act provides  for the admissibility of electronic evidence in legal proceedings and  authentication of electronic evidence. The associated secondary legislation  (regulations) have also been developed.      The National Information and Communications Technology Policy commonly  called (Maitlamo)” has also been adopted by the Country to guide the  development of ICT throughout the country.   1.4 Rationale   Cyber security is a global challenge. Thus, a co-ordinated multi-sector response   provides a route to building public confidence and trust in the use of ICTs. These   efforts rely on national actions among countries of the world, Botswana included.   One of the key challenges that the Government of Botswana is facing in this   information age is to ensure that the nation is secure against cyber threats.   Botswana is experiencing a growing dependence on Cyberspace for the delivery of   services essential to people’s daily lives, commerce, National security, innovation and   the general free flow of information. The increasing dependency on ICTs by both   public and private sectors, makes protection and sharing of information more critical   in order to protect the economic interests and security of Botswana and her citizens.      12 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         A number of new and major risks exist in cyberspace such as: organised crime in   cyberspace, hacktivism, cyberattacks, unplanned disruptions to network integrity and   security due to human errors or factors, cyber terrorism, abuse of personal data,   child online pornography, loss of money or data due to activities in cyberspace, etc.   With the increase in sophistication of these cyber threats, risks, and cybercrime over   the years, the necessity of developing a coherent approach to effectively detect,   prevent and mitigate both current and future Cyber threats arises, hence the   motivation to develop a National Cybersecurity Strategy for Botswana.    The strategy will help initiate a systematic national programme to defend cyberspace   from threats irrespective of their origin. Critically, the strategy prioritises cyber   threats and risks as well as allocation of responsibilities, to ensure that all relevant   stakeholders accept responsibility for and take appropriate steps to enhance   cybersecurity. As a result, the strategy aims to improve security by creating   stakeholders awareness on relevant risks, preventive measures and effective   responses.      13 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         2.0 CONTEXT – SOCIO-ECONOMIC, RISKS AND   THREATS    2.1 Society     Cyberspace has developed into a vital area of activity for the state, the economy,   science and society in general. Everything in the information age is connected to the   Internet and everything is connected to each other. This promotes innovation and   enhances productivity. It is estimated that there will be 50 billion devices connected   to the Internet by 2020 enabling them to communicate with each other (compared   to 15 billion today)2. By the end of 2015, there were more than 3.2 billion Internet   users globally, with a sizeable population of Batswana amongst them.   Cybersecurity is an ecosystem that goes beyond the use of technology. It includes non-  technical measures such as delivery of timely and appropriate policy and regulatory   responses, capacity building and consumer awareness. The main objective of the National   Cybersecurity Strategy is to ensure that Citizens have access to an open cyberspace with   confidence that their data will be protected.    Batswana use social media for advocacy on socioeconomic and political issues. It is   also a platform reach out to target audience instantaneously, at a fraction of the cost   of traditional media advertising. Examples include entertainment industry reaching   out to audience beyond border and government delivering the public services (e-gov   services) through the online platforms. Therefore, it is important to ensure that   cyberspace is secure to guarantee public confidence and integrity on the Internet.    2.2 Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce)     Cyberspace has developed into a market place of strategic importance in a relatively   short period of time. The country has enacted the Electronic Communications and   Transactions Act in order to facilitate e-commerce and is in the process of   developing an e-commerce strategy. Some businesses are already trading online and   also use the Internet to market their products on the global market. While   Botswana’s participation in online market is still at its infancy stage, it is expected to   grow once the country has developed and implemented an e-Commerce strategy. It   is important for Botswana to be part of the digital economy, using e-commerce to   drive the economic diversification.    2.3 e- Government Services   The Internet plays an important role in facilitating the communication between   Government and society. The Government has developed an e-government strategy   to provide online services. Cyberspace has an impact on the relationship between   the Government and society. The Government portal is already online. Social media                                            2  Source: A collaborative report by DHL and Cisco (http://www.dhl.com/content/dam/Local_Images/g0/New_aboutus/   innovation/DHLTrendReport_Internet_of_things.pdf)     14 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         such as Facebook and twitter are used to disseminate information and interact with   citizens. Usage of cyberspace to deliver e-government services improves the   relationship between the Government and society, allowing an open and transparent   platform for political participation and expression. Parliament has online initiatives   such as ―Botswanaspeaks”, through which the electorates can raise their issues   via ICTs and have Members of Parliament attend to them. Citizens can now interact   with their political leaders and provide input on issues of National interest without   the need to wait for “Kgotla‖ meetings.   2.4   Risks and Threats    While ICTs have improved the lives of ordinary Batswana, there are risks and threats   in the cyberspace that can potentially harm citizens. Because of its global   connectedness, Internet has a wide range of risks and threats that go beyond Botswana’s   borders. The types of threats and risks range from relatively low level ones such as fake   news to high level risks such as financial crimes and even interference of the country’s ICT   systems. There is, therefore, need for Batswana to be more vigilant and well   informed on how they can protect their data in the cyberspace.    ICT enabled Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) such as electricity, water, transportation,   telecommunications, commerce and health are susceptible to various cyber risks and   threats since they rely on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to   deliver their services. Cyber-attacks on CNI could have negative consequences for national   security, the economy or the well-being of citizens of the country. This Strategy contains a   series of measures and procedures to strengthen and have a coordinated approach to   protect the Critical National Infrastructure against the risks and threats of the cyberspace.   Cybercrimes are not only from within the country, they are cross border. They may come   from non-state actors (such as hacktivists who may not agree in principle with a position   Botswana has taken or terrorists wreaking havoc on states that hold opposing views), state   actors (countries with competing interest to those of Botswana or in conflict with Botswana)   and organised crime. There is a broad spectrum of new challenging risks and threats in the   cyberspace, which includes: cyber bullying, revenge porn, child pornography, identity fraud,   or misuse of the Internet for extremism. Some cybercrimes are increasingly becoming   common; these include distribution of sexual materials, child pornography, identity theft,   recruitment into the use and distribution of illicit substances especially among minors,   human. Multi-stakeholder cooperation between the governmental and relevant non-  governmental bodies at national, regional and International level is essential in order to   combat cyber threats as a whole and this Strategy advocates for that.      15 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         3.0  STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS      3.1 Vision & Mission Statement                                                               3.2 Core Values   The core values represent the attitudes, behaviours and characters required to  create an enabling and conducive environment for the successful realisation of the  National Cyber Security Strategy objectives:   VISION   Cybersecurity for all by 2022 and beyond   MISSION STATEMENT      Exist to protect information infrastructure, provide   information security assurance, build capacity and   capabilities to prevent and respond to cyber threats in   order to enhance the socio-economic development of   Botswana       16 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy          Accountability - All organisations/institutions responsible for various  strategic actions will make decisions in a responsible manner and utilise  the resources efficiently and effectively.    Integrity – The integrity of the infrastructure will be assured and data  transmitted over the networks will not be altered or deleted without   authority.    Confidentiality – Privacy and fundamental rights of individuals will be  preserved when implementing the various Cyber Security strategic  initiatives and adherence to internationally acceptable governance  principles will be maintained.    Collaboration - Collaboration and cooperation will be established with all  relevant multi-stakeholders including nationally and internationally  institutions to share information and experiences in addressing Cyber   Security challenges.                                  17 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         3.3 Strategic Objectives             Strategic Objectivel 1  To make Botswana more secure and resilient to Cyber  attacks   Strategic Objective 2  To build Cyber Security capacity and capability in  Botswana   Strategic Objective 3  To raise and promote Cyber Security awareness among  the general public  Strategic Objective 4  To foster Cyber Security research and development  Strategic Objective 5  To enhance collaboration and cooperation on Cyber  Security issues at national, regional and International  level  Strategic Objective 6  To harness or leverage Botswana’s Cyberspace for socio- economic development    18 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         3.4 Strategic Objectives and Initiatives   Strategic objectives and initiatives have been summarised in tabular form as shown below:     Strategic Objective:        To achieve a secure and resilient Cyberspace    Strategic Initiative Key Milestones     Expected Outcome Responsibility   1.1 Develop and review  appropriate policies and  legislation that promotes  a secure cyberspace   1.1.1   Enact legislative, policy and regulatory  framework for establishing National CIRT,  National Cyber Security Operation Centre,  Digital Forensic Labs and Research Centres.

The National Executive should identify   national business priorities and provide monetary and human resources needed to   implement the strategy. In addition, the importance of this strategy needs to be   understood across all sectors.        Cybersecurity Risk Assessment - The incorporation of risk management as a   delivery area within the executive management (both public and private enterprises)   provides a strong foundation for Cybersecurity implementation—covering the areas   of people, process and technology. The security of digital infrastructure and   information must be understood as vital and incorporated within all organisational   functionality beyond technical solutions.       Resource Prioritisation - Identification and prioritization of key resources aimed   at improving the country’s security, resilience, operational capacities to effectively   manage and respond to cyber incidents as well as protect against ever persistent   threats is crucial. Embedded within this area is the need to continuously improve   operational capabilities to keep abreast with the level of sophistication of cybercrime   as well as advanced persistent threats.       Human Capital - Efficient implementation of Cybersecurity requires highly qualified   and skilled human resource across all sectors. The ability of institutions in both   Public and Private sector to attain and retain skilled human resource is therefore   important for maintaining and ensuring a strong protection approach against cyber   threats especially with operators of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).       Multi-stakeholder Approach - Managing compliance of all key stakeholders and   actors within both the public and private sector provides assurance on improving the   nation’s Cybersecurity maturity. This requires deliberate effort and initiative from   each stakeholder to meet their obligations. A proper coordination of efforts is   required with a view to conducting cyber drills among sectors and to ensure that   national response and sector response are coordinated. Information sharing is also     29 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         key. The ability to build trust and relationships with key stakeholders (industry,   international Cybersecurity organizations and sovereign states) is important due to   the fact that cyber threats span various jurisdictions.       International Cooperation - The nature of cyber space is borderless and   complex; this implies that managing risk is a shared responsibility beyond   Government alone. Various key players besides GoB including NCII operators,   businesses, private sector, academia, civil society and citizenry should share this   responsibility based on harmonious collaboration. International collaboration is   therefore key in ensuring presence of capacity and mechanisms to handle cyber   threats from a foreign adversary as well as provide assistance to international allies   when required.      4.2  Governance Framework   There shall be a governance structure, which will oversee the implementation of the   National Cyber Security Strategy. It is recommended that a multi-stakeholder National   Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) , comprising representatives from the private   sector and relevant Government institutions and agencies, should be established. The   Advisory Council will oversee the operations of Botswana Computer Incidence Response   Team (BWCIRT) and overall implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The   BWCIRT will act as the Secretariat of the National Cybersecurity Advisory Council.   In addition it is also recommended that a specialised function, separate from   mainstream BWCIRT duties, of a Cybersecurity Operation Centre (COC) be established   in order to ensure that the country is well prepared for all Cyber threats. The COC   should deal with the threats and attacks of the highest level. These should be those   attacks, the objective of which threatens the security, sovereignty and economy of the   republic of Botswana. Such threats could be either state sponsored (such as espionage,   cyber conflict) or non-state actor activities such as terrorism. Because of the nature of   its assignment, COC should be established and managed by the National Security   agencies.    The strategy also recommends the establishment of Digital Forensic Laboratory (DFL) to   assist with processing and analysis of the electronic evidence. It is recommended that   Botswana Police Service is mandated to take the lead in establishment of the DFL.    Various sectorial CIRTs may also be established in order to assist the various sectors in   responding to the Cyber Security challenges. The coordination and sharing of   information of the sectorial CIRTs will be done through the BWCIRT.     30 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         The diagram below summarises the proposed governance structure for the   implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy:         Figure 1 : NCS Governance Structure   4.3 Roles and Responsibilities   The role of Government in Cybersecurity is extensive;this is to be expected given the   vital role of ICTs in the nation, the wide range of threats and vulnerabilities and the   cross-sector nature of Cybersecurity. The Government will assume a variety of roles   including national level policy-making and citizen level capacity-building. However, it   should be noted that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility. Various stakeholders,   particularly private and independent sectors, play a leading and key role in ensuring   security in the cyberspace.   4.3.1 Ministry of Transport and Communications   The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is responsible for developing   relevant policies and strategies, and supports the development of relevant laws   Ministry of  Transport and   Communications  National  Cybersecurity   Advisory Council  BWCIRT  Sectorial CIRTs  (e.g. Financail CiRT,  Government CIRT etc.)  Digital  Forensic   Laboratory  Cyber Security  operational   Centre  Ministry of Defence,  Justice and Security    31 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         governing the ICT sector in Botswana. It also coordinates their implementation through   National, regional and global collaborative efforts that harness local resources, talent   and innovation. Equally, MTC is responsible for the general oversight of the ICT sector   including cybersecurity. This role was further pronounced through a recent Presidential   directive, giving MTC the mandate for the overall coordination and oversight of ICT,   through its ICT roadmap. This was a direct result of consultation and participation of   the different Ministries, which supported this clarification of roles for the ICT sector.    4.3.2 Ministry of Defence Justice and Security   The Ministry of Defence Justice and Security (MDJS) is responsible for ensuring the   safety and security of the country, both in the physical space and in the cyberspace.   The Ministry and its various agencies continually assess the cyberspace landscape to   identify threats and risks to Botswana’s National Security and work together with Law   Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and other security services to combat cyber terrorism and   maintain law and order during nationwide cyber-attacks or emergencies. The Ministry is   responsible for overseeing the justice system and law enforcement of Cybersecurity   related laws, and would play a key role in the fight against cybercrime, especially   investigation detection, and prosecution. In addition the judiciary also has to be kept   abreast about the latest challenges and development on Cybersecurity for appropriate   justice to be dispatched. Criminal laws, procedures and policies needs to be constantly   updated to address Cybersecurity incidents and respond to cybercrime.    4.3.3 National Cybersecurity Advisory Council    The coordination and implementation of Botswana’s National Cybersecurity Strategy  (NCS) would be led by the proposed National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) in  collaboration with the relevant Ministries, Agencies or Departments. The central  coordination is cognisant of public private partnerships towards ensuring a robust  national Cybersecurity approach. NCAC will provide strategic leadership for the BWCIRT.   The key stakeholders that will be represented in the National Cybersecurity Advisory  Council are:   a) Ministry of Transport and Communications  b) Ministry of Justice Defence and Security  c) Law Enforcement Agencies  d) BOCRA  e) Non-banking financial institutions   f) Banking institutions  g) Public Telecommunications Operators  h) Internet Service Providers  i) National Critical Infrastructure Providers  j) Academia  k) Consumers     32 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         l)  ICT Industry        33 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy            4.3.4 National Computer Incident Response Team (BWCIRT)   The role of the proposed National CIRT is to act as the trusted point of contact as well   as provide central operational coordination for incident response at National level. This   entails ensuring partnership with international CIRTs to ensure presence of mechanisms   for cross-border incident handling as well as coordinating all sector specific country   response teams. Taking into consideration that Cybersecurity issues are increasing and   that it may take a long time for the realisation of some of the strategic actions and   approval of the strategy, it is recommended that as a matter of urgency the country   starts with the National CIRT so that it can assist in monitoring the cyber threats and   consumer awareness.   The main responsibilities of the National CIRT cover amongst others the following  areas:   i) Providing incident response support to all relevant stakeholders via established,  trusted, authorised and centrally coordinated initiatives at the national level;    ii) Dissemination of critical information such as early warnings and alert  notifications, security advisory, and upholding security best practices;    iii) Acting as a single point of contact for cyber incident reporting and coordination;   iv) Detecting and identifying anomalous activity;   v) Analysing cyber threats and disseminating cyber threat warning information;  vi) Analysing and synthesizing incident and vulnerability information disseminated   by others such as vendors to provide an assessment for interested  stakeholders;    vii) Establishing trusted communications mechanisms and facilitating  communications among stakeholders to share information and address cyber  security issues;   viii) Developing mitigation and response strategies and coordinating incident  response;    ix) Sharing data and information about the incident and corresponding responses;  x) Coordinating international cooperation on cyber incidents; and Building capacity   in all the above areas using advanced technology and techniques, establishing  methods, and researching threat analyses and mitigations.    4.3.5 Law Enforcement Agencies    Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Security Forces play a key role in investigating   cybercrimes and enforcing Cybersecurity related laws. They also play a vital role in   ensuring collaboration with a wide range of partners to combat cybercrimes with   international dimensions and/ or span multiple jurisdictions. Further, these agencies   play a vital role in keeping law and order during nation-wide cyber-attacks and     34 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         emergencies. The law enforcement agencies will establish collaboration with   international institutions such as Interpol and the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) on   child abuse material to address Cybersecurity.      4.3.6 Regulatory Authorities (BOCRA, NBIFIRA, Bank of Botswana etc.)   The regulators are mainly responsible for the consumer protection, therefore it will play  an important in the implementation of the national Cybersecurity strategy. For example  BOCRA provides regulatory oversight over the communications sector as aligned to the  MTC policy direction. Further, BOCRA, in collaboration with MTC, ensures compliance  within the communications sector; that operators adhere to national Cybersecurity laws,  policies and standards     4.3.7 National Critical Information Infrastructure Owners    NCII owners are keys to Botswana’s efforts to maintain Cybersecurity as they   continually assess and address threats and vulnerabilities as well as ensure various   mitigation measures are well implemented. They also ensure compliance with relevant   National Cybersecurity laws, policies, standards, procedures, frameworks, etc.   The following sectors are identified as national critical infrastructure sectors with regard  to the cybersecurity: finance, communications, energy, water, emergency  services, food, public safety, health, public services and e-government     4.3.8 Consumers & General Public    Effective implementation of security at individual level involves some level of   understanding with cyber security threats (e.g. viruses, spam, etc.) and the adoption of   appropriate technical safeguards (e.g. updating anti-virus software, firewalls, etc.). The   national cybersecurity strategy has to focus on the dissemination of appropriate basic   cybersecurity awareness information to the general public. For example consumers   have to be made aware that they cannot share information such as password, PIN,   online with unknown persons and regularly they have to change their passwords and   update the anti-virus.    4.3.9 Service Providers    The regulator (BOCRA) has to ensure that service providers implement appropriate  technical measures, procedures and standards to enhance the information security  through their networks.  A cybersecurity technical measures framework needs to be  developed and implemented that would incorporate technical (e.g., standards,  software), procedural (e.g., guidelines, standards, or mandatory regulations) and     35 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         personnel (e.g., best practices) safeguards. For example measures may include  promoting government and private sector to adopt international standards related to  cyber security (e.g., ISO 27001 on Information Security Management System).     4.3.10 Academia   Academic institutions will play an important role in the implementation of the national   cybersecurity strategy. Academic institutions educate the technical, management and   information assurance experts required to execute cyber security strategies. In addition,   research and development (R&D) activities, need to be carried out on cybersecurity and   the protection of information infrastructures. Through partnerships with the private   sector and governments the Academia can assist in the development of cybersecurity   related technologies, techniques, standards and processes that further the national   cybersecurity agenda. The Academia institutions may also have cybersecurity forensics   laboratories which may assist on the investigation and enforcement of cybersecurity   legislations   4.3.11 Civil Society   Civil society will play an important role in ensuring that there is a right balance in terms  of protection civil liberties, privacy and human rights etc. as we implement the national  cyber security strategy. The civil society needs to form part of the stakeholders in order  to provide confidence and integrity that the national cybersecurity strategy  implementation does not tramp on civil liberties. For example monitoring cyberspace  has to be done in a manner which does not invade personal privacy. Internationally a  number of civil society not-for profit organisations have also been established around  the issue of cybersecurity and cybercrime for example those dealing with child online  protection (COP). Therefore it is very important that collaboration is established with  international civic society to assist also on the consumer education.    4.3.12  Private Sector (Industry)   Businesses are expected to implement an adequate level of cyber security safeguards  into their business operation and practices. Such safeguards typically involve the  installation of technical solutions and the adoption of best practice secure business  processes.  For example, the financial and banking sector, with its dependency on  international clearing and central banking, and its links to international financial market  systems, cyber security concerns should be accorded high priority.      On a collective level, the private sector has an important role to play in its own right   and in cooperation with government in developing cyber security business norms,   standards and codes of conduct, as well as in identifying and encouraging the adoption   of good practices. By taking part in relevant forums or standards-development     36 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         organizations, industry plays a critical role in agreeing on technical standards to protect   security.   Equipment suppliers within the cyber security defence industry provide technical   solutions towards protection of digital infrastructure and information. The specific role   for vendors is to cooperate with the Botswana’s National CIRT (BWCIRT) in providing   vulnerability information These would help support incident response and ensure   compliance with the minimum cybersecurity standards for vendors’ products and   services..   4.4  Funding Resources   Funding and adequate resourcing will be fundamental to the implementation of this   strategy. Given that cybersecurity is a key to the realisation of Botswana’s goals and   vision, the government and the private sector should ensure that National Cybersecurity   Strategy and implementation programmes are adequately funded and resourced.   Funding of International cooperation partners should also be sourced to assist with the   implementation of the strategy recommendation. Establishment budget estimate at a   high-level is summarised in the table below:   Table 1 : NCS Establishment Budget   Budgetary Activities Estimated Amount   Establishment of CIRT         Phase 1: Basic CIRT services  P5 Million         Phase 2: Enhanced CIRT services P3 Million         Phase 3: Advanced CIRT Services P 2 Million   Sub-total for BWCIRT P 10 Million    Establishment of cybersecurity operation  centre   P15 Million    Capacity building programmes P 15 Million    Consume awareness programs P 5 Million    Digital forensic laboratory P 16 Million    Cybersecurity Research programme P 4.5 Million    TOTAL P65.5 Million       4.5  Monitoring and Evaluation   Until National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) is established MTC and BOCRA   could collaborate and employ the approaches mentioned below to develop and provide   a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework. Once the NCC is   established, NCC in coordination with MTC will provide operational monitoring and   evaluation for the implementation of this strategy.     37 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         A comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework shall be developed to   determine the long-term impact and outcome of the strategy across all sectors based   on periodic reviews (which would include a midterm review at the 3 year milestone and   a long term review at the 5 year milestone). The M&E framework shall consider the   following areas:    Alignment to Government of Botswana performance assessment approach;    Use of an external evaluator to undertake the long-term impact assessment (at 5  years); and    Assessment of the progress towards attainment of level 5 of the Cybersecurity  Capability Maturity Model.   The key elements of the M&E approaches are:    Setting performance targets for various ministerial or governmental departments,  groups or individuals responsible for specific aspects or actions of the strategy;    Establishing performance plans which establish a common understanding of what  is to be achieved, how it is to be achieved and managing resources to guarantee  success in implementation;    Monitoring and reporting performance;    Evaluating departments, groups or individual performance against established  performance targets.      38 | P a g e      National Cybersecurity Strategy         GLOSSARY     Critical Information Infrastructure refers to the digital infrastructure whose disruption or  damage negatively affects the well-functioning of the economy.

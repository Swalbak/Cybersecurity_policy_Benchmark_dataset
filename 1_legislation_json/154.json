Illustrations— (a) “A” gives “Z” fifty strokes with a stick. Here “A” can  be punished for one beating only although each blow may by itself constitute an offence;  (b) But if, while “A” is beating “Z”, “Y” interferes and “A” intentionally strikes “Y”, here, as the blow given to “Y” is no part of the act whereby “A” voluntarily causes hurt to “Z”, “A” is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to “Z” and to another for the blow given to “Y”.  19. Sentencing of a Person Convicted of one of Several Offences.  In all cases in which the judgment specifies that a person has committed one of several offences, but it is unclear which of these offences he or she has been convicted of, the offender shall be sentenced for the offence for which the lowest sentence is provided.  31  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    20. Habitual Offenders.  (1) Whenever any person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of more than six months for an offence committed under this Act, and the said convicted person has, on at least, three previous occasions been sentenced to imprisonment, the Magistrate or Court may, if in his, her or its opinion the circumstances justify so doing, give such person a warning by reading out and explaining to him or her the relevant parts of this section and such warning shall be recorded with the sentence.  (2) If any person who has been warned is subsequently convicted of any offence which may subject him or her to imprisonment, and such offence is committed more than one year after his or her release from serving the sentence in respect of which he or she was warned, the Court or Magistrate when sentencing him or her shall give him or her a second warning.  (3) If any person who was warned is convicted of an offence which may subject him or her to imprisonment, and such offence is committed within one year of his or her release from serving the sentence in respect of which he or she was warned, or if any person who was twice warned, is convicted of any such offence at any time after the second warning, he or she shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years.  (4) No person who was warned shall be tried for any offence which may subject him or her to imprisonment except under this Act, by a Magistrate of the First Class, non- summarily, or by a higher Court, and in awarding sentence under subsection (3), above, such Magistrate or Court shall not be subject to the limits of his or her or its powers set forth by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 2008.  32  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (5) Sentences awarded under subsection (3), above, shall not be subject to any maximum term prescribed for the offence of which the warned person is convicted.  Compensation 21. Compensation.  (1) A Court which convicts any accused person, whether or not the said Court passed any sentence as set forth in section 8, may order the offender to pay compensation to any person injured by his or her offence, if such compensation is in the opinion of the Court recoverable in a civil suit.  (2) An order under this section may be sent to a Civil Court for execution in accordance with the rules governing execution of judgments as set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure Act, 2008.  Note-Money or any other property as well may be ordered as compensation under this section. See the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 2008. Under such section, the Court first decides whether a fine is the proper punishment and if it so decides, it may order the whole or part of the fine to be paid as compensation. The fact that it has made such an order does not prevent the Court from ordering further compensation under this section.  CHAPTER III  CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DEFENCES  Criminal Responsibility  22. Common Knowledge.   A person is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have knowledge of any material fact if such fact is a matter of common knowledge.  33  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    23. Presumption of Knowledge of an Intoxicated Person.  A person who does an act in a state of intoxication is presumed to have the same knowledge as he or she would have had if he or she not intoxicated.  Defences Negating Criminal Responsibility  24. Acts of a Person Incapable of Judgment by Reason of Intoxication Caused Against his or her Will.   No act is an offence which is committed by a person who, at the time of doing such act, did not possess the power of appreciating the nature of his or her actions or of controlling them, by reason of intoxication caused by any substance administered to him or her against his or her will or without his or her knowledge.  25. Act done by Person Bound or Justified by Law.  No act is an offence which is done by a person who is legally bound to do it or justified by law in doing it, or who by reason of a mistake of fact, and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself or herself to be bound by law to do it or justified by law in doing it.  Illustration—  (a) “A” an officer of a Court being ordered by that Court to arrest “Y” and after due enquiry believing “Z” to be “Y” arrests “Z”. “A” has committed no offence.  (b) “A” sees “Z” commit what appears to “A” to be a murder. “A” in the exercise to the best of his or her judgment exerted in good faith of the power which the law gives to all persons of arresting murderers in the act, seizes “Z” in order to bring “Z” before the proper authorities. “A” has committed no offence, though it may turn out that “Z” was acting in self defence.  34  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    26. Act of a Court.  No act is an offence which is committed by a person when acting judicially as a Court or as a member of a Court in the exercise of any power which is in good faith he or she believes to be given to him or her by law.  27. Act Committed Pursuant to the Judgment or Order of the Court.  No act is an offence which is committed in pursuance of, or which is warranted by, the judgment or order of a Court, or for the execution of such judgment or order, if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, notwithstanding that the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order; provided that, the person doing the act believes, in good faith, that the Court has proper jurisdiction.  28. Accident in Committing a Lawful Act.  No act is an offence which is committed by accident or misfortune and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with due care and attention.  29. Act Committed to Prevent Injury.   No act is an offence by reason of any injury which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, if such act was committed without any criminal intent to cause injury, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other injury to person or property, or of benefiting the person to whom injury is or may be caused, provided that—  (a) in the light of the circumstances of the case, the commission of the act was reasonable;  (b) where the circumstances so require, the act was committed with reasonable care and skill;  35  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (c) the act was not committed with the intent of causing death or attempt to cause death in order to prevent or avoid injury only to property, and not an individual person;   (d) death of an individual person shall under no circumstances be deemed to be for the benefit of that person; and  (e) pecuniary benefit is not deemed to be a benefit within the meaning of this section.  Illustrations—  (a) A passenger train traveling at a high speed is approaching a stationary passenger train upon the same line of rails. A railway employee, as the only means of preventing a collision that would probably involve the lives of many passengers, switches the moving train in to a siding. The employee is not guilty of an offence if in light of all the circumstances, his or her act was reasonable, although fatal though less serious accident will likely result and a fatal accident in fact occurs;  (b) “A” in a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. “A” does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. If, in light of the circumstances his or her acts are found to be reasonable, “A” is not guilty of an offence.  (c) “Z” is seized by a crocodile, “A” fires at the crocodile knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill “Z” but not intending to kill “Z” and in good faith intending “Z’s” benefit. In fact “A” kills “Z”. “A” has committed no offence.  30. Children under Twelve Years of Age not Criminally Liable.  A child under twelve years of age, shall be deemed to lack criminal capacity and shall not be tried for or convicted of any offence, which he or she is alleged to have committed.   36  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    31. Criminal Capacity of Children of Twelve and under Fourteen Years of Age.  A child who is of twelve, but under fourteen years of age, at the time of the conduct constituting any offence which he or she is alleged to have committed, shall be presumed criminally liable, unless the contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt—  (a) to lack the capacity to form the intention necessary to commit the offence; or  (b) where negligence is an element of the offence concerned, to lack the capacity to behave in the way that a reasonable adult would have behaved in the circumstances.  32. No Presumption of Criminal Incapacity for Persons of and over the Age of Fourteen Years.  No person who is of or above the age of fourteen years shall be presumed to lack the capacity to form the necessary intention to commit any offence or, where negligence is an element of the offence concerned, to behave in the way that a reasonable person would have behaved in the circumstances of the offence.  33. No Relief from Civil Liability.  The provisions regarding criminal responsibility as they apply to children, shall not, however, affect any civil claim by the aggrieved party against the parents or guardian of the child.  34. Act of a Person Incapable of Judgment by Reason of Unsoundness of Mind. No act is an offence which is committed by a person who at the time of committing such act did not possess the power to appreciate the nature of his or her acts, or of controlling them by reason of permanent or temporary insanity or mental infirmity, provided however, that this provision shall not affect any civil claim instituted by the aggrieved party against the guardian unless the person of unsound mind was in custody at the time of the Commission of the offence.  37  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    35. Act not Intended to Cause Death or Grievous Hurt Done by Consent.  No act is an offence by reason of the injury it has caused to the person or property of any person who, being above the age of eighteen years, has voluntarily and with understanding given his or her consent, express or implied, to that act; provided that, this section shall not be applicable to acts which are likely to cause death or grievous hurt, nor to acts which constitute offences independently of any injury which they are capable of causing to the person who has given his or her consent or to his or her property.  Illustration—  “A” and “Z” agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing may be caused without foul play; and if “A” while playing fairly hurts “Z”, “A” commits no offence.  36. Consent Known to be Given Under Fear or Misconception.  A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Act, if its is given by any of the following—  (a) by a person under fear of injury or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows or has reason to believe that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception;  (b) by a person who from unsoundness of mind or intoxication is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he or she gives his or her consent; or  (c) by a person who is under eighteen years of age.  37. Communication made in Good Faith.  No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.  38  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Illustration—  “A” a surgeon in good faith communicates to a patient his opinion that the patient will not live. The patient dies in consequence of the shock. “A” has committed no offence.   38. Act to Which a Person is Compelled by Threats.  Except murder, and offences against the Government which may result in the sentence of death, no act is an offence which is committed by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which at the time of committing such act, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence; provided that, the person committing the act did not, of his or her own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm, put himself or herself, in the situation by which he or she became subject to such constraint.  39. Act Causing Slight Injury.  No act is an offence by reason that it causes or that it is intended to cause or that it is known to be likely to cause any injury, if that injury is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such injury.  Right of Private Defence  40. The Right of Private Defence.   (1) No act is an offence which is done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.  (2) Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions hereinafter contained, to defend— (a) his or her own body and the body of any other person  against any offence affecting the human body; and  39  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (b) property, whether movable or immovable, of himself, herself or of any other person, against any act, or attempted act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.   41. Right of Private Defence Against Act of Person of Unsound Mind, etc.  When an act, which would otherwise be an offence is not an offence by reason of age, want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he or she would have had as if the act was an offence.  Illustrations—  (a) “Z” under the influence of madness attempts to kill “A”. “Z” is guilty of no offence. But “A” has the same right of private defence which he would have if “Z” were sane;  (b) “A” enters by night a house which he or she is legally entitled to enter. “Z” in good faith taking “A” for a house breaker, attacks “A” Here “Z”, by attacking “A” under this misconception, commits no offence. But “A” has the same right of private defence against “Z”, which he or she would have if “Z” were not acting under that misconception.  42. General Limit of Right of Private Defence.  The right of private defence shall, in no case, extend to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.  43. No Right of Private Defence when Protection of Public Authorities Available.  There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.  40  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    44. Limitation of Right of Private Defence Against Act of Public Servant.  There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done or attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under the colour of his or her office, or at the directives of a public servant acting in good faith, though those directives may not be strictly justifiable by law.  Explanations—  (a) A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done or attempted to be done by a public servant, as such, unless he or she knows or has reason to believe that the person doing the act, or attempting to do it, is such public servant.  (b) A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done or attempted to be done by the direction of a public servant, unless he or she knows or has reason to believe that the person doing the act is acting by such direction or, if he or she has authority in writing, unless he or she produces such authority if demanded.  45. When Right of Private Defence of the Body Extends to Causing Death.  The right of private defence of the body extends, under the limitations mentioned in sections 43 and 44 of this Act, to the voluntary causing of death only when the act to be repulsed is any of the following—  (a) an attack which causes reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt;   (b) rape or an assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; or  (c) abduction or kidnapping. 41  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    46. When Right of Private Defence of Property Extends to Causing Death.  The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in sections 43 and 44 of this Act, to the voluntary causing of death only when the act to be repulsed is of any of the following—  (a) robbery;  (b) house-breaking by night;  (c) mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or  vessel, which building, tent or vessel, is used as human dwelling or as place for the custody of property; or  (d) theft, mischief or house-trespass in such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that, if such right of private defence is not exercised, death or grievous hurt shall be the consequence.  47. Right of Private Defence against Deadly Assault when there is Risk of Harm to Innocent Person.  The right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the apprehension of death, may be exercised, even if such defence can only be exercised at the risk of causing harm to an innocent person.   Illustration—  “A” is attacked by a mob which attempts to murder him or her. He or she cannot effectually exercise his or her right of private defence without firing on the mob and he or she cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. “A” commits no offence if by so firing he or she harms any of the children.  42  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    CHAPTER IV  JOINT ACTS, ABETMENT, CONSPIRACY AND ATTEMPT   Joint Acts  48. Acts Committed by Several Persons in Furtherance of Common Intention.   When a criminal act is committed by more than one person in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were committed by him or her alone.  49. When such an Act is Criminal by Reason of its Being Committed With a Criminal Knowledge or Intent.  Whenever an act, which is criminal by reason of its being committed with a criminal knowledge or intent, is committed by more than one person, each of such persons who joins in the act, with such knowledge or intention, is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were committed by him or her alone with that knowledge or intent.  50. Cooperation by Committing One of Several Acts Constituting an Offence.  When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by committing any one or more of those acts, either separately or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.  Illustrations—  (a) “A” and “B” agree to murder “Z” by separately and at different times giving him small doses of poison.  43  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    “A” and “B” both administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder “Z”. “Z” dies from the effect of the several doses of poison so administered to him or her. Under these facts, “A” and “B” intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and, as each of them does one or more of the several acts by which death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence, though their acts are separate and though the acts of one without the acts of the other would not have caused death.  (b) “A” and “B” are joint jailors and each has charge of “Z”, a prisoner alternately for six hours at a time. “A” and “B”, intending to cause “Z’s”’ death, knowingly cooperate, by illegally omitting to furnish “Z” with food supplied to them for that purpose during the time of their respective attendance. “Z” dies of hunger. Both “A” and “B” are guilty of the murder of “Z”.  (c) “A” a jailor has the charge of “Z” a prisoner. “A” intending to cause “Z’s” death illegally omits to supply “Z” with food. As a consequence, “Z” is significantly weaker, but still alive. “A” is dismissed from his or her office and “B” succeeds him or her. “B” without collusion or cooperation with “A” illegally omits to supply “Z” with food, knowing that he or she will probably cause “Z’s” death. “Z” dies of hunger. “B” is guilty of murder; but as “A” did not cooperate with “B” “A” is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.  51. Persons Concerned in Criminal Act May be Guilty of Different Offences.  Where more than one person is engaged or concerned in the commission of an offence, each may be guilty of a different offence depending on their individual actions.   44  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Illustration—  “Z” is attacked by “A”, under such circumstances of grave provocation that “A” killing of “Z” would only be culpable homicide, and not murder. “B”, having ill will towards “Z” intending to kill him or her and not having been subject to the provocation, assists “A” in killing “Z”. Under these facts, although both “A” and “B” are engaged in causing “Z’s” death, “B” is guilty of murder and “A” is guilty only of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.  Abetment 52. Abetment.  (1) A person abets the commission of an act when he or she— (a) instigates another person to commit such act;  (b) engages in a conspiracy with one or more other persons  in the commission of the act; and/or,  (c) intentionally aids or facilitates any act or illegal omission  in the commission of the act. (2) A person abets an offence when such person abets either  the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor by a person capable by law of committing the offence.  (3) It is not necessary that the person abetting should be capable by law of committing an offence or that he or she should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.  Explanation 1—  A person who by willful misrepresentation or by willful concealment of a material fact which he or she is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures or attempts to cause or procure the commission of an act, instigates the commission of such act within the meaning of this Chapter.  45  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Illustrations—  (a) “A” is authorised by a warrant issued by a Court to arrest “Z”. “B”, knowing that fact and also that “C” is not “Z” willfully represents to “A” that “C” is “Z” and thereby intentionally causes “A” to arrest “C”. Under these facts, “B” abets by instigating the arrest of “C”.  (b) “A”, a policeman, bound as such to give information of all designs to commit robbery, and knowing that “Z” intends to commit a robbery, illegally omits to give information of “Z’s” intention, knowing that the commission of the robbery is likely to be thereby facilitated. Under these facts, “A” has abetted the robbery.  Explanation 2—  (a) the abatement of the illegal omission of an act, may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself or herself be bound to do that act.  (b) to constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.  Illustrations—  (a) “A” instigates “B” to murder “C”. “B” refuses to do so, “A” is guilty of abetting “B” to commit murder.  (b) “A” instigates “B” to murder “D”.“B” in pursuance of the instigation stabs “D”. “D” recovers from the wound. “A” is guilty of instigating “B” to commit murder;  (c) “A”, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic in committing an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence and having the same intention as “A”. Under these facts, “A”, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.  46  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (d) “A”, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates “B” to take property belonging to “Z” out of “Z’s” possession. “A” induces “B” to believe that the property belongs to “A”. “B” takes the property out of “Z’s” possession in good faith believing it to be “A’s” property. “B”, acting under this misconception does not take dishonestly and therefore does not commit theft. But “A” is guilty of abetting theft and is liable to the same punishment as if “B” had committed theft.  Explanation 3—  It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor engages in the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he or she engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  Illustration—  “A” and “B” create a plan for poisoning “Z”. It is agreed that “A” shall administer the poison. “B” then explains the plan to “C” mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison but without mentioning “A’s” name. “C” agrees to procure the poison, procures and delivers it to “B” for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. “A” administers the poison; “Z” dies in consequence. Under these facts, though “A” and “C” have not conspired together, “C” has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which “Z” has been murdered. “C” has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.  53. Abetment if the Act Abetted is Committed in Consequence and where no Expressed Provision is made for Sentencing.  If the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the conviction of such abetment, whoever abets the offence shall be sentenced in accordance with the same provisions that apply to the commission of the offence.   47  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Explanation—  An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation or in pursuance of the conspiracy or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.  Illustrations—  (a) “A” instigates “B” to give false evidence. “B” in consequence of the instigation commits that offence. “A” is guilty of abetting that offence and is liable to the same punishment as “B”.  (b) “A” and “B” conspire to poison “Z”. “A” in pursuance of the conspiracy procures the poison and delivers it to “B” in order that he or she may administer it to “Z”. “B” in pursuance of the conspiracy administers the poison to “Z” in “A’s” absence and thereby causes “Z’s” death. Under these facts, “B” is guilty of murder. “A” is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy and is liable to the punishment for murder.  54. Abetment if a Person Abetted Commits the Act with Different Intention from that of the Abettor.   Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, upon conviction, shall be sentenced in accordance with the same provision that apply to the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.  55. Liability of Abettor when one act Abetted and Different Act Committed.   When an act is abetted and a different act is committed, the abettor is liable for the act committed in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had directly abetted it; provided that, the act committed was a probable consequence of the  48  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation or in pursuance of the conspiracy or with the aid which constituted the abetment.  Illustrations— (a) “A” instigates a child to put poison into the food of “Z”  and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of “Y”, which is by the side of that of “Z”. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of “A’s” instigation, and the act committed was in the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, “A” is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of “Y”.  (b) “A” instigates “B” and “C” to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provided them with arms for that purpose. “B” and “C” break into the house and being resisted by “Z”, either “B” or “C”, murder “Z”. Under these facts, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, “A” is liable to the punishment for murder.  56. Abettor when Liable to Cumulative Sentences for act Abetted and for act Committed.  If the act for which the abettor is liable under section 55 above, is committed in addition to the act abetted, and such act constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to sentencing for each of the offences.  57. Liability of Abettor for an effect caused by the act Abetted different from that Intended by the Abettor. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and the act is committed in a different way from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect; provided that, he or she knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.  49  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Exception—  The abettor shall not be liable under this section to the punishment for murder unless he or she knew that death would be the probable consequence of the act abetted.  Note- See section 210 of this Act.  Illustration—  “A” instigates “B” to cause grievous hurt to “Z”. “B” in consequence of the instigation causes grievous hurt to “Z”. “Z” dies in consequence. Under these facts,, if “A” knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, “A” is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for culpable homicide not amounting to murder or for murder as the case may be.  58. Abettor Present when an Offence is Committed Liable as a Principal.  Whenever any person who if absent would be liable to be convicted as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he or she would be sentenced in consequence of the abetment is committed, he or she shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.  59. Abetment of Offence Subject to Death Sentence or Life Imprisonment if the Offence is not Committed.   (1) Whoever abets the commission of an offence which may result in the death sentence or imprisonment, shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the sentencing of such abetment, upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or with a fine or with both.   50  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (2) If the abettor is a public servant whose duty is to prevent the commission of such offence, he or she shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or with a fine or with both.   Illustration—  “A” instigates “B” to murder “Z”. The offence is not committed. If “B” had murdered “Z” “B” would have been liable to the punishment of death. Therefore “A” is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or, if he or she is a public servant whose duty it is to prevent the murder, for a term not exceeding ten years and also in any event to a fine.  60. Abetment of Offence Subject to Sentence of Imprisonment if Offence is not Committed.   (1) Whoever abets an offence, subject to the sentence of imprisonment, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the conviction of such abetment, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one-fourth of the longest term provided for that offence or with a fine or with both.  (2) If the abettor is a public servant whose duty is to prevent the commission of such offence, he or she, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one-half of the longest term provided for that offence or with such time as is provided for the offence or with a fine or with both.  Illustration—  “A”, a policeman whose duty is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Under these facts, though the robbery be not committed, “A” is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence and also to a fine.  51  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    61. Abetting Commission of Offence by the Public, or by more than Ten Persons.  Whoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally, or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, commits an offence, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with a fine or with both.  Criminal Conspiracy  62. Conspiracy.  (1) Whoever conspires with one or more persons for the commission of an offence— (a) intending by this conspiracy agreement to bring about  the commission of the offence; or  (b) realising that there is a real risk or possibility that the  conspiracy may bring about the commission of an offence,  commits the offence of criminal conspiracy.   (2) Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy and, where there is no express provision for conviction in this Act, shall be sentenced in the same manner as if he or she had abetted such an offence.  Attempt   63. Attempting to Commit Offences Punishable with Imprisonment.  Whoever attempts to commit an offence or cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt commits any act towards the commission of the offence, where no express provision is made by this Act or any other law for the conviction of such attempt, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one-half of the longest term provided for that offence or with such fine as is provided for the offence or with both.  52  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    Illustrations—  (a) “A” makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box and finds on opening the box that there are no jewels in it. “A” has committed an act in furtherance of the commission of theft and therefore is guilty under this section.  (b) “A” makes an attempt to pick the pocket of “Z” by thrusting his or her hand into “Z’s” pocket. “A” fails in the attempt to pick the pocket of “Z”, because “Z” has nothing in his or her pocket. “A” is guilty under this section.  CHAPTER V  OFFENCES AGAINST SOUTHERN SUDAN   64. Treason.  (1) Whoever being a citizen of or a resident in Southern Sudan— (a) does any act, whether inside or outside Southern Sudan,  with the intent of overthrowing the Government; or (b) incites, conspires with or assists any other person to do  any act, whether inside or outside Southern Sudan, with the intent of overthrowing the Government,  commits the offence of treason, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.

CHAPTER XXI  OFFENCES RELATING TO ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY  Theft and Theft Related Offences  293. Theft.  (1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to effect such taking, and whoever dishonestly diverts, consumes or  148  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    uses any electricity, electric current or tap water, commit the offence of theft, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or with a fine or with both.  (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), above, a person is said to cause a thing to move, by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing as well as by actually moving it.  (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), above, “consent” may be expressed or implied and may be given either by the person in possession or by any person having for that purpose authority either expressed or implied.  Illustrations—  (a) “A” meets a camel carrying merchandise. He or she drives the camel in a certain direction in order that he may dishonestly take the merchandise. As soon as the camel begins to move, “A” has committed theft of the merchandise;  (b) “Z” going on a journey entrusts jewellery to “A” until “Z’s” return, “A” carries the jewellery to the market and sells it. Under these facts, the jewellery was not in “Z’s” possession. It could not therefore be taken out of “Z’s” possession and “A” has not committed theft, though he or she may have committed criminal breach of trust;  (c) “A” sees a ring belong to “Z” lying on a table in “Z’s” house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, “A” hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by “Z”, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Under these facts, “A” at the time of first moving the ring commits theft.  149  Act 9 Penal Code Act 2008    (d) “A” delivers a jewel to “Z” a jeweler to be re-set. “Z” carries it to his shop. “A”, not owing to the jeweler any debit for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the jewel as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his jewel by force out of “Z’s” hand and carried it away. Under these facts, “A”, though he or she may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft inasmuch as what he or she did was not done dishonestly.  (e) Again if “A” having pawned an article to “Z” takes it out of “Z’s” possession without “Z’s” consent not having paid what he or she borrowed on the article, he or she commits theft though the article is his own property inasmuch as he or she takes it dishonestly;  (f) “A” in good faith, believing property belonging to “Z” to be “A’s” own property, takes that property out of “Z’s” possession. Here, as “A” does not take dishonestly, he or she does not commit theft.  294. Theft in Dwelling House.  Whoever commits theft in or from any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling or the custody of property, or in or from any means of transportation used for the conveyance of passengers or goods, commits the offence of theft from a dwelling house, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or with a fine or with both.  295.

Illustrations—  (a) “A” commits theft on property in “Z’s” possession; while committing this theft he has a loaded pistol under his or her garment having provided this pistol for the purpose of hurting “Z” in case he or she should resist. “A” has committed an offence under this section;  (b) “A” picks “Z’s” pocket, having posted several of his or her companions near him or her, in order that they may restrain “Z”, if “Z” should perceive what is passing and should resist or should attempt to arrest “A”. “A” has committed an offence under this section.  Receipt or Possession of Stolen Property  297. Receipt of Stolen Property.  (1) Property, the possession of which has been transferred by theft or by extortion or by robbery, and property, which has been criminally misappropriated or in respect of which criminal breach of trust or cheating has been committed, is stolen property, whether the transfer has been made or the misappropriation or breach of trust has been committed within Southern Sudan or elsewhere.

Illustrations—  (a) “A” threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning “Z” unless “Z” gives him or her money. He thus induces “Z” to give him or her money. “A” has committed extortion;  (b) “A” threatens “Z” that he or she will keep “Z’s” child in wrongful confinement unless “Z” signs and delivers to “A” a promissory note binding “Z” to pay certain moneys to “A”. “Z” signs and delivers the note. “A” has committed extortion;  (c) “A” threatens to send men to pull down “Z’s” crops, unless “Z” will sign and delivery to “B” a bond binding “Z” under a penalty to deliver certain produce to “B” and thereby induces “Z” to sign and deliver the bond. “A” has committed extortion;  (d) “A” by putting “Z” in fear of grievous hurt dishonestly induces “Z” to sign or affix his or her seal to a blank paper and deliver it to “A”. “Z” signs and delivers the paper to “A”. Here, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security, “A” has committed extortion.  302. Extortion by Putting a Person in Fear of Death or Grievous Hurt.

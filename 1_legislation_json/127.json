Section 73 In the cases specified in section 72 (1) a) and c), confiscation may be dispensed   with on an exceptional basis if, considering the gravity of the criminal offence, it would be an   unfair and disproportionate disadvantage for the perpetrator or the owner, unless   a) it is excluded by an obligation under international law,   b) the perpetrator committed the criminal offence in a criminal organisation,   c) the criminal offence of drug trafficking, drug possession, facilitating drug production,   abuse of a substance required for producing drugs, abuse of new psychoactive substances,   abuse of performance-enhancing substance, counterfeiting of medicinal products,   counterfeiting of medical products, abuse of poison, abuse of harmful consumer products,   damaging the environment, damaging natural values, animal cruelty, fish poaching, game   poaching, organising illegal animal fights, violation of waste management regulations, abuse   of ozone depleting substances, abuse of radioactive materials, unlawful operation of a nuclear   facility, abuse of explosives or detonating equipment, abuse of firearms or ammunition, abuse   of a weapon prohibited by an international treaty, abuse of military products or services,   abuse of dual-use products, or violation of obligations related to keeping dangerous dogs was   committed.

CHAPTER IX   SENTENCING   The objective of punishment   Section 79 The objective of punishment shall be, in the interest of the protection of society,   to prevent the perpetrator or any other person from committing a criminal offence.   The principles of sentencing   Section 80 (1) Punishment shall be imposed within the framework laid down in this Act,   bearing in mind its objective, ensuring that the punishment is appropriate for the material   gravity of the criminal offence, the degree of guilt, the degree of danger the perpetrator poses   to society, and other mitigating and aggravating circumstances.   (2) The median value of the penalty range shall be the reference value when imposing a   sentence of fixed-term imprisonment. The median value shall be equal to half of the sum of   the minimum and maximum of the penalty range.   (3) If this Act provides for that the penalty ranges specified in the Special Part be increased   at sentencing, the calculation specified in paragraph (2) shall be performed using the   increased penalty ranges.   (4) If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment, it shall be determined without taking   the possibility of suspending the enforcement of the punishment and of release on parole into   account.   Concurrent sentence   Section 81 (1) One sentence shall be imposed for concurrence of criminal offences.   (2) The most serious type of penalty and penalty range from among those applicable to the   criminal offences constituting concurrence shall be the basis for imposing a concurrent   sentence.   (3) If at least two of the criminal offences constituting concurrence are punishable by fixed-  term imprisonment, the maximum of the applicable penalty range shall be determined by   increasing the maximum of the highest penalty range of the penalty ranges applicable to the   individual criminal offences by half, but it shall not reach the combined total term of the   maximum of the penalty ranges applicable to the individual criminal offences.   (4) If the respective conditions are met regarding the given criminal offence, the penalty   range of the criminal offence constituting concurrence shall be determined according to the   provisions applicable to special, multiple or violent multiple recidivists, or to commission in a   criminal organisation, before applying paragraphs (2) and (3).   (5) The secondary penalty, even in the case of a concurrent sentence, shall not exceed the   highest value or period specified in the Act.   Reduction of punishment   Section 82 (1) A punishment more lenient than the penalty range may be applied if, taking   the principles of sentencing into account, even its lowest level would be excessive.   (2) According to paragraph (1), if the minimum of the penalty range is   a) ten years of imprisonment, imprisonment for at least five years,   b) five years of imprisonment, imprisonment for at least two years,   c) two years of imprisonment, imprisonment for at least one year,   d) one year of imprisonment, imprisonment for a shorter period   mailto:eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code (as in force on 1 April 2022)   This document has been produced for informational purposes only.   26   Contact: eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   may be imposed instead.   (3) In the case specified in paragraph (2) d), imprisonment may be replaced by confinement,   community service or financial penalty, or any combination of these penalties may be   imposed.   (4) In the case of an attempt or abetting, if even the punishment applicable under   paragraph (2) would be excessive, punishment may be imposed by applying the subsequent   point of paragraph (2).   (5) If a reduction without limitation is permitted by this Act, the lowest level of any type of   penalty may be imposed as well.   Sentencing in the case of plea agreement   Section 83 (1) After the approval of a plea agreement in the proceedings specified under   Chapter XCIX of the Act XC of 2017 on the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter “plea   agreement”), the minimum of the more lenient penalty ranges specified in section 82 (2) shall   be taken as reference for sentencing.   (2) If plea agreement is approved for a defendant who, contributing to substantiating the   case or another criminal case, has cooperated significantly with the prosecution service or the   investigating authority, punishment may be imposed also by applying the subsequent point of   section 82 (2).   (3)   Section 84   Suspension of the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment   Section 85 (1) The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment of not more than two years   may be suspended for a probationary period if, with special regard to the personal   circumstances of the perpetrator, there is reasonable ground to believe that the objective of   punishment can be achieved even without enforcing it.   (1a) For the illegal crossing of the border fence (section 352/A of the Btk.), vandalisation of   the border fence (section 352/B of the Btk.), or obstructing construction works related to the   border fence (section 352/C of the Btk.), the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment of   not more than five years may be suspended for a probationary period.   (2) Unless otherwise provided in this Act, the probationary period shall not be shorter than   one year or longer than five years, but it shall not be shorter than the term of the imprisonment   imposed. The probationary period shall be determined in years, or in years and months.   (2a) For the illegal crossing of the border fence (section 352/A of the Btk.), vandalisation of   the border fence (section 352/B of the Btk.), and obstructing construction works related to the   border fence (section 352/C of the Btk.), the probationary period shall not be shorter than two   years or longer than ten years, but it shall not be shorter than the period of expulsion imposed   for committing the criminal offence concerned.   Section 86 (1) The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall not be suspended if the   convict   a) is a multiple recidivist,   b) committed the criminal offence in a criminal organisation, or   c) committed an intentional criminal offence before enforcement of the sentence of   imprisonment was completed or during a probationary period of suspended imprisonment.   (2) If the perpetrator is subject to the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment, due to   which the enforcement of his sentence of suspended imprisonment may not be ordered, the   probationary period shall be extended by the time of imprisonment.   mailto:eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code (as in force on 1 April 2022)   This document has been produced for informational purposes only.   27   Contact: eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   (3) The provision laid down in paragraph (2) shall also apply to imprisonment replacing a   community service or a financial penalty.   (4) In the cases under paragraphs (2) and (3), the probationary period may exceed five   years.   (5) If the perpetrator is sentenced multiple times to imprisonment suspended for a   probationary period, and the probationary periods for the individual sentences of   imprisonment have not yet passed then all probationary periods shall be served concurrently.   (6) Simultaneously with suspending the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment, the   perpetrator may be subjected to probationary supervision. If the perpetrator is a recidivist, he   shall be subject to probationary supervision.   Section 87 A sentence of suspended imprisonment shall be enforced if   a) it is established during the probationary period that enforcement of the sentence was   suspended notwithstanding a ground for exclusion specified in section 86 (1),   b) the perpetrator is sentenced to imprisonment to be served for a criminal offence   committed during the probationary period, or   c) the perpetrator seriously violates the rules of behaviour of probationary supervision,   d) the perpetrator expelled under section 60 (2a) returns to Hungary during the probationary   period of his sentence of suspended imprisonment.   Section 88 The provision on enforcement of a suspended sentence shall apply accordingly   to ordering the enforcement of a sentence suspended due to a pardon.   Provisions on special, multiple and violent multiple recidivists   Section 89 (1) Regarding a special or multiple recidivist, the maximum of the penalty range   of the more recent criminal offence shall be increased by half for imprisonment, but it shall   not exceed twenty-five years.   (2) Regarding a special or multiple recidivist, punishment may be reduced   under section 82 (1) only in cases deserving special consideration.   (3) The more severe legal consequences specified in paragraph (1) shall not be applied if   committing a criminal offence as a special recidivist is to be punished as a qualified case   under the Special Part of this Act.   Section 90 (1) Section 33 (4) shall not apply to a violent multiple recidivist.   (2) Regarding a violent multiple recidivist, the maximum of the penalty range for the   criminal offence based on which the perpetrator is considered to be a violent multiple   recidivist shall be doubled for imprisonment. If the maximum of the penalty range increased   this way would exceed twenty years, or if the criminal offence may be punished also by life   imprisonment under the Act, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.   (3) The punishment of a violent multiple recidivist   a) shall not be reduced under section 82 (1),   b) may be reduced without limitation if allowed by the General Part of this Act.   Provisions on commission in a criminal organisation   Section 91 (1) If a person committed an intentional criminal offence in a criminal   organisation, the maximum of the penalty range applicable to the criminal offence shall be   doubled, but it shall not exceed twenty-five years.   (2) If a person committed the criminal offence in a criminal organisation, a ban on entering   certain areas may also be applied.   (3) If it is established that the criminal offence was committed in a criminal organisation,   the legal consequences specified in this Act regarding the commission of a criminal offence in   a criminal conspiracy shall not apply.   mailto:eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code (as in force on 1 April 2022)   This document has been produced for informational purposes only.   28   Contact: eu-forditas@im.gov.hu   Crediting pre-trial detention, criminal supervision and infraction penalties   Section 92 (1) The entire period of a pre-trial detention or of a criminal supervision during   which, as prescribed by the court, the defendant was not allowed to leave a home, other   premises, an institute or a fenced area of it without permission, shall be credited to the term of   imprisonment, confinement, community service or to the financial penalty.

(2) An accumulative sentence may include only sentences of imprisonment to be served   which are yet to be served or are being served at the time of accumulation.   (3) If a sentence of suspended imprisonment becomes enforceable subsequently, it shall be   deemed a sentence of imprisonment to be served for the purpose of accumulation.

In 2007, ESCWA launched its cyber legislation initiative. This resulted in a set of activities  that served to regularize the approach for implementing cyber legislation in the Arab world,  at the national and regional levels. This initiative focused on a project called ‘The Regional  Harmonization of Cyber Legislation to Promote the Knowledge Society in the Arab World’.  In this digest, this project is referred to as the ‘Harmonization Project’ and covers all ESCWA  activities from 2007 to present.    The approach taken by ESCWA in this project was based on a deep involvement with key  stakeholders: legal country representatives, ICT consultants, representatives of various  international organizations and other concerned bodies. It was through such collaboration  that ESCWA developed the cyber legislation templates and directives, which are currently  being implemented in various ESCWA member countries.    Having assessed the status of cyber legislation in the region, ESCWA started by developing a  document called the ‘Models for Cyber Legislation’. This document provided a situational  analysis of cyber legislation in the member states of ESCWA, and made recommendations on  how to address and implement cyber legislation.    ESCWA then developed six templates for the definition of cyber legislation. These templates  identify general areas of concern that should be addressed by every country embarking on  introducing robust cyber legislation and regulations, and consist of a set of headings broken  down hierarchically. The templates serve as a model for the analysis of cyber legislation in  each country and as a tool for developing legislation where it is lacking. ESCWA used the  templates to evaluate cyber legislation in Bahrain and in Syria.    Based on the model and the templates, ESCWA developed six directives. Each directive  addresses a key issue in cyber legislation, such as e-Communication, Freedom of Expression,  Cybercrime, etc. For each directive, ESCWA analyzed the situation in the Arab region,  defined the scope of issues addressed by the directive and most importantly, developed a  proposed set of Sections and Articles to be used in the drafting of cyber legislation.    To support its cyber legislation activities, ESCWA developed a cyber legislation portal. It also  developed and launched a virtual network for the ongoing support of cyber legislation  stakeholders in the Arab region.    Building on these outputs, the digest presents a set of recommendations for continuing  efforts to improve cyber legislation in the ESCWA region.    Finally, the digest summarizes the process and methodology ESCWA used in developing and  implementing the cyber legislation initiative.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    2   2.0 The Context for Cyber Legislation in the ESCWA Region     2.1 The Importance of Cyber Legislation for Building a Knowledge Society     Technological advancement is an important socio-economic issue for the ESCWA region.  Countries with developed economies are currently diversifying from their reliance on  commodities and moving into knowledge-based economies. Developing countries also need  to pursue such a path. The development of a knowledge based society depends heavily, if  not entirely, on technological enablers for efficient development. These enablers are  necessary for the development and implementation of various technological facilities such  as electronic commerce, communication and the use of the Internet.    In the past 10 years or so, there has been a significant increase in PC, mobile and internet  penetration in ESCWA member countries. This growth enabled these countries to recognise  the potential of the Internet as a source of progress and development. It has also been  generally accepted that web-based activities in the region cannot flourish without a  proactive and favorable environment for their use, by people in their various activities.        2.2 The Scope of Regulation    To provide such an environment implies the regulation of the virtual space covered by the  Internet, commonly referred to as cyberspace. This is a global space unattached to any  geographical or jurisdictional scope. It therefore becomes necessary to regulate cyberspace  without hindering progress and development.    The legal foundation and framework used to regulate cyberspace is generally referred to as  cyber legislation. This is a virtual world that manages the legal aspects of issues as wide as  personal data, electronic transactions, intellectual property and others. It covers the  creation of laws for the components and activities in cyberspace.     Given that no single country has jurisdiction over such an international domain, cyberspace  is difficult to regulate. However, regulating national cyberspace is possible, and requires the  development of an appropriate legal foundation and framework. Since legislation has always  lagged behind the development of technology, such a foundation becomes even more  urgent.    Regional cyberspace can be regulated when countries enter into relevant conventions and  agreements. These can define the online dealings of computer system users, electronic  communications and the Internet across borders. Such dealings would provide incentive for  these countries to develop their knowledge societies. If on the other hand, cyberspace is left  unregulated, users will be discouraged from undertaking cyber transactions which would  inevitably hinder socio-economic development.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    3   2.3 The Status of Cyber Legislation in the ESCWA Region    The Arab region has already ventured through various initiatives that introduced some cyber  laws and regulations. All Arab countries agree on the importance of cyber legislation,  specifically as this feeds into the regional strategies and plans launched to prepare for a  regulated ICT environment favorable to the most suitable usage of cyberspace.    Cyber legislation in the ESCWA region started with the issue of the electronic transactions  law in the Kingdom of Jordan, in December 2001. This was followed by a United Arab  Emirates law specific to the exchange of information and electronic commerce in February  2002. The Kingdom of Bahrain introduced an electronic commerce law in September 2002.    Cyber legislation was also considered an important issue, though not addressed  comprehensively, in two key initiatives:      The ESCWA Regional Plan of Action1 (RPoA) developed in 2005 as an overall umbrella  which outlined all actions needed to build the Information Society including cyber  laws as part of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS);    The Arab ICT Strategy 2 developed by the League of Arab States for the region and for  the period 2007 to 2012.     There was a lull in cyber legislation activities until March 2007, when the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia issued a law addressing electronic transactions followed closely by a similar law in the  Sultanate of Oman in May 2008. After that, most cyber legislation activity was prompted by  the initiatives of ESCWA, as discussed in this digest.    In recent years, there have been a few laws aimed at improving the status of knowledge  societies in the Arab region. The most recent were:      The electronic transactions law issued by Qatar (2010);    The cybercrime law in the Kingdom of Jordan (2010);    The e-Signature and network services law (2011) as well as the law to cover  cybercrime issues in Syria (2012)     Some countries such as Algeria and Morocco took the approach of introducing laws to  protect intellectual property by modifying and updating their existing intellectual property  laws.    ESCWA prepared six tables showing the cyber legislation implemented by each ESCWA  member country. Each table deals with a certain key area of cyber legislation. These key  areas correspond to the six directives developed by ESCWA (see Section 3.5).         1    US/Default.aspx  2    US/Default.aspx           The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    4   The Status of Cyber Legislation on Key issues     e-Signature Laws: These can be considered as the most commonly implemented laws in the  Arab world. Countries that have already issued such laws include: the United Arab Emirates,  the Kingdom of Jordan, the Kingdom of Bahrain, Tunis, Algeria, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  Syria, the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, Egypt and Morocco.    e-Transactions and e-Commerce: laws related to e-Transactions are well developed in the  Arab world. As for e-Payments, the ESCWA region has not yet covered such issues, with the  exception of Lebanon and Yemen. In Lebanon, the central bank issued various decrees  related to the regularization of electronic payments and exchange. Additionally in Yemen, a  special law was issued to cover electronic banking transactions.    Figure 1 shows the status of individual Arab countries as far as electronic transactions, e- Signature and e-Commerce laws are concerned.

As for countries in North Africa,  both Tunis and the Kingdom of Morocco have issued such laws. This is a key issue as the  protection of personal records is critical while implementing e-Government and e- Commerce.         The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    5   Consumer Protection: there has been a lack of progress in this area, with the exception of  Tunis and Lebanon. Both countries have issued general laws that cover consumer protection  which also address protection in cyber space.    Laws to Combat Cybercrime: This is a commonly addressed area. These have seen quick  implementation in countries such as: the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  and the Sudan. Other countries have draft laws or bills such as the Kingdom of Bahrain,  Algeria, Syria, the Sultanate of Oman and Egypt. Tunis and Morocco have found it more  suitable to include articles related to cybercrime under their own laws of electronic  commerce and intellectual property.    Figure 2 shows the status of individual Arab countries as far as cybercrime is concerned.     Figure 2.

However, a comprehensive set of cyber legislations related to intellectual property  (including those aspects related to databases) have yet to be addressed in the Arab world.       2.4 Limitations in the Implementation of Cyber Legislation     Despite some Arab countries having issued numerous laws for cyberspace, the following  criticisms still remain:         The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    6    Most of these countries did not allow for an integrated package of laws that fit under  the proper scope of cyber legislation;    They did not have a comprehensive set of laws that cover various foundations of ICT  operations;    There have been few regional initiatives or special projects under cyber legislation;    Coordination and regional integration of cyber legislation was found lacking;    There are wide gaps between in the maturity of cyber legislation in the region. For  example, the Kingdom of Bahrain has implemented various laws and regulatory  decrees related to electronic transactions and commerce as well as the protection of  intellectual properties, yet countries like Iraq and Kuwait have not addressed these  issues at all, despite them having draft laws that have not been implemented yet;    Most countries in the region have not covered the legal aspects of electronic  payments with the exception of Lebanon and Yemen;    Most countries in the region have also not covered the issues of consumer protection  in cyberspace with the exception of Lebanon and Tunis;    Most countries in the region have not covered issues of personal data protection in  cyberspace.     In the workshop conducted by ESCWA in Cairo (March 2012), Dr. Younes Arab presented the  paper “Applying ESCWA Cyber Legislation Directives”. This document provides a useful  overview of the potential obstacles to a comprehensive implementation of cyber legislation  in the Arab world3.       3      The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    7   3.0 The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Initiative     Prior to 2007, extensive studies and regional analysis on cyber legislation was conducted in  areas of the world outside of the ESCWA region. Comparable material was not available for  the ESCWA region with few attempts made at developing cyber legislation in a concerted  and planned manner.     The nascent nature of knowledge societies in most ESCWA member countries required  immediate legislative action, in order to create an adequate enabling environment for ICTs  to flourish. Without a catalytic and conjoined effort to support their legislative plans,  policymakers were not well prepared in addressing cyber legislative issues. Resolving these  issues is of great importance towards facilitating electronic interactions between ESCWA  member countries and at the Arab regional level.     Most developed countries, as well as some developing countries, have recently started to  update or have already updated their legal and regulatory frameworks, in line with the  needs to adopting new technologies. An example is the launch of the \"e-Europe Initiative\"  by the European Commission (2000), which aimed at accelerating Europe's transition  towards a knowledge-based economy4. This would then realize the potential benefits of  higher growth, more jobs and improved access for all citizens, to the new services of the  information age.     A similar effort was needed for the ESCWA region in particular and the Arab world in  general. In 2007, ESCWA commenced with a series of activities aimed at the Regional  Harmonization of Cyber Legislation to Promote the Knowledge Society in the Arab World.    In launching Regional Harmonization activities, ESCWA aimed at enhancing the regional  integration of cyber legislation. It also aimed at strengthening the capacity of member  countries to develop their own knowledge societies. These two aims need to be achieved by  building a strong and sustainable ICT sector supported by appropriate legal and regulatory  frameworks. Such suitable frameworks lead to growth in the regional economy, particularly  in the ICT sector, through the implementation of appropriate laws.       3.1 The Objectives of Cyber Legislation     The general objectives of cyber legislation were understood by ESCWA as follows:     1. To prevent the illegal use of cyberspace.  2. To provide a framework that allows judiciary processes to address cybercrime   when it happens.  3. To reinforce human rights by recognizing the variety of aspects that relate to the   digital rights of individuals.  4. To enhance the different modes of electronic communication by providing the   required traceability, security and protection of data.  5. To define in clear terms the obligations, liabilities and responsibilities of all   stakeholders.     4          The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    8   6. To promote the use of ICT applications and e-Services in governmental, economic,  social and cultural activities so that users become more confident conducting  online transactions.     These general objectives were converted to more specific objectives for the Harmonization  Project as shown in the next section.      3.2 The Objectives of the Harmonization of Cyber Legislation     Following on from the above objectives, ESCWA established the objectives and expected  achievements (see next section) as follows:      To enhance regional integration in the field of cyber legislation and Knowledge  Societies.    To strengthen the capacity of member countries to develop their knowledge  societies through the drafting of cyber legislation.    To build a strong and sustainable ICT sector in member countries through the  development of appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.     Such objectives will lead to growth in the region's economy, particularly in the ICT sector, by:      Facilitating e-Transactions between the countries of the region with the removal of  legislative contradictions that may otherwise hinder their completion.    Enhancing regional and cross-border business and trade as extra-national consumers  will be less concerned about falling into legislative vacuums.    Minimizing ICT market segmentation problems and increasing cross-border  competitiveness by enabling access to wider markets for businesses which would  otherwise find it difficult to sell and expand outside of their national borders.     Various activities and results were accomplished starting with the development of the Cyber  Legislation Model, going through the approval of the Harmonization Project in 2008 and  launching it in 2009. The project is currently being conducted by ESCWA's Information and  Communication Technology Division (ICTD).      3.3 Models for Cyber Legislation in ESCWA Member Countries    ESCWA’s cyber legislation efforts began in 2007 as a project for the harmonization of cyber  legislation in ESCWA member countries. This was followed by a study entitled ’Models for  Cyber Legislation in ESCWA Member Countries’.5 This study formed the basis of the  approach to the harmonization of cyber legislation. It justified the launch of the  harmonization of cyber legislation and prepared the ground for implementation activities in  the region.       5          The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    9   This study was discussed in a peer review meeting in 2007 and a meeting was set up to  discuss the Model and review its findings (details can be found in Appendix B: Timeline). The  study was presented with two major objectives.     First Objective: Situational Analysis    The first objective was to present a review of the status of cyber legislation in the region.  This covered several areas of analysis including:     1. A survey of legal texts, international conventions, directives, treaties and national  laws of selected countries.     2. A review of cyber legislation activities in the ESCWA region. This included full legal   texts and articles of laws on such cyber-related topics such as e-Commerce,  consumer protection, intellectual property and e-Transactions.     3. Ratifications made by ESCWA member countries to international conventions were   outlined.    4. An analysis of current cyber or cyber related legislation in the ESCWA region, in   terms of whether such laws exhausted all topics as compared with international  conventions and non-Arab cyber laws.     Second Objective: Recommendations     The second objective was to present recommendations for drafting model cyber laws in the  ESCWA region. This was crucial as most ESCWA member countries still lack such legislation.  Such a lack can be attributed to reasons such as:      an underestimation of the importance of and the need for such legislation;    the judicial bodies in some countries not having a significant enough backlog of cyber  related cases to cause concern;    countries have not been able to use existing laws and provisions by analogy and  through broad interpretation in order to adjudicate cases dealing with cyberspace.      The document presented the following recommendations:     1. Identification of the cyber legislation topics to be addressed as:      Data protection;    Cybercrime;    Censorship and freedom of expression;    Privacy on the Internet;    E-Commerce;    Telecommunications.     These were used to develop ESCWA’s six directives (see Section ‎3.43.5).       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    10   2. The second step was to assess the status of legislation in each ESCWA member  country. This would result in identifying gaps between what is present and what is  required. Legislators can then opt for one of three approaches:       Drafting local laws;    Ratifying international treaties;    Adopting a model law available on a regional or international level.    3. A mechanism was proposed for enacting the new laws and consisted of the following   activities:      Creating specialized focus groups: of concerned ministries, ICT experts and legal  professionals in cyber legislation.       Based on the recommendations of the focus groups, model laws would be  defined, discussed and enlarged to include laws that were hierarchically broken  down into specific sections and articles.       Interviews and workshops would then be conducted to discuss the laws, acquaint  key stakeholders with these laws, address issues of compliance with existing  laws, subsequently, laying the groundwork for eventual implementation.       The final phase, before enacting the laws, would include discussion sessions  concerning the draft laws. The aim of these sessions is for stakeholders to ensure  that the draft laws cover all possible situations.     The importance of these recommendations directly led to the need for regional  harmonization amongst ESCWA member countries.      3.4 The Six ESCWA Cyber Legislation Templates    The first step towards the harmonization of cyber laws in the ESCWA region was the  development of six templates during 2007 and 2008. The six templates include a set of  headings broken down hierarchically. The headings identify areas of cyber legislation  concern, to be addressed by every country embarking on the introduction of robust cyber  legislation and regulations.    The templates can be used as follows:      To identify the breakdown of the various issues of each of the six areas of a directive  and hence use such a hierarchical breakdown for addressing the issues nationally.    To evaluate the status of a country vis-à-vis cyber legislation.    ESCWA applied this template for two member countries (Syria and the Kingdom of Bahrain)  and prepared reports summarizing their findings.           The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    11   The Definition of Templates    ESCWA developed the cyber legislation templates as tools which could help ESCWA member  countries in formulating new cyber laws and/or the evaluation of their existing national  cyber laws. There are six templates, each one covering one of the main areas for the  enhancement of the regulatory framework for cyberspace. Each template includes  components and sub-components for the development or adaptation of cyber legislation.    The templates focus on principles, issues, areas of high concern and matters relating to the  directive. By comparison, the six directives offer more concrete, specific proposals: chapters,  sections and articles to be used while developing cyber legislation. The six templates are  available on the webpage referred to in the link below.6 The directives are discussed in the  Section 3.5.     The Background and Current Status of the Templates     The development of the templates started in 2007 and was based on several sources, such  as:      Various international and regional conventions and agreements i.e. the Combating of  Cybercrime by the European Union.    The model laws and rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade  Law (UNICITRAL).    National laws and regulations of some countries such as France’s laws on the  protection of personal data.     The templates were announced during the December 2008 workshop conducted by ESCWA  (see Appendix B). They were first used to analyses the status of cyber legislation in the  Kingdom of Bahrain and in Syria in the same year.    By 2010, ESCWA had achieved the introduction of the templates in the Arab region, which  are currently being implemented. The status of these countries is described in six tables  corresponding to each directive. Each table contains a list of ESCWA member countries, and  the specific parts of the templates that have been implemented in those countries.      3.5 The Six ESCWA Cyber Legislation Directives     The six directives represent the core of the cyber legislation initiative’s output. They consist  of sample laws expressed as chapters, sections and articles. For a detailed explanation of the  methodology used to develop these directives, please consult Section 5: Process and  Methodology.    The package of six compatible directives was developed in Arabic as six separate documents.  They have also been published as one consolidated document.       6         The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    12   Each of the six documents has the following structure:      The areas that ESCWA’s research covered, essentially the scope of the directive.    The experience of ESCWA member countries in formulating legislation related to the  directive and a comparison of these formulations with international legislation.    A descriptive explanation of the proposed laws.    The specific chapters, sections and articles of the laws proposed for the specific  directive.      Additionally, each document referenced a wide range of studies, laws or cases relating to  the subject of the specific directive.     These directives were discussed and agreed upon during an expert group meeting that was  held at ESCWA’s premises in Feb 2011, as detailed in Appendix B.     The directives (together with annex and glossary) are available to download from ESCWA’s  website7.    Directive 1: e-Communication and Freedom of Expression    This first directive has a fundamental importance specifically as it forms the basis for other  cyber legislation directives. This is due to its handling of the technical and operational  aspects related to the determining the identities and responsibilities of the parties that  provide electronic communications services. The identities of responsible parties needs to  be legally determined after any transgression, hence the legitimation of the various aspects  of electronic communication are necessary.     An increase in Internet penetration and broadening in the nature and variety of users goes  in parallel with the increase in the types of devices used for accessing the Internet i.e.  laptops, mobiles, PCs, tablets, etc. Electronic communication witnessed a shift in paradigm,  from being solely used for accessing information to being used as the basis for interactive  socio-economic development. This brought to the forefront, the issue of validity of such  usage, where any transgression encountered by the transferred information, in terms of  medication, blockage, divulging of personal data, may result in damages to various parties  involved in the transfer. More importantly, the judiciary world has opened up to the  possibility of using such information as legal evidence, requiring firm and legal establishment  of the identities of the parties involved, the time and date of transfer and the information  systems it was sent from.     Communicators of information that use electronic means have traditionally resorted to  various technical devices to protect themselves. These devices resulted in a variety of  practices which could be discretionary, illegal, impractical, incomplete or lacking in exposing  the identities involved. These incongruous methods were seen as insufficient to protect the  public from the misuse of electronic communications.    The issues researched and addressed by this directive include:     7          The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    13      1. Electronic data transfer to and from the public and various providers. The directive  focuses on the freedom of such transfers and any constraints imposed on it. It also  addresses the role of the network service providers and data hosting service  providers during such transfer.      2. The legal framework for network service providers in as much as it covers their  obligations, liabilities and responsibilities. This also covers their coordination with  security and judiciary authorities as regards legislative issues.     3. The encryption of data and the usage of encryption tools, their import and their   export. This also covers the responsibility of the providers of such tools as far as the  privacy of information is concerned, and the cases where information can or cannot  be divulged based on court decisions. Finally, this issue covers the responsibility of  providers for the safekeeping of confidentiality of such data.     4. The surveillance of personal and private communications covers cases where   surveillance shall be disallowed. Also covered are those cases where such  surveillance can be officially allowed.     5. The legal proceedings, particularly penal proceedings, resulting from the   transgression of the above laws.    This directive was developed as a comprehensive set of laws that cover telecommunications  and freedom of expression. ESCWA relied on the European laws issued in 2000 for electronic  commerce as well as the corresponding French laws issued in 2004 and related international  and regional laws.    This directive identifies five chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: General Provisions  Chapter 2: The Legal Framework for the Network Service Providers  Chapter 3: Data Encryption  Chapter 4: Electronic Surveillance on Private and Personal Communications  Chapter 5: Criminal Provisions     Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     Directive 2: e-Signature and e-Transactions    The need for electronic signatures arose after both private and public sector started  providing electronic transactions via the web or through direct transacting. This was  particularly crucial in the financial sector. The development of various technological means  of applying electronic signatures to electronic transactions resulted in the need for a solid  legislative framework to safeguard such transactions and provide the necessary certification  levels for them.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    14   This directive is concerned with two aspects of e-Signatures and e-Transactions. On the one  hand, there is the legal aspect of their use. On the other, there is the technological aspect  related to such facilities as encryption systems, public and private key etc.    The issues researched and addressed by this directive include:    1. Electronic signature, records and evidence. This covers regular and official records as   well as copies thereof. It also covers the specification of legal conditions that define  the authenticity of electronic records and their use as evidence. Also addressed are  the data elements and mechanisms to be used when using electronic signatures.     2. The duties and responsibilities of the certification service provider or the owner of   the certification and the relying party. This also covers the regularization of the  procedures to be followed when issuing authenticated certificates.     3. Legal recognition of countries outside the Arab region of electronic certification. This   also considers the issues resulting from authenticated certificates issued outside the  Arab region.     4. Financial and banking transactions which covers all types of payment and transfer   orders, banking cards and automated withdrawals as well as electronic cash and  checks. Also addressed are the specifications of the information systems used for  such transactions and the responsibilities of the banks and financial institutions that  deal with such transactions and their obligation to safeguard the interests of their  clients.     Work was distributed under two sections. The first dealt with the legal aspects of electronic  transactions. The second dealt with the technological aspect specifically addressing  encryption systems, the use of public and private key as well as the identification of  authentication providers within European countries.    This directive identifies five chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: General Provisions  Chapter 2: Electronic Records and Signatures  Chapter 3: The responsibilities of Authentication Service Providers, the owner of   the certificate and the relying party  Chapter 4: Legal recognition of Authentication Certificates issued in Countries   outside the Arab Region  Chapter 5: Banking and Financial Transactions     Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     Directive 3: e-Commerce and Consumer Protection    Over the past thirty years, commercial transactions occurred through direct or web based  connectivity. This consisted of the transfer and acceptance of documentation, electronically  such as invoices, payments or transfer orders, contracts and financial statements. The     The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    15   resulting environment was called e-Commerce (often termed the virtual marketplace or e- marketplace). Transaction volumes, user counts and the number of commercially based  websites rose exponentially, and are still rising.    With the rise of competition and the need to reach customers faster, consumers were often  left in a vulnerable situation. This was exacerbated by cross-border commerce often  resulting in conflicting legal requirements.    The need for a “virtual” legal framework as robust as the traditional paper based laws and  regulations became crucial for the progress and development of the international  marketplace.    The issues researched and addressed by this directive include:    1. Electronic commercial messages and communications. This covers the use of   electronic mail and notifications including their source and date-time stamps. Also  covered are issues related to spamming as well as laws that protect consumers using  such facilities.     2. Electronically based contracts. This covers issues related to the legal recognition of   such contracts as well as issues related to electronic messages used when developing  such contracts. Also addressed are issues related to the price fixing and allowing  consumers to cancel transactions.     3. Codes of conduct and resorting to non-judiciary resolution of disputes and judicial   recourses, such as web based arbitration or rulings.    This directive identifies four chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: General Provisions  Chapter 2: Commercial Electronic Messages and Letters  Chapter 3: Electronic Contracts  Chapter 4: Final Provisions     Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     Directive 4: The Processing and Protection of Personal Data     With growing concern over human rights, the private and personal data of individuals has  naturally become a topical issue. This has been further emphasized by progress in cross- border global communications, the ability of such supporting systems to store and exchange  large amounts of data and the increasingly obvious commercial value of such data.    One of the earliest laws covering the processing and protection of personal data was issued  in France in 1987. It was later expanded and adopted by the European Council in 1981.    The need for a legal framework to protect individuals and regularize the processing of their  private and personal data was one of ESCWA’s main concerns.  The issues researched and addressed in this directive include:     The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    16     1. The general conditions required for the legal processing of personal electronic   records. This addresses issues related to the definition of what constitutes a personal  record and the principles that allow for its processing. Also addressed are the  responsibilities of those parties who are processing such records and the rights of the  person whose data is being processed, in order to know what is being processed and  how.     2. The setup of suitable control agencies whose main concerns are the protection of   electronic personal records. Such agencies will be responsible for the protection of  all such records as well as the control of the processing of such records and the  authorization for their processing. Such agencies will also have the authority to issue  penalties in case of transgressions or improper access as well as blocking access to  specific records or halting their processing.     3. Judicial recourses, responsibilities and sanctions. This covers the rights of the owners   of personal data to refer to special courts regarding the processing of such personal  records. Also addressed are issues related to compensation in the case of  transgressions and the cases where such transgressions are allowed by law.     4. The transfer of personal data to countries outside the Arab region. Issues such as the   responsibilities of the parties conducting such transfers are addressed as well as the  various assurances of such parties to the owners of the safety and security of their  records as part of the individual’s rights.     5. Codes of conduct covering articles required to regularize rules that can be used to   control the protection of personal records.    This directive identifies seven chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: General Provisions  Chapter 2: The Official Control Agency  Chapter 3: General Conditions for the Processing of Personal Data  Chapter 4: Judicial Recourses, Responsibilities and Sanctions  Chapter 5: The Transfer of Personal Data to Countries outside the Arab Region  Chapter 6: Code of Conduct  Chapter 7: Final Provisions     Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     Directive 5: Cybercrime     With the exponential increase in the penetration of laptops, mobiles and easily accessible  networks, a paradigm shift resulted in the generation of a new form of crime, aptly called  cybercrime. Gone is the need for criminal equipment and instruments. Any individual with  sufficient competence can be party to a wide range of crime categories using ICT facilities.  The nature of crimes can also be moral, financial, vandalistic and based on blackmail. The  range of crimes is complex and vast making it resistant to counter development using ICT     The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    17   information systems. Pirating media, pornography, harassment, malware cannot be easily  stopped.    The required legal framework needs to define the crimes in specific terms and formulate  relevant sanctions.    In general, cybercrime can be categorized into crimes that use the computer as the criminal  instrument, the means towards the crime and those crimes where the computer systems,  networks or facilities are the target of the crime.    The issues researched and addressed by this directive include:    1. Crimes whose target is data and information and information systems. This covers   the misuse of such systems through illegal access, acquisition or distribution of such  systems or software or their related passwords or access credentials.     2. Financial crimes covering the use of methods which aim at illegal financial benefits.   These cover swindling, embezzlement, illegal promotion or dissemination, the  acquisition of passwords, identity theft and access and dissemination of private and  confidential data. Crimes related to the misuse of banking cards and electronic  money can also be grouped under financial crimes.     3. Sexual abuse of minors: the dissemination of images, text or video clips or incitement   to pornographic activities.    4. Infringement of intellectual property: the fraudulent assumption of authorship,   imitation of signatures or stamps, copying of electronic documents or the piracy of  software products, the sale and promotion of such products and the infringement of  intellectual rights.     5. Crimes that misuse personal data. This covers issues related to the processing of   personal data without prior authority as well as the divulging of such information.    6. Hate crimes and crimes against humanity through the use of Information Systems.   Hate crimes include the publication and dissemination of racial information, threats  to or attacks of persons based on their race, colour or beliefs. The denial or distortion  of genocide and crimes against humanity are also addressed. Crimes against  humanity include the promotion of genocidal activities and incitement to genocide.     7. Promotion and facilitation of drugs and gambling through the use of Information   Systems as well as the promotion of alcoholic beverages to minors.    8. Crimes against public and national security using Information Systems: the disruption   of governmental activities through the use of Information Systems, the failure of  reporting or the misreporting of cybercrimes, access to classified information, illegal  manipulation of evidence, its destruction or hiding as well as any terrorist activities  or incitement to homicide.        The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    18   9. Crimes involving the promotion, import or export of encryption tools without license  or prior authorization from the required official agencies in the country. Also  included is the sale of unlicensed tools.     This directive identifies eleven chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: Crimes whose target is Data  Chapter 2: Crimes whose target is Information Systems  Chapter 3: Misuse of Information Systems and Software  Chapter 4: Crimes of a Financial or Transactional Nature  Chapter 5: Cybercrimes against Minors  Chapter 6: Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights  Chapter 7: Crimes related to Banking Cards and Electronic Money  Chapter 8: Crimes against Private Data  Chapter 9: Racial Crimes or Crimes against Humanity  Chapter 10: Drug and Gambling related crimes  Chapter 11: Cybercrimes against Public and National Security     Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     Directive 6: Intellectual Property Rights in ICT and Cyberspace    The rise in the penetration of computers led to a wider area of usage than they were  originally designed for. Authors, composers, film producers and developers of content,  among others, found themselves faced with an ever improving set of tools and utilities to  use when developing or creating their works. Works were developed in digital format and  often, disseminated in that form.    As in the other five directives, the rise in digital facilities used through Information Systems  necessitated the generation of a new set of legislation frameworks, needed to protect the  rights of authors against various transgressions.    The issues researched and addressed by this directive cover the legal protection of various  items. Legal protection in this directive covers both intellectual property rights as well as the  protection of patents. The following include the various areas addressed in the directive:    1. Application software (system and operating software, programming languages,   application software, etc.) This covers the legal protection of such products in terms  of their ownership, the rights of the holder of the intellectual copyright as well as the  exceptions that might result thereof.     2. Databases (content and structure). This covers two aspects: ownership and the right   to use such databases.    3. Semiconducting products. This covers laws related to the protection of the owner of   such products, those related to the patenting and duration of rights as well as rights  related to the topographies of semiconducting products.        The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    19   4. Digital products other than application software. This covers all regulations  concerned with the protection of such products which are not included in the  categories of software, databases and semiconducting products.      5. Domain names. This covers the rules and regulations for the issuing of names by  suitably assigned authorities, the processes required for the financial and  administration processes required for the registration of such domains, their  modifications and cancelations. Also addressed are the regulations needed for the  resolution of conflicts resulting from the use of domain names.      This directive identifies seven chapters as follows:     Chapter 1: General Provisions  Chapter 2: The Legal Protection of Software  Chapter 3: The Legal Protection of Databases  Chapter 4: The Legal Protection of Semiconducting Products  Chapter 7: Common Provisions      Their related sections and articles are listed in Appendix A.     3.6 The Portal, Virtual Network and Sustainability of Results    In parallel with the main activities for developing and launching the ESCWA Cyber Legislation  Directives, ESCWA had another aim for disseminating and supporting these efforts. This was  carried out through two related processes:    1. Making available information about the Harmonization Project including documents,   studies, reports and related resources through the ESCWA Cyber Legislation Portal.     2. Developing a virtual network. This is essentially a portal whose aim is to support the  cyber legislation environment in the Arab region, as a forum of discussion and  database of experts and institutions. The virtual network also aims at providing  continuity of operations in the field of cyber legislation in the Arab region. It is the  first portal of its kind in the region.     Most of the documents referred to in this digest are linked in the footnote to ESCWA’s cyber  legislation portal.     This section will concentrate on the virtual network as a part of the Harmonization Project.     Objectives of the Virtual Network    The main objectives of the virtual network are the following:     1. To support decision makers and legislators in Arab countries when developing  legislation frameworks that cover cyberspace operations.      2. To ensure the streamlining of such frameworks regionally and through the use of the  ESCWA cyber legislation directives.        The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    20   3. To make available a platform that provides opportunities for cooperation and  regional ongoing integration in the coordination of the cyber legislative process.     4. To make available a platform for the exchange of views and expertise.    5. To raise awareness of the importance of cyber legislation in the development of   Knowledge-based economies and societies.    6. To assess and evaluate the current status of cyber legislation in Arab countries and   compare it with regional and international cyber legislation.    One of the direct objectives noted for the virtual network is the reinforcement of regional  integration and the development of capacity for the countries in the region, in their efforts  to develop legislative and regulatory frameworks.     Components of the Portal & Virtual Network    The virtual network contains the following key components:    1. The content of the portal contains scientifically organized and documented   information on various issues of cyber legislation. Such as:      Cyber legislation texts based on national, regional and international sources;    Information covering the Harmonization Project and its activities;    Cyber legislation related conventions and agreements from the Arab world or  other countries;    Studies and directives issued by ESCWA;    Cyber legislation related references and reports;    ESCWA template for cyber legislation;    Matrices showing the status of cyber legislation in selected countries of the Arab  world.     2. The Interactive component which provides opportunities to cooperate in order to   adapt and maintain cyber legislation in an up to date form. This will allow:      The exchange of knowledge and best practices as well as dialog between experts  and stakeholders;    Highlighting of pending issues;    The sharing of documents, expertise and success stories;    Updating the portal with news, events and related activities;    Feedback from users aimed at improving the website.    3. A membership database that hosts the profiles of experts and professionals in the   field of cyber legislation.    4 A database that hosts specific information related to ministries, organizations and   other stakeholders.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    21   5. An advanced search engine that allows the extraction and production of beneficial  reports from the portal.     Users of the Virtual Network    The users of the virtual network consist of two categories:    1. Experts and professionals who will have special modes of registration, which would   provide special facilities such as the use of interactive tools and the participation in  web based discussions.      2. Regular users who can register and have access to browse the portal as well as  download various documents, studies and reports.      3.7 Advisory Services Offered by ESCWA     Throughout the Harmonization Project, ESCWA offered advisory services to its member  countries, notably the following:     1. Oman: review cyber laws, one on e-commerce and the other on e-communications.  2. Palestine: review selected cyber laws.  3. Syria: review of five draft cyber laws.  4. Bahrain: to develop a gap analysis study between Bahraini cyber laws and the ESCWA   Cyber Legislation Directives.  5. Jordan: to review the e-Transactions and Privacy law.  6. Sudan: to arrange a national training workshop on the ESCWA Cyber Legislation   Directives.  7. Lebanon: To arrange a national seminar on cyber legislation addressed to the   parliament and lawyers.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    22   4.0 Recommendations       The Harmonization Project has always looked forward to major upgrades.  Recommendations were issued as a result of proposals from regional experts in cyber  legislation, as well as recommendations from ESCWA meetings and workshops.     4.1 Government Level Recommendations    The following recommendations were issued for local implementation:     1. To highlight the importance of covering comprehensive cyber legislation.     2. To stress the importance of acquiring guidance from, as well as joining, international  cyber legislation agreements and those issued in the Arab region.     3. To urge governments to proceed with the implementation of cyber legislation.     4. To ensure that within each country, there is coordination between different  governmental bodies to avoid duplication of legislation.      5. To avail the required human and financial resources for the ongoing fieldwork.        4.2 Regional Recommendations     The following recommendations apply at a regional level:     1. To stress the need for regional cooperation in matters related to cyber legislation by  stressing the efforts made by the League of Arab States, ESCWA and regional and  international organizations.      2. To highlight the importance of the ESCWA cyber legislation directives.     3. To draft an integrated agreement between Arab countries, that covers the six  directives developed by ESCWA.      4. To develop plans that will develop and implement cyber legislation.    5. To facilitate electronic exchange between the countries in this region and build   Arabian information societies.     6. To work on the unification of Arabic ICT and cyber legislation terminology in  coordination with the League of Arab States.      7. To develop a legal Arabic database thesaurus.              The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    23   4.3 Capacity Building and Training Recommendations     The following recommendations are addressed at the capacity building and training level:     1. To train legislators, judges and lawyers on cyber legislation.     2. To organize national training workshops for judges, lawyers, technicians, members of  the prosecution, security forces and judicial officers.      3. To stress the need to conduct regional meetings and conferences for experts in cyber  legislation.      4. To prepare for the qualification of judicial officers and authorities.     5. To appoint prosecution and special courts specialized in cyber legislation.     6. To include subjects related to cyber legislation in the syllabuses of ICT colleges and  universities.        4.4 Recommendations for the Legislative Processes     The following are recommendations made to cover the process of legislation in various  countries:     1. To ensure that legislation emanates from civil society, making it more authentic,  rather than import concepts and operations from outside the region. This can be  achieved through:       Publishing the proposed Cyber Legislations;    Improving transparency in the legislation process;    Widening the pool of stakeholders for formulation of cyber legislation.     2. To encourage documentation of all discussions in legislative committees and teams.    3. To develop the competence needed for formulating clear legislative texts including   official commentary on each of the articles.    4. To develop methods of observation and fieldwork in parallel with the legislative   process.    5. To document and make possible the recall of jurisprudence. This can be achieved by   conducting studies that rely on fieldwork, without restricting what may be published  of court decisions and decisions that resolve conflicts in cyberspace.     6. To form groups specialized in cyberspace jurisprudence to help in publishing   judgments and case commentaries.       The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    24   7. To highlight the importance of preparing comparative analyses over jurisprudence  related to cybercrime, issued in the Arab region and in developed countries.      4.5 Other Recommendations     ESCWA recommends the following additional steps in addition to those mentioned above:     1. To encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field of cyber  legislation to form working groups, that can collectively lobby governments and  legislative bodies to develop special laws related to cyber legislation.      2. To launch financial feasibility studies that identify the required financial resources for  regulatory authorities and other bodies concerned with prosecution, penalization and  control, as well as identifying the most suitable forms for funding such operations all  with the aim of implementing effective laws.      3. To make available the means and financial and human resources needed for ongoing  fieldwork for regulatory authorities. This would allow them to conduct registration,  profiling and surveying of various cyberspace operations at the national level.             The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    25   5.0 Process and Methodology    This section provides an overview of the process and methodology that ESCWA used  throughout the development and implementation of the Cyber Legislation Initiative.        5.1 Activities     The activities initially planned for this project were the following:     1. To produce a report that will:     a) Identify major areas of concern for ESCWA member countries.  b) Update the status of cyber legislation in the Arab region.  c) Propose a framework for the regional harmonization of cyber legislation in the   Arab world.     2. To take into account past international experience (mainly the European  Commission's) to produce a set of directives which:      a) Comprise text models of cyber laws that may easily be implemented at the  national level.   b) Cover the six main areas of cyber legislation.  c) Include a set of coherent definitions of all legal terms used.  d) Include a detailed introductory statement of the fundamental purposes and   guiding principles of the directives.     3. To organize an experts meeting, involving professionals from governmental entities,  non-governmental organizations and the private sector to review the directives that  were proposed for the enhancement and harmonization of cyber legislation in the  Arab region.     4. To organize two regional workshops that will provide hands-on training, to policy and   decision makers, on the ESCWA cyber legislation Directives and their applications at  national and regional levels.     5. To provide advisory services to ESCWA member countries and, upon request, other   Arab countries on the drafting of legislation that would be in harmony with the  ESCWA cyber legislation directives.     6. To organize a seminar on the legal and regulatory requirements for a sustainable   knowledge society in the Arab region, to review the results of the harmonization  process at the regional and sub-regional levels and provide recommendations for  sustainability.     7. To promote and assist in the establishment of a Virtual Network of governmental,   private sector and NGO institutions concerned with the promotion of the ICT sector.  This activity will improve the sustainability of the project by helping various     The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    26   stakeholders interact and exchange knowledge during and after the implementation  of the project.      5.2 Research     The research conducted by ESCWA encompassed the following areas:      Reviewing the experiences and activities of international organisations such as the  EU, ITU, etc.    Reviewing the experiences and activities of Arab based organisations and ESCWA  member countries.    Information from various legislations issued by Western countries such as the USA,  France, Belgium, Switzerland, etc.    Reviewing key cyber related jurisprudential references in Arabic and other languages.    Referencing ESCWA studies related to cyber legislation for specific member countries  in particular.         5.3 The Different Approaches Considered     ESCWA considered the following three approaches to tackling the implementation of cyber  legislation in its member countries and the Arab region.    The first approach was to draft a specific legal framework for each cyberspace issue.    The second approach was to modify existing and applicable laws (this approach would be  applicable in some cases only). These laws could be adjusted through the addition of articles  or sections that regularize laws relating to cyberspace.    The third approach was to draft unified and consolidated laws that cover the various issues  in cyberspace, in such a manner as to create a single law categorized into classes of issues in  cyberspace.    ESCWA eventually adopted the first approach after the re-categorization of the various  issues under the six compatible directives.      5.4 The Six Directives: Consolidating Cyberspace Issues     ESCWA’s initial research resulted in identifying a large number of cyberspace related  facilities, activities, components and issues:      Electronic transactions;    E-Commerce;    The protection of personal data;    Cybercrime;    Electronic communication;     The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    27    Freedom of expression via electronic communication;    Protection of intellectual property;    Rules of evidence and the bases for decision and rulings;    Combating terrorism on the Internet – cyberterrorism;    Net neutrality;    ICT laws and regulations;    Computer forensics;    e-Government;    Adjudication via the Internet;    Ethical and professional controls in the Internet;    The basis and control of cloud processing    The above areas were too numerous and would have created an obstacle to building  consensus with a need for early implementation of cyber legislation. Therefore, ESCWA re- categorized the above items into six main directives for improved focus and ease of  development. The final six directives are:     1. e-Communication and freedom of expression;  2. e-Signature and e-Transactions;  3. e-Commerce and consumer protection;  4. The processing and protection of personal data;  5. The prevention and judicial processing of cybercrime;  6. Intellectual Property Rights in ICT and cyberspace.         5.5 Stakeholders of the Cyber Legislation Harmonization Project     ESCWA is currently implementing this project in coordination with several regional and  international organizations. The purpose is to develop cyber legislation which would include  the League of Arab States, the North Africa Office of the Economic Commission for Africa  (ECA-NA) and others. ESCWA is notably collaborating with high level experts, government  ministries, and specialized partners such as national and regional ICT societies and lawyer  syndicates.     Beneficiaries of the Project     Most parties in the ESCWA region or the Arab world will directly or indirectly benefit from  the results of the Harmonization Project. However, to arrive at a practical working plan,  ESCWA focused on the following beneficiaries:      Decision makers concerned with cyber legislation.    The ministries concerned with cyber legislation such as the ministries of justice,  commerce, interior and telecommunications.    Legislators, judges and lawyers.    The private sector.    Professional bodies and communities.    Members of the civil society.         The ESCWA Cyber Legislation Digest    28   Partners in the Project    The following is a list of parties involved in the development of the Harmonization Project:     1. ESCWA's Information and Communication Technology Division (ICTD).    2. Experts in the field of cyber legislation from the Arab region.    3. The Steering Committee for the project (see below).    4. Various cyber legislation experts and consultants.      Steering Committee    The Steering Committee of the Harmonization Project was established in early 2009 to  provide guidance and advice on the implementation of the project’s different phases and  components. Other functions covered the monitoring of progress and the evaluation of the  project’s achievements.    The Committee had its first meeting in December 2009 (see section ‎5.8). It consisted of the  following parties:     1. ESCWA representatives from ICTD.    2. The Director of the Arab Regional Bureau, International Telecommunication Union   (ITU).    3. The Regional Adviser on ICT Policy, the Economic Commission for Africa North Africa   Office (ECA-NA).    4. The representative of the Legal Department of the League of Arab States.    5. The representative of the Arab Administrative Development Organization (ARADO).    6. A regional expert in cyber legislation and his team.        Legal and ICT Advisors and Consultants    Throughout its development, the ESCWA Harmonization Project depended, to a large  extent, on the expertise and guidance of various legal and ICT advisors and consultants.    Their expertise and guidance were offered through one or more of these channels or roles:      Members of the Steering Committee;    Speakers in the various workshops and conferences;    Writers of specific papers.;    Consultants to assist in the development of various documents in the project;    Participants in the Experts General Meetings;    Reviewers of draft documents.

They cover the  period from 2007 when the initial activities began until present.      5.6 2007 (December): Peer Consultation Meeting and the Template     In December 2007, ESCWA organized a get-together for regional legal experts in Amman.  The meeting was entitled “The Peer Consultation Meeting on Cyber Legislation in the  ESCWA Region”.8    The objectives of the workshop were:      To meet with cyber legislation experts and present the June 2007 study entitled  “Models for Cyber Legislation in ESCWA member Countries” for their review and  comments.    To create a core network of experts and institutions that would be involved in the  continuous development, improvement and implementation of cyber legislation in  the ESCWA region.     The workshop was attended by representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon,  Palestine, Syrian Arab Republic, The Kingdom of Bahrain, The Royal Kingdom of Jordan, the  Sultanate of Oman, Yemen and ESCWA.    The meeting covered two other activities:    1. The presentation and discussion of a template that aimed at helping with the   development of an implementation strategy for cyber legislation in the region. (This  is discussed in section ‎3.4).     2. The presentation of two case studies by representatives from Syria and Bahrain   where the template was implemented. These helped highlight the applicability of the  template at the country level as well as the relevance of the study’s guidelines and  recommendations.      5.7 2008 (December): Workshop on Cyber Legislation and Templates     During 15-16 December 2008 in Beirut, Lebanon, ESCWA followed up with an event related  to the meeting of regional experts.

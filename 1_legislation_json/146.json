(2) This Chapter contains all the general principles of criminal responsibility that apply to any offence,  irrespective of how the offence is created.   Application  11.—(1) This Chapter applies to all offences against this Decree.    (2) All courts in criminal proceedings or trials shall apply the provisions of this Decree in relation to offences  under other laws to the fullest extent possible.   (3) Nothing in this Decree shall affect the validity of any proceeding taken in relation to any offence under  any law that is not framed or expressed in accordance with the provisions of this Decree.  Application of provisions relating to intoxication  12.—(1) Section 16(6) and (7) and Division 2 of Part 6 apply to all offences.    (2) for the purpose of interpreting the provisions stated in sub-section (1) in connection with an offence,  the other provisions of this Chapter may be considered, whether or not those other provisions apply to the offence  concerned.  PART 5 — GENERAL ELEMENTS of AN offENCE  Division 1 — General  Elements  13.—(1) An offence consists of physical elements and fault elements.    (2) However, the law that creates the offence may provide that there is no fault element for one or more physical  elements.   (3) The law that creates the offence may provide different fault elements for different physical elements.   Establishing guilt in respect of offences  14. In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved -   (a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to  establishing guilt;   (b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements  for the physical element.   Division 2 — Physical Elements of an Offence  Physical elements  15.—(1) A physical element of an offence may be—   (a) conduct; or  (b) a result of conduct; or  (c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs.     1042  (2) In this Decree—  “conduct” means an act, or an omission to perform an act or a state of affairs; “engage in conduct” means—  (a) do an act; or  (b) omit to perform an act.   Voluntariness  16.—(1) Conduct can only be a physical element if it is voluntary.    (2) Conduct is only voluntary if it is a product of the will of the person whose conduct it is.    (3) The following are examples of conduct that is not voluntary—  (a) a spasm, convulsion or other unwilled bodily movement;  (b) an act performed during sleep or unconsciousness;  (c) an act performed during impaired consciousness depriving the person of the will to act.    (4) An omission to perform an act is only voluntary if the act omitted is one which the person is capable of  performing.    (5) If the conduct constituting an offence consists only of a state of affairs, the state of affairs is only voluntary  if it is one over which the person is capable of exercising control.    (6) Evidence of self induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining whether conduct is voluntary.    (7) Intoxication is self induced unless it came about—  (a) involuntarily; or  (b) as a result of fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress or   force.   Omissions  17. An omission to perform an act can only be a physical element if—  (a) the law creating the offence makes it so; or (b) the law creating the offence impliedly provides that the offence is committed by an omission to   perform an act that by law there is a duty to perform.  Division 3 — Fault Elements of an Offence Fault elements   18.—(1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or  negligence.    (2) Sub-section (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements  for a physical element of that offence.   Intention  19.—(1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.    (2) A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.   (3) A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events.   Knowledge  20. A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the  ordinary course of events.   Recklessness  21.—(1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if—  (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and     1043 (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.    (2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if— (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and  (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.     (3)  The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.    (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or  recklessness will satisfy that fault element.   Negligence  22. A person is negligent with respect to a physical element of an offence if his or her conduct involves—  (a) such a great falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the  circumstances; and   (b) such a high risk that the physical element exists or will exist—  that the conduct merits criminal punishment for the offence.   Offences that do not specify fault elements  23. —(1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists  only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element.   (2) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists of a  circumstance or a result, recklessness is the fault element for that physical element.   Division 4 — Cases where fault elements are not required Strict liability   24.—(1) If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of strict liability— (a) there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and  (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 35 is available.    (2) If a law that creates an offence provides that strict liability applies to a particular physical element of the  offence—  (a) there are no fault elements for that physical element; and  (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 35 is available in relation to that physical element.    (3) The existence of strict liability does not prevent an offender from raising any other defence that is applicable  to the offence for which he or she is charged.  Absolute liability  25.—(1) If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of absolute liability—  (a) there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and  (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 35 is unavailable.    (2) If a law that creates an offence provides that absolute liability applies to a particular physical element of  the offence:   (a) there are no fault elements for that physical element; and  (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 35 is unavailable in relation to that physical element.    (3) The existence of absolute liability does not prevent an offender from raising any defence that is applicable  to the offence for which he or she is charged.    1044 PART 6 — CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THERE IS No CRIMINAL RESPoNSIBILITY  Division 1 — Circumstances Involving Lack of Capacity Children under 10 years   26. A child under 10 years old is not criminally responsible for an offence.   Children over 10 years but under 14 years  27.—(1) A child aged 10 years or more but under 14 years old can only be criminally responsible for an offence  if the child knows that his or her conduct is wrong.    (2) The question whether a child knows that his or her conduct is wrong is one of fact. The burden of proving  this is on the prosecution.   Mental impairment  28.—(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if, at the time of carrying out the conduct  constituting the offence, the person was suffering from a mental impairment that had the effect that—  (a) the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct; or  (b) the person did not know that the conduct was wrong (that is, the person could not reason with a   moderate degree of sense and composure about whether the conduct, as perceived by reasonable  people, was wrong); or   (c) the person was unable to control the conduct.    (2) The question whether the person was suffering from a mental impairment is one of fact.    (3) A person is presumed not to have been suffering from such a mental impairment. The presumption is  only displaced if it is proved on the balance of probabilities (by the prosecution or the defence) that the person was  suffering from such a mental impairment.    (4) The prosecution can only rely on this section if the court gives leave.    (5) The court must return a special verdict that a person is not guilty of an offence because of mental impairment  if and only if it is satisfied that the person is not criminally responsible for the offence only because of a mental  impairment.    (6) A person cannot rely on a mental impairment to deny voluntariness or the existence of a fault element but  may rely on this section to deny criminal responsibility.     (7)  If  the court  is  satisfied  that  a person carried out conduct as a  result of  a delusion caused by a mental  impairment, the delusion cannot otherwise be relied on as a defence.    (8) In this section— “mental impairment” includes senility, intellectual disability, mental illness, brain damage and severe   personality disorder.     (9)  The reference in sub-section (8) to mental illness is a reference to an underlying pathological infirmity of  the mind (whether of long or short duration and whether permanent or temporary), but does not include a condition  that results from the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli.    (10) A condition that results from the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli may be  evidence of a mental illness if it involves some abnormality and is prone to recur.  Division 2 — Intoxication  Definition—self induced intoxication  29. for the purposes of this Chapter, intoxication is self induced unless it came about—  (a) involuntarily; or  (b) as a result of fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress or   force.     1045 Intoxication (offences involving basic intent)   30.—(1) Evidence of self induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining whether a fault element  of basic intent existed.    (2) A fault element of basic intent is a fault element of intention for a physical element that consists only of  conduct.   (3) This section does not prevent evidence of self induced intoxication being taken into consideration in  determining whether conduct was accidental.    (4) This section does not prevent evidence of self induced intoxication being taken into consideration in  determining whether a person had a mistaken belief about facts if the person had considered whether or not the facts  existed.    (5) A person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if— (a) he or she had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in circumstances   surrounding that occasion; and  (b) he or she honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion   were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.   Intoxication (negligence as fault element)  31.— (1) If negligence is a fault element for a particular physical element of an offence, in determining whether  that fault element existed in relation to a person who is intoxicated, regard must be had to the standard of a reasonable  person who is not intoxicated.    (2) However, if intoxication is not self induced, regard must be had to the standard of a reasonable person  intoxicated to the same extent as the person concerned.   Intoxication (relevance to defences)  32. — (1) If any part of a defence is based on actual knowledge or belief, evidence of intoxication may be  considered in determining whether that knowledge or belief existed.    (2) If any part of a defence is based on reasonable belief, in determining whether that reasonable belief existed,  regard must be had to the standard of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated.    (3) If a person’s intoxication is not self induced, in determining whether any part of a defence based on  reasonable belief exists, regard must be had to the standard of a reasonable person intoxicated to the same extent as  the person concerned.    (4) If, in relation to an offence— (a) each physical element has a fault element of basic intent; and  (b) any part of a defence is based on actual knowledge or belief—  evidence of self induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining whether that knowledge  or belief existed.

(2) In determining whether a person was under a mistaken belief about facts, or was ignorant of the facts, the  court may consider whether the mistaken belief or ignorance was reasonable in the circumstances.   Mistake of fact (strict liability)  35.—(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence that has a physical element for which there is  no fault element if—  (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the physical element, the person considered whether  or not facts existed, and is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and   (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted an offence.    (2) A person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if— (a) he or she had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances   surrounding that occasion; and  (b) he or she honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion   were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

Claim of right  38.—(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence that has a physical element relating to property  if—  (a) at the time of the conduct constituting the offence, the person is under a mistaken belief about a  proprietary or possessory right; and   (b) the existence of that right would negate a fault element for any physical element of the offence.    (2) A person is not criminally responsible for any other offence arising necessarily out of the exercise of the  proprietary or possessory right that he or she mistakenly believes to exist.    (3) This section does not negate criminal responsibility for an offence relating to the use of force against a  person.   Division 4 — Circumstances involving external factors Intervening conduct or event   39.

Duress  40.—(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting  the offence under duress.    (2) A person carries out conduct under duress if and only if he or she reasonably believes that - (a) a threat to cause death or serious harm has been made that will be carried out unless an offence is   committed; and  (b) there is no reasonable way that the threat can be rendered ineffective; and  (c) the conduct is a reasonable response to the threat.

References in Acts to offences  50.—(1) A reference in a law (including this Decree) to an offence is deemed to include an offence against  section 44 (attempt), 48 (incitement) or 49 (conspiracy) of this Decree that relates to such an offence.    (2) Sub-section (1) does not apply if a law is expressly or impliedly to the contrary effect.   PART 8 — CoRPoRATE CRIMINAL RESPoNSIBILITY  General principles  51.—(1) This Decree applies to bodies corporate in the same way as it applies to individuals. It so applies with  such modifications as are set out in this Part, and with such other modifications as are made necessary by the fact  that criminal liability is being imposed on bodies corporate rather than individuals.    (2) A body corporate may be found guilty of any offence, including one punishable by imprisonment.   Physical elements   52.  If a physical element of an offence is committed by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting  within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the  physical element must also be attributed to the body corporate.     1051 Fault elements other than negligence   53.—(1) If intention, knowledge or recklessness is a fault element in relation to a physical element of an  offence, that fault element must be attributed to a body corporate that expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised or  permitted the commission of the offence.    (2) The means by which such an authorisation or permission may be established include— (a) proving that the body corporate’s board of directors intentionally, knowingly or recklessly carried out   the relevant conduct, or expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised or permitted the commission of the  offence; or   (b) proving that a high managerial agent of the body corporate intentionally, knowingly or recklessly  engaged in the relevant conduct, or expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised or permitted the  commission of the offence; or   (c) proving that a corporate culture existed within the body corporate that directed, encouraged, tolerated  or led to non compliance with the relevant provision; or   (d) proving that the body corporate failed to create and maintain a corporate culture that required  compliance with the relevant provision.    (3) Sub-section (2)(b) does not apply if the body corporate proves that it exercised due diligence to prevent  the conduct, or the authorisation or permission.    (4) factors relevant to the application of sub-section (2)(c) or (d) include— (a) whether authority to commit an offence of the same or a similar character had been given by a high   managerial agent of the body corporate; and  (b)  whether the employee, agent or officer of the body corporate who committed the offence believed   on reasonable grounds, or entertained a reasonable expectation, that a high managerial agent of the  body corporate would have authorised or permitted the commission of the offence.    (5) If recklessness is not a fault element in relation to a physical element of an offence, sub-section (2) does not  enable the fault element to be proved by proving that the board of directors, or a high managerial agent, of the body  corporate recklessly engaged in the conduct or recklessly authorised or permitted the commission of the offence.    (6) In this section— “board of directors” means the body (by whatever name called) exercising the executive authority of the   body corporate.  “corporate culture” means an attitude, policy, rule, course of conduct or practice existing within the body   corporate generally or in the part of the body corporate in which the relevant activities takes place.  “high managerial agent” means an employee, agent or officer of the body corporate with duties of such   responsibility that his or her conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the body corporate’s  policy.   Negligence  54.—(1) The test of negligence for a body corporate is that set out in section 22.    (2) If— (a) negligence is a fault element in relation to a physical element of an offence; and  (b)  no individual employee, agent or officer of the body corporate has that fault element—  that fault element may exist on the part of the body corporate if the body corporate’s conduct is  negligent when viewed as a whole (that is, by aggregating the conduct of any number of its employees,  agents or officers).    (3) Negligence may be evidenced by the fact that the prohibited conduct was substantially attributable to— (a) inadequate corporate management, control or supervision of the conduct of one or more of its   employees, agents or officers; or     1052 (b) failure to provide adequate systems for conveying relevant information to relevant persons in the   body corporate.   Mistake of fact (strict liability)  55.—(1) A body corporate can only rely on section 35 (mistake of fact (strict liability)) in respect of conduct  that would, apart from this section, constitute an offence on its part if—  (a)  the employee, agent or officer of the body corporate who carried out the conduct was under a mistaken  but reasonable belief about facts that, had they existed, would have meant that the conduct would not  have constituted an offence; and   (b) the body corporate proves that it exercised due diligence to prevent the conduct.    (2) A failure to exercise due diligence may be evidenced by the fact that the prohibited conduct was substantially  attributable to—  (a) inadequate corporate management, control or supervision of the conduct of one or more of its  employees, agents or officers; or   (b) failure to provide adequate systems for conveying relevant information to relevant persons in the  body corporate.   Intervening conduct or event  56. A body corporate cannot rely on section 39 (intervening conduct or event) in respect of a physical element  of an offence brought about by another person  if  the other person  is an employee, agent or officer of  the body  corporate.   PART 9 — PRoof of CRIMINAL RESPoNSIBILITY  Legal burden of proof—prosecution  57.—(1) The prosecution bears a legal burden of proving every element of an offence relevant to the guilt of  the person charged.    (2) The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has  discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant.    (3) In this Decree— “legal burden” , in relation to a matter, means the burden of proving the existence of the matter.   Standard of proof—prosecution  58.—(1) A legal burden of proof on the prosecution must be discharged beyond reasonable doubt.     (2) Sub-section (1) does not apply if the law creating the offence specifies a different standard of proof.   Evidential burden of proof—defence  59.—(1) Subject to section 60, a burden of proof that a law imposes on a defendant is an evidential burden  only.    (2) A defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of this Decree (other  than section 28) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.     (3)  A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided  by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.     (4)  The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the  offence.     (5)  The defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge  the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court.    (6) The question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law.     1053  (7) In this Decree—  “evidential burden”, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that  suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.   Legal burden of proof—defence  60. A burden of proof that a law imposes on the defendant is a legal burden if and only if the law  expressly—  (a)  specifies that the burden of proof in relation to the matter in question is a legal burden; or  (b) requires the defendant to prove the matter; or  (c) creates a presumption that the matter exists unless the contrary is proved.   Standard of proof—defence  61. A legal burden of proof on the defendant must be discharged on the balance of probabilities.   Use of averments  62. A law that allows the prosecution to make an averment is taken not to allow the prosecution—  (a) to aver any fault element of an offence; or  (b) to make an averment in prosecuting for an offence that is directly punishable by imprisonment.

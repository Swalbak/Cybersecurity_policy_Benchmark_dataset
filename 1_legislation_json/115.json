Is there a critical infrastructure  protection (CIP) strategy or plan in  place?  6 Cyprus does not have a critical infrastructure protection strategy or plan in place.  The critical infrastructure protection in general is under the responsibility of the  Ministry of Interior and Civil Defence. Critical information  infrastructure protection is under the responsibility of the Office of the Commissioner  of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation (OCECPR). < sy> The work under the critical information infrastructure protection project is in  progress as of August 2014.  The academic sector, particularly the KIOS Research Centre for Intelligent System  and Networks at the University of Cyprus, has published  numerous research papers on Cypriot critical infrastructure.  4. Is there legislation/policy that  requires the establishment of a  written information security plan?  6 There is no legislation or policy in place in Cyprus that requires the establishment of  a written information security plan.  5. Is there legislation/policy that  requires an inventory of “systems”  and the classification of data?  Cyprus classifies sensitive information against a four-tiered classification system,  however, there is no legislation or policy requiring the classification of particular data.  6. Is there legislation/policy that  requires security practices/ requirements to be mapped  to risk levels?  6 Cyprus does not map specific security practices or requirements to risk levels.  7. Is there legislation/policy that  requires (at least) an annual  cybersecurity audit?  6 There is no legislation or policy in place in Cyprus that requires (at least) an annual  cybersecurity audit.  8.

The introduction of such a policy may occur in light of action in the Cybersecurity  Strategy of Cyprus to introduce a national security policy.  10. Is there legislation/policy that  requires mandatory reporting of  cybersecurity incidents?  4 Cyprus has passed the Subsidiary Administrative Act Number 371/2013 that requires  mandatory reporting of cybersecurity incidents.  11. Does legislation/policy include an  appropriate definition for “critical  infrastructure protection” (CIP)?  6 Cypriot legislation does not have an appropriate definition for “critical infrastructure  protection”.  COUNTRY: CYPRUS   Cyprus adopted a national cybersecurity strategy in  2013. It includes a commitment to update key elements  of the legal framework for cybersecurity. Cyprus also  is working toward the establishment of a national  computer emergency response team (CERT), which is   expected to be operational in 2015. The country has also  taken an interest in sector-specific approaches to the  management of cybersecurity, with a potential focus on  the energy and financial services sectors.

Are requirements for public  and private procurement of  cybersecurity solutions based  on international accreditation or  certification schemes, without  additional local requirements?  Not  applicable  There are no specific cybersecurity standards or certification requirements for  procurement in Cyprus, as of August 2014.  OPERATIONAL ENTITIES  1. Is there a national computer  emergency response team (CERT)  or computer security incident  response team (CSIRT)?  6 Cyprus does not have an operational national CERT in place.   However, the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Finance is  currently financing a project that will enable a government CERT to become fully  functional by early 2015. The Cybersecurity Strategy provides for further work in  evaluating a national CERT.  2. What year was the computer  emergency response team (CERT)  established?  –  3. Is there a national competent  authority for network and  information security (NIS)?  There is no clear national competent authority for network and information security  in Cyprus.  The Office of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation  (OCECPR) is the regulatory authority for postal and electronic  communications and, according to the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security, is the agency responsible for the implementation of a national  CERT. < to-enisa> The OCECPR does not have a national responsibility for network and  information security.  The current structure and the wider scope of the NIS authority will be evaluated  under a specific action of the cybersecurity strategy in 2015.  4. Is there an incident reporting  platform for collecting  cybersecurity incident data?  6 As of August 2014, there is not a clear incident reporting platform for the collection  of cybersecurity incident data in Cyprus.  The lack of a CERT or similar authority means cybersecurity incident data is not  centrally logged.  5. Are national cybersecurity exercises  conducted?

Is there a national incident  management structure (NIMS)  for responding to cybersecurity  incidents?  6 There is not a clear national incident management structure (NIMS) for responding to  cybersecurity incidents in Cyprus.  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  1. Is there a defined public-private  partnership for cybersecurity?  The biennial CYpBER conference provides a platform for Cyprus  government and private sector representatives to liaise and exchange ideas relating  to cybersecurity concerns, particularly those effecting the oil and gas industry. The  conference produces significant, and publicly available, documentation covering  topics addressed by the representatives.  The national Cyber Security Strategy provides for a framework of a public-private  partnership for cybersecurity, and also requires that any project should consider  and follow the general policy of the public-private partnership framework of the  government. Currently there is public-private cooperation in the fields of awareness  for cybersecurity and in the creation of a cybercrime centre of excellence.  2. Is industry organised (i.e. business  or industry cybersecurity councils)?  6 Apart from the biennial CYpBER conference , there is no  significant industry-led platform for cybersecurity in Cyprus.  3. Are new public-private partnerships  in planning or underway (if so,  which focus area)?  6 There are no new public-private partnerships being planned in Cyprus.

Is there a joint public-private sector  plan that addresses cybersecurity?  Forums such as the CYpBER conference indicate that the energy  and oil sector remains a significant area of cooperation between the sector and  government. However no sector-specific plans have been published.  2. Have sector-specific security  priorities been defined?  6 There has been some discussion of cybersecurity risks in the energy sector, which  appears to be a priority area for Cyprus.

EDUCATION  1. Is there an education strategy to  enhance cybersecurity knowledge  and increase cybersecurity  awareness of the public from a  young age?  6 Cyprus does not have a cybersecurity education program in place.

(12) Capital murder shall be treated as a distinct offence from non  capital murder for the purpose of any appeal against conviction;  otherwise capital murder shall not be treated as a distinct  offence from non-capital murder for any other purpose.     70 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (13) Where on an appeal against conviction of capital murder the   Court substitutes a verdict of guilty of non-capital murder for  the verdict of guilty of capital murder, the Court shall  nevertheless determine whether the sentence of death is  warranted under subsection (4) and shall confirm the sentence if  it is found to be so warranted.   (14) In this section—   “judicial officer” means—   (a) a judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal or  the High Court, the master in chambers or a person  performing the functions of a judge of the Supreme Court,  or the Court of Appeal or the High Court or of the master  in chambers;   (b) the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court or the Registrar  of the Court of Appeal or High Court or any person  performing the functions of the Chief Registrar or  Registrar;   (c) a magistrate or a person performing the functions of a  magistrate;   (d) a person employed in the Office of the Director of Public  Prosecutions or engaged to carry out functions on behalf  of the Director of Public Prosecutions;   (e) a justice of the peace in the carrying out of his or her  duties.   87.

(3) A person who is convicted of a non-capital murder may be  sentenced to death if—   (a) he or she has previously been convicted of another  murder committed on a different occasion;     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 71  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) he or she has been convicted of another murder   committed on the same occasion as the one with which he  or she is charged.   (4) A person referred to in subsection (3) shall not, by virtue of that  subsection, be sentenced to death by reason of a previous  conviction for murder unless—   (a) at least 7 days before the trial, notice is given to him or  her that it is intended to prove the previous conviction;  and   (b) before he or she is sentenced, his or her previous  conviction for murder is admitted by him or her, or is  found to be proven by the trial judge.   88.

DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY   (1) If a person kills or is a party to the killing of another person, he  or she shall not be convicted of murder if he or she was  suffering from such mental disorder (whether arising from a  condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any  inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially     72 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     impaired his or her mental responsibility for his or her acts in  doing or being a party to the killing.   (2) On a charge of murder, it is for the defence to prove that the  person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be  convicted of murder.   (3) A person who, but for this section would be liable to be  convicted of murder, is liable to be convicted of manslaughter.   (4) The fact that one party to a killing is by virtue of this section  not liable to be convicted of murder shall not affect the question  whether the killing amounted to murder in the case of any other  party to the killing.   91. PROVOCATION   If on a charge of murder there is evidence on which the jury can find  that the person charged was provoked (whether by things done or by  things said or by both) to lose his or her self -control, the question  whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable person do  as he or she did shall be left to be determined by the jury; and in  determining the question the jury shall take into account everything  both done and said according to the effect which in their opinion, it  would have on a reasonable person.   92.

(3) It is no defence to a charge on indictment under subsection (1)  that the death was caused by the negligence of others as well as  of the accused; if the death is caused by the act or default of  several persons they all commit manslaughter but the  negligence imputed to the accused must have been a substantial  cause of the death.   (4) If the negligent act of the accused was a substantial cause of  death, the fact that the deceased was himself or herself  negligent and so contributed to the accident or other  circumstances by which the death occurred does not afford a  defence to a charge under subsection (1).   93.

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1) “suicide pact” means a  common agreement between 2 or more persons having for its  object the death of all of them, whether or not each of them is to  take his or her own life, but nothing done by a person who  enters into a suicide pact is to be treated as done by him or her  in pursuance of the pact unless it is done while he or she has the  settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact.   (3) A person acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between himself  or herself and another person to kill that other person or be a  party to the killing of that other person commits the offence of  manslaughter.

ORDER ON CONVICTION FOR RESTORATION OF PROPERTY  TO OR FOR OWNER   (1) When a person is prosecuted on a charge for an offence of  which the unlawful acquisition of the property by him or her is  an element, and he or she is convicted of the offence, the Court  may order that the property be restored to the owner or his or  her representative.   (2) Any such order has the effect of a judgment and is binding on  the offender and any person claiming through him or her as  determining the ownership of the property, but as regards any  other person the order has the effect only of changing the     312 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     possession of the property and does not affect any right of  property or right of action.   (3) In any such case, the Court may order that the personal property  which is found in the possession of the offender and which  appears to the Court to have been derived directly or indirectly,  from unlawful acquisition of property, shall be delivered to any  person who appears to the Court to be entitled to the property so  unlawfully acquired.   (4) This section does not apply to a valuable security, if it appears  that the security has been paid or discharged in good faith by  the person liable for the payment thereof, or, in the case of a  negotiable instrument, that it has been taken or received by  transfer or delivery in good faith by some person for a valuable  consideration and without any reasonable cause to suspect that  it has been unlawfully acquired.   643. POWER TO ORDER PAYMENT OUT OF MONEY TAKEN FROM  ACCUSED   When an accused person has been convicted of stealing or unlawfully  obtaining any property, and it appears to the Court from the evidence  that he or she sold such property or part of it to any person who had  no knowledge that it was stolen or unlawfully obtained, the Court  may, where money has been taken from the accused on his or her  arrest, on the application of the purchaser and on restitution of the  property to its owner, order that out of the money taken from the  accused, if it belongs to him or her, that a sum not more than the  proceeds of the sale be paid to such purchaser.   644. POWER TO ORDER RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY ALTHOUGH  NO CONVICTION   The Court may also, if it sees fit, award restitution of the property  taken from the prosecutor, or any witness for the prosecution, or other  person, as a result of the commission of such offence, although the  person charged is not convicted, if the jury declares, as it may do, or  where the offender is tried without a jury, if it is proved to the  satisfaction of the Court by whom he or she is tried that such property  belongs to the prosecutor or witness or the other person, and that he  or she was unlawfully deprived of it through such offence.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 313  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     645. PROVISIONS AS TO RESTITUTION ADDITIONAL TO OTHER   ENACTMENTS   The provisions of this Code governing the restitution of property shall  be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any  enactment governing such restitution.   646. ORDER DENYING ACCESS TO INFORMATION USED TO  OBTAIN ANY WARRANT   (1) A judge or magistrate may, on application made at the time of  issuing a warrant under this Code or any other enactment or at  any time thereafter, make an order prohibiting access to and the  disclosure of any information relating to the warrant on the  ground that—   (a) the ends of justice would be subverted by the disclosure  for one of the reasons referred to in subsection (2) or the  information might be used for an improper purpose; and   (b) the ground referred to in paragraph (a) outweighs in  importance the access to the information.   (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), an order may be made  under subsection (1) on the ground that the ends of justice  would be subverted by the disclosure—   (a) if disclosure of the information would-   (i) compromise the identity of a confidential informant,   (ii) compromise the nature and extent of an ongoing  investigation,   (iii) endanger a person engaged in particular  intelligence-gathering techniques and thereby  prejudice future investigations in which similar  techniques would be used, or   (iv) prejudice the interests of an innocent person; and   (b) for any other sufficient reason.   (3) Where an order is made under subsection (1), all documents  relating to the application shall, subject to any terms and  conditions that the judge or magistrate considers desirable in  the circumstances, including, without limiting the generality of  the foregoing, any term or condition concerning the duration of     314 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     the prohibition, partial disclosure of a document, deletion of  any information or the occurrence of a condition, be placed in a  packet and sealed by the judge or magistrate immediately on  determination of the application, and that packet shall be kept in  the custody of the Court in a place to which the public has no  access or in any other place that the judge or magistrate may  authorize and shall not be dealt with except in accordance with  the terms and conditions specified in the order or as varied  under subsection (4).   (4) An application to terminate the order or vary any of its terms  and conditions may be made to the judge or magistrate who  made the order or a judge of the Court before which any  proceedings arising out of the investigation in relation to which  the warrant was obtained may be held.

PART 4  SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS     SUB-PART A   Trial of Summary Offences   654. DEFINITION OF “COURT”   In this Sub-Part unless the context otherwise requires “Court” means  a district court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in respect of summary  offences.        Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 317  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Jurisdiction of District Courts   655. JURISDICTION GENERALLY   For the purpose of conferring jurisdiction on a Court, every summary  offence shall be deemed to have occurred either in the district in  which the offence actually was committed or occurred or in any  district in which the offender or person complained against may be  residing or found.   656. JURISDICTION IN RECEIVING OR UNLAWFUL POSSESSION   (1) The receiver of property obtained or appropriated contrary to  law is liable to be proceeded against and convicted and  punished in any magisterial district within this State in which he  or she has any such property in his or her possession, or in the  magisterial district in which he or she actually received the  property.   (2) Subsection (1) equally applies in cases of unlawful possession.   657. BONA FIDE QUESTION OF TITLE TO LAND   If, on the hearing of any complaint, the magistrate is of the opinion  that a bona fide question of title to land, or to any interest in land or  accruing from land, is raised between the parties, he or she shall  dismiss such complaint, and may make such order with respect to  costs as he or she thinks fit.   658. SAVING   Nothing in this Code shall be construed to abolish or limit the  jurisdiction of a magistrate or justice of the peace in respect of  offences created by any other enactment and not specified in this  Code.        318 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Practice and Procedure   659. APPLICATION OF OTHER PROCEDURE PROVISIONS TO  COMPLAINTS   (1) The provisions of Sub Part C relating to indictments, shall, so  far as they are appropriate, apply to complaints preferred  against offenders upon their trial before magistrates, in order to  secure their conviction summarily, whether for an indictable  offence, or not, if there is no express provision otherwise  applicable to such complaint.   (2) The provisions of this Code and any other enactment, regulating  any criminal proceedings in cases or matters not summary, shall  apply when necessary or if required, to all summary  proceedings, where there is no express provisions in this Code  or any other enactment applicable to such proceedings, except  where it appears from the context that such provisions are not  applicable to summary proceedings.   660. TRANSFER CASE TO DISTRICT COURT HAVING JURISDICTION   (1) If, upon the hearing of any complaint, it appears that the cause  of complaint arose outside the jurisdiction of the court before  which such compliant is brought, the magistrate may, on being  satisfied that the court has no jurisdiction, direct the case to be  transferred to the court having jurisdiction where the cause of  complaint arose.   (2) Where the defendant is in custody and the magistrate thinks it  expedient that the defendant should continue to be in custody  or, if he or she is not in custody, that he or she should be placed  in custody, the magistrate shall direct that the defendant be  taken by a police officer before the magistrate having  jurisdiction where the cause of complaint arose.   (3) The magistrate shall issue a warrant for that purpose to the  police officer, and deliver to him or her the complaint and  recognizances, if any taken by him or her, to be delivered to the  magistrate before whom the defendant is to be brought, and the  complaint and recognizances, if any, shall be treated to all     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 319  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     intents and purposes as if they had been taken by that  magistrate.   (4) Where the magistrate makes no order that the defendant should  continue to be kept, or should be placed in custody, he or she  shall transfer the case in accordance with the provisions of  subsection (3) and inform the accused accordingly.

(2) Where an offence is created by more than one section of one or  more enactments, it shall only be necessary to specify or refer  to the leading section of such enactments or one of the leading  sections.   (3) If there is no such reference, the Court may amend the  complaint, or cause it to be amended accordingly, and a mistake  or omission as to such reference shall not invalidate the  proceedings, but may be corrected or supplied in any document  or proceedings at any time.   668. SPECIFYING OR NEGATIVING EXCEPTION, ETC.,  UNNECESSARY   (1) A defendant may be required to prove any exception,  exemption, condition, excuse or qualification, whether or not it  is relative to the description of the offence in the enactment  creating the offence.

PERIOD OF LIMITATION   (1) Where no time is prescribed for making a complaint with  respect to any summary offence by the enactment relating to  such offence, the complaint—   (a) shall be made within 6 months from the time when the  matter of the complaint arose; or     322 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) if it arose upon the high seas shall be made within the 6   months after the arrival of the ship or vessel in this State;  or   (c) in the case of a continuous contravention, shall be made  within 6 months, from the last date of such contravention  and if it shall be competent in such case in any  prosecution to include the entire period during which the  contravention has occurred.

WARRANT FOR WITNESS IN FIRST INSTANCE, WHEN   If the magistrate is satisfied by evidence upon oath that any person  likely to give material evidence whether for the complainant or for  the defendant, will not attend to give evidence without being  compelled to do so, he or she may issue a warrant to compel the  attendance of that person.   684. BRINGING UP ARRESTED WITNESS   If the hearing of the case for which his or her evidence is required is  fixed for a time which is more than 72 hours after the arrest, a witness  arrested under a warrant, except for disobedience to a summons  issued under section 682, shall be taken before a magistrate, and the  magistrate may on his or her furnishing security by recognizance, to  the satisfaction of the magistrate, for his or her appearance at the  hearing, order him or her to be released from custody, or shall, on his  or her failing to furnish such security, order him or her to be detained  to appear at the hearing.   685.

(2) If the case is adjourned, the Court may either, by warrant,  commit the defendant in the meantime to a correctional facility,  or to such safe custody as the Court thinks fit, or discharge him  or her, upon his or her entering into a recognizance, with or  without a surety or sureties, as condition for his or her  appearance at the time and place to which the hearing is  adjourned.

(3) If the defendant is later arrested on a warrant, he or she shall be  brought before a magistrate who shall commit him or her, either  by warrant to a correctional facility or by verbal order to the  custody of the police officer who arrested him or her, or to such  safe custody as he or she thinks fit, and order him or her to be  brought before the Court at such time as the Court may  determine.

(2) Where 2 or more complaints are made by one or more parties  against another party or other parties and such complaints refer  to the same matter, such complaints may, if the Court thinks fit,  be heard and determined at one and the same time if each  defendant is informed of his or her right to have the complaints  taken separately and consents to their being taken together.   694. OBJECTIONS TO COMPLAINTS   The defendant may, prior to pleading to the complaint, state any  objections to the competency or relevancy of the complaint or  proceedings, and no such objections shall be allowed later in the  course of the hearing of the case, unless with the leave of the Court  and with cause shown.   695.

DEFECTS, VARIANCES, ETC., WHEN IMMATERIAL   (1) If, any objection is made on account of any defect or variance  in a complaint or other proceeding, or on account of any  omission or mistake or variance in the drawing up of a  conviction or order, minute or memorandum or other  proceeding, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court, that  sufficient evidence given before a district court, making such  order to have authorised the making or drawing or of any other  proceeding free from such mistake or variance, the Court shall  amend such complaint or such conviction, or order, minute or  memorandum, or other proceeding, and proceed as if no such  defect, omission or mistake or variance had existed.   (2) Subject to the provisions of section 741(2), nothing in this  section shall affect the provisions of section 733.   745. AMENDMENT OF RECOGNIZANCE   The Court may, if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interests of  justice, amend any recognizance, provided it has been entered into in  due time.     348 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     746. PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS, OR OTHER THINGS   (1) The Court may order the production of any document, exhibit,  or other thing connected with the proceedings, the production of  which appears to it necessary for the determination of the  appeal.   (2) A proper officer shall cause all writings and other articles  exhibited by any witnesses, or any of them, to be inventoried  and labelled, or otherwise marked, so that the same may be  identified at a trial.   (3) All exhibits shall, be taken charge of by a proper officer, and  shall be produced by him or her at a trial.   747. APPEAL TO BE DETERMINED ON RECORD   Subject to the provisions of sections 749, 750 and 751, an appeal  shall generally, and especially in the case of a dismissal, be heard and  determined only on the record, transmitted to the Court.   748. NOTICE OF APPLICATION TO ADDUCE EVIDENCE AT HEARING   A party who intends to apply at the hearing of the appeal for evidence  or further evidence to be adduced at the hearing shall give written  notice of the application and the reasons in support of the application  to the other parties to the appeal, and shall also file the application  with the Registrar before the case is to be heard.   749. EVIDENCE BY AFFIDAVIT   Where further evidence is ordered, the Court may, in appropriate  circumstances, also order that such evidence be given by affidavit.   750. EXAMINATION OF WITNESS IN APPEAL   (1) A witness may be examined at the hearing of an appeal, even  though he or she was not examined at the original hearing if the  Court is satisfied as to any of the following matters—   (a) that he or she was served with a summons at the original  hearing, and was prevented from appearing due to some  unavoidable cause;     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 349  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) that he or she was prevented from appearing in person by   reason of his or her absence from the State;   (c) that he or she was actually offered for examination, but  the district court improperly refused to examine him or  her.   (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1), only those  witnesses examined at the original hearing shall be examined at  the hearing of an appeal, unless the Court is satisfied that  without the further evidence of other witnesses, a miscarriage of  justice is likely to result.   751. PROCEEDINGS AS TO EVIDENCE ON APPEAL   (1) Where, in any proceedings, the Court considers it necessary that  fresh evidence or further evidence should be adduced, it may  either—   (a) re-examine any witness, who was a competent witness at  the trial, and who gave evidence at the original hearing;   (b) order any witness, who would have been a competent  witness at the trial to attend and be examined before the  Court, whether or not he or she was called as a witness at  the original hearing;   (c) receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness including  the appellant or respondent whether or not he or she was  called or examined at the original hearing, but no person  shall be called as a witness without his or her consent  where such consent is required by law;   (d) order the evidence to be adduced before the Court on a  day to be fixed;   (e) refer the case back to the magistrate to take the evidence,  and may in that case—   (i) direct the magistrate to adjudicate afresh after  taking the evidence and subject to such directions in  law, if any, as the Court may think fit to give, or   (ii) direct the magistrate after taking the evidence to  report specific findings of fact for the information  of the Court,     350 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     and on any such reference the case shall, so far as may be  practicable and necessary, be dealt with as if it were being  heard in the first instance;   (f) remit to any fit person to inquire and report in regard to  the facts and circumstances of any case under appeal, and  on considering such report may pronounce judgment.   (2) Any witness required under subsection (1)—   (a) shall be summoned or produced in the same manner;   (b) may be remunerated at the same rate; and   (c) shall suffer the same penalties and liabilities for non- attendance,   as are provided with respect to witnesses summoned to attend at  the hearing or trial of any case before the Court in the exercise  of its general civil jurisdiction.   (3) Where a case is referred back to a district court under  subsection (1)(e), the Court may direct the district court to re- summon the respective parties to the appeal and to re-hear and  determine the case referred to it without any further charges or  costs and, unless the Court otherwise directs, either party is  entitled, subject to the provisions of this Code, to appeal against  the decision or order of the district court on such re-hearing.   752. INADMISSIBLE GROUNDS OF APPEAL   No appeal shall be allowed on any of the following grounds—   (a) that the district court had no jurisdiction in the case unless  an objection to the jurisdiction of the district court had  been formally taken at any time during the proceedings of  the case and before the decision of the Court had been  given but if such objection had been so taken, and was  well founded, the Court may refer the case back to the  magistrate with such directions as it considers proper, or  may hear and determine the case upon the merits, and  may confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the  magistrate or may make such other order in the matter as  the Court thinks just, and may by such order exercise any  power which the magistrate against whose decision the  appeal is made might have exercised;     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 351  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) that inadmissible evidence has been admitted by the   district court, if there is sufficient admissible evidence to  sustain the decision;   (c) that admissible evidence has been rejected; but if the  Court considers the objection well founded, it shall  proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 751;   (d) that the case should not have been dealt with as a  summary offence;   (e) that the sentence, penalty or punishment is inadequate;   (f) that any question of value, compensation or costs has  been wrongly determined by the magistrate, unless in the  opinion of the Court his or her determination is not  altogether supported by the evidence nor justified in the  circumstances.   753. APPEALS TO BE DECIDED ON MERITS   (1) No conviction or order made in pursuance of any proceedings  for a summary conviction shall be quashed for any defect or  want of form.   (2) Every appeal shall be decided on its merits, and in all cases  where it appears that the merits of the case have been tried and  there is evidence to support the decision by the magistrate, the  Court shall confirm the decision and no conviction, order,  warrant, process or proceeding in connection with the decision,  shall be quashed, notwithstanding any objection concerning the  improper admission or rejection of any evidence.   (3) The Court may, in any case where there was improper  admission or rejection of evidence, amend the conviction,  order, warrant, process or proceeding if necessary, or give such  judgment or make such order as it considers the magistrate  should have given or made in the circumstances.   754. POWERS OF COURT ON APPEAL   (1) In giving judgment the Court may—   (a) confirm, vary or reverse the decision, either in whole or in  part;     352 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) refer or remit the case under the provisions of sections   751 and 752 or otherwise;   (c) make such other order for disposing of the case as justice  may require.   (2) The Court may, so far as may be necessary for doing complete  justice between the parties, review any order made by the  magistrate with respect to the case.   755. JUDGMENT ON APPEAL FINAL   Every judgment of the Court on appeal shall be final and conclusive.   756. POWER OF COURT AS TO COSTS   Subject to the provisions of this Sub-Part, the Court may make such  order as to the costs of any case, both in the district court and in  Court, as it may think just, and may order such costs to be paid  forthwith, and imprisonment on default in addition to any term of  imprisonment to which the person ordered to pay such costs may be  otherwise liable.   757. COSTS WHERE APPEAL ABANDONED OR WITHDRAWN   Where an appeal is abandoned or withdrawn, the Court may, on proof  of notice of appeal having been given to the person entitled to receive  such notice, order that the person be paid such costs as the Court may  think fit, although the appeal has not been prosecuted.   758. EXECUTION FOR APPEAL COSTS   (1) If payment of costs is not made, the person entitled to it may  apply to the district court for an order of execution as if the  judgment or order as to costs was a judgment given in the  district court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction.   (2) The magistrate may also, on application by or on behalf of the  person entitled to such costs, commit the person by whom it is  payable to a correctional facility for any term not exceeding 2  months, in addition to any term of imprisonment to which he or  she may be otherwise liable under the judgment in the case,     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 353  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     unless the amount of such costs and all unpaid costs and  charges of the execution if any, or otherwise, and the costs of  the commitment, if the magistrate thinks fit so to order, are  sooner paid.   759. DEFAULT OF APPEARANCE BY APPELLANT   (1) Where the appellant fails to appear before the Court and to  prosecute his or her appeal, the Registrar of the Court shall, not  later than 24 hours, transmit to the clerk of the Court from  which the case on appeal was brought, a certificate to that  effect, and the magistrate shall treat the recognizance as  forfeited and deal with it as such, or make such order as may be  just, with respect to the amount lodged by the appellant.   (2) Where the appellant has been released from custody but  remains or becomes liable to be kept in custody, the magistrate  shall forthwith issue a warrant for his or her arrest and  detention.   760. TRANSMISSION OF APPEAL JUDGMENT TO DISTRICT COURT   The Registrar of the Court shall, within 24 hours after the Court has  delivered its judgment, or so soon thereafter as may be practicable,  transmit a certificate of the judgment to the clerk of the district court  against whose decision the appeal is made and the clerk shall then  cause the judgment to be put into execution forthwith, in the same  manner as the orders of the district court are enforceable.   761. POWER OF MAGISTRATE TO ENFORCE APPEAL JUDGMENT   (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, after the Court has  delivered its judgment, the magistrate of the Court against  whose decision the appeal is made, shall have the same  jurisdiction and power to enforce any decision which has been  confirmed or varied by the Court, or any judgment which has  been pronounced by the Court, in the same manner in all  respects, as if such decision or judgment had been pronounced  by the magistrate.   (2) Where an order for the imprisonment of any person, or for the  payment of money and in default of payment for the     354 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     imprisonment of the person, is confirmed or varied, or made  originally on appeal, the pronouncement of the sentence shall  be a sufficient warrant without more for the arrest, detention  and commitment to a correctional facility of the person.   (3) The imprisonment of the person, if it has not already  commenced, shall commence from the day on which he or she  is in actual custody in the correctional facility where he or she  may have been ordered to be imprisoned.   (4) Where the person has been discharged from imprisonment on  giving the requisite security under section 733, he or she shall  be imprisoned for such further period as, together with the time  during which he or she may already have spent in the  correctional facility, may be equal to the period for which he or  she was ordered to be imprisoned.   762. PUBLICATION OF JUDGMENT REASONS   Where the Court has delivered a written judgment, the Registrar of  the Court shall forward to the Printery, a copy of the judgment to be  published in the Gazette, for the guidance of the district courts.      Case Stated by Magistrate   763. POWER OF MAGISTRATE TO STATE CASE   (1) After the hearing and determination of any complaint, the  magistrate may, in his or her discretion, on the application of  either party to such complaint or on his or her own motion, state  a case on any point of law arising in the case for the opinion of  the Court.   (2) The statement of facts in the case stated shall, for the purpose of  the determination of the case, be conclusive.   764. RECOGNIZANCE BY APPLICANT   If a case is stated on the application of a party, the party, (hereinafter  called the “appellant”), shall , at the time of making his or her  application enter into recognizance with one or more sureties  acknowledged before the magistrate or the clerk of the Court on     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 355  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     condition to appear and prosecute his or her appeal and to abide by  the judgment of the Court, as well as pay such costs as may be  awarded by the Court.   765. RELEASE OF APPELLANT   If the appellant is in custody, he or she may be released upon a  recognizance being entered into.   766. TRANSMISSION OF CASE AND NOTICE OF HEARING   A case stated shall be transmitted to the Registrar of the Court in the  same manner and with the same notice to the parties as in a case on  appeal under this Sub-Part.   767. SAVING AS TO RIGHT OF APPEAL   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent either party in  such a case from appealing against any determination of fact or  question of law that is not raised in the case stated by the magistrate,  and such an appeal shall be independent of the case stated.   768. POWER OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS TO  REQUIRE CASE TO BE STATED   The Director of Public Prosecutions may, by notice in writing under  his or her hand, require a magistrate to state a case on any point of  law, and on receipt of such notice, the magistrate shall state such case  accordingly.   769. REMISSION OF CASE STATED TO MAGISTRATE. HEARING  AND PROCEDURE   (1) The Court may remit any case stated to the magistrate for  further information from the magistrate.   (2) The Court shall hear and determine questions of law arising on  the case stated, and the provisions of this Code with respect to  the hearing and judgment of appeals and of all matters  incidental thereto shall, so far as appropriate, apply to a case  stated.     356 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     770. REVIEW OF SENTENCING   (1) A case to which this section applies may be referred to the  Court for the sentencing to be reviewed under subsection (3).   (2) This section applies to any case in which sentence is passed on  a person convicted of an offence in the High Court or a  magistrate’s court.   (3) Without prejudice to anything in this Code relating to appeals  in, or stating of, criminal cases or matters to the Court, the  Director of Public Prosecutions, if it appears to him or her that  the sentencing of a person in a case to which this Code or any  other enactment applies has been unduly lenient, may refer the  case to the Court for the Court to review the sentencing; and on  such a reference the Court may—   (a) quash the sentence passed on that person by the Court of  trial; and   (b) in place of that sentence pass such sentence as the Court  thinks appropriate and as the Court of trial had power to  pass when dealing with the person tried.   (4) The provisions of subsection (3) may be satisfied if it appears to  the Director of Public Prosecutions that the judge or, as the case  may be, the magistrate erred in law as to his or her powers of  sentencing.   (5) The time during which a person is in custody pending the  review of his or her case pursuant to a reference under this  section, shall be reckoned as part of the term of any sentence to  which he or she is for the time being subject.   (6) The term of any sentence passed by the Court under sub section  (3) shall, unless the Court orders otherwise, begin to run from  the time when that term would have begun to run if it had been  passed by the Court of trial.   (7) The provisions of sections 768 and 769 apply, with such  modifications and adaptations as are necessary, in relation to a  case referred to the Court under this section as those provisions  apply in relation to a case referred to the Court under those  sections.

(2) A person may be remanded under this section in the same  manner in all respects as a person accused of an indictable  offence may be remanded.   773. PROCEDURE   Where an indictable offence is, under the circumstances stated in  sections 774 and 776 authorised to be dealt with summarily—   (a) the procedure shall, unless the Court exercises its power  to deal with the offence summarily, be the same in all  respects as if the offence were to be dealt with throughout  the trial as an indictable offence, but when the Court  exercises its power to deal with the offence summarily,  the same procedure shall apply as if the offence were a  summary offence and not an indictable offence, and the  provisions of this Code shall apply accordingly;     358 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (b) the evidence of any witness taken before the Court   exercised its power to try the offence summarily need not  be taken again, but every witness shall, if the defendant so  requires it, be recalled for the purpose of cross- examination;   (c) a conviction for the offence shall have the same effect as  a conviction for the offence on indictment ;   (d) where the Court exercises the power to deal with the case  summarily, and dismisses the complaint, it shall, if  required, deliver to the person charged, a copy of the  order of dismissal duly certified under the hand of the  magistrate and such dismissal shall have the same effect  as an acquittal on a trial on indictment for the offence;   (e) in the case of a child, the conviction shall contain a  statement, as to the consent or otherwise of his or her  parent or guardian, and, in case of a young person, of the  consent of the person, to be tried by the Court.   774. COMPLAINT FOR OFFENCE TRIABLE EITHER ON INDICTMENT  OR SUMMARILY   (1) Where a complaint is laid for a charge against any person with  an offence which by virtue of any enactment is both an  indictable offence and a summary offence, the Court shall, if  the accused has attained the age of 12, proceed as if the offence  is not a summary offence, unless the Court, having jurisdiction  to try the complaint summarily, determines on the application  of the prosecutor to do so.   (2) An application under subsection(1) shall be made before any  evidence is called and, if the accused fails to appear to answer  to the complaint, the application may be made in his or her  absence.   (3) Subject to subsection (4), where the Court has, in pursuance of  subsection (1), begun to inquire into the complaint as an  indictable offence, then if at any time during the inquiry it  appears to the Court, having regard to any representations made  in the presence of the accused by the prosecutor, or made by the  accused, and to the nature of the offence, that it is proper to do  so, the Court may proceed to try the offence summarily.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 359  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (4) Where the prosecution is conducted by or on behalf of the   Director of Public Prosecution, the Court shall not proceed  under subsection (3) to try the offence summarily without the  consent of the Director of Public Prosecution.   (5) Where the Court proceeds to try a case summarily under  subsection (3) it shall, before asking the accused whether he or  she pleads guilty, cause the charge to be written down, if this  has not already been done, and read to him or her.   (6) Where, the Court has begun to try a complaint summarily under  subsection (1), the Court may, at any time before the conclusion  of the evidence for the prosecution, discontinue the summary  trial and proceed to inquire into the complaint as an indictable  offence.   (7) Nothing in this section shall affect the right of the accused or  the prosecutor under any enactment to claim that an offence  which is being tried summarily should be tried by a jury.   775. SUMMARY TRIAL OF COMPLAINT AGAINST ADULT FOR  CERTAIN INDICTABLE OFFENCES   (1) The following provisions of this section shall have effect where  a person who has attained the age of 16 years is brought before  a district court on a complaint charging him or her with any  indictable offence specified under this section.   (2) If at any time during an inquiry into an offence it appears to the  Court, having regard to any representations made in the  presence of the accused by the prosecutor or made by the  accused, and to the nature of the offence, that the punishment  that the Court has power to impose under this section would be  adequate and that the circumstances do not make the offence  one of serious character and do not for other reasons require  trial on indictment, the Court may proceed to try the case  summarily.   (3) For the purpose of proceeding under subsection (2), the Court  shall cause the charge to be written down, if this has not already  been done, and read to the accused and shall inform him or her  that he or she may, if he or she consents, be tried summarily  instead of being tried by a jury, and if the Court thinks it     360 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     desirable for his or her information, shall explain what is meant  by being tried summarily.   (4) The Court, after informing the accused of his or her options as  required under subsection (3), shall ask him or her whether he  or she wishes to be tried by a jury or consents to be tried  summarily, and if he or she consents to be tried summarily, the  Court shall proceed to summary trial of the complaint.   (5) A person summarily convicted of an indictable offence under  this section is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2  years or a fine not exceeding $2,000.   (6) Nothing in this section shall empower a district court to try an  indictable offence summarily—   (a) without the consent of the prosecutor in a case affecting  the property or affairs of the Government or of any local  authority or other body which has power to act under or  for the purposes of any enactment relating to local  government;   (b) without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecution  where the prosecution is being carried on by him or her or  on his or her behalf.   (7) Where any person is convicted under this section of an offence  of inciting to commit a summary offence, he or she is not liable  to a penalty greater than that to which he or she would  otherwise be liable if he or she were convicted summarily of the  summary offence.   (8) Despite any provisions of this Code on attempts, where a  person is convicted under this section of attempting to commit  an offence that is both an indictable offence and a summary  offence, he or she is not liable to any greater penalty than he or  she would be liable to on being summarily convicted of the  completed offence.   (9) The offences to which this section relates are—   (a) offences under section 94 of this Code (attempted  suicide);   (b) offences under sections 243, 244 and 245 of this Code  (relating to noteage);     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 361  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (c) offences under sections 251 to 258 and section 262 of this   Code (relating to fraud);   (d) offences under section 259 of this Code in relation to any  document being an authority or request for payment of  money where the amount of the money does not exceed  $500;   (e) offences under section 263 of this Code where the  document uttered, dealt with or used is a document  included in the sections mentioned in paragraphs (c) and  (d) of this subsection.

REDUCTION OF CHARGE FROM INDICTABLE TO SUMMARY  OFFENCE   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 774 (4) and section 775 (6)  (b), where, on the holding of any preliminary inquiry on a charge of  an indictable offence, the magistrate is of the opinion that the  evidence establishes or appears to establish, the commission of a  summary offence of a kind similar to the offence charged or an  abetment, or an attempt or incitement to commit that summary  offence, the magistrate may, if he or she thinks fit, inform the accused  person accordingly, and all further proceedings thereafter in the  matter shall be the same as if a complaint had been made against the  person for the offence or abetment, attempt or incitement.        362 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Summary Trial of Child   777. SUMMARY TRIAL OF CHILD OTHER THAN FOR MURDER   (1) Where a child is charged before the Court with any indictable  offence other than murder, the Court, if it thinks it expedient so  to do, and if the parent or guardian of the child, when informed  by the Court of his or her right to have the child tried by a jury,  does not object to the child being dealt with summarily, may  deal summarily with the offence, and, in the case of conviction,  inflict the same punishment as might have been inflicted if the  case had been tried on indictment, provided that—   (a) where a term of imprisonment is imposed, the term does  not in any case exceed 6 months;   (b) where a fine is imposed, the amount does not in any case  exceed $500.   (2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, the Court  shall, at any time during the hearing of the case at which it  becomes satisfied by the evidence that it is expedient to deal  with the case summarily, cause the complaint to be reduced into  writing, if this has not already been done, and to be read to the  parent or guardian of the child.   (3) The Court shall then address a question to such parent or  guardian in the following terms:   “Do you desire the child to be tried by a jury, and object to the  case being dealt with summarily by this Court?”   with a statement, if the Court thinks such statement desirable  for the information of such parent or guardian, of the meaning  of the case being dealt with summarily, and of the sitting of the  High Court at which the child will be tried, if tried by a jury.   (4) Where the parent or guardian is not present when the child is  charged, the Court may, if it thinks it just so to do, remand the  child for the purpose of causing notice to be served on such  parent or guardian, with a view of securing, so far as may be  practicable, his or her attendance at the hearing of the charge, or  the Court may, if it thinks it expedient so to do, deal with the  case summarily.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 363  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (5) Nothing in this section shall render punishable for an indictable   offence any child who is not, in the opinion of the magistrate  before whom he or she is tried, of or above the age of 12 years,  and of sufficient capacity to commit crime.      Summary Trial of Young Person   778. SUMMARY TRIAL OF YOUNG PERSON WITH HIS OR HER  CONSENT   (1) Where a young person is charged before the Court with an  indictable offence, other than murder, the Court, if it thinks it  expedient so to do, having regard to the character and  antecedents of the person charged, the nature of the offence,  and all the circumstances of the case, and if when the young  person charged with the offence is informed by the Court of his  or her right to be tried by a jury, consents to his or her case be  dealt with summarily, the Court may deal summarily with the  offence and in its discretion, order the person, if convicted of  the offence, either to pay a fine not exceeding $500 or to be  imprisoned for any term, not exceeding 6 months.

(2) Where the evidence has been given in the absence of the  accused, this shall be recorded on the deposition of the witness  and the deposition need not be read in the presence and hearing  of the accused.   (3) The depositions shall be authenticated by a certificate signed by  the magistrate.   (4) After the evidence for the prosecution, including any statements  tendered under section 799 has been given and after hearing any  submissions, if any made, the magistrate shall, unless he or she  then decides not to commit for trial, cause the charge to be  written down, if this has not already been done, and if the  accused is not represented by counsel, shall read the charge to  him or her and explain it in ordinary language.   (5) The magistrate shall then say to the accused—   “I must warn you that if this Court should commit you for trial  you may not be permitted at that trial to give evidence of an  alibi or to call witnesses in support of an alibi unless you have  earlier given particulars of the alibi and of the witnesses, you  may give those particulars to the prosecutor not later than 7  days from the end of these committal proceedings.”   or words to that effect and, if it appears to the magistrate that  the accused may not understand the meaning of the term  “alibi”, the magistrate shall explain it to him or her.   (6) The magistrate shall not be required to give this warning where  it appears to the magistrate that having regard to the nature of  the offence with which the accused is charged, it is unnecessary  to do so.     374 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (7) After complying with the requirements of this section relating   to the statement of the accused and whether or not he or she has  made a statement in answer to his or her charge, the magistrate  shall give him or her an opportunity to give evidence himself or  herself and to call witnesses.   (8) Subject to subsection (9), where the accused is represented by  counsel, his or her counsel shall be heard on his or her behalf  with the leave of the Court both before and after the evidence is  taken.   (9) Where the magistrate grants leave to counsel for the accused to  be heard after and before, the evidence is taken, counsel for the  prosecution shall be entitled to be heard immediately before  counsel for the accused is heard for the second time.   (10) Where the magistrate determines to commit the accused for trial  in respect of a charge different from that which was read to him  or her in accordance with subsection (4), the magistrate shall  cause the new charge to be read to him or her.   799. COMMITTAL FOR TRIAL WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF  EVIDENCE   (1) For the purposes of section 797(2), where the accused is  represented by counsel and the magistrate has been informed  that all the evidence for the prosecution has been given to the  accused, the magistrate shall cause the charge to be written  down if this has not already been done, and read to the accused,  and shall then ascertain whether he or she wishes to—   (a) object to any of the prosecution statements being tendered  in evidence;   (b) give evidence himself or herself or call witnesses; or   (c) submit that the prosecution statements disclose  insufficient evidence to put him or her on trial by jury for  the offence with which he or she is charged.   (2) If the magistrate is satisfied that the accused or as the case may  be, each of the accused persons, does not wish to take any of  the steps mentioned in subsections (1)(a), (1)(b) and (1)(c) and  determines, after receiving any written statements tendered by  the prosecution and the defence under section 800, to commit     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 375  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     the accused for trial without consideration of the evidence, the  magistrate shall proceed in accordance with subsection (3) and  in any other case the Court shall proceed in accordance with  section 798.   (3) The Magistrate shall then say to the accused—   “You will be committed for trial by jury but I must warn you  that at that trial you may not be permitted to give evidence of an  alibi or other special defence to call witnesses in support of an  alibi or other special defence unless you have earlier given  particulars of the alibi or other special defence and the  witnesses. You or your counsel may give those particulars now  to this Court or at any time in the next 7 days to the  prosecutor.”   (4) Despite subsection (3), the magistrate shall not be required to  give this warning in any case where it appears to him or her that  having regard to the nature of the offence with which the  accused is charged, it is unnecessary to do so.   800. WRITTEN STATEMENTS BEFORE MAGISTRATE   (1) In committal proceedings a written statement by any person  shall, if the conditions mentioned in subsection (2) are satisfied,  be admissible as evidence to the like extent as oral evidence to  the like effect by that person.

(3) So much of any statement as is admitted in evidence under this  section shall, unless the Court commits the accused for trial by  virtue of section 797 or the Court otherwise directs, be read  aloud at the hearing, and where the Court so directs an account  shall be given orally of so much of any statement that is not  read aloud.   (4) Any document or object referred to as an exhibit and identified  in a written statement tendered in evidence under this section  shall be treated as if it had been produced as an exhibit and  identified by the maker of the statement.      Decision of Magistrate   801. COMMITTAL OF ACCUSED   If the magistrate holding a preliminary inquiry thinks that the  evidence is sufficient to put the accused person on his or her trial, or  to commit him or her for sentence, he or she shall commit him or her  for trial to the next sitting of the High Court or for sentence  accordingly.   802. DISCHARGE OF ACCUSED   (1) When all the evidence on the part of the prosecutor and of the  accused person, as contained in their written statements or the  depositions, if any, have been considered , the magistrate shall,  if he or she is of opinion that no sufficient case is made out, to  put the accused upon his or her trial, discharge him or her.

STATEMENT OF INTENT TO DEFRAUD, DECEIVE OR INJURE   Where the enactment creating the offence does not make an intent to  defraud, deceive or injure a particular person an essential ingredient  of the offence, it is not necessary in stating any intent to defraud,  deceive or injure in an indictment to state an intent to defraud,  deceive or injure any particular person.   814. ALLEGATIONS FOR PRETENDING AS TO ENCLOSURES IN  POSTAL PACKETS   It is not necessary to allege in any indictment against the person for  wrongfully and wilfully pretending or alleging that he or she enclosed  and sent, or caused to be enclosed and sent, in any postal packet any  money or valuable security or to prove on the trial, that the act was  done with intent to defraud.     382 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     815.

Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 383  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Averments Sufficient or Unobjectionable   820. INADMISSIBLE OBJECTION   No count shall be deemed objectionable or insufficient on any of the  following grounds, that it—   (a) does not set out any document which may be the subject  of the charge;   (b) does not specify the means by which the offence was  committed;   (c) does not state who is the owner of any property  mentioned in it;   (d) does not set out or imperfectly sets out, the addition of  any accused or any other person;   (e) designates the person mentioned in it by a name of office  or other descriptive appellation instead of his or her  proper name;   (f) does not name or describe with precision any person or  thing;   (g) charges an intent to defraud without naming or describing  the person whom it was intended to defraud;   (h) does not contain the name of the person injured;   (i) omits to state the time at which the offence was  committed, or states that it was committed between any 2  days stated, or on or about a day stated, or otherwise;   (j) states the offence to have been committed on a day  subsequent to the filing of the indictment or on an  impossible day or on a day that never happened;   (k) does not state the value or price of any matter or thing, or  the amount of damage, injury or spoil in any case;   (l) does not set out the words used where words used are the  subject of the charge;   (m) does not aver any matter unnecessary to be proved.        384 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Inadmissible Objections in certain Special Cases   821. STATEMENTS IN ALTERNATIVE AS IN ENACTMENT LAWFUL   (1) Where an enactment creating an offence states the offence to  be—   (a) the doing or the omission to do any one of any different  acts in the alternative;   (b) the doing or the omission to do any act in any one of any  different capacities;   (c) with any one of any different intentions;   (d) states any part of the offence in the alternative,   the acts, omissions, capacities, or intentions, or other matters  stated in the alternative in the enactment, may be stated in the  alternative in the count charging the offence.   (2) A count shall not be deemed objectionable on the ground that it  charges in the alternative several different matters or acts which  are stated in the alternative in the enactment describing any  offence, or declaring the matters or acts charged to be an  indictable offence, or on the ground that it is double or  multifarious.   (3) The Court may, at any stage of the trial, amend or divide the  count on the ground that it is so framed as to embarrass the  accused in his or her defence.   (4) The Court may, if it is satisfied that the ends of justice require  it, order any count to be amended or divided into 2 or more  counts, and, on such order being made, the count shall be so  divided or amended, and a formal commencement may be  inserted before each of the counts into which it is divided.   822. SUFFICIENCY OF AVERMENT AS TO BANK-NOTE OR NOTE  DESCRIBED AS MONEY   In every indictment in which it is necessary to make averment as to  any money or bank-note, it is sufficient to describe the money or  bank-note simply as money, without specifying any particular note, or  bank-note, and an allegation, so far as it concerns the description of  the property, shall be sustained—     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 385  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (a) by proof of any amount of note or of any bank- note,   although the particular species of note of which the  amount was composed, or the particular nature of the  bank- notes shall not be proved;   (b) in the case of money or bank- note obtained by false  pretences or by any other unlawful act, by proof that the  offender obtained any note or bank- note, or any portion  of its value although such note or bank- note may have  been delivered to him or her in order that part of its value  should be returned to the party who delivered it, or, to any  other person, and that part has been returned accordingly.   823. SUFFICIENCY OF AVERMENTS CHARGING FRAUD WITHOUT  DETAILS   (1) Subject to subsection (2), no count which charges any false  claim, or any fraud, or any attempt or conspiracy by fraudulent  means, shall be deemed insufficient because it does not set out  in detail what constituted the false claim, or the fraud, or the  fraudulent means.   (2) The Court may, if it is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair  trial, order that the prosecutor shall furnish particulars of the  matters referred to in subsection (1) or any of them.   824. COUNT FOR LIBEL OR SELLING OR EXHIBITING  PUBLICATIONS   (1) Subject to subsection (2), no count for publishing a  blasphemous, seditious, obscene or defamatory libel or for  selling or exhibiting any obscene book, pamphlet, newspaper,  or other printed or written matter, shall be deemed insufficient  on the ground that it does not set out the words thereof.   (2) The Court may order the prosecutor to furnish such particulars  stating what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper, or  writing are relied on in support of the charge.   (3) A count for libel may charge that the matter published was  written in a sense which would make the publishing criminal,  specifying the sense without any prefatory averment showing  how that matter was written in the sense, and at the trial it is     386 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     sufficient to prove that the matter published was criminal, either  with or without any innuendo.   825. COUNT FOR PERJURY, ETC. NOT INVALID ETC.   (1) Subject to subsection (2), no count charging perjury, the  making of a false oath or of a false statement, fabricating  evidence, subordination, or procuring the commission of any of  these offences, shall be deemed insufficient on the ground that  it does not state the nature of the authority of the tribunal before  which the oath or statement was taken or made, or the subject  of the inquiry, or the words used, or the evidence fabricated, or  on the ground that it does not expressly negative the truth of the  words used.   (2) The Court may, if it is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair  trial, order that the prosecutor furnishes particulars of what is  relied on in support of the charge.   826. EXCEPTION   No provisions contained in this Sub-Part as to matters which are not  to render any count objectionable or insufficient, shall be construed as  restricting or limiting in any way, the general provisions of section  810.      Descriptions   827. DESCRIPTION OF ACCUSED   (1) The description or designation in an indictment of the accused  person, or of any other person to whom reference is made, shall  be such as is reasonably sufficient to identify him or her  without necessarily stating his or her correct name, or his or her  abode, style, title, degree or occupation.   (2) Where the name of a person is unknown, or for any other  reason, it is impracticable to give his or her description or  designation, it is sufficient to give a description or designation  as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances or the person  may be described as “a person unknown.”     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 387  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     828. DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENT OR THING   Any document or other thing may be described in any indictment by  any name, or designation, by which it is usually known, and any  document may be described by its purport, without setting out a copy,  or facsimile of the whole, or any part of it.   829. STATEMENT OF ACT, OMISSION, PLACE, THING, TIME   Subject to any other provisions of this Sub-Part, it is sufficient to  describe any place, time, thing, matter, act or omission to which it is  necessary to refer in any indictment, in ordinary language in such a  manner as to indicate with reasonable clarity, the place, time, thing,  matter, act or omission referred to.   830. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY   The description of property in a count in an indictment shall be in  ordinary language and such as to indicate with reasonable clarity the  property referred to, and if the property is so described, it is not  necessary, except when required for the purpose of describing an  offence depending on any special ownership of property or special  value of the property, to state the name of the person to whom the  property belongs or the value of the property, and the allegation that  the property concerned was not the property of the accused is implied  in all cases where it is essential to the criminality of the charge.   831. DESCRIPTION OF TRADE OR OTHER MARK   A trade-mark may be described in any indictment, by that name, and  any other mark may be described in any way which will indicate its  nature, without setting out a copy or facsimile of it.      Joinder   832. JOINING OF COUNTS, BUT MURDER ALONE TO BE CHARGED   (1) Any number of counts for any offences may be joined in the  same indictment if the offences are founded on the same facts  or form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a     388 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     similar character, but with respect to a count charging murder,  no count charging any other offence than murder shall be  joined.   (2) When there are more counts than one in an indictment, each  count may be treated as a separate indictment.   (3) If the Court thinks it conducive to the ends of justice so to do, it  may direct that the accused person be tried on any one or more  of such counts separately.   (4) The Court may make such order either before or in the course  of the trial, and, if it is made in the course of the trial, the jury  shall be discharged from giving a verdict on the counts on  which the trial is not to proceed.   (5) The counts in the indictment which are not then tried shall be  proceeded upon in all respects, as if they had been contained in  a separate indictment.   (6) Unless there are special reasons for so doing, the Court shall not  make an order preventing the trial at the same time of any  number of distinct charges of stealing, not exceeding five,  alleged to have been committed within 6 months from the first  to the last of such offences whether or not against the same  person.   833. CHARGING ANY OR ALL OF SEVERAL OFFENCES   If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful  which of the several offences is constituted by the facts which can be  proved, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any  of those offences and any number of such charges may be tried at  once, or he or she may be charged in the alternative with having  committed some or one of those offences.   834. INDICTMENT FOR STEALING   (1) In an indictment for stealing money, the accused may be  charged and proceeded against for the amount of a general  deficiency although such general deficiency is made up of any  number of specific sums of money, the taking of which  extended, over any space of time.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 389  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) It is lawful in any indictment for stealing, to allege that the   property charged to have been stolen was taken at different  times between any 2 specific days stated in the indictment, and  upon such an indictment, proof may be given of the stealing  upon any day or days between the 2 specific days.   (3) In an indictment against a person for stealing he or she may be  charged with not more than 5 distinct acts of stealing, whether  against the same person or not, committed by him or her within  the space of 6 months from the first to the last of such acts.   835. ELECTION BY PROSECUTOR ETC.   (1) Where upon an indictment for stealing, it appears that the  property alleged in the indictment to have been stolen at one  time was stolen at different times, the prosecutor shall not by  reason thereof, be required to elect upon which act of stealing  he or she will proceed and the accused shall be liable to be  convicted of every such act of stealing in like manner as if  every act had been separately charged, unless it appears that  there were more than 5 acts of stealing, or that more than 6  months elapsed between the first and the last of the acts.   (2) Where there are more than 5 acts of stealing or more than 6  months have elapsed between the first and the last of the acts,  the prosecutor shall be required to elect to proceed in respect of  5 acts of stealing which appear to have taken place within the  period of 6 months from the first to the last of the acts.   836. JOINDER OF PERSONS   Any number of persons charged—   (a) with committing or, with aiding and abetting, or with  procuring the commission of the same offence, although  at different times;   (b) with harbouring in respect of the same offence, although  at different times;   (c) with receiving, although at different times, any property  or part of any property obtained by means of an indictable  offence or by means of an act which, if it had been done  in this State, would be an indictable offence and which is     390 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     an offence under the laws in force in the place where it  was done,   may be charged with substantive offences in the same indictment and  may be tried together although, as the case may be, the principal  offender is not included in the same indictment, or is not amenable to  prosecution.   837. POWER TO ORDER PARTICULARS AND ADJOURN FOR  PURPOSE   The Court may, in any case, where it is satisfied that it is necessary  for a fair trial, direct that the prosecutor furnishes the accused person  with particulars of any matter alleged in the indictment, and may  adjourn the trial for that purpose.   838. CONSIDERATION OF WRITTEN STATEMENTS OR  DEPOSITIONS ON APPLICATION   (1) In determining whether particulars of any matter alleged in an  indictment are required or not, and whether a defect in the  indictment is material to the substantial justice of the case or  not, the Court may have regard to the written statements or  depositions tendered by the prosecution.   (2) When any particulars are furnished, a copy shall be given  without charge to the accused person or his or her counsel.   (3) An entry as to the furnishing of particulars shall be made in the  Crown Book, and the trial shall proceed in all respects as if the  indictment had been amended in conformity with such  particulars.      Previous Convictions   839. CHARGING PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS   Any charge of a previous conviction of an offence shall be stated at  the end of the indictment by means of a statement that the person  accused has been previously convicted of that offence at a certain  time and place, without stating the particulars of the offence.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 391  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     840. UNNECESSARY TO CHARGE PREVIOUS CONVICTION.   COMPETENCE TO PROVE PREVIOUS CONVICTION   (1) It is not necessary in an indictment against the person for any  offence to charge or allege that the person had been previously  convicted of any offence, and except as otherwise expressly  provided in this Code, it is not competent to prove at the trial of  the person for any offence that he or she was previously  convicted of an offence.   (2) Where at the trial of any person for any offence, the person  gives evidence of his or her good character, it is lawful for the  prosecutor in rebuttal to give evidence of the former conviction  of the person of any offence.      Preferring of Indictments   841. INDICTMENTS TO BE GENERALLY PREFERRED BY DIRECTOR  OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS   (1) Unless otherwise provided in this Code, every indictment shall  be preferred by and in the name of the Director of Public  Prosecutions.   (2) The averment in an indictment, that the prosecution is instituted  by the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, is  sufficient evidence of that fact, until the contrary is shown.   842. CHARGING OFFENCE DISCLOSED BY DEPOSITIONS   An indictment may charge the offence for which the accused was  committed for trial or for sentence or for any offence disclosed by the  committal proceedings.   843. SIGNING OF INDICTMENTS   (1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) , all  indictments shall be signed by the Director of Public  Prosecutions or by counsel acting for him or her and a  statement on the indictment to that effect is sufficient evidence  of that fact.     392 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) Where under any enactment any injured party or complainant is   entitled to prosecute privately, the indictment shall be signed by  that party and not by the Director of Public Prosecutions.   (3) The Registrar shall not receive an indictment from any private  prosecutor unless—   (a) the indictment has been endorsed by a certificate of the  Director of Public Prosecutions to the effect that he or she  has seen such indictment and declines to prosecute at the  public instance the offence set forth in the indictment; and   (b) the private prosecutor has given the required security to  prosecute the indictment to conclusion at the time at  which the accused shall be required to appear and has  paid such costs as may be ordered by the Court, except  where the Court has dispensed with payment of such  costs.   844. FILING OF INDICTMENTS   (1) Every indictment shall be filed in the Registry of the High  Court at least 5 days before the first day of the sitting of the  Court.   (2) Copies of the indictment for service shall also be supplied to the  Registrar.

(4) The omission of such statement , or any mistake in it, shall not  constitute a ground for an objection to the proceedings, but the  Court may, and shall, on the application of either the prosecutor  or the accused, at any time, order a statement of these  particulars to be entered or amend the statement where it is  erroneous or defective.   (5) Any erroneous or defective entry in the Crown Book may at  any time be amended by the judge in accordance with the facts  by which such error or defect is sought to be corrected, but  nothing contained in this section shall dispense with the taking  of notes by the judge presiding at the trial.   (6) The entries in the Crown Book, or a certified copy of the  entries, or of so much of the entries as may be material may be  referred to in any proceeding in a criminal case on appeal.   (7) Any certificate of any indictment, trial, conviction, or acquittal,  or of the substance of such certificate, shall be made up from  the memorandum in the Crown Book, and shall be admissible  in evidence for the same purpose and to the same extent as  certificates of records, or the substantial parts of such  certificates of records, are by law admissible.

SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS   (1) Unless some other period or mode of service is expressly  provided, the notice of trial and any other notice or document  required to be served on an accused shall be served by  delivering it to the accused at least 3 days before the day  specified in it for his or her trial, or by leaving a copy of the  notice or document with the person of his or her household at  his or her dwelling house, or if no person of his or her  household can be found, by affixing the copy to the main outer  door or other conspicuous part of his or her dwelling house.   (2) Where the accused is not in custody, the copy of the notice or  document, may also be served on him or her by leaving it at the  place specified in the recognizance as the place at which service     396 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     of the indictment or other document may be made or by leaving  it at his or her place of employment or business.

(4) The officer effecting the service of the copy of the notice or  document shall forthwith deliver or transmit to the official from  whom he or she received such notice for service a return of the  mode by which the service was made and such return is prima  facie evidence that the service of the notice was made in  manner and form stated in the return.   (5) The accused may waive any period allowed under this section  for the service of any notice or document on the accused and  the Court may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the trial to  enable the period to run to completion or the notice to be given.   854.

APPLICATION TO QUASH COUNT NOT FOUNDED ON  DEPOSITIONS BEFORE MAGISTRATE   (1) An accused person may, at any time before he or she is given in  charge to the jury, apply to the Court to quash any count in the  indictment on the ground that it is not founded on the facts and  evidence disclosed in the written statements of the prosecution  or the depositions taken before the magistrate.   (2) The Court shall quash the count, if the Court is satisfied that the  count is not founded on such facts and evidence.   (3) If, at any time during the trial, it appears to the Court that any  count is not so founded, and that injustice has been or is likely  to be done to the accused in consequence of the count, the  Court may quash the count and discharge the jury from finding  any verdict based upon it, if the Court is satisfied that is in the  interest of justice.   860. OBJECTION FOR FORMAL DEFECT   (1) Every objection to any indictment for any formal defect  apparent on the face of it shall be taken before the jury is sworn  and not after the jury has been sworn.     398 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) The Court, before which any objection is taken for any formal   defect may, if it considers it necessary, cause the indictment to  be forthwith amended in such particular and thereupon the trial  shall proceed as if no such defect had occurred.   861. OBJECTION THAT INDICTMENT IS LIKELY TO PREJUDICE OR  EMBARRASS   (1) The accused may before pleading to an indictment apply by oral  motion to the Court to quash the indictment on the ground that  it is calculated to prejudice or embarrass him or her in his or her  defence to the charge.   (2) Upon hearing the motion the Court may quash the indictment or  may order that it be amended in such manner as the Court  thinks just or may refuse the motion.   862. OBJECTION OF SUBSTANCE OR TO JURISDICTION   (1) If an indictment does not state in substance an indictable  offence, or states an offence not triable by the Court, the  accused person may move the Court to quash it or in arrest of  judgment in accordance with the provisions of this section.   (2) If such motion is made before the accused pleads, the Court  shall either quash the indictment or amend it, if it thinks that it  ought to be amended.   (3) If the defect in the indictment is noticed by the Court during the  trial, and the Court does not think it fit to amend it, the Court  may, in its discretion, quash the indictment or leave the  objection to be taken in arrest of judgment.   (4) Upon an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court  shall proceed to satisfy itself in such manner and upon such  evidence as it thinks fit, whether it has jurisdiction or not.   863. OBJECTION WITHOUT PLEA   (1) When the accused objects only and does not plead any plea, the  Court shall proceed to hear and determine the matter forthwith.   (2) If the objection is overruled, he or she shall be called upon to  plead to the indictment.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 399  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     864. SPECIAL DEFENCE   (1) Where the accused intends to plead a special defence, he or she  shall give written notice of such defence to the Director of  Public Prosecutions or the private prosecutor, with any  information which might be of material assistance to the  prosecution including any information in the possession of the  defence, relating to witnesses the defence intends to call in  support of the special defence.   (2) Where the accused intends to plead an alibi, he or she shall give  written notice of such alibi to the Director of Public  Prosecutions or the private prosecutor, with particulars as to  time and place and of the witnesses by whom it is proposed to  prove it, and the prosecutor on being given the notice, if he or  she so desires, shall be entitled to an adjournment of the case, if  the Court is of opinion that he or she has not had sufficient  length of notice.   865. SPECIAL PLEAS   (1) The following special pleas, and no others, may be pleaded in  accordance with the relevant provisions of this Sub-Part, that is  to say—   (a) a plea of autrefois acquit;   (b) a plea of autrefois convict;   (c) a plea of pardon, and such plea under section 327 with  respect to defamatory libel.   (2) All other grounds of defence may be relied on under the plea of  not guilty.      Plea of Autrefois Acquit or Autrefois Convict or Pardon   866. AUTREFOIS ACQUIT OR CONVICT AND PARDON PLEADED  TOGETHER   (1) The pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict or pardon, may  be pleaded together, and shall, if pleaded, be disposed of before  the accused person is called on to plead further.     400 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) In respect of the pleas of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, it   is sufficient for the accused to state that he or she has been  lawfully acquitted or convicted, as the case may be, of the  offence charged in the count or counts to which such plea is  pleaded.   (3) Where every such plea is disposed of against the accused, he or  she shall be allowed to plead not guilty.   867. DISCHARGE OF ACCUSED ON PLEA OF AUTREFOIS CONVICT   (1) On the trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois convict to any  count or counts, if it appears that the matter on which the  accused person was given in charge on the former trial is the  same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give  him or her in charge, and that he or she might on the former  trial, if all proper amendments had been made which might then  have been made, have been convicted of all the offences of  which he or she may be convicted on the count or counts to  which such plea is pleaded, the Court shall give judgment that  he or she be discharged from the count or counts.   (2) If it appears that the accused might, on the former trial, have  been convicted of any offence of which he or she may be  convicted on the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded,  but that he or she may be convicted on the count or counts of  some offence or offences of which he or she could not have  been convicted on the former trial, the Court shall direct that he  or she shall not be convicted on the count or counts of any  offence of which he or she might have been convicted on the  former trial, but that he or she shall plead over as to the other  offence or offences charged.   868. PREVIOUS ACQUITTAL OR CONVICTION, A BAR TO CHARGE  WITH ADDITIONS TENDING TO INCREASE PUNISHMENT   Where an indictment charges substantially the same offence as that  charged in the indictment on which the accused person was given in  charge on a previous trial, but adds a statement of intention or  circumstances of aggravation tending, if proved, to increase the  punishment, the previous acquittal or conviction shall be a bar to the  subsequent indictment.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 401  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     869. ACQUITTAL OR CONVICTION FOR MURDER A BAR TO   SECOND CHARGE OF MANSLAUGHTER AND VICE VERSA   (1) A previous acquittal or conviction on an indictment for murder  is a bar to a second indictment for the same offence being  charged as manslaughter.   (2) A previous acquittal or conviction on an indictment for  manslaughter is a bar to a second indictment for the same  offence being charged as murder.   (3) If it appears, at the trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit  or autrefois convict to an indictment for murder or  manslaughter, that the first trial was for an offence committed  against the person now alleged to have been killed, and the  death of the person is now alleged to have been caused by the  offence previously charged, but that the death happened after  the trial at which the accused was acquitted or convicted, as the  case may be, then, if it appears on the first trial not the accused,  if convicted, might have been sentenced to imprisonment with  hard labour for 3 years or more, the Court shall direct that the  accused be discharged from the indictment before it, or direct  that the accused pleads over.   870. USE OF DEPOSITION AND JUDGE’S NOTES TO TRY PLEA OF  AUTREFOIS ACQUIT OR CONVICT   On trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict,  the written statements and depositions transmitted to the Court on the  previous trial, together with the Judge’s notes, if available, and the  written statements and depositions transmitted to the Court on the  subsequent charge, are admissible in evidence to prove or disprove  the identity of the charges.   871. PROCEEDING ON PLEAS OTHER THAN PLEA OF GUILTY   Unless it is otherwise expressly provided in this Code, if the accused  pleads any plea, other than the plea of guilty, he or she is, by such  plea without any further form, deemed to have demanded that the  issues raised by such plea shall be tried by a jury and is entitled to  have them tried accordingly.     402 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     872. TRIAL OF FRESH ISSUES ON PLEAS OTHER THAN PLEA OF   NOT GUILTY   (1) When the issues raised by any plea except the plea of not guilty,  have been found against an accused person, who has not  pleaded the plea of not guilty, he or she shall be called upon to  plead afresh, and, if those issues have been tried by a jury, the  judge may direct the issues raised by any fresh plea to be tried  by the same jury or another jury.   (2) If the judge directs that those issues be tried by the same jury, it  is not necessary that the jury should be sworn afresh, but the  oath already taken by them is to be deemed to extend to the trial  of any fresh issues.   873. TRIAL TO BE ON INDICTMENT   Every person who is committed for trial by magistrate on a charge of  having committed an indictable offence, or against whom an  indictment is preferred, shall be tried on indictment in the Court.   874. TRIAL TO BE BY JUDGE AND JURY   Every cause before the Court shall be tried and decided by the judge  and a jury as constituted in accordance with the provisions of this  Code.   875. SAME PROCEDURE FOR ALL OFFENCES EXCEPT TREASON   The proceedings in respect of all indictable offences with the  exception of treason shall be conducted in the same manner.   876. NON-APPEARANCE OF ACCUSED   When any person against whom an indictment has been duly  preferred is at large, and does not appear to plead to the indictment,  whether he or she is under recognizance to appear or not—   (a) the Court may issue a warrant for his or her arrest;   (b) the Registrar shall, at any time after the end of the sitting  of the Court at which the accused person ought to have  appeared and pleaded, grant to the prosecutor, upon     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 403  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     application made on his or her behalf and upon payment  of $5, a certificate of such indictment having been  preferred;   (c) upon production of the certificate to any magistrate or  justice of the peace, the magistrate or justice shall issue a  warrant to arrest the accused, and to cause him or her to  be brought before the magistrate or justice, to be dealt  with according to law;   (d) if it is proved upon oath before a magistrate that any  person arrested and brought before him or her on such  warrant is the person charged and named in the  indictment, the magistrate shall, without further inquiry or  examination, either commit to correctional facility by a  warrant or release him or her on bail, and if it appears that  the accused had, without reasonable excuse, broken his or  her recognizance to appear, he or she shall not be entitled  to bail as of right;   (e) if it is proved upon oath before the magistrate or justice of  the peace that the accused person is, at the time of the  application and production of the certificate, confined in a  correctional facility for any other offence than that  charged in the indictment, the magistrate or justice of the  peace shall issue a warrant directed to the correctional  officer, commanding him or her to detain the person in  custody until he or she is, by lawful authority, removed  from custody.   877. FORFEITURE OF RECOGNIZANCE OF ACCUSED AND  SURETIES   Where an accused person against whom an indictment has been duly  preferred does not appear to plead to the indictment, and he or she has  given security for his or her appearance, the accused and his or her  sureties shall be dealt with in accordance to section 604.   878. POWER TO ADJOURN AND DIRECTIONS TO JURY   (1) When the accused person is given in charge to the jury, the trial  thereafter shall proceed continuously subject to the power of the  Court to adjourn it.     404 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) A trial may be adjourned at any time of the trial, whether a jury   has or has not been sworn and whether evidence has or has not  been given.   (3) Upon every adjournment the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct  that during the adjournment the jury should be kept together  and proper provision made for preventing the jury from  communicating with any other person on the subject of the trial.   (4) If the Court gives no such direction, the jury shall be permitted  to separate.   (5) When a trial is adjourned after the jury have been sworn, the  Court may discharge the jury.   879. FORMAL ADJOURNMENT NOT NECESSARY   No formal adjournment of the Court shall be required, and no entry  thereof in the Crown Book shall be necessary.   880. BAIL OF ACCUSED OR WITNESSES ON ADJOURNMENT   When a trial is postponed or adjourned, the Court may admit the  accused to bail or enlarge his or her bail if he or she has already been  admitted to bail in accordance with section 601 and may enlarge the  recognizances of the witnesses.   881. DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, VARIANCES   (1) If, on trial of any indictment, there appears to be a variance  between the proof and the charge in any count in the  indictment, either as preferred, or as amended , or as it would  have been if amended in conformity with any such particulars,  the Court may amend the indictment, or any count in it, or any  particulars so as to make it conformable with the proof.   (2) If the Court is of opinion that the accused person has not been  misled or prejudiced in his or her defence by such variance, it  shall make such amendment.   (3) If it appears that there is in the indictment, or in any count in it,  an omission to state or a defective statement of anything  requisite to constitute the offence, but that the matter omitted is     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 405  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     provided by the evidence, the Court shall, if it is of the opinion  that the accused has not been misled or prejudiced in his or her  defence by such omission, amend the count by inserting in it the  matter omitted.   (4) The trial in either of these cases may then proceed in all  respects as if the indictment or count had been originally  framed as amended.   (5) If the Court is of the opinion that the accused has been misled  or prejudiced in his or her defence by any variance, or  omission, or defective statement, but that the effect of such  misleading or prejudice might be removed by adjourning or  postponing the trial, the Court may, in its discretion, make the  amendment and adjourn the trial to a future day in the same  sittings, or discharge the jury and postpone the trial to the next  sittings of the Court, on such terms as it thinks just.   (6) In determining whether the accused has been misled or  prejudiced in his or her defence, the Court shall consider the  contents of the written statements, or depositions tendered by  the prosecution, as well as such other circumstances of the case.   882. INSERTION, OR CHANGE OF COUNT TO MEET PLEA   (1) The Court may allow any count to be inserted in the indictment,  or to be altered, or added to, to meet any plea which the accused  is willing to plead and which the prosecution is willing to  accept.   (2) The Court may alter or add to any count at any time before  judgment is pronounced.   (3) Every such insertion, alteration or addition, shall be read and  explained to the accused.   883. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AMENDMENTS   Whenever the Court allows an amendment, it shall do so only on such  terms and conditions, if any, as to costs or otherwise as may be  considered just and proper.     406 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     884. CORRECTION OF ERRORS   It shall be competent to correct any error in the minutes or procedure  or in the extract of any sentence or order or judgment at any time, and  any such correction shall be sufficiently authenticated by the initials  of a proper officer of the Court.   885. ORDER TO BRING UP INMATE IN CUSTODY FOR THE OTHER  CAUSE   If the person against whom an indictment is preferred is at the time  confined for some other cause in the correctional facility, the Court  may, by order in writing, without a writ of habeas corpus, direct the  correctional officer to bring up to the body of the person, as often as  may be required, for the purpose of the trial, and the correctional  officer shall obey such order.   886. RIGHT OF ACCUSED TO HAVE INDICTMENT READ   Every accused person shall, upon being called upon to plead, be  entitled to have the indictment on which he or she is to be tried read  over to him or her, if he or she so requires.   887. ACCUSED TO APPEAR AND PLEAD   (1) At the time appointed for the trial or sentencing of the accused  upon any indictment he or she shall appear or be placed at the  bar.   (2) The accused shall be informed in open Court of the offence  with which he or she is charged as set forth in the indictment,  and he or she shall be required to plead instantly to the  indictment, unless where the accused, having been committed  for trial objects, and the Court finds that he or she has not been  duly served with a copy of the indictment.   (3) A trial is deemed to begin when the accused is called upon to  plead to the indictment.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 407  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     888. ACCUSED COMMITTED FOR SENTENCE TO PLEAD   A person who has been committed for sentence shall be called upon  to plead to the indictment.   889. NO PLEADING TO PREVIOUS CONVICTION COUNT.  EXCEPTION   Unless otherwise expressly provided, where an indictment contains a  count charging the accused person with having been previously  convicted, he or she shall not, at the time of his or her arraignment, be  required to plead to it unless he or she pleads guilty to the rest of the  indictment, nor shall such count be mentioned to the jury when the  accused is given in charge to them, nor shall he or she be tried upon  the count if he or she is acquitted on the other counts.   890. NO PLEA IN ABATEMENT   No plea in abatement shall be allowed.   891. COMPETENT PLEAS   (1) When the accused person is called upon to plead, he or she may  plead either guilty or not guilty, or he or she may object or  plead such special pleas as are provided in this Sub-Part.   (2) If the accused wilfully refuses to plead or will not answer  directly, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order the Registrar to  enter a plea of not guilty.   892. JURY TO FIND IF ACCUSED CAPABLE TO PLEAD AND TAKE  HIS OR HER TRIAL   (1) If, when the accused is called upon to plead to the indictment, it  appears to be uncertain for any reason whether he or she is  capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be  able to make a proper defence, a jury chosen from the panel of  jurors shall be empanelled forthwith and shall be sworn to find  whether or not he or she is so capable.   (2) Where the jury finds that the accused person is so capable of  understanding the proceedings, the trial shall proceed as in  other cases.     408 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (3) Where the jury finds that he or she is not capable of   understanding the proceedings, the finding shall be recorded  and the Court may order the accused to be discharged or may  order him or her to be kept in custody in such place and in such  manner as the Court thinks fit until he or she can be dealt with  according to law.   (4) A person so found to be incapable of understanding the  proceedings at the trial, may subsequently be indicted and tried  for the offence if he or she is then found capable of  understanding the proceedings.   893. GIVING ACCUSED IN CHARGE TO JURY   Where the jury has been sworn to give a true verdict according to the  evidence upon the issues to be tried by them, and have elected a  foreman, the proper officer of the Court shall inform them of the  charge set forth in the indictment and of their duty as jurors at the  trial.   894. DEPOSITION SIGNED BY MAGISTRATE TO BE EVIDENCE   (1) A deposition taken at committal proceedings may be produced  and given in evidence at the trial of the person against whom or  for whom it was taken, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the  judge—   (a) that the deponent is dead, or so ill as not to be able to  travel, although there may be a prospect of his or her  recovery; or   (b) that the deponent is kept out of the way by the prosecutor  or the accused person; or   (c) that the deponent is absent from the State or cannot be  found after diligent search, or cannot be compelled to  attend the Court, and if the Court is satisfied that such  absence is caused by, or is due to any improper motive on  the part of the deponent, and, if such motive exists, that  there is any collusion between the deponent and the party  tendering the deposition in respect of such motive, this  provision shall not apply;     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 409  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (d) that the deponent is mentally ill so as to be incapable of   testifying;   (e) if the deposition purports to be signed by the magistrate  by or before whom it purports to have been taken; or   (f) if it is proved to by the person who offers it as evidence  that it was taken in the presence of the accused person or  the prosecutor, as the case may be, or, in cases where the  deposition was taken after committal, that notice of the  examination was given as provided in this Code, to the  party against whom the deposition is proposed to be given  in evidence.   (2) If the deposition purports to have been taken and signed, it is  presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have  been duly taken, read and signed.   (3) If it is made to appear to the Judge that the witness who made  the deposition may, within a reasonable time, be capable of  attending to give evidence and that the ends of justice require  that the witness should be examined personally before the jury,  the Court may postpone the trial on such terms as may seem  proper.   895. EVIDENCE AT FORMER TRIAL SIMILARLY ADMISSIBLE   The evidence of a witness given at a previous trial under like  circumstances as mentioned in section 894 shall be admissible on any  subsequent trial of the same charges.   896. EVIDENCE OF POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY AND OF  PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS   (1) At the trial of a person charged with handling stolen goods,  evidence may be given at any stage of the proceedings that  there was found in his or her possession other property stolen  within the immediately preceding period of 12 months, and  such evidence may be taken into consideration for the purpose  of proving that he or she knew the property to be stolen which  is the subject of the proceedings taken against him or her.   (2) At the trial of a person charged with handling stolen goods,  where evidence has been given that the stolen property was     410 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     found in his or her possession, then if, within immediately  preceding period of 5 years he or she has been convicted of any  offence involving fraud or dishonesty, evidence of his or her  previous conviction may be given at any stage of the  proceedings after he or she has been given not less than 3 days  written notice by the prosecutor to give evidence of his or her  previous convictions.   (3) Evidence of the previous convictions of an accused person may  be taken into consideration for the purpose of proving that the  accused person knew the property was stolen.   (4) For the purposes of this section it is not necessary to set out in  the indictment the previous convictions.   897. JURY TO DETERMINE ISSUES AS TO PREVIOUS CONVICTION   (1) Where an indictment contains a count charging the accused  person with having been previously convicted, if he or she is  convicted on any other part of the indictment, he or she shall be  asked whether or not he or she has been previously convicted as  alleged, and if he or she says that he or she has not or does not  say that he or she has been so convicted, the jury shall be  charged to inquire into the matter.   (2) If, upon the trial of the person for any subsequent offence  evidence is given on the part of the accused of his or her good  character, the prosecutor may, in rebuttal, prove such previous  conviction, and the jury shall be charged to inquire into the  matter together with the offence to be tried.   898. PREVIOUS CONVICTION, HOW PROVED   (1) Where the person indicted for an offence has previously been  convicted of any offence, it is lawful for the prosecutor, if the  accused has denied such conviction, to give notice that in the  event of his or her pleading guilty or being found guilty of the  offence for which he or she is indicted, proof will be given of  any previous conviction.   (2) When notice has been duly served on the accused that evidence  of any previous conviction would be offered against him or her,  in accordance with subsection (1), it is lawful, where the person     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 411  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     pleads guilty or is convicted, for the prosecutor before sentence  is pronounced, to offer to prove such previous conviction or  convictions, and the Court shall then ask the accused whether  he or she confesses to the fact that he or she is the person who  has been previously convicted and whether he or she was  previously convicted as alleged.   (3) If the accused does not confess any such matter, then, in the  event of his or her pleading guilty, the Court shall empanel a  jury, and in case of the accused person not pleading guilty, shall  direct the jury which convicted him or her to try the truth of any  matter, to which the accused does not confess, or admit.   (4) If on trial by the jury, the previous convictions of the accused or  any of them to which he or she does not confess or admit is  proved, or if he or she confesses or admits such previous  convictions or any of them, then the Court shall take into  account such of the previous convictions as has been proved or  confessed or admitted, in passing sentence for the offence to  which the accused has pleaded guilty or of which he or she has  been found guilty.   899. JUDGE TO TAKE NOTES OF EVIDENCE   The judge presiding at the trial shall take or cause to be taken notes of  the evidence, unless the proceedings are recorded by mechanical or  electronic means.   900. ORDER TO BRING UP INMATE WITNESS   The provisions of section 783 apply, with the necessary modification,  for securing the attendance of the person confined in any correctional  facility in this State, who is required to give evidence for the purpose  of the trial.   901. SUMMONS TO WITNESS   The Registrar shall issue summonses for witnesses to attend at a trial  of offences in the High Court.     412 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     902. SERVICE OF SUMMONS TO WITNESS   The provisions of sections 786, 787 and 788 apply, with the necessary  modifications, to the service and proof of service of summons on a  witness to attend at a trial of offences in the High Court.   903. COURT TO ORDER PROSECUTION TO CALL WITNESS   (1) If the Judge is of the opinion that any witness who is not called  for the prosecution ought to be called, he or she may require the  prosecutor to call such witness, and if the witness does not  attend, the Judge may make an order that his or her attendance  be procured, and the Court may, if it thinks fit, adjourn the  further hearing of the case to some other time during the  sittings.   (2) If, in such a case, the Judge is of the opinion that it would be  conducive to the ends of justice so to do, it may, upon the  application of the accused, discharge the jury and postpone the  trial.   904. COURT TO DISPENSE WITH PRODUCTION OF MEDICAL OR  OTHER WITNESS   (1) Without prejudice to any other provision, the judge may  dispense with the production of a Government medical officer  or other person as a witness at a criminal trial in the High Court,  if in the opinion of the judge that the evidence of such witness  is merely formal, or is not really material to the guilt or  innocence of the accused, or that the trial, without injustice to  the accused, can proceed without such witness being called.   (2) In such a case the judge may allow the deposition of such  witness taken at the preliminary inquiry to be read at the trial.   905. WITNESS FOR PROSECUTION NOT PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED   If the judge is of the opinion that the accused person is taken by  surprise, in a manner likely to be prejudicial to his or her defence, by  the production on behalf of the prosecution of a witness who did not  give any deposition, or of whom the prosecutor has not given  sufficient notice to the accused of his or her intention to produce, the  Court may, on the application of the accused, adjourn the further     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 413  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     hearing of the case, or discharge the jury from giving a verdict, and  postpone the trial.   906. WITNESSES TO BE OUTSIDE COURTROOM   The judge may, at any time during the trial, order every person who is  to be called as a witness, other than the accused himself or herself, to  leave the Courtroom and remain outside in the precincts of the Court  until he or she is called.   907. REFRACTORY WITNESS   (1) When—   (a) it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the  summons was served on any witness who has failed to  attend or remain in attendance;   (b) any witness who at the preliminary inquiry has entered  into a recognizance to appear at the trial has failed to  appear, and that the presence of such witness is material  in the interest of justice, the judge may, by warrant, cause  such witness to be arrested and forthwith brought before  him or her to give evidence and to answer for his or her  disregard of the summons.   (2) The judge may detain such witness before the Court or in the  correctional facility or lock-up, in order to secure his or her  presence as a witness, or may release him or her on a  recognizance with or without sureties as a condition for his or  her appearance to give evidence and to answer for his or her  default in not attending or not remaining in attendance at the  trial.   (3) The Court may, in a summary manner, inquire into and dispose  of the charge against the witness, who, if convicted of the  charge, is liable to a fine not exceeding $500, or to  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both, and  the recognizance of such witness and his or her sureties, if any,  entered into at the preliminary inquiry shall be forfeited.        414 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     Disclosure by Prosecutor and Accused   908. DISCLOSURE BY THE PROSECUTOR   (1) Subject to any guidelines as may from time to time be issued by  the Director of Public Prosecutions, at the trial of any indictable  offence the prosecutor shall—   (a) disclose to the accused any prosecution material which  has not previously been disclosed to the accused and  which, in the opinion of the prosecutor, might undermine  the case for the prosecutor against the accused; or   (b) give to the accused a written statement that there is no  material of a description mentioned in paragraph (a).   (2) For the purposes of this section prosecution material is  material—   (a) which is in the prosecutor’s possession and which came  into his or her possession in connection with the case for  the prosecution against the accused;   (b) which he or she has inspected in connection with the case  for the prosecution against the accused.   (3) Where the material consists of information which has been  recorded in any form, the prosecutor discloses it for the  purposes of this section—   (a) by ensuring that a copy is made of it and that the copy is  given to the accused; or   (b) if in the prosecutor’s opinion it is not practicable or not  desirable to make a copy by allowing the accused to  inspect it at a reasonable time and place, or by taking  steps to ensure that he or she is allowed to do so,   and a copy may be in such form as the prosecutor thinks fit and  need not be in the same form as that in which the information  has already been recorded.   (4) Where the material consists of information which has not been  recorded, the prosecutor discloses it for the purposes of this  section by ensuring that it is recorded in such form as he or she  thinks fit and—     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 415  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (a) by ensuring that a copy is made of it and that the copy is   given to the accused; or   (b) if in the prosecutor’s opinion it is not practicable or not  desirable, by allowing the accused to inspect it at a  reasonable time and place or by taking steps to ensure that  he or she is allowed to do so.   (5) Where the material does not consist of information, the  prosecutor discloses it for the purpose of this section by  allowing the accused to inspect it at a reasonable time and place  or by taking steps to ensure that he or she is allowed to do so.   (6) Material shall not be disclosed under this section to the extent  that the Court, on an application by the prosecutor, concludes  that it is not in the public interest to disclose it and orders  accordingly.

(3) The names of the requisite number of persons drawn under  subsection (2) and approved as fair and neutral shall be marked  in the panel and, on being sworn, they shall constitute the jury  to try the issue.   (4) The cards corresponding with the numbers of the persons so  drawn and sworn, shall be kept apart by themselves until the  jury have delivered their verdict and their verdict has been  recorded, or until the jury have otherwise been discharged, and  the cards shall then be returned to the box and mixed with the  other numbers then remaining undrawn, and shall be redrawn as  often as and as long as any issue remains to be tried.

(2) The affirmation shall have the same effect as if the person had  taken an oath in the usual form, and shall, if untrue, be liable to  the same penalty as a person convicted of perjury.   (3) Whenever, in any legal or other proceedings, it is necessary or  usual to state or allege that jurors have been sworn, it shall not  be necessary to specify that any particular juror has made  affirmation instead of oath, but it is sufficient to state or allege  generally that the jurors have been sworn.   950. SWEARING OF JURY COLLECTIVELY   (1) The jury may be sworn collectively in every case with uplifted  hand without kissing any book or object or repeating the words  of the oath, and each juror may swear with uplifted hand saying  after the oath has been administered “I so swear so help me  God.”   (2) If a juror objects to be sworn, he or she may be sworn in such  manner as the judge is satisfied is binding on him or her.   951.

(3) An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be  discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.   (4) Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have  the same qualifications, and have the same powers, facilities  and privileges as the regular jurors.   (5) In relation to alternate jurors, in addition to the challenges  permitted under section 958—   (a) where one person is indicted, the prosecution and the  accused person each shall be entitled to one peremptory  challenge; and   (b) where 2 or more persons are jointly indicted—   (i) each accused person shall be entitled to one  peremptory challenge,   (ii) the prosecution shall be entitled to one peremptory  challenge in respect of each person charged.

SUB-PART B   Principles of Judicial Sentencing   1096. RESTRICTIONS ON THE IMPOSITION OF CUSTODIAL  SENTENCES   (1) This section applies where a person is convicted of an offence  punishable with a custodial sentence other than one fixed by  law.   (2) Subject to subsection (3), the Court shall not pass a custodial  sentence on the offender unless it is of the opinion—   (a) that the offence, or the combination of the offence and  one other offence associated with the offence, was so  serious that only such a sentence can be justified for the  offence; or   (b) where the offence is of a violent or sexual nature, that  only such a sentence would be adequate to protect the  public from serious harm from the offender.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 477  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (3) Nothing in subsection (2) prevents the Court from passing a   custodial sentence on an offender if the offender refuses to  consent to a community sentence which is proposed by the  Court and requires that consent.   (4) Where a Court passes a custodial sentence, it is the Court’s  duty—   (a) in a case not falling within subsection (3), to state in open  Court that it is of the opinion that either or both of  subsection (2)(a) and (2)(b) apply and why it is of that  opinion; and   (b) in any case, to explain to the offender in open Court and  in ordinary language why it is passing a custodial  sentence on the offender.   (5) A Court shall cause a reason stated by it under subsection (4) to  be specified in the warrant of commitment and to be entered in  the record of the Court.   1097. LENGTH OF CUSTODIAL SENTENCES   (1) This section applies where a Court passes a custodial sentence.   (2) The custodial sentence shall be—   (a) for any term (not exceeding the permitted maximum) as  in the opinion of the Court is commensurate with the  seriousness of the offence, or the combination of the  offence and other offences associated with the offence; or   (b) where the offence is of a violent or sexual nature, for such  longer term (not exceeding that maximum) as in the  opinion of the Court is necessary to protect the pubic  from serious harm from the offender.   (3) Where the Court passes a custodial sentence for a term longer  than is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, or the  combination of the offence and other offences associated with  it, the Court shall—   (a) state in open Court that it is of the opinion that subsection  (2)(b) applies and why it is of that opinion; and   (b) explain to the offender in open Court and in ordinary  language why the sentence is for such a term.     478 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (4) A custodial sentence for an indeterminate period shall be   regarded for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) as a  custodial sentence for a term longer than any actual term.   1098. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CUSTODIAL SENTENCES   (1) Subject to subsection (2), a Court shall obtain and consider a  pre-sentence report before forming any such opinion as is  mentioned in subsection (2) of either section 1096 or section  1097.   (2) Where the offence or any other offence associated with it is  triable only on indictment, subsection (1) does not apply if, in  the circumstances of the case, the Court is of the opinion that it  is unnecessary to obtain a pre-sentence report.   (3) In forming any such opinion as is mentioned in subsection (2)  of either section 1096 or section 1097 a Court—   (a) shall take into account all such information about the  circumstances of the offence (including any aggravating  or mitigating factors) as is available to the Court; and   (b) in the case of any such opinion as is mentioned in  paragraph (b) of that subsection, may take into account  any information about the offender which is before the  Court.   (4) A custodial sentence which is passed in a case to which  subsection (1) applies is not invalidated by the failure of the  Court passing sentence to comply with that subsection but any  Court, on an appeal against such a sentence—   (a) shall obtain a pre-sentence report if none was obtained by  the Court passing sentence; and   (b) shall consider any such report obtained by it or by the  Court passing sentence.   (5) A “pre-sentence report” in this Sub-Part means a report in  writing which is made by a probation officer with a view to  assisting the Court in determining the most suitable method of  dealing with an offender.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 479  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1099. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE CASE OF MENTALLY   DISORDERED OFFENDERS   (1) Subject to subsection (2), in any case where section 1098  applies and where the offender is, or appears to be mentally  disordered, the Court shall obtain and consider a medical report  before passing a custodial sentence other than one fixed by law.   (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if, in the circumstances of the  case, the Court is of opinion that it is unnecessary to obtain a  medical report.   (3) Before passing a custodial sentence other than one fixed by law  on an offender who is or appears to be mentally disordered, a  Court shall consider—   (a) any information before it which relates to the offender’s  mental condition (whether given in a medical report, a  pre-sentence report or otherwise); and   (b) the likely effect of such a sentence on that condition and  on any treatment which may be available for it.   (4) A custodial sentence which is passed in a case to which  subsection (1) applies is not invalidated by the failure of the  Court passing sentence to comply with that subsection, but any  Court, on an appeal against such a sentence—   (a) shall obtain a medical report if none was obtained by the  Court; and   (b) shall consider any such report obtained by it or by the  Court passing sentence.   (5) In this section—   “medical report” means a report as to an offender’s mental  condition made or submitted orally or in writing by a  qualified registered medical practitioner;   “qualified” in relation to a registered medical practitioner,  means appearing to the Court to have special knowledge  and experience of cases of mental disorder.   (6) Nothing in this section prejudices the generality of section  1098.     480 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1100. SAVING FOR MITIGATION AND MENTALLY DISORDERED   OFFENDERS   (1) Nothing in this Code prevents a Court from mitigating an  offender’s sentence by taking into account any such matters as,  in the opinion of the Court, are relevant in mitigation.   (2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), nothing in  this Code prevents a Court—   (a) from mitigating any penalty included in an offender’s  sentence by taking into account any other penalty  included in that sentence; or   (b) in the case of an offender who is convicted of more than  one offence, from mitigating the offender’s sentence by  applying any rule of law as to the totality of sentences.   (3) Nothing in this Code—   (a) requires a Court to pass a custodial sentence, or any  particular custodial sentence, on a mentally disordered  offender; or   (b) restricts any power which enables a Court to deal with a  mentally disordered offender in the manner the Court  considers to be most appropriate in all the circumstances.   1101. EFFECT OF PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS ETC.   (1) An offence shall not be regarded as more serious for the  purposes of any provision of this Code by reason of any  previous convictions of the offender or any failure on the part  of the offender to respond to previous sentences.   (2) Where any aggravating factors of an offence are disclosed by  the circumstances of other offences committed by the offender,  nothing in this Code prevents the Court from taking those  factors into account for the purpose of forming an opinion as to  the seriousness of the offence.   1102. GENERAL JUDICIAL GUIDELINES   (1) Without prejudice to sections 1096 to 1101, a Court in  sentencing an offender convicted by or before the Court, shall  observe the general guidelines set forth in subsection (2).     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 481  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) The guidelines referred to in subsection (1) are as follows—   (a) the rehabilitation of the offender is one of the aims of  sentencing;   (b) the gravity of a punishment must be commensurate with  the gravity of the offence;   (c) an offender shall only not be sentenced for an offence of  which the offender has been convicted or for another  offence or other offences which the offender has asked  the Court to take into consideration in passing sentence;   (d) where a fine is imposed, the Court in fixing the amount of  the fine must take into account, among other relevant  considerations, the means of the offender so far as these  are known to the Court, regardless of whether this will  increase or reduce the amount of the fine.     SUB-PART C   Sentencing and Orders in General   1103. SENTENCING GUIDELINES   (1) Subject to section 1104 the Chief Justice may, from time to  time, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Director  of Public Prosecutions and any other relevant person or body,  issue to the district courts, Sentencing Guidelines with respect  to such offences as he or she may consider appropriate, and  these Guidelines shall be complied with by every magistrate.   (2) The guidelines may be issued by way of regulations.   (3) Where a magistrate does not comply with any such Guidelines  when passing a sentence in respect of any offence to which the  Guidelines relate, he or she shall state in writing and in open  Court, why the Guidelines were not followed in the particular  case.   1104. PUNISHMENT MAY NOT BE LESS THAN MINIMUM   Where a mandatory minimum punishment is prescribed in respect of  any offence by this Code or any other enactment, a Court may not  sentence an offender to any less punishment than that prescribed.     482 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1105. PRONOUNCEMENT OF SENTENCE   Every sentence, unless otherwise provided, shall be pronounced in  open Court in the presence of the offender, but it is not necessary that  the sentence is written out or signed in his or her presence.   1106. MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE   (1) The Court which sentenced the offender, may at any time  before imprisonment, require the attendance of the offender,  unless sentence was pronounced in his or her absence, and to  alter or modify the sentence, but shall not impose a higher  sentence than that originally pronounced.   (2) The signature of the magistrate, or proper officer of the Court to  any sentence is sufficient to authenticate the sentence.   1107. RUNNING OF SENTENCES   Where a person after conviction for a crime is convicted of another  crime, either before sentence is passed on him or her for the first  conviction or before the expiration of that sentence, any sentence  (other than sentence of death) which is passed on him or her for the  second conviction, shall be executed after the expiration of the first  sentence, unless the Court directs that it is executed in lieu of the first  sentence or of any part of the first sentence.      Terms of Orders in Cases other than for Payment of Money   1108.

PROBATION ORDERS   (1) Subject to subsection (2), where a Court by which a person is  convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for     504 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     which is fixed by law) is of opinion that having regard to the  circumstances including the nature of the offence and the  character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the Court  may, instead of sentencing him or her, make a probation order.   (2) The Court shall, before making a probation order, explain to the  offender in ordinary language the effect of the order and that, if  he or she fails in any respect to comply with the order or  commits another offence, he or she will be liable to be  sentenced for the original offence; and if the offender is not less  than 14 years of age the Court shall not make the probation  order unless he or she expresses his or her willingness to  comply with the conditions of the order.   1158. DURATION AND REQUIREMENT OF PROBATION ORDER   (1) A probation order shall have effect for such period not less than  one year from the date of the order as may be specified in the  order and shall require the probationer to—   (a) submit during that period to the supervision of a probation  officer appointed for, or assigned to the district specified  in the order, in which the probationer will reside during  the probation period; and   (b) shall contain such conditions as the Court considers  necessary for securing the supervision of the offender;  and   (c) such additional conditions as to residence; and   (d) other matters (including submission by the probationer to  medical treatment) as the Court, having regard to the  circumstances of the case, considers necessary for  securing the good conduct of the offender or for  preventing a repetition of the same offence or the  commission of other offences.

DAMAGES AND COMPENSATION   (1) A Court, on making a probation order, may, without prejudice  to its power of awarding costs against him or her, order the  offender to pay such damages for injury or compensation for  loss as the Court thinks reasonable; but in the case of an order  made by a district Court the damages and compensation  together shall not exceed $100 except where such greater sum is  allowed by any other enactment.   (2) An order for the payment of damages or compensation may be  enforced in like manner as an order for the payment of costs by  the offender.   (3) Where the Court, in addition to making an order for the  payment of damages or compensation to the person, orders the  offender to pay to that person any costs, the order for the  payment of damages or compensation and the order for the     506 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     payment of costs may be enforced as if they constituted a single  order for the payment of costs.   1160.

(3) A summons or warrant issued under this section shall direct the  probationer to appear or to be brought before the supervising  Court.

(6) A fine imposed under this section in respect of a failure to  comply with the conditions of a probation order—   (a) shall be deemed for the purposes of any enactment to be a  sum adjudged to be paid on a conviction;   (b) shall be taken into account when fixing any subsequent  sentence passed on the probationer under the provisions  of this section or of section 1162.   (7) A probationer who is required by the probation order to submit  to treatment for his or her mental condition shall not be treated  for the purposes of this section as having failed to comply with  that condition on the ground only that he or she has refused to  undergo any surgical, electrical or other treatment if, in the  opinion of the Court, his or her refusal was reasonable having  regard to all the circumstances.   (8) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 1163, a  probationer who is convicted of an offence committed during  the probation period shall not on that account be liable to be     508 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     dealt with under this section for failing to comply with any  condition of the probation order.   1162. COMMISSION OF FURTHER OFFENCE   (1) Subject to subsection (2), if it appears to a judge or magistrate  that a probationer has been convicted of an offence committed  during the probation period and has been dealt with in respect  of that offence, he or she may issue a summons requiring the  probationer to appear at the place and time specified in the  summons or may issue a warrant for his or her arrest.   (2) A magistrate shall not issue such summons or warrant, except  upon information in writing and on oath.   (3) A summons or warrant issued under this section shall direct the  probationer to appear or to be brought before the Court by  which the probation order was made, or before the supervising  Court.   (4) Where a warrant is issued requiring the probationer to be  brought before the High Court, if he or she cannot forthwith be  brought before the Court because the Court is not sitting, the  warrant shall have effect as if it directed him or her to be  brought before the magistrate of the district where he or she is  arrested, and the magistrate shall commit him or her to custody  or release him or her on bail (with or without sureties) until he  or she can be brought or appear before the High Court.   (5) If a person in respect of whom a probation order has been made  by the High Court is convicted and dealt with by a district court  in respect of an offence committed during the probation period,  the magistrate may commit him or her to custody or release him  or her on bail (with or without sureties) until he or she can be  brought to appear before the High Court; and if he or she does  so, the magistrate shall send to the High Court a copy of the  minute or memorandum of the conviction entered in the Court  register signed by the clerk of the Court together with such  other particulars of the case as may be desirable.   (6) Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court by which a  probation order was made, or to the satisfaction of the  supervising Court, that the person in whose case that order was  made has been convicted and dealt with in respect of an offence     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 509  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     committed during the probation period, the Court may deal with  him or her as if he or she had been convicted by that Court of  that offence.   (7) If a person in respect of whom a probation order has been made  by a district court is convicted before the High Court of an  offence committed during the probation period, or is dealt with  by the High Court for an offence so committed in respect of  which he or she was committed for sentence to the High Court,  the High Court may deal with him or her for the offence for  which the order was made in any manner in which the district  court could deal with him or her if it had convicted him or her  of that offence.   (8) If a person in respect of whom a probation order has been made  by a district court is convicted by another district court of any  offence committed during the probation period, the Court may,  with the consent of the Court which made the order or of the  supervising Court, deal with him or her, for the offence for  which the order was made, in any manner in which the Court  could deal with him or her if it had convicted him or her of that  offence.   1163. EFFECTS OF PROBATION   (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a conviction of an  offence for which an order is made under this Sub-Part, placing  the offender on probation shall be deemed not to be a  conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the  proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent  proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the  provisions of this Sub-Part.   (2) Where an offender, who is not less than 16 years of age at the  time of his or her conviction for an offence for which he or she  is placed on probation, is subsequently sentenced under this  Sub-Part for that offence, the provisions of subsection (1) shall  cease to apply to the conviction.   (3) Without prejudice to subsection (1), the conviction of an  offender who is placed on probation shall in any event be  disregarded for the purposes of any enactment which imposes  any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or     510 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     authorises or requires the imposition of any such  disqualification or disability.

(2) On receipt of any such report, the supervising Court shall  review the probation order for the purpose of considering  whether to cancel the condition as to residence or reduce the  period thereof, and may, if it thinks fit, amend the order  accordingly without the necessity of any application in that  behalf.   1166.

(3) The opinion referred to in subsection (1) is that the making of a  combination order is desirable in the interests of—   (a) securing the rehabilitation of the offender; or   (b) protecting the public from harm from the offender or  preventing the commission of further offences by the  offender.   1180. APPLICATION OF RELEVANT LAW TO CONSTITUENT PARTS  OF COMBINATION ORDERS   (1) Subject to section 1179, this Sub-Part applies in relation to a  combination order, in so far as the order imposes a requirement  such as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (a) or  (b) of section 1179(2), as if the order were a probation order.   (2) Subject to section 1179, this Sub-Part applies in relation to a  combination order, in so far as the order imposes a requirement  such as is mentioned in section 1179(2)(a)(ii), as if the order  were an extra mural order.   (3) Subject to section 1179, this Sub-Part applies in relation to a  combination order, in so far as the order imposes a requirement  such as is mentioned in section 1179(2)(a)(i) or 1179(2)(b)(i),  as if the order were a curfew order.     SUB-PART H   Discharge and Binding Over and Suspended Sentence   1181. DISMISSAL WITH REPRIMAND   A Court may, in its discretion, if such course appears to meet the  justice of the case, dismiss, with a reprimand only, any person  convicted of any offence not punishable with death.     520 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1182. ABSOLUTE AND CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE   (1) Where a Court by or before which a person is convicted of an  offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by  law) is of opinion, having regard to the circumstances,  including the nature of the offence and the character of the  offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a  probation order is not appropriate, the Court may make an order  discharging the offender.   (2) Such an order may discharge the offender absolutely or, if the  Court thinks fit, may discharge the offender subject to the  condition that the offender commits no offence during such  period, not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order, as may  be specified in the order; and in this Sub-Part an order of the  latter is referred to as an “order for conditional discharge” and  the period specified in the order for conditional discharge is  referred to as “the period of conditional discharge”.   (3) Before making an order for conditional discharge the Court  shall explain to the offender in ordinary language that, if the  offender commits another offence during the period of  conditional discharge, the offender will be liable to be  sentenced for the original offence.   (4) Where, under the provisions of this Sub-Part, a person  conditionally discharged under this section is sentenced for the  offence in respect of which the order for conditional discharge  was made, the order for conditional discharge ceases to have  effect.   (5) The Minister may, by order, amend subsection (2) by  substituting, for the maximum period specified in that  subsection as originally enacted or as previously amended  under this subsection, such period as may be specified in the  order.   1183. COMMISSION OF FURTHER OFFENCE BY PERSON  CONDITIONALLY DISCHARGED   (1) If it appears to a judge or a magistrate that a person in whose  case an order for conditional discharge has been made, has been  convicted in Saint Lucia of an offence committed during the  period of conditional discharge and has been dealt with in     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 521  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     respect of that offence, then, subject to subsection (2), the judge  or magistrate may issue a summons requiring that person to  appear at the time and place specified in the summons, or may  issue a warrant for that person’s arrest.   (2) A magistrate shall not issue such a summons except on  information, and shall not issue such a warrant except on  information in writing and on oath.   (3) A summons or warrant issued under subsection (1) shall direct  that the person to whom it relates appear or be brought before  the Court that made the order for conditional discharge.   (4) If a person in whose case an order for conditional discharge has  been made by the High Court is convicted in a magistrate’s  court of an offence committed during the period of conditional  discharge, the magistrate may either commit the offender to  custody, or may release the offender on bail, until the offender  can be brought before the High Court; and if the magistrate  does so, the magistrate shall send to the High Court a copy of  the record of the conviction entered in the register of the  magistrate’s court, signed by the clerk of that Court.   (5) Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that made an  order for conditional discharge that the offender in whose case  the order was made has been convicted of an offence committed  during the period of conditional discharge, the Court may deal  with the offender, for the offence for which the order was made,  in any manner in which it could deal with the offender if the  offender had just been convicted of that offence by or before  that Court.   (6) If a person in whose case an order for conditional discharge has  been made by a magistrate’s court—   (a) is convicted before the High Court of an offence  committed during the period of “conditional discharge”;  or   (b) is dealt with by the High Court for any such offence in  respect of which the offender was committed for sentence  to the High Court, the High Court may deal with the  offender, for the offence for which the order was made, in  any manner in which the magistrate’s court could deal     522 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     with the offender if it had just convicted the offender of  that offence.   1184. SUSPENDED SENTENCES   (1) A Court which passes a sentence of imprisonment on an  offender for a term of not more than 3 years for an offence, may  suspend the sentence by ordering that the sentence shall not  take effect unless—   (a) during a period specified in the order, being not less than  12 months nor more than 3 years from the date of the  order, (in this Sub-Part referred to as “the operational  period”) the offender commits in Saint Lucia another  offence punishable with imprisonment for a period  exceeding 6 months (hereafter in this section and sections  1185 and 1186 referred to as “subsequent offence”); and   (b) thereafter, a Court having power to do so, orders under  section 1185 that the original sentence shall take effect.   (2) A sentence shall not be suspended under subsection (1) if the  offence involved the illegal use or possession of a firearm or the  offence was in furtherance of drug trafficking or other drug  related offence.   (3) A Court shall not deal with an offender by means of a  suspended sentence unless the case appears to the Court to be  one in respect of which a sentence of imprisonment would have  been appropriate in the absence of power to suspend such a  sentence by an order under subsection (1).   (4) A Court which passes a suspended sentence on an offender for  an offence shall not make a probation order in the offender’s  case in respect of another offence of which the offender is  convicted by or before the Court.   (5) Where a Court passes a suspended sentence on an offender in  respect of an offence and also a term of imprisonment in respect  of another offence, the Court shall direct that the suspended  sentence be concurrent with the term of imprisonment.   (6) On passing a suspended sentence, the Court shall explain to the  offender in ordinary language the offender’s liability under     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 523  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     section 1185, should the offender commit a subsequent offence  during the operational period.   1185. SUBSEQUENT OFFENCE DURING OPERATIONAL PERIOD   (1) Subject to subsection (3), where an offender is convicted of a  subsequent offence committed during the operational period of  a suspended sentence, the Court by or before which the  offender is convicted of the subsequent offence may order that  the suspended sentence shall take effect with the original term  unaltered, or the Court may substitute a lesser term of  imprisonment for the original term.   (2) Where a Court deals with an offender in respect of a suspended  sentence passed by another Court, the former Court shall notify  the latter Court of the manner in which the offender was dealt  with.   (3) Where an offender in respect of whom a suspended sentence  passed by the High Court is in operation is convicted of an  offence by a magistrate’s court, the magistrate’s court shall  forward to the Registrar of the High Court a Certificate signed  by the magistrate and under the seal of the magistrate’s court  certifying that the offender has been convicted of a subsequent  offence, together with such other particulars of the case as the  magistrate may consider desirable.   (4) On receipt of the certificate, a Judge of the High Court before  whom the offender is brought may, without prejudice to the  order of the magistrate with respect to the subsequent offence,  order that the suspended sentence shall take effect with the  original term unaltered or with the substitution of a lesser term  for the original term.   1186. DISCOVERY OF FURTHER OFFENCE   (1) Where a person has been convicted by, or before a Court, of a  subsequent offence committed during the operational period of  a suspended sentence, but that Court was not at the time aware  of the suspended sentence or of some feature affecting the  operation of that sentence, any Court may, on receipt of  information relating to that suspended sentence, or that feature,     524 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     as well as the conviction of the subsequent offence, issue a  summons requiring that person to appear at the place and time  specified in the summons, or may issue a warrant for that  person’s arrest.   (2) A summons or warrant issued under subsection (1) shall direct  that the person appear, or be brought before the Court by or  before which the person was convicted in respect of the  subsequent offence and, upon that person so appearing or being  so brought, the Court shall proceed to exercise its powers under  section 1185 in respect of the suspended sentence.     SUB-PART I   Fines, Forfeitures, Compensation Etc.   1187. APPROPRIATION OF FINES AND OTHER MONEY TO USE OF  STATE   Subject to the provisions of this Code or any other enactment, every  fine recovered in the Court in respect of a contravention of any of the  provisions of any enactment, and also the proceeds of any seizure or  forfeiture made or incurred subject to the process of the Court, shall  be paid into the Treasury for the use of the State.   1188. POWER TO SELL OR DISPOSE OF NON-PECUNIARY  FORFEITURES   Subject to the express provisions of any enactment, all forfeitures not  of a pecuniary nature which are incurred in respect of an offence  triable by the Court, or which may be enforced by the Court, may be  sold or disposed of in such a manner as the Court may direct, and the  proceeds of such sale shall be applied in the same manner as if the  proceeds were a fine imposed under the enactment on which the  proceeding for the forfeiture is founded.   1189. LEVY AS IN CIVIL ACTIONS ON CONVICTION FOR  DEFAMATION   When any person is convicted of the unlawful publication of any  defamatory matter, the prosecutor may elect to levy the fine, if any,  and costs out of any property of the offender in like manner as in civil     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 525  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     actions, in which case all further criminal proceedings in execution or  recovery or otherwise in respect of the fine and costs, if any, shall  cease, and a registration of a certificate of the proceedings in such  case shall have the same effect as the registration of a judgment in a  civil case.      General Powers as to Payments of Money   1190. ALTERNATIVE POWERS IN GENERAL   (1) The Court, by whose order any sum of money is adjudged to be  paid, may exercise all or any of the following powers,  namely—   (a) allow reasonable time for payment of the sum;   (b) direct payment of the sum to be made by reasonable  instalments;   (c) direct that the person liable to pay the sum may give, to  the satisfaction of the Court security, with or without a  surety or sureties, for the payment of the sum or of any  instalment thereof, and such security may be given and  enforced in the manner provided in subsection (2);   (d) order a garnishee of the person’s income;   (e) use any other power which the Court thinks fit to ensure  payment of the sum adjudged.   (2) Where the Court directs that the sum be paid by instalments, if  the person liable to make such payments defaults in the  payment of any one instalment, the same proceedings may be  taken for recovery of the whole sum as if he or she is in default  of payment of all the instalments then remaining unpaid.   1191. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PAYMENT OF ADJUDGED SUM   Where time has been allowed by the Court for the payment of the  sum adjudged to be paid by the offender on an application by, or on  behalf of the offender, the Court shall allow further time for the  payment of the sum by instalments.     526 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1192. PERIODICAL PAYMENTS THROUGH OFFICE OF COURT OR   SPECIFIED PERSON   (1) Where a Court orders money to be paid periodically by one  person to another, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order that the  payment shall be made through an officer of the Court or any  other person or officer specified in the order.   (2) An order made for the periodical payment of money may, upon  cause being shown upon fresh evidence to the satisfaction of the  Court, be revoked, revived, or varied by a subsequent order of  the Court.   (3) Any order made by the Court under this section, shall be subject  to such directions as to remuneration to be paid to any officer or  person as well as any fund from which remuneration may be  paid, or to such other directions as may be given by the Court.

POSTPONEMENT OF ISSUE OF WARRANT OF COMMITMENT  FOR NON-PAYMENT   Where an application is made to the Court to issue a warrant for  committing a person to a correctional facility for non-payment of  money adjudged to be paid by an order, the Court may, if it deems it  expedient so to do, postpone the issue of such warrant until such time  and on such conditions, if any, as the Court may consider just.   1194. SEARCHING PERSON ORDERED TO PAY MONEY   (1) Where a person has been adjudged to pay a sum—   (a) by a conviction of a Court, or   (b) in proceedings in any Court for enforcing an order in any  matter of bastardy, or an order under which weekly sums  are made payable towards the maintenance of a wife, the  Court may order him or her to be searched and any money  found on him or her, or which may be found on him or  her when taken to the correctional facility in default of  payment of the sum adjudged to be paid by him or her,  may, if the Court so directs, be applied towards the     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 527  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     payment of such sum, and the balance, if any, shall be  returned to him or her.   (2) Any money found on the person shall not be applied in the  manner stated in subsection (1) if the Court is satisfied that the  money does not belong to the person, or that the forfeiture of  the money will be more injurious to his or her family than his or  her imprisonment or for other sufficient cause.   1195. FINE OR PENALTY MAY NOT BE LESS THAN MINIMUM   Subject to the provisions of this Code or any other enactment relating  to any offence, a Court may not sentence the person convicted before  it of an offence punishable by penalty or fine, to any less penalty or  fine, than the mandatory minimum penalty or fine prescribed by this  Code, or such other enactment for such offence.      Fines in Indictable Cases   1196.

(3) Where a person convicted of any indictable offence is  sentenced to pay a fine, the Court may direct that, if he or she  fails to pay the fine at the time appointed for the payment, he or  she shall be liable to imprisonment until the fine is paid.

(2) No such imprisonment shall exceed 12 months in duration, and  the judge may, at any time, order the discharge of any such  inmate.   (3) The return of the Commissioner of Police or the correctional  officer to any writ of habeas corpus of an arrest or detention  under any judgment or order of the Court for non-payment of  any fine or forfeiture imposed or incurred, shall be deemed  sufficient in law, if it contains or has attached to it a certificate  by the Registrar, setting forth the judgment or order by virtue of  which such arrest or detention was made.

(2) The judge or magistrate may, unless the person satisfies him or  her that he or she does not intend to leave the State, rescind so  much of the order as allows time for payment or for payment by  instalments, and issue such warrant of commitment or other  process as might have been issued at the hearing but for the  order allowing time for payment or payment by instalments.

(2) Where there is no fine or sum of money to be recovered by the  order, such costs, or costs and compensation, shall be  recoverable in the same manner as any fine or sum of money  adjudged to be paid by an order of the Court is recoverable, as  the Court may direct.   1207.

SAVING OF RIGHT OF CIVIL ACTION   Except as otherwise provided in section 1207, nothing in this Code,  shall bar the action of any person in respect of any injury sustained by  him or her or his or her property.   1209.

ORDER AGAINST COMPLAINANT TO PAY COSTS OR  COMPENSATION   Where a complaint is dismissed, the Court may order that the  complainant shall pay to the defendant such costs as the Court may  consider just and reasonable, and if in the opinion of the Court the  complaint was frivolous or vexatious, it may, in addition, order the  complainant to pay to the defendant a reasonable sum as  compensation for the inconvenience and expense to which the  defendant may have been put by reason of such complaint.

SUB- PART J   Distress   1221. CASES IN WHICH DISTRESS LEVIABLE   Subject to the provisions of this Sub-Part, any sum of money  adjudged to be paid by an order shall, if the enactment under which  the order is made so directs and in the discretion of the Court may be  levied upon the movable property of the offender by distress and sale  thereof.     Laws of Saint Lucia Criminal Code Cap.3.01 535  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     1222.

CASES IN WHICH DISTRESS MAY BE REFUSED   When an application is made to the Court for a warrant of distress and  it appears to the Court—   (a) that the offender has no movable property on which to  levy the distress;   (b) that in the event of a warrant of distress being issued, his  or her movable property will be insufficient to satisfy the  sum of money adjudged to be paid by the order;   (c) that the levy of the distress will be more injurious to him  or her or his or her family than imprisonment,   or for any other sufficient reason, the Court may, if it thinks fit,  instead of issuing the warrant of distress, order the offender, on non- payment of the adjudged sum, to be imprisoned, for any term not  exceeding the term prescribed in relation to a like sum under section  1202.   1224. DETENTION OR RELEASE OF OFFENDER DURING DISTRESS  PROCEEDINGS   Where a warrant of distress is issued, the Court may either allow the  offender to go at large or, by a warrant in that behalf, order him or her  to be kept and detained in safe custody until return has been made to  the warrant, unless the offender gives sufficient security by  recognizance or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court, for his or  her appearance before the Court at the time or extended time and  place appointed for the return of the warrant.   1225. PERSONS AUTHORISED TO EXECUTE DISTRESS   (1) A warrant of distress issued by the High Court may be executed  anywhere within the State by a sheriff’s officer or by any other  person, so directed.     536 Cap.3.01 Criminal Code Laws of Saint Lucia  Revision Date: 31 Dec. 2005     (2) If a warrant of distress is issued by a magistrate, it shall   authorise the distress and sale of the movable property of the  offender within the local limits of the magistrate’s jurisdiction  and also outside such limits by the bailiff or other proper officer  of any such jurisdiction, or any person so directed.   1226. POWER OF ENTRY TO EXECUTE DISTRESS   (1) If a person charged with the execution of a warrant of distress is  prevented from executing the warrant by the fastening of doors,  or otherwise, he or she may open the doors by all necessary  means using such force as may be required, in the presence of 2  witnesses, one of whom must be a police officer, if possible, the  sergeant or other officer in charge of the police station in the  district.   (2) Any action taken under subsection (1) is without prejudice to  any imprisonment or other punishment or penalty to which a  person is otherwise liable for obstructing by refusal, violence or  other physical impediment the execution of any warrant of  distress.   1227. PROPERTY AVAILABLE FOR DISTRESS   Where a warrant of distress is issued by the Court, it shall authorise  the person charged with the execution of the warrant, to take any  money as well as any goods of the person against whom the distress  is levied, and any money so taken shall be treated as if it were the  proceeds of sale of goods taken under the warrant.   1228. PROPERTY EXEMPTED FROM DISTRESS   The wearing apparel and bedding of a person and his or her family, as  well as the tools and implements of his or her trade to the value of  $1,000 shall not be taken under a warrant of distress.   1229.

TIME WITHIN WHICH DISTRESS TO BE SOLD   Subject to section 1231, the property shall be sold within the time  fixed by the warrant, and, if no time is so fixed, within the period of  14 days (unless the time is enlarged), from the date of the making of  the distress; provided the sum for which the warrant was issued, and  also the charges in respect of taking and keeping the property, are  sooner paid.   1231. DUTIES OF PERSON EXECUTING WARRANT   A person charged with the execution of any warrant of distress shall  sell the property or cause it to be sold, and may deduct out of the  amount realised by such sale all costs and charges actually incurred in  effecting the sale, and shall pay to the proper officer of the Court or to  the person specified by him or her, the remainder of the amount  which may be applied in payment of the sum for which the warrant  was issued, including the proper costs and charges incurred in respect  of the execution of the warrant, and the balance, if any, may be paid  to the person upon whose movable property the distress was levied,  or to such other person as the Court may order or direct.   1232.

OPPOSITION TO LEVY OR ON PROCEEDS OF SALE   All objections to the levy as well as all claims or objections to the  proceeds of sale must be made and filed with the person charged with  the execution at any time before the day of sale, unless the Court  allows a further time for that purpose, in which case the Court may  give such directions with respect to the sale, including the  postponement of the sale as it may consider just.   1235. RANKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF CLAIMS   The amount to be levied shall rank by privilege on the proceeds of the  distress and sale after the expenses and costs thereof in case no  adverse claim or opposition has been duly filed, but if there is any  such claim or opposition, the proceeds shall be distributed as in civil  proceedings, subject in the case of dispute to the decision or direction  of the Court.   1236. SATISFACTION OF DISTRESS   Where any person, against whom a warrant of distress is issued, pays  or tenders to the person charged with the execution of the warrant, the  sum stated in the warrant or produces to him or her, the receipt for  payment of such sum issued by the proper officer of the Court, and  also pays the amount of the costs and charges of such distress up to  the time of payment or tender of payment, the person so charged shall  cease to execute the warrant.

POWER TO ORDER IMPRISONMENT IF DISTRESS  INSUFFICIENT   Where a return is made by the person charged with the execution of  the warrant to the effect that no sufficient movable property of the  offender can be found on which to levy the distress, or where the  amount levied on the property is insufficient, the Court may order the  offender, on non-payment of the sum of money adjudged to be paid  by the order as well as all costs and charges of the distress and of the  commitment, to be imprisoned, for any term not exceeding the term  prescribed in relation to a like sum under section 1202 of this Code.

(2) The Court may, at any time, cancel or mitigate the forfeiture,  upon the person liable applying and giving security, to the  satisfaction of the Court, for the future performance of the  condition of the recognizance, and paying, or giving security  for the payment of the costs incurred in respect of the forfeiture,  or upon such other conditions as the Court may think just.

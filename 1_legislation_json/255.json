TITLE TWO   CRIMINAL OFFENCE      1. General Provisions on Criminal Offences      Criminal Offence      Article 5    A criminal offence shall be an act which is established by law as a criminal  offence, which is unlawful, and for which guilt was determined.      Manner of Commission of Criminal Offence      Article 6    (1) A criminal offence may be committed by commission or omission.    (2) A criminal offence was committed by omission when the perpetrator omitted  to do what he was obliged to do.    (3) Omission may result in a criminal offence even when the act committed is not  established by law as omission provided that the perpetrator satisfied the elements of a  criminal offence by omitting to do what he was obliged to do.      Time of Commission of Criminal Offence      Article 7    (1) A criminal offence shall be considered to have been committed at a time when  the principal acted or was obliged to act, irrespective of when the consequence of that act  occurred.    (2) An accomplice shall be considered to have committed a criminal offence at a  time when he acted or was obliged to act.      Place of Commission of Criminal Offence        Article 8    (1) A criminal offence shall be considered to have been committed at a place  where the principal acted and was obliged to act or where the consequence of the act  occurred in whole or in part, and in case of attempts also at a place where the  consequence of an attempted act according to his wrongful intent should have or could  have occurred.    (2) An accomplice shall be considered to have committed an offence also at a  place where he acted in the capacity of an accomplice.      Petty Offences      Article 9   -deleted-      Legitimate Self-defense      Article 10    (1) An act committed in legitimate self-defense shall not constitute a criminal  offence.    (2) Legitimate self-defense is such defense which is absolutely necessary for one  to defend his good and good of another person from a concurrent or imminent unlawful  attack.    (3) Where a perpetrator exceeded the limits of legitimate self-defense, he may  receive a lighter punishment, and where the use of excessive power was caused by strong  excitement or fear due to an assault, punishment may be remitted.      Extreme Necessity      Article 11    (1) An act committed in extreme necessity shall not constitute a criminal offence.    (2) Extreme necessity is a condition under which a perpetrator committed an act  to eliminate concurrent or imminent danger to his good or good of another person which  he did not cause and which could not have been eliminated in any other manner,  provided that the harm caused thereby does not exceed the harm threatened.    (3) Where a perpetrator caused danger by negligence, or where he exceeded the  limits of extreme necessity, he may receive a lighter punishment, and where he exceeded  the limits under particularly mitigating circumstances, punishment may be remitted.    (4) Where a perpetrator was under an obligation to expose himself to the danger  threatened, such an act may not constitute extreme necessity.        Force and Threat      Article 12    (1) An act which was committed under the influence of absolute force shall not  constitute a criminal offence.    (2) If a perpetrator committed a criminal offence to eliminate danger to his good  or good of another person and where such danger was represented by either force which  is not absolute or a threat, the perpetrator shall be subject to the provisions of Art.11  hereof mutatis mutandum, and the force and threat shall be considered to be a danger  which he did not cause.    (3) If a perpetrator committed a criminal offence under force or threat, where the  conditions referred to in paras 1 and 2 hereof are not met, the perpetrator thereof may  receive a lighter punishment, and where such an offence was committed under  particularly mitigating circumstances, punishment may be remitted.   (4) In the cases referred to in paras 1 and 2 hereof, where the person who was  under force or threat is not considered to be the principal of that criminal offence, then  the person who applied force or threat shall be considered to be the principal.      Culpability      Article 13   (1) Considered to be guilty of a criminal offence shall be a perpetrator who is of  sound mind and who acted with wrongful intent, and was aware or was obliged to be  aware or could have been aware that his act was prohibited.

Mental Capacity      Article 14   (1) A perpetrator shall be considered to have been mentally incapacitated where  at the time of commission of an unlawful act which constitutes a criminal offence he was  unable to understand the effects of his act or could not control his actions due to a  mental illness, temporary mental alienation, arrested mental development or other  severe mental alienation (mental incapacity).   (2) A perpetrator whose capacity to understand the effects of his act or to control  his actions was substantially diminished due to any of the conditions referred to in para.  1 hereof (significantly reduced mental capacity) may receive a lighter punishment.   (3) The culpability of a perpetrator who due to the use of alcohol, drugs or other  circumstances brought himself to a state in which he could not understand the effects of     his acts or control his actions shall be determined based on the time immediately  preceding such state.   (4) A perpetrator who under the circumstances referred to in para. 3 hereof  committed a criminal offence in the state of significantly reduced mental capacity may  not receive a lighter punishment.      Wrongful Intent      Article 15   A criminal offence shall be considered to have been committed with wrongful  intent when the perpetrator was aware of his act and desired its commission or when the  perpetrator was aware that he could commit an act and decided to commit it.      Negligence      Article 16   A criminal offence shall be considered to have been committed by negligence  when the perpetrator was aware that his action may result in an offence but carelessly  assumed that it would not occur or that he could prevent it if it occurred, or when he was  not aware that with his act he may commit an offence although given the circumstances  under which the offence was committed and his personal capacity he should have been  aware or could have been aware of this possibility.      Liability for Severe Consequence      Article 17   When a criminal offence resulted in a severe consequence for which law provides  for a more severe punishment, the perpetrator may receive such more severe  punishment where with respect to that consequence he acted with negligence, but also if  he acted with wrongful intent provided that the act committed does not contain elements  of another criminal offence.      Error of Fact      Article 18    (1) An act committed under an irreparable error of fact shall not constitute a  criminal offence.      (2) An irreparable error of fact exists where a perpetrator was not obliged to   avoid and could not have avoided the error with respect to a factual circumstance     regarded as an element of crime or with respect to a factual circumstance which, had it  existed, would have made the act lawful.      (3) If the perpetrator acted under an error of law due to negligence, the act shall   constitute a criminal offence committed by negligence where so provided by law.      Error of Law      Article 19    (1) An act committed under an irreparable error of law shall not constitute a  criminal offence.     (2) An irreparable error of law exists where a perpetrator was not obliged to know  and could not have known that the act he committed was prohibited.     (3) Where a perpetrator was not aware that the act was prohibited but was obliged  to know or could have known it was prohibited, he may receive a lighter punishment.      2. Attempted Criminal Offence and Voluntary Abandonment      Attempt      Article 20   (1) Anyone who commences the commission of a criminal offence with wrongful  intent but does not complete it shall be punished for attempted criminal offence  punishable under law by a prison term of five years or longer, whereas other attempted  criminal offences shall only be punishable where it is explicitly provided for by law that  the punishment also applies to an attempt.    (2) Also considered to be the commencement of a crime is the use of a specific  tool or the application of a specific method of commission provided that they are defined  by law as elements of the crime.   (3) A perpetrator shall be punished for an attempt by the punishment laid down  for the criminal offence, but may also receive a lighter punishment.      Inappropriate Attempt      Article 21   Where a perpetrator attempted to commit a criminal offence with an  inappropriate tool or against an inappropriate object punishment may be remitted.      Voluntary Abandonment        Article 22   (1) Where a perpetrator attempted to commit a criminal offence but has  voluntarily abandoned its commission punishment may be remitted.    (2) Where a perpetrator voluntarily abandoned the commission of a criminal  offence, he shall receive punishment for the acts that constitute another separate  criminal offence which is not covered by the criminal offence that the perpetrator  abandoned.      3. Complicity in Criminal Offence     Principal and Co-principal     Article 23   (1) A principal shall be a person who commits a criminal offence himself or a  person who carries out the crime through another person provided that this other person  can not be considered to be the principal.     (2) Where several persons jointly take part in the commission of a crime with   wrongful intent or by negligence, or where they follow their prior arrangement and  jointly act with wrongful intent and thus make a significant contribution to the  commission of the criminal offence, each person shall receive a punishment prescribed  for the crime in question.      Instigation      Article 24   (1) Anyone who acts with wrongful intent to instigate another person to commit a  criminal offence shall receive a punishment as if he committed the crime by himself.   (2) Anyone who acts with wrongful intent to instigate another person to commit a  criminal offence which carries a five year prison term or a more severe punishment but  does not even attempt commission shall receive the punishment laid down by law for the  attempted criminal offence.      Aiding      Article 25   (1) Anyone who acts with wrongful intent to aid another in the commission of a  criminal offence shall be punished as if he committed it himself, but may receive a lighter  punishment.   (2) The following, in particular, shall be considered as aiding in the commission  of a criminal offence: giving counsel or instructions on how to commit the crime,  supplying the perpetrator with the means for commission of the crime, creating     conditions or removing obstacles to the commission of crime as well as promising one  prior to the commission to conceal the crime, a perpetrator, the means by which the  crime was committed, any traces of the crime, or the proceeds of crime.      Limits of Liability and Punishment of Accomplices      Article 26   (1) Co-principal liability is defined by his wrongful intent or negligence, and  instigator and aider liability by their wrongful intent.   (2) Where a co-principal, instigator or an aider voluntarily prevented the  commission of a criminal offence, punishment may be remitted.   (3) Personal relations, capacity and circumstances for which the law excludes  culpability or allows for the remission of punishment and which serve as ground to  qualify an offence as serious or minor, or have an impact on the punishment imposed,  may apply only to the principal, co-principal, instigator or aider with whom such  relations, capacity and circumstances exist.      Punishment of Instigator and Aider for   Attempt and for Minor Criminal Offence      Article 27   (1) Where the commission remains incomplete, the instigator and aider shall  receive a punishment for an attempt.   (2) Where the principal commits a minor criminal offence than the one that  instigation or aiding refers to and which would have been contained in it, the instigator  and aider shall receive punishment for the criminal offence committed.   (3) The provision of para. 2 hereof shall not apply if the instigator would receive a  more severe punishment under Art.24, para. 2, hereof.      Special Provisions on Liability for Criminal Offences   Committed through Media      Liability of Editor-in-chief      Article 28   (1) Liability for criminal offences committed through media shall be borne by the  editor-in-chief or a person replacing him at the time of publication of the information  provided that:   1) until the end of the main hearing before a first instance court the  author remains unknown,     2) the information was published without the consent of the author,   3) at the time when the information was published there existed, and  still exist, factual or legal obstacles to prosecuting the author.

Criminal Liability of Legal Persons      Article 31    (1) Criminal liability of legal persons and sanctions to be applied thereto shall be  laid down by law.      TITLE THREE   PUNISHMENT     1. Purpose of Punishment, Types of Punishment and Requirements  for their Imposition      Purpose of Punishment      Article 32   Within the general purpose of criminal sanctions (Art.4, para. 2), the purpose of a  punishment shall be to:    1) prevent a perpetrator from commission of criminal offences and influence him  not to commit criminal offences in the future;    2) influence others not to commit criminal offences;    3) express social condemnation of the criminal offence and emphasize that  everyone has a duty to abide by law;    4) strengthen morality and promote social responsibility.      Types of Punishments      Article 33   Perpetrators may receive the following punishments:    1) forty-year prison term;    2) prison term;    3) fine;    4) community work.      Principal and Accessory Punishments      Article 34    (1) A forty-year prison term, a prison term and community work may be imposed  only as principal punishments.    (2) A fine may be imposed as both a principal and accessory punishment.    (3) Where a single criminal offence carries several punishments, only one of them  may be imposed as the principal punishment.      Forty-year Prison Term      Article 35      (1) A forty-year prison term may be prescribed for the most serious criminal  offences provided that it is not prescribed as the only punishment for a specific criminal  offence.    (2) A forty-year prison term may not be imposed on the following:    1) a person who at the time of commission of a criminal offence is not 21;   2) a person who at the time of commission of a criminal offence is of   significantly reduced mental capacity (Art.14, para. 2);    3) a person who attempted to commit a criminal offence.      Prison Term      Article 36    (1) A prison term may not be shorter than thirty days or longer than twenty years.    (2) The prison term referred to in para. 1 hereof shall be imposed in full years and  months, and terms up to six months shall be imposed also in days.      Parole      Article 37    (1) A prisoner who has served two thirds or, exceptionally, has served a half of his  prison term or his forty year prison term may be released on parole provided that during  his prison term he has improved his behaviour to an extent that it can be reasonably  expected that his behaviour outside of prison will be good and, in particular, that he will  not reoffend during his service of the remainder of the punishment. In deciding whether  a prisoner meets the requirements for parole, due consideration shall be given to his  conduct during the service in prison, his fulfillment of work obligations, which is  assessed with respect to his capacity, as well as to other circumstances that indicate that  the purpose of the punishment has been achieved.   (2) The decision granting a prisoner parole may order that he fulfills an  obligation set by law.    (3) In the case referred to in para. 1 hereof, the prisoner shall be considered to  have served his punishment provided that the parole is not revoked.      Revocation of Parole      Article 38    (1) Parole shall be revoked by court where during his parole the convicted person  commits one or more criminal offences that carry a prison term over one year, or where  he omits to fulfill an obligation ordered by law.    (2) Parole may be revoked by court if the person on parole commits one or more  criminal offences which carry a prison term up to one year. In deciding whether to     revoke parole, the court shall consider in particular any links between the criminal  offences committed, their respective motives and other circumstances which may show  that revocation of parole is justified.    (3) The provisions of paras 1 and 2 hereof also apply when the person on parole is  tried for a criminal offence that he committed before his release on parole.    (4) When a court revokes parole it shall impose punishment by applying the  provisions of Articles 48 and 50, para. 2 hereof and shall consider previously imposed  punishment as already established. Part of the punishment that the convicted person has  served under the previous conviction shall be included in the new punishment, while the  time spent on parole shall not be included.    (5) Where a person on parole is sentenced to a prison term up to one year, and  the court does not revoke parole, the parole shall be extended by the time he spent  serving that prison term.    (6) In the cases referred to in paras 1 through 3 hereof, the parole may be revoked  not later than within two years of the date when the parole expired.      Fine      Article 39    (1) A fine may not be set at below two hundred euros. A fine may not exceed  twenty thousand euros, while for criminal offences committed out of greed it may not  exceed one hundred thousand euros.    (2) When imposed as the principal punishment, a fine shall be set as follows:   1) up to two thousand euros for criminal offences punishable by a prison term up  to three months;   2) from four hundred to four thousand euros for criminal offences punishable by  a prison term up to six months;   3) from six hundred to eight thousand euros for criminal offences punishable by  a prison term up to one year;   4) from eight hundred to sixteen thousand euros for criminal offences punishable  by a prison term up to two years;   5) minimum one thousand two hundred euros for criminal offences punishable  by a prison term up to four years;    6) minimum one thousand two hundred euros for criminal offences which carry  a fine as the only punishment.   (3) For criminal offences committed out of greed the fine as an accessory  punishment may be imposed even when it is not prescribed by law, or when law  prescribes that a perpetrator shall be punished by either a prison term or a fine, and the  court imposes a prison term as the principal sentence.   (4) Where the court imposes a fine as the principal punishment and additionally  imposes a fine as an accessory punishment, a single fine shall be imposed under the rules  laid down in Art.48 hereof.     (5) The court ruling shall specify the term of payment which may not be shorter  than fifteen or longer than three months. Where so justified, the court may allow the  convicted person to pay the fine in installments, provided that the payment deadline is  not longer than within one year.   (6) Where a convicted person does not pay a fine within the deadline set thereof,  the court shall replace the fine by a prison term by substituting each twenty-five euro  amount in his fine by one day of prison term, provided that the prison term does not  exceed six moths, and where a fine exceeding nine thousand euros is imposed, the prison  term may not be longer than one year.   (7) Upon prior consent of the convicted person, an outstanding fine not  exceeding two thousand euros may be substituted by community work and not by a  prison term. Each twenty-five euro amount of his fine shall be substituted by eight hours  of community work, provided that the community work does not exceed three hundred  and sixty hours.    (8) Where the convicted person pays only part of the fine, the court shall  substitute the remainder by a prison term on a pro rata basis, and where the convicted  person pays the remainder of the fine, his service of the prison term shall be suspended.   (9) The fine may not be enforced in the event of death of the convicted person.      Amount of Daily Fine      Article 40   (1) In the cases when it is possible to establish the perpetrator’s assets and  liabilities, the court may pronounce a fine in daily amounts.   (2) The number of daily fines may not be less than ten or more than three  hundred and sixty. The number of daily fines to be imposed for the criminal offence  committed shall be set in accordance with the general rules on fixing of punishment as  laid down in Art.42 hereof.     (3) The amount of daily fine shall be determined by dividing the difference   between the perpetrator’s assets and liabilities in the previous calendar year by the  number of days in a year, whereby the daily fine must be more than five and less than  one thousand euros.    (4) The total amount of fine shall be calculated by the court by multiplying the  number of daily fines by the amount of the daily fine.   (5) In determining the value of daily fines the court may request data from banks  and other financial institutions, state authorities and legal entities which shall  communicate the data requested and which may not invoke protection of business or  other secrets.   (6) Where it is not possible to obtain reliable data on perpetrator’s assets and  liabilities, or where the perpetrator does not earn any income but is the owner of  property or holder of property rights, the court shall use the available data and  determine the amount of daily fine at its own discretion.   (7) The provisions of Art. 39, paras 3 through 9 hereof shall also apply when a  fine is imposed in compliance with the above provisions.        Community Work      Article 41    (1) Community work may be imposed for criminal offences punishable by a fine  or prison term up to five years.    (2) Community work may be imposed for minimum sixty and maximum three  hundred and sixty hours to be served over a period of time not shorter than thirty days or  longer than six months.    (3) This punishment shall be imposed upon prior consent of the perpetrator and  may not be served for longer than sixty hours in a month.   (4) Community work shall be considered to be any work which is beneficial for  society, does not harm one’s dignity, and is not done for any gain.   (5) In pronouncing this punishment, the court shall give due consideration to the  type of the criminal offence committed and the perpetrator’s personality.   (6) If a perpetrator omits to complete his community work, this punishment shall  be replaced by a prison term, whereby each sixty hour period of community work  initiated will be substituted by one month prison term.      2. Fixing of Punishment      General Rules for Fixing Punishment      Article 42   (1) The court shall fix the punishment for the perpetrator of a criminal offence  within the statutory limits for that particular offence taking into account the purpose of  punishment and giving due consideration to any circumstances which result in lighter or  more severe punishment (mitigating and aggravating circumstances) as well as the  following, in particular: degree of culpability, motives for the commission of offence,  degree of peril or injury to the protected good, circumstances under which the offence  was committed, perpetrator’s history, his personal situation, his behaviour after the  commission of criminal offence, particularly his attitude towards the victim of the  criminal offence as well as any other circumstances concerning the perpetrator’s  personality.   (2) In fixing a fine the court shall give particular consideration to the  perpetrator’s financial situation.   (3) The circumstance which is an element of the criminal offence may not be  additionally taken into consideration as either an aggravating or mitigating  circumstance, except where it exceeds the measure required for establishing the criminal  offence or a certain form of criminal offence, or where there are two or more such  circumstances of which only one is sufficient for the establishment of a more serious or  minor form of the criminal offence.        Reoffending      Article 43   When fixing punishment for a perpetrator who has reoffended after he has served  a punishment, been forgiven a punishment, had his punishment barred by the statute of  limitations, or has had his punishment remitted after the deadline for revocation of  parole has expired, or after he has been imposed judicial admonition, the court can take  this as an aggravating circumstance while at the same time giving due consideration to  the seriousness of the prior offence, whether his prior offence is of the same kind as the  new one, whether both offences were committed out of the same motives, as well as to  the circumstances under which the offences were committed and how much time has  passed since the earlier conviction or since the punishment imposed, forgiven or barred  by the statute of limitations, since the remission of punishment, expiry of the deadline  for revocation of an earlier suspended sentence or since the judicial admonition  imposed.      Multiple Reoffending      Article 44   (1) For a criminal offence which was committed with wrongful intent and which  is punishable by a prison term, the court may impose a more severe punishment than the  punishment provided for by law on condition that:    1) the perpetrator has already been convicted twice or more times for criminal  offences committed with wrongful intent to a prison term of minimum one year, and that  he shows propensity for offending;    2) less than five years passed from his release from service of the previous  punishment to the commission of the new criminal offence.   (2) The more severe punishment may be pronounced for maximum twice the  amount of the punishment provided for by law, and for maximum twenty year prison  term.   (3) In assessing whether to impose a more severe punishment than the  punishment provided for by law, the court shall give due consideration in particular to  the number of prior convictions, any relations between such prior criminal offences,  motives out of which they were committed, circumstances under which the offences were  committed, and the need to impose such punishment in view of the purpose of  punishment to be achieved.      Mitigation of Punishment      Article 45   The court may impose on a perpetrator a punishment below the limit laid down  by law or a lighter punishment provided that:      1) a lighter punishment is provided for by law;    2) remission of punishment is provided for by law, but the punishment does not  get remitted by court;    3) it is established that there were particularly mitigating circumstances and it is  assessed that a mitigated punishment will be sufficient to achieve the purpose of  punishment.      Limits of Mitigation of Punishment      Article 46    (1) Where the requirements for mitigation of punishment referred to in Art.45 of  this Code are met, the court shall impose a lighter punishment, subject to the following  limits:   1) if the criminal offence carries a minimum prison term of five years or  longer, the punishment may be mitigated up to two year prison term;   2) if the criminal offence carries a minimum prison term of three years or  longer, the punishment may be mitigated up to one year prison term;    3) if the criminal offence carries a minimum prison term of two years,  the punishment may be mitigated up to six month prison term;    4) if the criminal offence carries a minimum prison term of one year, the  punishment may be mitigated up to three month prison term;    5) if the criminal offence carries a minimum prison term under one year,  the punishment may be mitigated up to thirty day prison term;    6) if the criminal offence carries a prison term for which minimum term  is not specified, the punishment may be replaced by a fine;    7) if the criminal offence carries a fine for which the lowest amount is  specified, the punishment may be mitigated to six hundred euro.   (2) When the court is authorized to remit punishment to a perpetrator, the  punishment may be mitigated without taking into consideration the limits prescribed for  mitigation of punishment.      Remission of Punishment      Article 47   (1) Punishment may be remitted by court only where so explicitly provided for by  law.   (2) Punishment may also be remitted by court where a perpetrator committed an  offence by negligence and where the consequences of that offence affect the perpetrator  to an extent that makes it reasonable to believe that imposition of punishment would not  serve its purpose.     (3) Punishment may also be remitted by court where a perpetrator committed a  criminal offence punishable by maximum five year prison term provided that after the  commission but before he learned he was uncovered he had eliminated the consequences  of the offence or had compensated the damage inflicted by the criminal offence.      Concurrence of Criminal Offences      Article 48   (1) Where a perpetrator by one or more acts committed several criminal offences  for which he is tried at the same time, the court shall first pronounce the punishment for  each of the respective criminal offences, and then impose a cumulative punishment for  all the offences.   (2) A cumulative punishment shall be imposed by the court subject to the  following rules:    1) where for one of the concurrent criminal offences the court pronounced  a forty year prison term, the court shall impose that punishment only;    2) where for concurrent criminal offences the court pronounced prison  terms, the court shall increase the most severe punishment fixed, provided that  the cumulative punishment is shorter than the sum of individual punishments  fixed and that it does not exceed twenty year prison term;    3) where all of the respective concurrent criminal offences carry a prison  term of up to three years, the cumulative punishment may not exceed ten year  prison term;    4) where for concurrent criminal offences the court pronounced only  fines, the court shall impose a cumulative fine which amounts to the sum of  individual fines provided that it does not exceed twenty thousand euros, or a  hundred thousand euros where one or more criminal offences were committed  out of greed; and where the court pronounced only daily fines, they may not  exceed the amount of three hundred and sixty thousand euros;       5) where for concurrent criminal offences the court pronounced  community work as the only punishment, the court shall impose a cumulative  punishment of community work which amounts to the sum of hours of work to  be served, provided that the punishment does not exceed three hundred and  sixty hours and that the period within which the community work must be done  does not exceed six months;    6) where for some concurrent criminal offences the court pronounced  prison terms and fines for other concurrent criminal offences, the court shall  impose a cumulative prison term and a single fine, under the provisions of  subparagraphs 2 through 4 of this paragraph.

(2) Criminal offences against person may constitute a continuing criminal offence  only when committed against the same person.   (3) Offences that due to their nature may not be joined into a single offence may  not constitute a continuing criminal offence.   (4) Where a continuing criminal offence comprises minor and more serious  forms of the same offence, the most serious form of the offences committed shall be  considered to constitute a continuing criminal offence.   (5) A continuing criminal offence may be punished by a more severe punishment  than the punishment provided for by law provided that the continuing criminal offence  consists of at least three criminal offences that meet the requirements referred to in para.  1 hereof.     (6) A more severe punishment may not exceed twice the punishment laid down   by law or exceed a twenty year prison term.

The punishment or part of punishment that the  convicted person has served will be included in the prison term pronounced.   (2) Where a convicted person is tried for a criminal offence committed during his  service of a prison term or a juvenile prison term, the court shall impose a punishment     irrespective of the previously imposed punishment if the purpose of punishment may not  be achieved by applying the provisions of Art.48 hereof, taking into account the  seriousness of the criminal offence and the part of earlier punishment not yet served.   (3) A convicted person who during his service of a prison term or a juvenile  prison term commits a criminal offence which is punishable by law by either a fine or up  to one year prison term shall receive a disciplinary punishment.

TITLE FOUR   WARNING MEASURES      1. Suspended Sentence and Judicial Admonition      Purpose of Suspended Sentence and Judicial Admonition      Article 52   (1) Warning measures shall be: suspended sentence and judicial admonition.   (2) Within the general purpose of criminal sanctions (Art.4, para. 2), the purpose  of a suspended sentence and judicial admonition shall be to avoid imposition on the  perpetrator of a punishment for minor criminal offences when that is considered not  necessary for criminal law protection and when it is reasonable to expect that  admonition, together with imminent punishment (suspended sentence) or an     admonition alone (judicial admonition), will have sufficient influence on the perpetrator  to deter repeat offending.      Suspended Sentence      Article 53   (1) By pronouncing a suspended sentence the court pronounces a punishment  and orders at the same time that such punishment shall not be enforced provided that  the convicted person does not reoffend within a term set by the court for not shorter than  one or longer than five years (probation term).   (2) The court may specify in the suspended sentence that the punishment shall be  enforced if the convicted person does not return the pecuniary gain obtained through the  commission of the criminal offence or does not compensate for the damage he caused by  the commission of criminal offence or does not fulfill any other obligations provided for  in criminal law provisions. The deadline by which these obligations must be fulfilled  shall be set by the court within the probation term prescribed.   (3) Security measures which are imposed together with a suspended sentence  shall be enforced.      Conditions for Imposing Suspended Sentence      Article 54   (1) A suspended sentence may be imposed when the perpetrator is pronounced a  prison term up to two years.   (2) A suspended sentence may not be imposed for criminal offences punishable  by a prison term up to ten years or a more severe punishment.   (3) A suspended sentence may not be imposed unless more than five years have  passed since the date of the finality of the judgment of conviction for an offence  committed with wrongful intent. A suspended sentence may not be imposed on a  perpetrator who has already been imposed two suspended sentences.   (4) When determining whether to impose a suspended sentence, the court shall  take into account the purpose of the suspended sentence and give particular  consideration to the perpetrator’s personality, his personal history, his behaviour after  the commission of the criminal offence, the degree of guilt and other circumstances  under which the offence was committed.   (5) If both a prison term and a fine are pronounced on a perpetrator, a suspended  sentence may be imposed only for the prison term.      Revocation of Suspended Sentence due to New Criminal Offence      Article 55     (1) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence if during his probation term the  convicted person commits one or more criminal offences and receives a prison term of  two years or longer.    (2) Where during his probation term the convicted person commits one or more  criminal offences and receives a prison term of less than two years or a fine, the court  shall decide whether to revoke the suspended sentence after having reviewed all the  circumstances of the offences committed and the perpetrator himself, and in particular  the relatedness of committed criminal offences, their importance and motives out of  which they were committed. The court shall thereat be limited by the rule that a  suspended sentence may not be imposed if the perpetrator should be imposed  punishment of more than two years in prison for criminal offences determined in the  suspended sentence and for the new criminal offences (Art.54, para. 1).    (3) Where the court revokes a suspended sentence, it shall impose a cumulative  prison term by applying the provisions of Art.48 hereof for both the previously  committed and the new criminal offence by taking the punishment from the revoked  suspended sentence as already imposed.    (4) Where the court does not revoke a suspended sentence, it can impose a  suspended sentence or a punishment for the new criminal offence. A convicted person  who receives a prison term for the new criminal offence shall not have the period served  in prison included in the probation term pronounced under the suspended sentence for  the previous offence.    (5) Where the court finds that a suspended sentence should also be imposed for  the new criminal offence, the court shall pronounce a cumulative punishment for both  the earlier and the new criminal offence under the provisions of Art.48 hereof and shall  specify a new probation term for minimum one and maximum five years counting from  the date of finality of the new judgment. If the convicted person commits a criminal  offence during his new probation term, the court shall revoke the suspended sentence  and impose a prison term by applying the provision of para. 3 hereof.      Revocation of Suspended Sentence   due to Prior Criminal Offence      Article 56    (1) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence if, after its imposition, the court  establishes that the convicted person committed a criminal offence prior to the  imposition of a suspended sentence and if the court finds that there would have been no  grounds for the imposition of a suspended sentence had the existence of that offence  been known. In such a case, the provision of Art.55, para. 3 hereof shall apply.    (2) If the court does not revoke a suspended sentence, provision of Art.55, para. 4  hereof shall apply.      Revocation of Suspended Sentence due to   the Omission to Fulfill Specific Obligations        Article 57    Where under the suspended sentence the convicted person is ordered to fulfill  any of the obligations referred to in Art.53, para. 2 hereof, and where he omits to comply  within the time limit provided for in the judgment, the court may, within the limits of  probation term, extend the deadline for fulfilling the obligation or it may revoke the  suspended sentence thereof and impose the punishment pronounced in the suspended  sentence. If the court establishes that the convicted person may not fulfill the obligation  for justified reasons, the court shall relieve him of the duty to comply or replace it by  other appropriate obligation laid down by law.      Time-limits for Revocation of Suspended Sentence      Article 58    (1) A suspended sentence may be revoked during the probation term. During this  term, if a convicted person commits a criminal offence which entails a revocation of the  suspended sentence, whereas it is determined by the judgment only after the expiry of  the probation term, the suspended sentence may be revoked within maximum one year  of the date the probation term expired.    (2) If a convicted person does not fulfill an obligation referred to in Art.53, para.  2 hereof within the time limit set, the court may order within maximum one year of the  date when the probation term expired that the punishment pronounced in the suspended  sentence be enforced.      Suspended Sentence with Protective Supervision      Article 59    (1) The court may order that the perpetrator who has been imposed a suspended  sentence be placed under protective supervision for a specific period of time during the  probation term.    (2) Protective supervision includes the measures of assistance, care, supervision  and protection, as laid down by law.      Conditions for Ordering Protective Supervision      Article 60    (1) When a court imposes a suspended sentence it may order that a perpetrator  be placed under protective supervision if on account of his personality, personal history,  behaviour after the commission of criminal offence, and particularly his attitude to the  victim of the criminal offence and the circumstances of commission of the criminal  offence it may be reasonably expected that the protective supervision will better serve the  purpose of the suspended sentence.      (2) Protective supervision shall be ordered by the court in the judgment by which  it imposes the suspended sentence and pronounces the measures of protective  supervision, their duration, and manner for their implementation.      Obligations While under Protective Supervision      Article 61    Protective supervision may comprise one or more of the following obligations:    1) reporting to a competent authority in charge of enforcement of protective  supervision within the time limits specified by that authority;    2) training of the perpetrator for a particular profession;    3) accepting a job appropriate to the abilities and propensities of the perpetrator;    4) fulfillment of the obligations to support family, care and bring up children and  carry out other family obligations;    5) refraining from visiting certain places, bars or events if that may be a chance or  incentive for repeat offending;    6) timely reporting of any change of residence, address or job;    7) refraining from the use of drugs and alcohol;    8) treatment in an appropriate medical institution;    9) visiting particular professional and other counseling offices or institutions and  following their instructions;    10) eliminating or mitigating the damage inflicted by the criminal offence in  question, and in particular reconciliation with the victim of the crime.      Selection of Measures of Protective Supervision      Article 62    When selecting the obligations referred to in Article 61 hereof and determining  their duration, the court shall take into account in particular the age of perpetrator, his  health condition, propensities and habits, motives for the commission of criminal  offence, behaviour after commission of criminal offence, personal history, personal and  family situation, conditions for fulfilling the obligations ordered as well as other  circumstances which are related to the perpetrator’s personality and which bear  relevance to the selection of the measures of protective supervision and their duration.         Duration of Protective Supervision      Article 63      (1) The duration of the measures of protective supervision shall be set within the  limits of the probation term specified in the suspended sentence.    (2) Protective supervision shall be terminated by revocation of the suspended  sentence.    (3) During the period of protective supervision the court may, in consideration of  the results achieved, order cancellation of certain obligations or their replacement with  other obligations.    (4) Where in the course of protective supervision the court finds that the purpose  of this measure has been achieved the protective supervision may be terminated before  expiration of the time period for which it was ordered.      Consequences of Noncompliance while under Protective Supervision      Article 64    Where a convicted person who received protective supervision does not fulfill the  obligations ordered by the court, the court may admonish him or replace previous  obligations with other obligations or extend the protective supervision within the limits  of the probation term or revoke the suspended sentence.      Judicial Admonition      Article 65    (1) Judicial admonition may be imposed for criminal offences which carry a  prison term of maximum one year or a fine and which were committed under such  mitigating circumstances which render them particularly minor.    (2) For certain criminal offences and under the conditions provided for by law, a  judicial admonition may be imposed even for the offences which carry a prison term not  exceeding three years.    (3) Judicial admonition may be imposed by the court for several criminal  offences committed in concurrence, provided that the conditions referred to in paras 1  and 2 above have been established for each of these respective criminal offences.    (4) When deciding whether to impose a judicial admonition, the court shall,  taking into account the purpose of the judicial admonition, consider in particular the  personality of the perpetrator, his personal history, his behaviour after the commission  of criminal offence, specifically his relationship towards the victim of crime, the degree  of guilt and other circumstances under which the offence thereof was committed.    (5) A judicial admonition may not be imposed on military persons for criminal  offences against the Army of Montenegro.        TITLE FIVE   SECURITY MEASURES      Purpose of Security Measures      Article 66    Within the general purpose of criminal sanctions (Art.4, para. 2), the purpose of  security measures shall be to eliminate the situations or conditions which might  influence a perpetrator to reoffend.

(4) Mandatory medical treatment of drug addiction, mandatory medical  treatment of alcoholism, disqualification from a profession, activity or duty, driving  prohibition, confiscation of objects and publication of the judgment may be imposed if  the perpetrator has already received punishment, suspended sentence or judicial  admonition or if his punishment has been remitted    (5) The measure of expulsion of a foreign national from the country may be  imposed provided that the perpetrator has already received punishment or suspended  sentence.

(5) The time spent in a medical institution by the perpetrator who committed a  criminal offence in the state of significantly diminished mental capacity and who has  been punished by prison term shall be included in the prison term imposed. If the period  spent in a medical institution is shorter than the duration of the punishment imposed,  once the security measure ends, the court shall order that the convicted person serves  the remainder of punishment or be released on parole. In taking a decision on the release  on parole, the court shall give due consideration in particular to the success of the  treatment, his health condition, the time spent in a medical institution and the  remainder of punishment not yet served, in addition to the conditions referred to in  Art.37 hereof.      Mandatory Outpatient Psychiatric Treatment        Article 70    (1) A perpetrator who in the state of mental incapacity committed an unlawful act  which constitutes a criminal offence by law shall be imposed the measure of mandatory  outpatient psychiatric treatment provided that the court determines that there is serious  threat that the perpetrator may commit an unlawful act which constitutes a criminal  offence by law and that in order to eliminate this threat his outpatient treatment will be  sufficient.    (2) The measure referred to in para. 1 above may be imposed also on a mentally  incapacitated perpetrator on whom mandatory psychiatric treatment and placement in  an appropriate medical institution have been imposed when the court establishes on the  basis of the results of such treatment that his placement and treatment in that institution  is no longer needed, and that his outpatient treatment would suffice.    (3) Under the conditions referred to in para. 1 above, the court may also impose  mandatory outpatient psychiatric treatment on a perpetrator whose mental capacity was  significantly diminished provided that he was imposed a suspended sentence or was  released on parole pursuant to Art.69, para. 5 hereof.

Selection of Attendance Order      Article 80d   1) In selecting an attendance order, the relevant public prosecutor and the court, in  accordance with their respective powers, shall take into consideration the entire interests  of the juvenile and the victim, and shall in so doing make sure that the implementation  of one or more attendance orders does not interfere with the juvenile’s school or work  obligations.   2) Attendance orders may be implemented for not longer than six months, in which  period it can be replaced by another attendance order or be suspended.   (3) Selection and implementation of attendance orders shall be done in collaboration  with the juvenile’s parents, adoptive parents or guardians and the competent  guardianship authority.

Purpose of Correctional Measures and Juvenile Prison      Article 82   Within the general purpose of criminal sanctions (Art.4, para. 2), the purpose of  correctional measures and juvenile prison shall be to provide protection and support to  juvenile criminal offenders by way of supervision, vocational education and development  of a sense of personal responsibility in order to allow them to be educated, reformed, and  properly developed. The purpose of a juvenile prison term is to exert positive influence  on juvenile offenders to prevent repeat offending, as well as to deter other juveniles from  criminal offending.      2.

Selection of Correctional Measure        Article 84    In selecting a correctional measure, the court shall take into consideration the  juvenile’s age, maturity, other qualities, propensities, level of neglect in terms of their  personal and educational development, motive for which the crime was committed,  overall living environment before the commission, seriousness of the crime, whether the  juvenile has previously received any correctional measures or sanctions and any other  circumstances that may assist in the selection of the measure which best serves its  purpose.      Imposition of Correctional Measures      Article 85   (1) Disciplinary measures shall be imposed on a juvenile who need not be  submitted to extended correctional measures and, particularly, if he committed a  criminal offence out of recklessness or levity.

(4) Together with the measure of referral to a juvenile correctional facility, the  court may also order that the juvenile, following the service of this measure, be placed  under direct supervision by his guardian.      Direct Supervision by Parents, Adoptive Parents or Guardian      Article 88    (1) The measure of direct supervision by parents, adoptive parent or guardian  shall be ordered by the court where the parents, adoptive parent or guardian are able to  provide this supervision and where they can be reasonably expected to provide it.

Such work may last thirty hours within a  single month, and may be done within a time period not shorter than one month or  longer than four months. In pronouncing this obligation, the court shall make sure this  does not interfere with the juvenile’s school or work obligations.    (3) A parent, adoptive parent or guardian of a juvenile who has received one or  more obligations under para. 1 above shall inform the guardianship authority in time  about any change or longer absence from his permanent or temporary residence.

(2) When deciding whether to impose the measure referred to in para. 1 above,  the court shall particularly take into account the degree of neglect of the juvenile,  seriousness and nature of the criminal offence committed, and whether he has  previously received any correctional measures or a juvenile prison term.   (3) A juvenile shall stay at correctional home for not shorter than one or longer  than four years, whereby the court shall have the authority to order suspension of the  measure during its service.      Release on Parole from Correctional Home        Article 94    (1) A juvenile who has spent at least one year at correctional home may be  released on parole where based on the outcome of correction and reformation process, it  can be reasonably expected that he will not reoffend and that he will show good conduct  in his living environment.   (2) The court may order that throughout the period of parole the juvenile be  imposed a correctional measure of direct supervision.   (3) Release on parole may last for not longer that the legal term set for referral to  a correctional home provided that the court has previously not suspended enforcement  of the correctional measure or replaced it with another measure.   (4) If the juvenile commits a crime during his parole or if he does not fulfil the  obligations ordered together with a direct supervision measure, the court may revoke his  parole.

(3) Where the measure under para. 1 above was imposed instead of the measure  of referral to a community-based correctional facility or of referral to a correctional  home, the juvenile may stay in the special education and treatment facility for not longer  than three years. If this measure was imposed instead of a security measure, the juvenile  may stay in the special education facility for as long as it is necessary, and when he  reaches the age of twenty-three, the enforcement of the measure will continue in an  institution where the security measure of mandatory psychiatric treatment and the  measure of care in a psychiatric institution are served.

(2) Save for the cases under para. 1 above and provided no other provisions are  envisaged for respective correctional measures, a direct supervision measure or an  institutional measure may, in view of the success of the reformation process, be  suspended from enforcement, but may also be replaced by another measure that will  better achieve the purpose of the correctional measures. The suspension of enforcement  or replacement by another measure from within a set of institutional measures shall be  subject to the following limitations:   1) the measure of referral to a community-based correctional facility may  not be suspended within six months of its beginning, during which  period it may be replaced by the measure of referral to a correctional  home or a special education and treatment facility.   2) the measure of referral to a correctional home may not be suspended  within one year, during which period it may be replaced with the  measure of referral to a community-based correctional facility or a  special education and treatment facility.      Re-examination of Correctional Measures      Article 97   (1) Where more than two years have passed since the date of final decision  ordering a correctional measure of direct supervision or an institutional measure, and  where the enforcement has not yet started, the court shall re-examine the need to  enforce the pronounced measure. In so doing, the court may decide that a previously  ordered measure be enforced, be not enforced, or be replaced with another measure.

Fixing the Punishment of Juvenile Prison   Article 103    (1) A court shall fix the punishment of juvenile prison within the statutory limits  envisaged for such punishment, taking into account the very purpose of juvenile prison,  as well as all circumstances that may make the punishment more or less severe and  particularly the degree of the juvenile’ s mental development and the time needed for his  education, reformation and vocational training.   (2) A court may not impose a juvenile prison term for a specific criminal offence  for a period of time exceeding the prison term laid down by law for that offence, but shall  not be bound by the minimum term laid down for that punishment      Fixing the Punishment of Juvenile Prison   for Concurrent Criminal Offences      Article 104   (1) Where an older juvenile commits several concurrent criminal offences, and  the court establishes that one of these offences carries the punishment of juvenile prison,  the court shall fix a cumulative punishment for all these offences within the limits laid  down in Art.101 hereof.   (2) Where the court finds that for one of the concurrent criminal offences an  older juvenile should be punished, and that for other criminal offences he should be  imposed correctional measures, the court shall impose only a juvenile prison term for all  concurrent criminal offences.   (3) The court shall proceed in the manner referred to in paras 1 or 2 above even  when after it has imposed the punishment it establishes that the convicted person, either  before or after the imposition, committed another criminal offence      Time Bar for the Enforcement of Juvenile Prison Term      Article 105   The punishment of juvenile prison term may not be enforced where:   1) ten years have passed since the date of conviction to a juvenile prison term  over five years;   2) five years have passed since the date of conviction to a juvenile prison term of  over three years;     3) three years have passed since the date of conviction to a juvenile prison term  up to three years.

Effect of Punishment on Correctional Measures      Article 107    Where within the term of a correctional measure the court imposes the  punishment of a juvenile prison term on an adult (Art.110, para 3) or a prison term  (Art.110, para 4) for one year or longer, the correctional measure shall be terminated  upon commencement of the prison term, and where a prison term is imposed for a  shorter term, the court shall specify in its judgment whether following the service of  punishment the enforcement of the correctional measure will continue or whether that  measure will be suspended.      Effect of Correctional Measures and of Juvenile Prison Term         Article 108   (1) Correctional measures and a juvenile prison term shall not give rise to any  legal consequences which consist of prohibition to acquire certain rights.    (2) Persons serving the measure of referral to a correctional home or juvenile  prison term shall be disqualified, for the term of the correctional measure or juvenile  prison term, from any work or functions in state authorities, local self-government  authorities, business organisations or other entities that operate using state-owned  property or in organizations entrusted by law with the exercise of public powers.

Such a person may be punished only by a direct  supervision measure to be enforced by a guardianship authority or an appropriate  institutional correctional measure. In deciding which of the measures to impose, the  court shall take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the  seriousness of the crime, the time that has passed since the commission, as well as the  perpetrator’s behaviour, and the purpose of the correctional measure.   (3) An adult tried for the criminal offence he committed as an older juvenile may  receive only the measure of direct supervision to be enforced by a guardianship authority  or an appropriate institutional correctional measure and, subject to the requirements  under Art.100 hereof, also a juvenile prison term. In deciding which of the sanctions to  impose, the court shall take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and in  particular the seriousness of the crime, the time that has passed since the commission, as  well as the perpetrator’s behaviour, and the purpose of the correctional measure.   (4) Notwithstanding para. 3 above, an adult who at the time of trial is twenty-one  or older, may instead by a juvenile prison term be imposed a prison term the duration of  which is set in accordance with Articles 101 and 104 hereof.

(2) A young adult who was imposed a correctional measure may be imposed all  security measures, subject to the conditions set by this Code, except for the measure of  prohibition to engage in a profession, activity or duty.

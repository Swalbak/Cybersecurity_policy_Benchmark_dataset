(5) Annual fees shall be set out under subsection (3) only   in such manner and to such extent as is reasonably required   to ration the use of radio spectrum bands for which the   Telecommunications Commission reasonably expects   demand to exceed supply.   (6) Unless provided otherwise in a licence including a   right to use particular radio spectrum bands, the price paid for   the acquisition of such licence shall be deemed to have   included all fees payable for the right to use such radio   spectrum bands and no annual or other fee may be prescribed   under subsection (3) in respect of the right to use such radio   spectrum bands.        72   (7) The Telecommunications Commission may, by order  or direction, made on application or on its own motion,  declare that any radio spectrum that has been duly assigned  to a person is comprised of two or more separate allocations   by geographical area.   (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the  Telecommunications Commission may define the  geographical boundaries of the separate allocations as it  thinks fit, provided that the sum of the geographical areas of  the separate allocations is equal to the geographical area of   the original allocation.   (9) Where an original allocation is assigned without  geographical boundaries, its geographical area shall be   deemed to be national.   (10) For the avoidance of doubt, the separate allocations  described in subsection (7) shall remain assigned to the  person to whom the original allocation was assigned.   (11) The Telecommunications Commission may by order  or direction made on application or on its own motion,  without compensation, declare that all radio spectrum  assigned within any frequency band is assigned on a non-  exclusive basis, and make further allocations of spectrum in  that frequency band to any other person or persons:  PROVIDED THAT all the conditions in subsection (12) are   satisfied.   (12) The conditions referred to in subsection (11) are,  after a public consultation period of at least three months, the  Telecommunications Commission makes a determination that   (a) the amount of unallocated radio spectrum in  the frequency band, and in any other  frequency band that is a reasonable alternative  to that frequency band, is not reasonably  sufficient for another person to provide a  commercially viable service; and   (b) __ use of radio spectrum in the frequency band  by multiple licensees on a shared basis can be  achieved efficiently and without undue harm  to licensees with existing allocations of radio  spectrum in that frequency band.        73   58. (1) The Telecommunications Commission may, by order Vacation of radio  or direction, made on application or on its own motion, without   spectrum without  compensation   compensation, declare vacant any radio spectrum that has been duly  assigned to a person, and may assign such spectrum to a different person on  any of the grounds under subsection (2) and in accordance with the  determination under subsection (3).   (2) The grounds referred to in subsection (1) are —   (a)   (b)   (©)   (d)   ()   ®   where the spectrum is assigned under an  individual service licence, such vacation or  reassignment is necessary or appropriate to  comply with or conform to the laws of  Solomon Islands or international treaties,   commitments, recommendations or standards   legally binding Solomon Islands;   the person previously assigned the relevant  radio spectrum agrees to vacate it;   the person previously assigned the relevant  radio spectrum has failed to comply with this  Act or a determination, order, direction,   licence or condition under this Act relating to  radio spectrum and has failed to cure the  failure within a reasonable time following  service of written notice specifying failure  and requiring cure;   the person previously assigned the relevant  radio spectrum made in connection with the  assignment to it of the radio spectrum any  false statement of a material fact or omitted  to state a material fact necessary in order to  make the statements made, in the light of the  circumstances under which they were made,   not misleading;   the person previously assigned the relevant  radio spectrum has entered into liquidation,  takes any action for its voluntary winding-up  or dissolution, or is the subject of any order  by a court or tribunal for its compulsory  winding-up or dissolution; or   the person has entered into receivership  except if the person and the                 Vacation of radio  spectrum with  compensation   74   59.   Telecommunications Commission are  satisfied that the person is likely to remain,  in full compliance with the terms and  conditions of its licence despite entering into   receivership.   (3) If after a public consultation (including consultation   with the Ministry) period of at least three months, the   Telecommunications Commission makes a determination that   (a) any radio spectrum is not in significant use  in the entire country or in a geographic area;   (b) the person to whom such spectrum was  assigned has not committed to plans to make  significant use of the spectrum in the entire  country or the relevant geographic area in the  reasonably foreseeable future; and   (c) there is demonstrable demand from other  persons for making efficient use of all or part  of such radio spectrum in the entire country  or the relevant geographic area,   the Telecommunications Commission may, make an order or   direction under subsection (1) in relation to such spectrum   taking into account its existing usage and technical   requirements.   (4) The Telecommunications Commission shall allow   any person required to vacate any spectrum duly assigned to   it a reasonable period of time to vacate such spectrum taking   into account its existing usage and technical requirements.   (1) The Telecommunications Commission may, by order   or direction made on application or on its own motion, require a person to   vacate radio spectrum then assigned to the person, and may assign such   radio spectrum to a different person on grounds other than those in section   58(2) if£—   (a) necessary or expedient to further the  objective in section 3 and to promote the  public benefit;           75   (b) there is reasonable justification for the  causing of any hardship that may result to   any licensee; and   (c) where the spectrum is assigned in an  individual service licence, such vacation or  reassignment is necessary or appropriate to  comply with or conform to the laws of  Solomon Islands or international treaties,  commitments, recommendations or standards   legally binding Solomon Islands   (2) The Telecommunications Commission shall provide   written notice to a person previously assigned radio spectrum   that the Telecommunications Commission intends to vacate   the relevant radio spectrum pursuant to subsection (1) and   such person may within thirty days appeal to the High Court   for the determination of the person’s interest or right, the  legality of the vacation of the spectrum, and the   reasonableness of the compensation and the period of time   within which the person shall be paid compensation.   (3) The Telecommunications Commission shall pay, or   shall procure that new persons assigned the relevant radio   spectrum pay, reasonable compensation (the valuable   consideration of which may take the form of cash or some  other form and may be payable by way of lump sum or by  instalments) within a reasonable period of time after the   vacation of radio spectrum under this section having due   regard to all the relevant circumstances.   (4) The Telecommunications Commission shall to the   extent possible assign to a person who is required to vacate   any spectrum where subsection (1)(c) applies appropriate   available alternative spectrum in order to allow such person   to continue its business without unreasonable cost or   disruption.   PART 8 —- COMPETITION   (1) Subject to section 61, no person shall engage in a Ant coe tee   practice or enter into a contract, arrangement or understanding which has the   purpose, effect, or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening   competition in a telecommunications market.        76      (2) Without limitation, a practice of a service provider or   a contract, arrangement or understanding between two or   more service providers is prima facie likely to have the effect   of substantially lessening competition in a   telecommunications market if it or the person engaging in it   directly or indirectly—   (a)   (b)   (c)   @   ()   ()   (g)   fixes the retail prices or other conditions of   trading of a telecommunications service;   apportions, shares or allocates a  telecommunications market or markets   among themselves or other service providers,   prevents or restricts the supply or acquisition   of a telecommunications service to or from a   person or class of persons;   requires or unfairly induces a supplier to  refrain from selling to another service   provider;   imposes unfair restrictions on whom another   person may deal with in a  telecommunications market;   competes unfairly in a telecommunications   market by cross-subsidising a service in such   market from a service that is not supplied in   a competitive telecommunications market, or   competes unfairly in a retail   telecommunications market by reducing the   margin of profit available to a competing   service provider in such market by effecting   a “margin squeeze” whereby it offers the   retail telecommunications service at a price   that is so low, or provides to a competitor in   such retail market a wholesale  telecommunications service or access used  by the competitor to provide the retail   service at a price that is so high, as to prevent   the profitable competitive provision of the   retail service, where in either case the  wholesale service or access —              77   (i) is not supplied in an effectively  competitive telecommunications   market;   (ii) is necessary for the competitor to  provide the retail service; and   (iii) cannot for economic, technical or  legal reasons reasonably be  duplicated by the competitor;   (h) supplies a telecommunications service at  prices below cost for a substantial period of  time such that competitors are reasonably  likely to be driven from the market;   @ bundles a telecommunications service that is  supplied in an effective competitive  telecommunications market with a service  that is not supplied in an effective  competitive telecommunications market in  circumstances where a discount is applied to  the effectively competitive service sold as  part of the bundle and such discount is not  available if the effectively competitive  service is acquired on its own;   @) pre-emptively acquires or secures scarce  facilities or resources, including rights of  way, required by another service provider for  the operation of its business, with the   purpose of unfairly denying the use of the  facilities or resources to the other service   provider; or   (k) adopts technical specifications for networks  or facilities with the purpose of preventing  interoperability with another service  provider’s network or facility.   (3) The Telecommunications Commission may, by   determination, order, regulation or direction, identify or by   regulation prescribe other practices which have the purpose,   effect, or are likely to have the effect, of substantially   lessening competition in a telecommunications market.           a   78   (4) The Telecommunications Commission may, by  determination, order, regulation or direction, exempt a  practice, contract, arrangement or understanding from the  prohibition in subsection (1) if it—   (a)   (b)   contributes to improving the provision or  distribution of telecommunications services or  to promoting technical, social or economic  progress or the objective in section 3 while  allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting  benefit; and   does not afford a person engaging in such  practice or entering into such contract,  arrangement or understanding the possibility of  eliminating competition in respect of a  substantial part of the telecommunications  services in question.   (5) In considering the effective competitiveness of and  effects on a telecommunications market, the  Telecommunications Commission shall have regard to —   (a)   (v)   (c)   (d)   (e)   the extent to which actual or potential service  providers constrain the conduct of another  service provider, having regard to such  factors as significant barriers to entry and  expansion;   the extent to which users have the ability to  constrain the market conduct of a service  provider, having regard to such factors as the  interchangeability or substitutability of  services by reason of their characteristics,  prices or intended uses;   the extent to which the market conduct ofa  service provider is constrained by  countervailing bargaining power;   the extent to which the conditions of  competition are similar in any geographical  area; and   the reliability and availability of relevant  information and the time, expertise and other                 4 .    79   resources available to it to analyse such  information.   (6) The existence of any of the purposes specified in  subsections (1) and (2) may be inferred from the conduct of  any relevant person or from any other relevant circumstances.   61. Notwithstanding section 60, a contract, arrangement or Safe harbour for   understanding among competing service providers to use, own or hold an facilities sharing   interest together in facilities, or lease or otherwise share facilities in order to   reduce unnecessary duplication of costs, does not contravene that section   if   (a) the terms of such contract, understanding or  arrangement do not unreasonably preclude sharing  such facilities with other service providers on non-  discriminatory terms; and   (b) such facilities are essential facilities or it is otherwise  unlikely that significant efficiencies would result  from the service providers separately acquiring and   using such facilities.   PART 9 -INTERCONNECTION AND ACCESS   62. Subject to this Act, any determination, order, direction or Commercial   licence issued under this Act or any other applicable law, service providers negotiation  are at liberty to negotiate, conclude and amend agreements with one another  for interconnection, access and other services, including the type and amount  of charges, in such manner and on such conditions as are mutually   acceptable to the service providers.   63. (1) A service provider has the right and, when requested aleve rade   by another service provider in writing, the obligation to negotiate and  endeavour to conclude an interconnection agreement with another service   provider.   (2) A service provider shall —   (a) respond within a reasonable time to a request  for negotiation and meet all reasonable  requests for interconnection at any  economically and technically feasible point  of its network;           80   (b)   (c)   @)   (e)   @   (g)   (h)   offer conditions that maintain end-to-end  operability in order to facilitate the provision  of telecommunications services by an  interconnecting service provider to the user  notwithstanding that the user is directly  connected to a different network;   incorporate in its interconnection agreement  reasonable conditions, including without  limitation with respect to the timing, quality,  technical, operational and fault handling   terms;   ensure that such conditions—   @ do not unfairly discriminate among  service providers; and   (ii) —_ are no less favourable to other  interconnecting service providers than  those it provides for its own  telecommunications services or those   of its affiliates;   offer interconnection on the terms in its   reference offer, if any, approved under   section 65;   provide access to such of its facilities,  systems, software and services as are   reasonably required by the interconnecting  service provider to interconnect and provide  telecommunications services to its users;   make available to other service providers on  a timely basis information, including  technical specifications and commercially  relevant information that is reasonably  required by the interconnecting service  provider to interconnect and provide  telecommunications services to its users;   not disclose or otherwise use information  received from other service providers in  connection with interconnection to obtain a  competitive advantage or for any purposes  other than for which it was supplied; and                 81   (i) take such other steps as may be required by  determination, order or direction in order to  ensure timely and effective interconnection.   64. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), a service provider Access to essential   has the obligation to negotiate and endeavour to conclude an agreement on  facilities   access to its essential facilities with a service provider which requests such   access in writing.   (2) A service provider shall—   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   ()   respond to a request for negotiation from,  and within a reasonable time meet all  reasonable requests for access to any of its   essential facilities;   incorporate in its access agreement  reasonable conditions, including without  limitation with respect to the timing, quality,  technical, operational and fault handling   terms;   ensure that such conditions—   (i) do not unfairly discriminate among  service providers; and   (ii) are no less favourable to other  service providers than those it  provides for its own  telecommunications services or  those of its affiliates;   make available to other service providers on  a timely basis information, including  technical specifications and commercially  relevant information that is reasonably  required by the other service providers to  provide telecommunications services to its   users;   not disclose or otherwise use information  received from other service providers in  connection with access to essential facilities  to obtain a competitive advantage or for any  purposes other than for which it was   supplied;       Reference offers   82   65.   (f) provide access to its essential facilities in a  manner that is sufficiently unbundled to  enable another service provider to access the  facilities that it reasonably requires in order  to provide its telecommunications services;  and   (g) take such other steps as may be required by  determination, order or direction in order to  ensure timely and effective access to  essential facilities.   (3) The Telecommunications Commission may, by  determination, order or direction, determine a facility to be   an essential facility.   (4) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply until the  fourth anniversary of the new entrant launch date and  thereafter shall only apply upon a determination of the  Telecommunications Commission made on application or on  its own motion that the provisions of this section are  necessary to further the objective in section 3.   (1) — Subject to subsection (4), the Telecommunications  Commission may, by order or direction, require one or more service   providers —   (a) to prepare, periodically update and revise a  reference offer for approval by the  Telecommunications Commission in such  manner and within such time, as the  Telecommunications Commission may, by  regulation, prescribe;   (b) to address in its reference offer such matters  as the Telecommunications Commission  considers necessary and expedient for the  effective implementation of the reference  offer; and   (c) to publish its reference offer on its website  and send a copy to any service provider on  request.   (2) For the purposes of this section, a “reference offer” is  a model agreement, or a group of model agreements, which  includes the proposed conditions on which the service             66.   83   provider is prepared to offer requesting service providers  interconnection.   (3) The objective of requiring a service provider to  prepare a reference offer shall be to accelerate and assist the  reaching with other service providers of reasonable and fair  agreements for interconnection.   (4) In performing its functions and duties and exercising  its powers under this section, the Telecommunications  Commission shall, in addition to the matters in section 30,   consider—   (a) existing obligations applying to the service  provider under this Act and any  determination, order, direction or licence  issued under this Act, including without  limitation under section 63(2)(d);   (b) the relative bargaining strengths of the  service provider and other service providers  likely to request interconnection from it; and   (c) in light of the foregoing, whether requiring a  service provider to prepare a reference offer  is likely to further the objective stated in  subsection (3).   (5) A service provider required to provide a reference  offer under subsection (1) may apply to the  Telecommunications Commission to treat an existing  agreement as its reference offer or part of its reference offer.   (6) The Telecommunications Commission shall approve  an application made under subsection (5) if it considers that  the publication of an existing agreement would, taking into  account the obligation of service providers in section  63(2)(d), sufficiently further the objective of requiring a  reference offer in subsection (3).   (7) If a service provider fails to prepare a reference offer  in accordance with this section to the reasonable satisfaction  of the Telecommunications Commission, the  Telecommunications Commission may prepare the reference  offer and it shall apply to that service provider.

QUALITY OF SERVICE     6.1 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS   NME shall, if it is declared a dominant service provider in the   telecommunications market in which mobile telecommunications services   are provided, comply with the following key performance indicators for   its mobile telecommunications network during each calendar quarter (the   measurement period):      Parameter | Measurement = ‘Obligation | Obligation | Obligation —  during 1\". | during 2\" .| during 3\"  year. year. ||: year-and   after        1. Network | The 10% of cells which >95% >97% >98%   call set-up   success   rate   have the highest levels of  carried traffic during their   busy hour during the  measurement period are  identified. The call set-up  success rate is calculated  for each cell during the  identified busy hour. The   network call set-up            178     success rate is the average  across the individual  success rates for each cell.               2. Network | The network dropped call | <3.5% <2.0% <1.5%   dropped rate (Urban Areas) is  call rate calculated during the busy   (Urban hour for each of the 10%   Areas) of busiest cells (as for the  call success rate) in Urban   Areas. The network   dropped call rate (Urban   Areas) is the average over  the dropped call rates for   each such cell.   3. Network | The network dropped call | <5.0% <5.0% <5.0%   dropped rate (Non-Urban Areas) is   call rate calculated during the busy  (Non- hour for each of the 10%   Urban of busiest cells (as for the  Areas) call success rate) in Non-   Urban Areas. The  network dropped call rate   (Non-Urban Areas) is the   average over the dropped  call rates for each such   cell.   4. Network | The busy hour with the >90% >93% >95%   quality highest level of carried  traffic during the     measurement period is  identified for each cell.  The call set-up success  rate and dropped call rates  are then calculated for  each cell over this busy  hour. The proportion of  cells satisfying the  criterion (see definition in   subclause 6.2) is the  performance measure.               6.2   179   EXPLANATION OF PARAMETERS   (a)   (b)   (c)   The Network Call Set-up Success Rate parameter measures the   call set-up success rate over the busiest part of the network. The   call set-up success rate is defined as successful seizures for   TCH/seizure attempts for TCH.   The Network Dropped Call Rate parameter measures the dropped   call rate over the busiest part of the network in each of: (i) Urban   Areas, and (ii) Non-Urban Areas. The network dropped call rate is   defined as the proportion of calls successfully set up which   terminate for any reason other than termination by either the   calling or called parties. For the purpose of this clause 6:   (i) “Urban Areas” means those main provincial centres in each   province in which STL provides mobile   telecommunications services; and   (ii) | “Non-Urban Areas” means those parts of Solomon Islands,   except for the Urban Areas, in which STL provides mobile   telecommunications services,   as set out in set out in Appendix D (Population estimates for 2008   based on 1999 Census).   The Network Quality parameter measures the proportion of the   network over which performance is deemed to be adequate during   busy periods. It is defined as the “number of cells with x% OF   lower dropped call rate and a call set up success rate of y% or   higher divided by the total number of operational cells” where x   and y are the respective obligations in the relevant measurement   period.

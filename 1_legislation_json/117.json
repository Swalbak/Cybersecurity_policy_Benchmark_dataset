(2) No person shall be convicted of an offence in relation to   any act or omission done or omitted by him or her when of the   age of 10 years but under the age of 12 years, unless he or she   knew that the act or omission was morally wrong, or that it was   contrary to law.      13. Insanity-(1) A person shall be presumed to be sane at the   time of doing or omitting any act until the person proves on the   balance of probabilities that he or she was not sane to the extent   provided in subsection (2).   (2) A person is not criminally responsible for any act done or   omitted to be done when suffering from a mental defect or   mental disorder that renders the person incapable:   (a) of knowing what he or she is doing or omitting to do;   or   (b) of attributing to that act or omission the same moral   character that members of the community   generally would attribute to that act or omission.   (3) The fact that by virtue of this section any person has not   been or is not liable to be convicted of an offence shall not affect   the question whether any other person who is alleged to be a   party to that offence is guilty of that offence.   (4) Where upon the trial of any person that person is   acquitted on account of insanity, the Judge must order that the   person be examined by two (2) medical practitioners and the   following provisions apply:   (a) pending the receipt by the Judge of certificates from   the medical practitioners, the person must be   detained in one of the following places as the   Judge thinks appropriate -   (i) a private or public hospital; or   (ii) a prison facility;        14 Crimes 2013, No. 10      (b) when the Court has sufficient information on the   condition of a defendant acquitted on account of   his or her insanity, the Court must -   (i) consider all the circumstances of the   case; and   (ii) consider the evidence of the two (2)   medical practitioners; and   (c) if it is satisfied that the making of the order is   necessary in the interests of the public or any   person or class of persons who may be affected by   the Court’s decision.   (5) Despite anything in the Mental Health Act 2007 no   person subject to an order made under subsection (4)(a) shall be   released on leave or discharged from any institution without an   order of the Court that made the order detaining that person.      14. Compulsion-(1) Except in relation to the offences listed   in subsection (2), a person who commits an offence under   compulsion arising from threats of immediate death or serious   bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is   committed is not criminally responsible if he or she:   (a) believes that the threat will be carried out; and   (b) is not a party to any association or conspiracy from   which the compulsion arises or was a foreseeable   consequence.

Consent to death - No person has a right to consent to   the infliction of death upon himself or herself; and, if any person   is killed, the fact that the person gave any such consent shall not   affect the criminal liability or responsibility of any other person   who is a party to the killing.      17. Self-defence-(1) A person unlawfully assaulted, not   having provoked the assault by any blows, words or gestures, is   justified in repelling force, if the force the person uses:   (a) is not meant to cause death or grievous bodily harm;   and   (b) is no more than is necessary for the purpose of self   defence.

(5) This section shall not justify the wilful infliction of any hurt   or mischief disproportionate to the assault that it was intended to   prevent.   (6) A person is justified in using force, in defence of the person   or anyone under that person’s protection, against an assault,   although in so doing the person causes death or grievous bodily   harm if:   (a) the person causes it under reasonable apprehension that   the violence with which the assault was originally   made or with which the assailant pursues his or her   purpose will cause death or grievous bodily harm to   the person under his or her protection; and        2013, No. 10 Crimes 17      (b) the person believes on reasonable grounds that he or she   cannot otherwise preserve the person under his or   her protection from death or grievous bodily harm;   and   (c) the force the person uses is no more than is necessary to   prevent the assault or repetition of it.      18.

PART IV - ELECTRONIC CONTRACTS     10. Validity of contracts     No contract shall be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on  the ground that an electronic record was used in its formation.        10   11. Declarations of intent     No declaration of intent or other similar statement between the originator  and the addressee of an electronic record shall be denied legal effect, validity or  enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record.    12. Attribution of electronic record and signature     (1) An electronic record or electronic signature shall be attributable to a  person where it was the act of that person.     (2) The act of a person referred to in subsection (1) may be shown in  the manner set out in this section which includes the proper application of any  security procedure to determine the person to whom the electronic record or  electronic signature is attributable.     (3) An electronic record shall be deemed to be that of the originator  where it was sent -     (a) by a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the  originator in respect of that electronic record; or     (b) by an information processing system programmed by or on   behalf of the originator to operate automatically.     (4) Subject to subsection (5), an addressee is entitled to regard an  electronic record as being that of the originator and to act on that assumption  where -     (a) in order to ascertain whether the electronic record was that  of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure  previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or     (b) the data message as received by the addressee resulted   from the actions of a person whose relationship with the  originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that  person to gain access to a method used by the originator to  identify an electronic record as its own.     (5) Subsection (4) shall not apply -     (a) from the time when the addressee has both received notice   from the originator that the electronic record is not that of the  originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly;     (b) in a case referred to in subsection (4)(b), at any time when   the addressee knew or ought to have known, had it      11   exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure,  that the electronic record was not that of the originator; or     (c) where, in all the circumstances of the case, there are   reasonable grounds for the addressee to regard the  electronic record as that of the originator or to act on that  assumption.     (6) Subject to subsection (7), where an electronic record is that of the   originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or where the addressee is  entitled to act on that assumption, the addressee shall be entitled to regard the  electronic record received as being what the originator intended to send, and to  act on that assumption.     (7) The addressee shall not be entitled to regard the electronic record   received as being what the originator intended to send where the addressee  knew or ought to have known, had the addressee exercised reasonable care or  used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the  electronic record as received.     (8) The addressee shall be entitled to regard each electronic record  received as a separate electronic record and to act on that assumption, except to  the extent that the addressee duplicates another electronic record and the  addressee knew or ought to have known, had the addressee exercised  reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the electronic record was a  duplicate.    13. Acknowledgment of receipt     (1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) shall apply where, on or before sending  an electronic record, or by means of that electronic record, the originator has  requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the electronic record  be acknowledged.     (2) Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the  acknowledgment be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an  acknowledgment may be given by -     (a) any communication by the addressee, automated or  otherwise; or     (b) any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the   originator that the electronic record has been received.        12   (3) Where the originator has stated that an electronic record is  conditional on receipt of the acknowledgment, the electronic record shall be  treated as though it had never been sent, until the acknowledgment is received.         (4) Where the originator has not stated that an electronic record is  conditional on receipt of the acknowledgment, and the acknowledgment has not  been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, where no  time has been specified or agreed within a reasonable time, the  originator -     (a) may give notice to the addressee stating that no  acknowledgment has been received and specifying a  reasonable time by which the acknowledgment must be  received; and     (b) where the acknowledgment is not received within the time   specified in paragraph (a), may, upon notice to the  addressee, treat the electronic record as though it has never  been sent or exercise any other rights it may have.     (5) Where the originator receives the addressee's acknowledgment of   receipt, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the  related electronic record was received by the addressee, but that presumption  does not imply that the content of the electronic record corresponds to the  content of the record received.     (6) Where the received acknowledgment states that the related  electronic record met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in  applicable standards, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced,  that those requirements have been met.     (7) Except in so far as it relates to the sending or receipt of the  electronic record, this Part is not intended to deal with the legal consequences  that may flow either from that electronic record or from the acknowledgment of its  receipt.    14. Time and place of sending and receipt     (1) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the  addressee, an electronic record is sent when it enters an information processing  system outside the control of the originator or the person who sent the electronic  record on behalf of the originator.         13   (2) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the  addressee, the time of receipt of an electronic record shall -     (a) where the addressee has designated an information  processing system for the purpose of receiving an electronic  record, occur -     (i) at the time when the electronic record enters the   designated information processing system; or     (ii) where the electronic record is sent to an information  processing system of the addressee that is not the  designated information processing system, at the time  when the electronic record is retrieved by the  addressee; or     (b) where the addressee has not designated an information   processing system, occur when the electronic record enters  an information processing system that the addressee uses  for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information  of the type sent from which the addressee is able to retrieve  the electronic record or information.     (3) Subsection (2) shall apply notwithstanding that the place where the   information processing system is located may be different from the place where  the electronic record is deemed to be received under subsection (4).     (4) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the  addressee, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the place where the  originator has his place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place  where the addressee has his place of business.     (5) For the purposes of this section -     (a) where the originator or the addressee has more than one  place of business, the place of business is that which has  the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or,  where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place  of business;     (b) where the originator or the addressee does not have a place   of business, reference is to be made to the usual place of  residence; and         14   (c) \"usual place of residence\", in relation to a body corporate,  means the place where it is incorporated or otherwise legally  registered.     PART V - SECURE ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES     15. Secure electronic records     (1) Where a prescribed security procedure, or a commercially reasonable  security procedure agreed to by the parties involved, has been properly applied  to an electronic record to verify that the electronic record has not been altered  since a specified point in time, the record shall be treated as a secure electronic  record from such specified point in time to the time of verification.     (2) For the purposes of this section and section 16, whether a security  procedure is commercially reasonable shall be determined having regard to the  purposes of the procedure and the commercial circumstances at the time the  procedure was used, including -     (a) the nature of the transaction;     (b) the sophistication of the parties;     (c) the volume of similar transactions engaged in by either or all  parties;     (d) the availability of alternatives offered to but rejected by any party;     (e) the cost of alternative procedures; and     (f) the procedures in general use for similar types of transactions.     16. Secure electronic signatures     Where, in the application of a prescribed security procedure or a  commercially reasonable security procedure agreed to by the parties involved, it  can be verified that an electronic signature was, at the time it was made -     (a) unique to the person using it;     (b) capable of identifying such person;     (c) created in a manner or using a means under the sole control of the  person using it; and         15   (d) linked to the electronic record to which it relates in a manner such  that had the record been changed, the electronic signature would  be invalidated,     the signature shall be treated as a secure electronic signature.    17. Presumptions relating to secure electronic records and signatures     (1) In any proceedings involving a secure electronic record, it shall be  presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the secure electronic  record has not been altered since the specific point in time to which the secure  status relates.     (2) In any proceedings involving a secure electronic signature, it shall  be presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that -     (a) the secure electronic signature is the signature of the person  to whom it correlates; and     (b) the secure electronic signature was affixed by that person   with the intention of signing or approving the electronic  record.     (3) In the absence of a secure electronic record or a secure electronic   signature, nothing in this Part shall create any presumption relating to the  authenticity and integrity of the electronic record or an electronic signature.     (4) For the purposes of this section -     \"secure electronic record\" means an electronic record treated as a  secure electronic record by virtue of section 15 or 18;     \"secure electronic signature\" means an electronic signature treated  as a secure electronic signature by virtue of section 16 or 19.        PART VI - EFFECT OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES    18. Secure electronic records with digital signatures     Where a digital signature is a secure electronic signature by virtue of  section 19, the portion of an electronic record that is signed with a digital  signature shall be treated as a secure electronic record.    19. Secure digital signatures        16   Where any portion of an electronic record is signed with a digital  signature, the digital signature shall be treated as a secure electronic signature  with respect to such portion of the record, where -     (a) the digital signature was created during the operational period of a  valid certificate and is verified by reference to the public key listed  in such certificate; and     (b) the certificate is considered trustworthy, in that it is an accurate   binding of a public key to a person's identity on grounds that -     (i) the certificate was issued by a licensed certification  authority;     (ii) the certificate was issued by a certification authority outside   Mauritius recognised for this purpose by the Controller;     (iii) the certificate was issued by a public sector agency  approved by the Minister to act as a certification authority on  such conditions as he may impose; or     (iv) the originator and the addressee have expressly agreed to   use a digital signature as a security procedure, and the  digital signature was properly verified by reference to the  public key of the originator.     20. Presumptions regarding certificates     It shall be presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that any  information, other than information identified as subscriber information which has  not been verified, set out in a certificate issued by a licensed certification  authority and accepted by the subscriber, is correct.    21. Unreliable digital signatures     Unless otherwise provided for in any enactment or agreement, a person  relying on a digitally signed electronic record shall assume the risk that the digital  signature is invalid as a signature or authentication of the signed electronic  record, where reliance on the digital signature is not reasonable under the  circumstances having regard to -     (a) any fact which the person relying on the digitally signed electronic  record knows or has notice of, including a fact set out in the  certificate or incorporated in it by reference;     (b) the value or importance of the digitally signed electronic record, if   known;      17     (c) the course of dealing between the person relying on the digitally   signed electronic record and the subscriber and any available  indication of reliability or unreliability other than the digital signature;  and     (d) any usage of trade, particularly trade conducted by trustworthy   systems or other electronic means.     PART VII - OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO DIGITAL SIGNATURES    22. Reliance on certificates     Any person relying on a digital signature shall also rely on a valid  certificate containing the public key by which the digital signature can be verified.    23. Prerequisites to publication of certificates     No person shall publish a certificate or otherwise make it available to a  person known by that person to be in a position to rely on the certificate or on a  digital signature that is verifiable with reference to a public key listed in the  certificate, where that person knows that -     (a) the certification authority referred to in the certificate has not issued  it;     (b) the subscriber listed in the certificate has not accepted it; or     (c) the certificate has been revoked or suspended, unless the   publication is for the purpose of verifying a digital signature created  prior to such suspension or revocation.

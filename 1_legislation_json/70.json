Criminal legislation of the Republic of Armenia   1. The criminal legislation of the Republic of Armenia consists of this Code. New laws that   envisage criminal liability shall be included in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.   2. The Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia is based on the Constitution of the Republic   of Armenia and on principles and norms of international law.      Article 2. Tasks of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia   1. Tasks of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia shall be as follows: to protect human   and citizens’ rights and freedoms from criminal encroachments, rights of legal entities,   property, environment, public order and security, constitutional order, peace and safety of   humanity, as well as to prevent crimes.   2. For the purpose of implementing these tasks, the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia   stipulates the ground for criminal liability and the principles of criminal legislation, determines   what acts dangerous to the public are deemed to be crimes and defines the types of   punishment and other criminal-law enforcement measures for commission thereof.      Article 3. Ground for criminal liability   The sole ground for criminal liability is criminal offence, i.e. the commission of an act that   contains all elements of corpus delicti provided for in the criminal statute.      Article 4. Principles of criminal legislation   The Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia is based on the principles of legality, equality   before the law, inevitability of liability, personal liability, fault based liability, individualisation of   justice and liability and humanism.            CDL-REF(2021)022    - 3 -   Article 5. Principle of legality   1. The criminality of an act, its punishability and other criminal law effects shall be determined   only by the criminal statute.   2. Application of the criminal statute by analogy shall be prohibited.      Article 6. Principle of equality before the law   Persons having committed a criminal offence shall be equal before the law and shall be subject   to criminal liability, irrespective of gender, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features,   language, religion, world outlook, political and other views, membership to national minority,   property status, birth, disability or other circumstances of personal or social nature.   (Article 6 edited by HO-3-N of 5 February 2013)      Article 7. Principle of inevitability of liability   1. Each person having committed a criminal offence shall be subject to punishment or other   criminal–law enforcement provided for in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.   2. Release from criminal liability and punishment shall be available only in case of grounds   and conditions provided for in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.      Article 8. Principle of personal liability   A person shall be subject to criminal liability only for the criminal offence committed by himself   or herself.      Article 9. Principle of fault-based liability   1. A person shall be subject to criminal liability only for action or inaction dangerous to the   public and for consequences — dangerous to the public — in respect of which his or her guilt   is established by the competent court.   2. Objective incrimination, i.e. criminal liability for causing harm without guilt, shall be   prohibited.   Article 10. Principle of individualisation of justice and liability   1. Punishment and other criminal-law enforcement measures applied to a person having   committed a criminal offence must be fair, i.e. appropriate to the gravity of criminal offence,   circumstances under which it has been committed, personality of the criminal, must be   necessary and sufficient to correct him or her and prevent new crimes.   2. It shall be forbidden to try a person twice for the same crime.   (Article 10 amended by HO-97-N of 9 June 2004)              CDL-REF(2021)022 - 4 -   Article 11. Principle of humanism   1. The Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia shall serve to ensure physical, mental,   material, ecological and other types of safety of a human being.   2. No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or   punishment.      CHAPTER 2   OPERATION OF CRIMINAL STATUTE IN TIME AND SPACE      Article 12. Operation of criminal statute in time   1. Criminality and punishability of an act shall be determined by the criminal statute in force at   the time of commission thereof.   2. Time of committing a criminal offence shall be deemed to be the time of committing an   action (inaction) dangerous to the public, irrespective of the moment the consequences ensue.   Article 13. Retroactive effect of criminal statute   1. The statute removing criminality of an act, mitigating punishment or otherwise ameliorating   the conditions of a person having committed a criminal offence has a retroactive effect, i.e.   applies to persons having committed such an act — before the entry into force of that statute,   including to those who serve or have served their punishment, but have conviction.   2. The statute defining criminality of an act, aggravating the punishment or otherwise   deteriorating the condition of a person having committed a criminal offence has no retroactive   effect.   3. The statute partially mitigating liability and meanwhile aggravating liability has retroactive   effect only in respect of the part that mitigates liability.      Article 14. Operation of criminal statute in respect of persons having committed a   criminal offence within the territory of the Republic of Armenia   1. A person having committed a criminal offence within the territory of the Republic of Armenia   shall be subject to liability under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.   2. A criminal offence shall be considered as committed within the territory of the Republic of   Armenia when it has been:   (1) commenced, continued or finished within the territory of the Republic of Armenia;   (2) committed in complicity with persons who were engaged in criminal activity within the   territory of another State.   3. The liability of a person who commits a criminal offence within the territory of the Republic   of Armenia and other states shall ensue under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia,   where he or she was brought to liability within the territory of the Republic of Armenia and   unless otherwise provided for by international treaties of the Republic of Armenia.

A person having committed a criminal offence   on board the military ship or airplane of the Republic of Armenia — irrespective of its location   — shall be also subject to liability under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.   5. Where foreign diplomatic representatives and other persons enjoying diplomatic immunity   commit a criminal offence within the territory of the Republic of Armenia, the issue of subjecting   them to criminal liability shall be settled in accordance with norms of international law.   (Article 14 supplemented by HO-97-N of 9 June 2004)      Article 15. Operation of criminal statute in respect of persons having committed a   criminal offence outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia   1. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia and stateless persons permanently residing in the   Republic of Armenia, having committed a criminal offence outside the territory of the Republic   of Armenia, shall be subject to criminal liability under the Criminal Code of the Republic of   Armenia, where the act committed by them is recognised as a crime under the legislation of   the state where the crime was committed and where they were not sentenced in another state.   When sentencing the aforementioned persons, the punishment may not exceed the upper   threshold of punishment provided for by the law of the foreign state in the territory of which the   criminal offence was committed.   2.

Foreign nationals and stateless persons not permanently residing in the Republic of   Armenia, having committed a criminal offence outside the territory of the Republic of Armenia,   shall be subject to criminal liability under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia, where   they have committed:   (1) crimes which are provided for by international treaties of the Republic of Armenia;   (2) grave or particularly grave crimes which are against the interests of the Republic of   Armenia or rights and freedoms of citizens of the Republic of Armenia.   4. Norms stipulated in part 3 of this Article shall apply, where foreign nationals and stateless   persons not permanently residing in the Republic of Armenia have not been convicted of the     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 6 -   crime concerned in another state and are subject to criminal liability in the territory of the   Republic of Armenia.

Persons specified in part 2 of this Article shall not be extradited to a foreign state, where   there are good reasons to believe that extradition has been requested for inquest or   punishment due to their race, religion, nationality, membership to a certain social group or   political opinion.   No one shall be extradited to a foreign state where there is a serious risk that he or she may   be subjected to tortures or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.   4. Where laws of the state requesting the extradition of persons having committed a criminal   offence envisage death penalty for the crime concerned, the extradition thereof may be   rejected, if the requesting party does not provide sufficient guarantees to the requested party   that death sentence shall not be applied.   5. In case of refusing to extradite a person having committed a criminal offence, criminal   prosecution for crimes committed in the territory of a foreign state shall be carried out in   accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Armenia.

Crime shall be deemed to be an act dangerous to the public, having been committed with   guilty mind (mens rea) and which is envisaged by this Code.   2. The action or inaction which, although, may formally contain elements of any act provided   for by this Code but due to its little significance does not present social danger, i.e. it has not   caused and may not have caused any essential harm to a legal or natural person, the public   or the State, shall not be deemed to be a crime.      Article 19. Types of crimes   1. According to the nature and degree of danger posed to the public, crimes shall be classified   as crimes of minor and medium gravity, grave and particularly grave crimes.   2. Crimes of minor gravity shall be deemed to be intentionally committed acts maximum   punishment for which provided for in this Code shall not exceed two years of imprisonment or   for which punishment not related to imprisonment is envisaged, as well as negligently   committed acts maximum punishment for which provided for in this Code shall not exceed   three years of imprisonment.   3. Crimes of medium gravity shall be deemed to be intentionally committed acts for which   maximum punishment provided for in this Code shall not exceed five years of imprisonment,   as well as negligently committed acts for which maximum punishment provided for in this Code   shall not exceed ten years of imprisonment.   4. Grave crimes shall be deemed to be intentionally committed acts for which maximum   punishment provided for in this Code shall not exceed ten years of imprisonment.   5.

A criminal offence committed intentionally may be manifested in direct intention or indirect   intention.   2. A criminal offence shall be deemed to be committed with direct intention, where a person   has realised his or her action (inaction) as being dangerous to the public, has foreseen its   dangerous consequences for the public and has desired ensuing thereof.   3. A criminal offence shall be deemed to be committed with indirect intention, where a person   has realised his or her action (inaction) as being dangerous to the public, has foreseen the   possibility of occurrence of dangerous consequences for the public and did not desire those   consequences, but has knowingly allowed them to occur.   4. Where the statute does not connect criminal liability for completed crimes with occurrence   of certain consequences of a criminal offence, a criminal offence shall be deemed to be   intentionally committed, where a person committing it has realised his or her act as being   dangerous to the public and has desired to commit it.   5. A person shall be subject to criminal liability for aggravating circumstances of intentional   crime, where he or she has realised those circumstances.

A criminal offence shall be deemed to be committed with inadvertent negligence, where a   person has not foreseen the possibility of occurrence of consequences of his or her action   (inaction) dangerous to the public, but in the situation concerned ought to have and could have   foreseen them.      Article 31. Causing harm without guilt   1. An act shall be deemed to be committed without guilt, where a person has not realised and   could not realise in the situation concerned his or her action (inaction) as being dangerous to   the public or has not foreseen the possibility of occurrence of consequences dangerous to the   public and ought not to have or could not have foreseen them in the situation concerned.   2. An act shall be deemed to be committed without guilt also in cases when a person has   foreseen the possibility of occurrence of consequences of his or her action (inaction) as being   dangerous to the public, did not desire the occurrence thereof but, due to incompatibility of his   or her psychological and physiological characteristics with extreme conditions or neuropsychic   load, could not prevent the occurrence thereof.      Article 32. Liability for crime with two forms of guilt   Where the statute provides for stricter liability for intentional crime negligently causing serious   consequences, a person shall be subject to liability for those consequences only in cases   when he or she has foreseen the possibility of occurrence of consequences of his or her action   (inaction) as being dangerous to the public but without sufficient grounds has self-confidently   hoped that they would be prevented or has not foreseen the possibility of occurrence of   consequences of his or her action (inaction) as being dangerous to the public, though ought   to have and could have foreseen them in the situation concerned.

Liability for preparation of a crime and the attempted crime shall be ensued under the same   Article of the Special Part of this Code, as for a completed crime — referring to Articles 34 or   35 of this Code.      Article 34. Attempted crime   An attempted crime shall be deemed to be an action (inaction) committed with direct intention   which is directly aimed at committing a criminal offence, where the crime has not been   completed for circumstances beyond the person’s control.      Article 35. Preparation of crime   Preparation of crime shall be deemed to be acquisition or adaptation of means or tools for   committing a criminal offence with direct intention, as well as intentional creation of other   conditions, where the crime has not been completed for circumstances beyond the person's   control.      Article 36. Voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose   1. Voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose shall be deemed to be termination of preparation   of a crime or an attempted crime or an action (inaction) immediately aimed at committing a   criminal offence by a person, where he or she has realised the possibility of completing the   crime.   2. A person having voluntarily renunciated criminal purpose to complete a crime shall not be   subject to criminal liability, unless his or her act actually committed contains other corpus   delicti.   3. An organiser, inciter or abettor of a crime shall not be subject to criminal liability in the event   of voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose, where he or she, by informing state authorities   or through other measures undertaken, has prevented the perpetrator from completing the   crime.   4. Where actions specified in part 3 of this Article have not resulted in the prevention of a crime   committed by a perpetrator, the measures undertaken may be taken into account as a   circumstance mitigating liability and punishment when imposing punishment.

A perpetrator shall be deemed to be the person who has directly committed a criminal   offence or has immediately participated in the commission thereof jointly with other persons   (joint perpetrators), as well as has committed the criminal offence through the use of other   persons who, by virtue of law, shall not be subject to criminal liability or have committed the   criminal offence negligently.   3. An organiser shall be deemed to be the person who has organised or directed the   commission of criminal offence, as well as has established an organised group or a criminal   organisation or has directed them.   4.

In the event the perpetrator does not complete the crime for circumstances beyond his or   her control, other accomplices shall be subject to liability for preparation of a crime or   complicity in the attempted crime.     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 14 -   5. Where an organiser, inciter or abettor fail in accomplishing their actions for circumstances   beyond their control, the liability of those persons shall ensue for preparation of relevant crime.   6. Accomplices shall be subject to liability only for those aggravating circumstances of the   crime of which they realised.   7. When subjecting accomplices to liability, the nature and level of participation in crime of   each thereof shall be taken into account.      Article 40. Any excess on the part of accomplice   1. Any excess on the part of an accomplice shall be deemed to be commission of a criminal   offence by a person who exceeds the intention of other accomplices.   2.

Commission of criminal offence by a group of persons, organised   group or criminal organisation   1.

An action shall not be deemed to be a crime, where it has been committed under necessary   defence, i.e. when defending life, health and rights of a defender or other person, or interests   of the State or the public from encroachment — dangerous to the public — or a real threat   thereof through causing harm to an encroacher which was not in the excess of necessary   defence.   2. While being defended from violence dangerous to human life or from an encroachment   accompanied by a real threat of such violence, any harm, including death, may be caused.   3. A person shall be entitled to the right of necessary defence, regardless of the possibility to   avoid encroachment or apply to the support of other persons or state authorities and of   professional and other special competences and official position.   4. Excess of necessary defence shall deemed to be intentional actions which, obviously for a   defender, do not correspond to the nature and extent of danger of encroachment.   An act committed in the excess of necessary defence shall be deemed to be a crime, where   it is especially provided for in the Special Part of this Code.   5. Discharge of weapons or any other means or objects for the purpose of being defended   from the attack of an armed person or an armed group of persons and for preventing illegal   and forced intrusion into a residence or other premises, regardless of the gravity of harm   caused to the encroacher, shall not be considered as an excess of necessary defence and   shall not result in criminal liability.   (Article 42 supplemented by HO-97-N of 9 June 2004)   Article 43. Causing harm while apprehending a person having committed a   criminal offence   1. An action whereby harm was caused to a person having committed a criminal offence while   apprehending him for the purpose of transferring him or her to competent authorities and   precluding the possibility of committing a new act dangerous to the public shall not be   considered as a crime, where it did not go beyond measures necessary for that.   2. Excess of measures necessary for apprehending a person having committed a criminal   offence shall be deemed to be an obvious disproportion to the danger of an act and of person   having committed it, as well as with circumstances of apprehending as a result of which a   person was caused harm that was not conditioned by the necessity of apprehending.   3. An act committed with excess of necessary measures for apprehending a person having   committed a criminal offence shall be deemed to be a crime, where it is particularly provided   for in the Special Part of this Code.

Causing harm intentionally that is obviously disproportionate to the nature and degree of an   imminent danger and to circumstances of eliminating the danger shall be deemed to be an   excess of extreme necessity, where equal or greater harm compared to the prevented harm   was caused to the interests protected by law.      Article 45. Physical or mental coercion   1. Causing harm through physical or mental coercion to the interests protected under criminal   statute shall not be deemed to be a crime, where, as a result thereof, a person could not   control his or her actions (inaction).   2. The issue of criminal liability in cases when a harm is caused through mental as well as   physical coercion to the interests protected under the criminal statute which does not deprive   a person of the capability to control his or her actions, shall be settled, having regard to the   provision of Article 44 of this Code.      Article 46. Justified risk   1. Causing harm to the interests protected under the criminal statute in the course of the   justified risk taken to achieve socially useful aim shall not be deemed to be a crime.   2. The risk shall be deemed to be justified, where the mentioned aim could not be achieved   without actions (inaction) not related to the risk, and a person running a risk has undertaken   necessary measures to prevent the act of causing harm to the interests protected under the   criminal statute.   3. The risk shall not be deemed to be justified, where it was obviously accompanied by danger   of death of third persons and by threat of ecological or social disaster.      Article 47. Execution of order or executive order   1. Causing harm to the interests protected under the criminal statute by a person who has   acted in pursuance of an order or executive order binding thereon — issued under the   prescribed procedure shall not be deemed to be a crime.

Deprivation of special or military rank, category, degree or qualification class, as well as   property confiscation shall be applied only as supplementary punishments.   4. Only one main punishment may be imposed in respect of one crime. One or more   supplementary punishments may be joined with the main punishment as and in cases   provided for in this Code.   5. Property confiscation and deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or to engage in   certain activities as supplementary punishments may be imposed only in cases provided for   in this Code.

The court shall determine the amount of fine, taking into account the gravity of crime and   the property status of the person being convicted.   3. If the person condemned is unable to immediately and fully pay the imposed fine, the court   shall define a maximum of one-year term for paying the fine or shall allow to pay the fine in   instalments within the same time limit or shall replace the fine by public works. In case of   postponing payment or paying the fine in instalments, a schedule for fine payment, as well as   the amount of fine to be paid in each instalment are defined. The referred privilege shall be   repealed by court judgement, where the convict fails to perform the obligations under the fine   payment schedule.

Where the result of calculation made for replacing the fine or unpaid part of the fine with public   works exceeds two thousand two hundred hours, two thousand two hundred hours shall be   imposed. Rounding up the time values as a result of calculation made for replacing the fine   or unpaid part of the fine with public works shall be done in favour of the convict.   5.

While imposing deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or to engage in certain   activities together with confinement in a disciplinary battalion, detention or fixed-term   imprisonment as a supplementary punishment, the term of supplementary punishment shall   cover the whole period of serving the main punishment; moreover, the term of supplementary   punishment shall be calculated after serving the main punishment. In other cases, the term of   supplementary punishment shall be calculated from the moment the criminal judgement enters   into legal force.      Article 53. Deprivation of special or military rank, category, degree or qualification   class   When convicting a person for a grave or particularly grave crime the court, based on the data   characterising the criminal, may deprive him or her of a special or military rank, category,   degree or qualification class.

While serving the punishment of restriction in military service, in case of imposing a   punishment towards a serviceman concerning deprivation of liberty as prescribed by part 6 of   Article 66 or by Article 67 of this Code, or releasing from the military service by a serviceman   on grounds prescribed by law, the restriction in military service by the court is substituted by   a fine, by calculating one month of the restriction in military service against thirty-fold of the   minimum salary.

The punishment imposed for recidivism may not be less than half of the maximum   punishment provided for by sanction in the relevant Article of the Special Part of this Code.   The punishment imposed for recidivism may not be less than two thirds of the maximum   punishment provided for by sanction in the relevant Article of the Special Part of this Code.   The punishment imposed for particularly dangerous recidivism may not be less than three   quarter of the maximum punishment provided for by sanction in the relevant Article of the   Special Part of this Code.   (Article 67.1 supplemented by HO-143-N of 23 May 2011)      Article 68. Determination of terms of punishment by adding them   1. While adding punishments in full or partially by the combination of offences and by   combination of criminal judgements, one day of imprisonment shall be equal to:   (1) one day of detention or confinement in a disciplinary battalion.   (2) (sub-point repealed by HO-119-N of 1 June 2006)   (3) three hours of public works.   2. While adding punishments in the form of fine, deprivation of the right to hold certain positions   or to engage in certain activities, deprivation of special or military rank, category, degree or   qualification class and property confiscation to confinement in a disciplinary battalion,   detention, imprisonment, they shall be executed separately.     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 28 -   (Article 68 amended by HO-119-N of 1 June 2006)      Article 69. Calculation of terms of punishment and the set-off thereof   1. The terms of deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or to engage in certain   activities, confinement in a disciplinary battalion, imprisonment shall be calculated by months   and years. The term of public works shall be calculated by hours. The term of detention shall   be calculated by days and months.   2. While replacing or adding punishments specified in part 1 of this Article, as well as setting-  off the punishment, the terms may be calculated by days.   3. Before the entry into force of the criminal judgement, the term of detention shall be set-off   against the punishment imposed in the form of imprisonment, confinement in a disciplinary   battalion by calculating one day against one day, whereas in case of public works — one day   against three hours.   4. Before the entry into force of the criminal judgement, during holding under detention or   serving the punishment imposed in the form of imprisonment — upon the criminal judgement   of the court — for a criminal offence committed in another State, in case of extradition of a   person based on Article 16 of this Code, one day shall be calculated against one day.   5. Before the trial, the court, while imposing punishment on a person under detention in the   form of fine, deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or to engage in certain activities,   taking into account the term of detention, shall mitigate the imposed punishment or fully   exempt from serving the punishment.   6. The term of applying medical coercive measures on a person who became mentally ill after   the commission of a criminal offence shall be set-off against the term of punishment.

Where the court, by imposing punishment in the form of detention, imprisonment or   confinement in a disciplinary battalion, comes to a conclusion that the convict is capable of   being corrected without serving the term of punishment, may decide on conditional non-  application of the punishment.   2. In case of conditional non-application of punishment, the court shall take into account the   features characterising the personality of the criminal, the circumstances mitigating and   aggravating liability and punishment.   3. In case of conditional non-application of punishment, the court shall define a probation   period for a term of one to five years.   4. In case of conditional non-application of punishment in the form of imprisonment,   supplementary punishments may be imposed, except for property confiscation.      CDL-REF(2021)022    - 29 -   5. When taking a decision on conditional non-application of punishment, the court may impose   certain duties on the convict, i.e. not to change the place of permanent residence, take a   course of treatment from alcohol and drug addiction, venereal disease or toxicomania, provide   his or her family with financial assistance. With or without mediation of a competent authority   supervising the convict’s behaviour, the court may impose also other duties on the convict   contributing to correction thereof or replace them.   6. Where the convict maliciously evades, during the probation period, the performance of   duties imposed thereon by the court upon conditional non-application of punishment, with   mediation of a competent authority supervising the convict’s behaviour, as well as in case of   committing a negligent criminal offence or an intentional criminal offence of minor gravity, the   court shall settle the issue of cancelling the decision on conditional non-application of   punishment.   7. Where a person commits an intentional criminal offence of medium gravity, grave or   particularly grave intentional criminal offence during the probation period, the court shall   cancel the decision on conditional non-application of punishment and impose punishment by   the rules provided for in Article 67 of this Code. Punishment shall be imposed by the same   rules also for committing a new negligent criminal offence or an intentional criminal offence of   minor gravity, where the court cancels the decision on conditional non-application of   punishment.

SECTION 4   RELEASING FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND PUNISHMENT      CHAPTER 11   RELEASING FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY      Article 72. Releasing from criminal liability in the event of active repentance   1. A person having committed a criminal offence of minor or medium gravity for the first time   may be released from criminal liability, where, following the commission of a criminal offence,   he or she has voluntarily surrendered by acknowledging guilt, has assisted in disclosing the   crime, has compensated or otherwise settled the damage caused as a result of the crime.     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 30 -   2. A person having committed another type of criminal offence shall be released from criminal   liability in cases expressly provided for in an Article of the Special Part of this Code.   (Article 72 amended by HO-214-N of 23 June 2011)      Article 73. Releasing from criminal liability in the event of reconciliation with the   victim   A person having committed an offence of minor gravity may be released from criminal liability,   where he or she has reconciled with the victim and has compensated or otherwise settled the   damage caused to him or her.      Article 74. Releasing from criminal liability in the event of a change of situation   A person having committed a criminal offence of minor or medium gravity for the first time may   be released from criminal liability, where it becomes clear that — owing to a change of situation   — the person concerned or the act committed by him or her have ceased to be dangerous to   the public.      Article 75. Releasing from criminal liability due to expiration of the statute of   limitations   1. A person shall be released from criminal liability, where the following terms have elapsed   from the day when the criminal offence is regarded as completed:   (1) two years from the day when a criminal offence of minor gravity is regarded as completed;   (2) five years from the day when a criminal offence of medium gravity is regarded as   completed;   (3) ten years from the day when a grave criminal offence is regarded as completed;   (4) fifteen years from the day when a particularly grave criminal offence is regarded as   completed.   2. The statute of limitations shall be calculated from the day when a criminal offence is   regarded as completed till the moment when the criminal judgment enters into legal force. In   case of a continuous crime, the statute of limitations shall be calculated from the moment of   termination of the act, whereas in case of a continuing crime – from the moment of committing   the last act.   3. The running of the statute of limitations shall be interrupted, where — before expiration of   the mentioned terms — the person commits a new criminal offence of medium gravity, a new   grave or a particularly grave criminal offence. In this case, the statute of limitations shall be   calculated from the moment when the new criminal offence is regarded as completed.   4. The running of the statute of limitations shall be suspended, where a person evades   investigation or trial. In this case, the running of the statute of limitations shall resume from the   moment of arresting the person or his or her surrender by acknowledging guilt. Moreover, a      CDL-REF(2021)022    - 31 -   person may not be subjected to criminal liability, if ten years have elapsed from the day when   a criminal offence of minor or medium gravity is regarded as completed, and twenty years   from the day when a grave or particularly grave criminal offence is regarded as completed,   and the running of the statute of limitations has not been interrupted by a new crime.   5. The issue of application of the statute of limitations with regard to a person who has   committed a criminal offence punishable by life imprisonment, shall be settled by the court.   Where the court finds it impossible to release a person from criminal liability due to expiry of   the statute of limitations, life imprisonment shall not be applied.   6. No statute of limitations shall be applied with regard to persons having committed criminal   offences against peace and safety of humanity as provided for in Articles 384, 386-391, 393-  397 of this Code. No statute of limitations shall be applied also with regard to persons having   committed criminal offences provided for in international treaties of the Republic of Armenia,   where a prohibition of application of a statute of limitations is laid down in those treaties.   7. The calculation of the statute of limitations for a person having committed a criminal offence   provided for in Articles 132.2 and 168 of this Code, as well as a criminal offence against sexual   integrity and sexual freedom of a minor victim as provided for in Articles 138-142 of this Code   shall start from the moment the victim attains 18 years.   (Article 75 amended, supplemented by HO-103-N of 1 June 2006, supplemented by HO-  112-N of 12 November 2013)      CHAPTER 12   RELEASING FROM PUNISHMENT      Article 76. Conditional early release   1. A person who serves a punishment in the form of imprisonment or confinement in a   disciplinary battalion may, upon serving the minimum term of punishment defined under part   3 of this Article, benefit from conditional early release, where, upon consideration of the reports   of the Penitentiary Service and the Probation Service on circumstances provided for by parts   1.1 and 1.2 of this Article and the motion of a commander of a disciplinary battalion, the court   comes to the conclusion that — in order to be corrected — the convict does not need to serve   the remaining part of the imposed punishment, as:   (1) he or she has behaved properly while serving the punishment, and   (2) it is not very likely that the convict will commit a new criminal offence.   In case of conditional early release from serving the punishment, the convict shall not be   exempt from additional punishment imposed against him or her.   1.1. The following circumstances shall be taken into account when assessing the proper   conduct of the convict:   (1) existence of incentive while serving the punishment;     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 32 -   (2) existence of disciplinary penalty while serving the punishment;   (3) participation in educational programmes, athletic and cultural events or amateur unions of   convicts while serving the punishment, where there has been such a possibility;   (4) working for at least three months while serving the punishment, where there has been a   possibility to work, or where not working has not been conditioned by the health problems of   the convict;   (5) other circumstances for assessing the proper conduct of the convict.   1.2. The following shall be taken into account when assessing the likelihood for the convict to   commit a new crime:   (1) age of the convict, age of the convict at the time of committing the crime;   (2) nature of the crime and danger posed to the public;   (3) existence of recidivism;   (4) his or her attitude towards the criminal offence committed;   (5) compensation of damage caused by the crime or settlement in any other way or   undertaking an obligation in writing to compensate the damage caused or settle in any other   way;   (6) his or her attitude towards criminal subculture;   (7) certain inclinations, possible addictions, preferences;   (8) participation in re-socialisation, including personal development activities;   (9) contact with the family or outside world or the existence of persons under care;   (10) social environment;   (11) state of health, including state of mental health, being in mandatory treatment and the   result of mandatory treatment;   (12) other circumstances for assessing the likelihood for the convict to commit a new crime.   2. When applying conditional early release, the court may impose on a person the duties   provided for in part 5 of Article 70 of this Code, which the person must fulfil during the unserved   part of the punishment. Where the convict has not yet compensated or settled in other way   the real damage caused to the victim, the court shall impose such a duty on the convict.   3. Conditional early release may be applied only if the convict has actually served:   (1) not less than one third of a punishment imposed for a crime of minor or medium gravity;   (2) not less than half of a punishment imposed for a grave crime;   (3) not less than two third of a punishment imposed for a particularly grave crime other than   the crimes provided for in point 4 of this part, as well as of a punishment imposed on a person   having previously benefited from conditional early release (where the conditional early release   has been cancelled on grounds provided for in part 6 of this Article).   (4) not less than three quarter of a punishment imposed for crimes provided for in part 2 of   Article 104, part 3 of Article 138, part 3 of Article 139, part 3 of Article 175, parts 2 and 3 of   Article 217, part 3 of Article 218, parts 2 and 3 of Article 221, part 1 of Article 222, part 3 of      CDL-REF(2021)022    - 33 -   Article 266, part 3 of Article 269, part 1 of Article 299, Article 305, part 2 of Article 384, part 2   of Article 387, part 2 of Article 388, Article 389, parts 1 and 3 of Article 390, part 3 of Article   391, Articles 392, 393 and 394 of this Code.   (5) in case of life imprisonment — not less than twenty years of imprisonment.   4. The actually served term of a punishment in the form of imprisonment and confinement in   a disciplinary battalion may not be less than three months.   5. (part repealed by HO-62-N of 1 March 2017)   5.1. (part repealed by HO-332-N of 23 May 2018)   5.2. In case of taking a decision on conditional early release from serving the punishment, the   court shall establish a probation period in the amount of the unserved part of the punishment   during which the person is under the supervision of the competent body.   5.3. In case of taking a decision on conditional early release of a person sentenced to life   imprisonment from serving the punishment, the court shall establish a probation period for a   term of ten years.   6. Where, during the probation period, a convict:   (1) maliciously evades fulfilling the duties imposed on him or her by the court at the time of   conditional early release, the court shall, upon the motion of the body carrying out surveillance   over the convict’s conduct, take a decision on cancelling the conditional early release and   executing the unserved part of the punishment;   (2) commits a negligent criminal offence, the issue of maintaining or cancelling the conditional   early release shall be settled by the court;   (3) commits an intentional criminal offence, the court shall impose a punishment on him or her   under the rules provided for in Article 67 of this Code. Punishment shall be imposed under the   same rules, where a negligent criminal offence has been committed, and the court cancels   the conditional early release.   7. Where a person serving life imprisonment has committed a new intentional criminal offence   for which imprisonment is imposed, the running of the term specified in point 5 of part 3 of this   Article shall be suspended till the expiry of the term of the new punishment.   (Article 76 supplemented by HO-26 of 5 November 2003, amended by HO-97-N of 9 June   2004, HO-33-N of 15 December 2005, HO-68-N of 25 May 2006, HO-119-N of 1 June 2006,   HO-275-N of 28 November 2007, supplemented by HO-69-N of 1 March 2011, edited,   supplemented, amended by HO-62-N of 1 March 2017, amended by HO-332-N of 23 May   2018)      Article 77. Replacing the unserved part of a punishment by a milder punishment   1. The court may replace the unserved part of the punishment of a person serving   imprisonment for a crime of minor or medium gravity by a milder form of punishment, taking   into account the circumstances provided for in parts 1.1 and 1.2 of Article 76 of this Code and     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 34 -   the reports of the Penitentiary Service and Probation Service regarding thereto. In case of   replacing the unserved part of a punishment by a milder form of punishment, a convict shall   not be exempt from additional punishment imposed against him or her.   2. The unserved part of a punishment may be replaced by a milder form of punishment after   the convict has actually served not less than one third of the punishment.   3. When replacing the unserved part of a punishment by a milder punishment, the court may   choose any milder form of punishment in accordance with those specified in Article 49 of this   Code, within the limits provided for by this Code for each form of punishment.   (Article 77 supplemented by HO-62-N of 1 March 2017, supplemented by HO-49-N of 17   May 2016, edited by HO-332-N of 23 May 2018)      Article 78. Postponing the serving of the punishment by pregnant women or   persons having a child under the age of three, or releasing them from   punishment   1. The court may postpone the serving of the punishment by pregnant women or persons —   having a child under the age of three — sentenced to imprisonment, except for persons   sentenced to imprisonment for a term of more than five years for grave and particularly grave   crimes, or release them from punishment within the limits of the term during which a woman   is released from work due to pregnancy, delivery, as well as a child’s attainment of the age of   three.   2. Where, in cases provided for in part 1 of this Article, the convict abandons the child or has   given him or her up to a children’s home or evades taking care of and bringing him or her up,   for which he or she has been warned in a written form by a body carrying out surveillance over   him or her, the court may, upon the motion of such body, send the convict to serve the   punishment imposed by the criminal judgment.   3. After the child reaches the age of three or in case of his or her death, the court may, taking   into account the conduct of the convict, release the convict from serving the punishment, or   replace the punishment by a milder form of punishment, or send the convict to serve the   unserved part of the punishment. In that case, the court may set-off, in full or in part, the   unserved term of the punishment against the term of serving the punishment.   4. Where the convict has committed a new criminal offence during the period of release from   serving the punishment, the court shall impose a punishment on him or her under the rules   provided for in Article 67 of this Code.      Article 79. Releasing from punishment due to severe illness   1. Where, while serving the punishment, a person has acquired a mental disorder that has   deprived him or her of the ability to realise the actual nature and significance of his or her      CDL-REF(2021)022    - 35 -   actions (inaction) or to direct them, the court shall release him or her from serving the   punishment. The court may impose medical coercive measures on such a person.   2. Where a person, following the commission of a criminal offence or delivery of a criminal   judgment, has acquired another severe illness which prevents him or her from serving the   punishment, the court may release him or her from serving the punishment, taking into account   the gravity of the criminal offence committed, the personality of the convict, the nature of the   illness and other circumstances.   3. Persons referred to in parts 1 and 2 of this Article may, upon recovery, be subjected to   criminal liability and punishment, provided that the statutes of limitations laid down in Articles   75 and 81 of this Code have not expired.   4. A military serviceman sentenced to confinement in a disciplinary battalion shall be released   from punishment in case of such an illness due to which he is considered ineligible for military   service.      Article 80. Releasing from punishment due to extraordinary circumstances   A person convicted of a crime of minor or medium gravity may be released from punishment,   where further serving of the punishment may result in grave consequences for the sentenced   person or his or her family due to a fire, manmade or natural disaster, severe illness or death   of the only member of the family capable to work, or other extraordinary circumstances.   (Article 80 amended by HO-97-N of 9 June 2004)      Article 81. Releasing from punishment due to expiry of the limitations period of a   criminal judgment of conviction   1. A person convicted of a crime shall be exempt from serving the punishment where, after   taking legal effect, the criminal judgment of conviction has not been executed in the following   terms:   (1) two years in case of being convicted of a crime of minor gravity;   (2) five years in case of being convicted of a crime of medium gravity;   (3) ten years in case of being convicted of a grave crime;   (4) fifteen years in case of being convicted of a particularly grave crime.   2. The running of the limitations period shall be interrupted, where, before expiry of the   mentioned terms, a person commits a new intentional criminal offence. In this case, the   limitations period shall be calculated from the day of committing a new criminal offence.   3. The running of the limitations period shall be suspended, where the convict evades serving   the punishment. In this case, the running of the limitations period shall resume upon the arrest   of the person or his or her surrender by acknowledging guilt. Moreover, a criminal judgment   of conviction may not be executed, where ten years have passed since the delivery of a   criminal judgment for a crime of minor or medium gravity, and twenty years have passed since     CDL-REF(2021)022 - 36 -   the delivery of a criminal judgment for a grave or particularly grave crime, and the running of   the limitations period has not been interrupted by a new crime.   4. The issue of application of the limitations period with regard to a person sentenced to life   imprisonment, shall be settled by the court. Where the court finds it impossible to apply the   statute of limitations, life imprisonment shall be replaced by fixed-term imprisonment.   5. No limitations period shall be applied with regard to persons convicted of crimes against   peace and safety of humanity as provided for in Articles 384, 386-391, 393-397 of this Code.         CHAPTER 13   AMNESTY, PARDON, CONVICTION      Article 82. Amnesty   A person having committed a criminal offence may, upon an act of amnesty adopted by the   legislative body, be released from criminal liability, and a convict may be released from both   the main and supplementary punishments in full or in part, or the unserved part of a   punishment may be replaced by a milder form of punishment, or the conviction may be   cancelled.   Article 83. Pardon   A person convicted of a crime may, upon an act of pardon, be released from both the main   and supplementary punishments in full or in part, or the unserved part of the punishment may   be replaced by a milder form of punishment, or the conviction may be cancelled.   (Article 83 amended by HO-150-N of 7 March 2018)      Article 84. Conviction   1. A person shall be considered to have conviction from the day when the criminal judgment   of conviction takes legal effect up to the moment when the conviction expires or is cancelled.   2. Conviction shall, in accordance with this Code, be taken into account in case of recidivism   and when imposing a punishment.   3. Persons who have been sentenced by a criminal judgment of the court without a punishment   being imposed, or have been released from serving the punishment by a criminal judgment of   the court, or have served their punishment for such an act the criminality and punishability of   which are removed by law, shall be considered to have no conviction.   4. Conviction shall expire:   (1) following the probation period, in case of conditional non-application of punishment;   (2) one year after serving the imposed punishment, for persons sentenced to a punishment   milder than imprisonment;      CDL-REF(2021)022    - 37 -   (3) three years after serving the punishment, for persons sentenced to imprisonment for a   crime of minor or medium gravity;   (4) five years after serving the punishment, for persons sentenced to imprisonment for a grave   crime;   (5) eight years after serving the punishment, for persons sentenced to imprisonment for a   particularly grave crime.   5. Where a person has benefited from conditional early release as prescribed by law, or the   unserved part of a punishment has been replaced by a milder punishment, the term of expiry   of conviction shall be calculated from the moment of releasing from serving the main and   supplementary punishments.   6. Where, after serving the imposed punishment, a person has demonstrated unimpeachable   conduct, the court may, upon his or her request, cancel the conviction before the term of expiry   of conviction elapses, but not earlier than the expiry of half of that term. When cancelling the   conviction, the court may also take into account the advisory report submitted by the State   Probation Service on cancelling the conviction, based on the claim of the court.   7. Where a person commits a new criminal offence before expiry of the conviction, the term   of its expiry shall be interrupted. The term of expiry of the conviction for the first crime shall be   calculated again after actually serving the punishment (main and supplementary) for the last   crime. In that case, the person shall be considered to be convicted of both crimes before the   term for expiry of the conviction for the graver crime elapses.   8. Cancellation or expiry of conviction shall eliminate all legal effects related to the conviction.   This norm shall not prevent the provision for restrictions by law for holding positions of a judge,   prosecutor, officer of the Investigative Committee, officer of the Special Investigation Service,   police officer, penitentiary officer, officer of the national security bodies to hold positions of   member of the Commission for Prevention of Corruption.

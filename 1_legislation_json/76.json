Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis      Minister of National Defence Raimundas Karoblis             APPROVED by  Resolution No. 818 of the Government of  the Republic of Lithuania of 13 August  2018        NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY         CHAPTER ONE  GENERAL PROVISIONS     1. The National Cyber Security Strategy (hereinafter referred to as the “Strategy”) sets   out the main national cyber security policy orientations in public and private sectors. The  implementation of the Strategy is aimed at strengthening cyber security of the state and the  development of cyber defence capabilities, at ensuring prevention and investigation of criminal  offences committed using the objects of cyber security (hereinafter referred to as the “criminal  offences in cyberspace”), at promoting the culture of cyber security and development of  innovation, at enhancement of a close collaboration between public and private sectors as well  as international cooperation and ensuring the fulfilment of international obligations in the field of  cyber security in the country until 2023.   2. The strategy has been drawn up with the environmental analysis, data of the conducted  research, suggestions of the representatives of public and private sectors taken into account and  meets the provisions of the Programme of the Seventeenth Government of the Republic of  Lithuania which was accepted by Resolution No. XIII-82 of the Seimas of the Republic of  Lithuania of 13 December 2016 “On the Programme of the Government of the Republic of  Lithuania” (hereinafter referred to as the “Programme of the Government of the Republic of  Lithuania”), of the National Security Strategy approved by Resolution No. IX-907 of the Seimas  of the Republic of Lithuania of 28 May 2002 “On the Approval of the National Security  Strategy”, of the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Cyber Security, of the communications  and recommendations by the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission  in the field of cyber security, as well as of the Communication from the Commission to the  European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the  Committee of the Regions “A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe” dated 6 May 2015  and the Lithuanian Information Society Development Programme 2014-2020 “Digital Agenda of  the Republic of Lithuania” approved by Resolution No. 244 of the Government of the Republic  of Lithuania of 12 March 2014 “On the Approval of Lithuanian Information Society  Development Programme 2014-2020 “Digital Agenda of the Republic of Lithuania”. After  Lithuania joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  recommendations produced by this organisation on Digital Security Risk Management for     2        Economic and Social Prosperity has also become one of the key guidelines referred to by the  Strategy.       3. Terms used in the Strategy shall have the same meanings as those defined in the Law   on Cyber Security, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Organisation of the National  Defence System and Military Service, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Higher Education  and Research and the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Right to Obtain Information from  state and Municipal Institutions and Agencies.        CHAPTER TWO  TARGETS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STRATEGY, EVALUATION CRITERIA AND   THEIR VALUES    4. The main purpose of the strategy is to provide the Lithuanian society with the   opportunity to exploit the potential of information and communications technology (ICT) by  identifying cyber incidents in an effective and timely manner, preventing their occurrence and  spread, and managing consequences resulting from cyber incidents.     SECTION ONE   STATE’S CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER DEFENCE CAPABILITIES    5. The first target of the Strategy is to strengthen cyber security of the country and the   development of cyber defence capabilities.  6. Like other countries of the world in which the potentials of the ICT are exploited and   which have a perfectly well developed broadband infrastructure, Lithuania has become attractive  not only to individual persons, to their groupings and organised groups but also to the countries  specified in the reports of annual national security threat assessments of the State Security  Department of the Republic of Lithuania and the Second Investigation Department under the  Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter referred to as the “SSD”  and “SID”, accordingly) which pose threat to Lithuania’s national security and conduct adverse  activities in the global and Lithuanian cyberspace. Data collected by the National Cyber Security  Centre under the Ministry of National Defence (NCSC), SSD and SID has revealed that  Lithuania continuously encounters various types of cyber incidents aimed at infringement on the  national information resources and critical information infrastructure; according to forecasts, the  number and extent of cyber incidents are not likely to reduce in the future1.   7. According to the data of the Report on the State of National Cyber Security 2017, in  2017, the National Electronic Communication Networks and Information Security Incidents     1 The State Security Department of the Republic of Lithuania and the Second Investigation Department under the  Ministry of National Defence (2018). National Security Threat Assessment; National Cyber Security Centre  under the Ministry of National Defence (2018). Report on the State of National Cyber Security 2017.     3        Investigation Unit – Computer Emergency Response Team in Lithuania (CERT-LT) –  processed as many as 54, 414 cyber incidents. In 2017, the number of recorded cyber incidents  was 10% higher than in 2016. The Lithuanian national information resources remain the primary  target of cyber-espionage attacks; nonetheless, critical information infrastructure of the private  sector and other enterprises which are of strategic or great importance to the national security is  no exception either. Applying technical cyber security measures the NCSC has identified that the  biggest number of cases of proliferation of malicious software was in the sectors of energy  (27%), public security and legal order (22%) and foreign affairs and security policy (21%).  Compared to 2016, malicious software mostly proliferated in the areas of public security and  legal order, foreign affairs and security policy, and energy. The situation of cyber security in the  country is also strongly affected by the state of websites of public sector which, based on the data  of the Report on the State of National Cyber Security 2017, deteriorated in 2017.   8. The annual reports of the NCSC, SSD and SID provide information on the extent of  proliferation of cyber incidents which shows that every cyber security subject faces situation  where a decision has to be made on how much time, money or any other resources might be  needed to protect the existing communication and information systems or provided services.  Cyber security subjects perform security risk assessment but risk assessment is often conducted  formally only so as to comply with the requirements of legal acts or provision of internationally  recognised standards.   The Risk Analysis Manual published by the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of  Lithuania reflects the progress and advancement of the risk assessment by research and  innovation tools of the time, however, the provisions of the security risk assessment  methodology have gradually changed and control environment assurance has transformed into  all-encompassing activity risk assessment of an organisation.   9. Individual assessment processes in terms of different security areas in Lithuania have  already reached the point of maturity, however, on the national level, the security risk assessment  culture and cyber security risk assessment are still fragmentary. There is a lack of analysis on  cyber threats and gaps in security as well as full integration into activity risk assessment  processes. Furthermore, rapid development of ICT results in the staff responsible for cyber  security lacking knowledge, skills and practice.   10. To improve the culture of cyber security policy development and implementation, to  update cyber security risk assessment and other requirements, the following significant changes  took place in the field of cyber security in 2018:   10.1. Recast provisions of the Law on Cyber Security helped improve the organisation,  management and control of the cyber security system, specified competence, functions, rights  and duties of authorities which develop and implement cyber security policy, duties and  responsibility of cyber security agents, and established additional cyber security assurance  measures.   10.2. The functions of regulation and safeguarding the security of state information  resources, of the activities of public communications networks, public electronic service     4        providers and electronic information hosting providers were mustered up which enabled the state  to ensure systematic monitoring of cyber space, control of and responsibility for cyber incidents  occurring in communication and information systems of cyber security entities; the NCSC has  become the only agency in Lithuania to organise cyber incident management in the country and  provide help and assistance to state institutions, business and residents under the principle of one  stop shop.   11. Consolidation of capabilities is aimed at developing an integral cyber security  management system in Lithuania which would represent a systematic approach to the security  management planning in any field, promote orientation of cyber security entities to security  management quality assurance, reduce administrative burden falling on cyber security entities,  ensure the systematicity of assessment and evidence-based security management culture, help  optimise the planning of security expenditure. Among the aims is the target to ensure sustainable  development of cyber security competences and enhancement of regional cyber security  capabilities.   12. The Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania and the NCSC  continuously cooperate with cyber security entities and provide consultations on the topics of  cyber security as well as organise cyber security exercises.   In 2017, the national cyber security exercise Cyber Security 2017 had around 200  participants from over 50 organisations of private and public sector. In cooperation with the  Communications Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Police and  the State Data Protection Inspectorate, workshops for the representatives of cyber security  entities were organised – they were familiarised with the requirements of legal acts in the area of  cyber security. Participants of the exercise had trainings aimed at containing and resisting cyber- attacks against critical communication and information systems and ensure the functioning of  such systems.   The Ministry of National Defence will continue to organise national cyber security  exercises on a regular basis, will promote continuous improvement of cyber security skills not  only in the national but also in international cyber security exercises.   13. The European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  acknowledge that the cyber space in some cases has become a separate military space or one of  the tools of hybrid warfare. Cyber measures may be used to sabotage operation of a country’s  critical information infrastructure (e.g., a cyber-attack which took place in one of Iran’s nuclear  energy objects in 2010), might negatively affect the security of a country and its society (e.g.,  cyber-attacks in Ukraine’s power plants in 2015 and 2016), undermine economy and social  welfare; for this reason, the security of the national cyber space is a legitimate national security  interest of every country.   In accordance with the decision adopted in NATO Warsaw Summit 2016 with regard to  recognition of cyber space as the fifth warfare domain, the Lithuanian Armed Forces have  become the main cyber space defence entity of the Republic of Lithuania. The strengthening of  cyber defence so as to prevent military cyber threats and to effectively manage cyber incidents is     5        one of the prerequisites for ensuring vital and primary interests of a country’s national security.  To fulfil the objectives set for the Lithuanian Armed Forces, national cyber defence capabilities  will be developed which will help ensure interaction between the Lithuanian Armed Forces and  the civil capabilities of the country, also capabilities of the Lithuanian Armed Forces to ensure  reliable deterrence of aggressors in cyber space, and in case of failure to deter aggressors – to  independently and in cooperation with the Allies – to defend the Republic of Lithuania making  use of all cyber security measures.   14. Objectives for achieving the first target of the Strategy:  14.1. The first objective of the first target is to develop a systematic approach to cyber   security and preventive activity. This objective will be pursued by improving the ways of cyber  security risk identification, evaluation and forecast, by building up a picture of cyber security  identification and a risk map to reveal the risks typical of individual sectors, by developing a  regional cyber security centre and state-controlled electronic communications network with  complex cyber security measures which would incorporate state mobilisation tasks for  performing critical state functions assigned to state and municipal institutions, agencies and  companies, by carrying out surveys on cyber security state, measurements of advancement or  maturity assessments, by ensuring public information on cyber security state, by putting into use  other measures and actions which reinforce cyber security and preventive activities.   14.2. Second objective of the first target is to increase the efficiency of cyber security  policy development and implementation by reducing administrative burden falling on cyber  security entities. This objective will be attained by improving legal regulation of cyber security,  by preparing standardised but differentiable cyber security requirements, by carrying out the  analysis of good practice, standards applicable when ensuring cyber security, by encouraging  cyber security entities to follow such standards, by establishing a national integrated crises  management mechanism, by ensuring smooth cooperation among the structures of all levels, by  updating cyber security risk assessment system, by evaluating methodological potentials to  conduct monitoring and control of the funds required for cyber security, by determining the  priority of their allocation and use, by implementing any other measures of cyber security policy  development and implementation.   14.3. The third objective of the first strategy is to promote organisation of and  participation in international exercises. This objective will be fulfilled by periodically organised  complex national cyber security exercises, by participation in the EU, NATO and other countries  organised and led exercises, by incorporation of experience of national and international  exercises into incident assessment, information communication and other actions.   14.4. The fourth objective of the first strategy is to develop cyber defence capabilities of  the country. This objective will be achieved by ensuring effective interaction of the Lithuanian  Armed Forces and civilian capabilities, by developing cyber defence capabilities and by  providing assistance to other state and municipal institutions and agencies.     SECTION TWO     6        CRIMINAL OFFENCES IN CYBER SPACE    15. The second target of the Strategy is to ensure prevention and investigation of   criminal offences in cyber space.  16. Criminal offences in cyber space have a negative impact on the world’s economy.   According to research2, global damage caused by criminal offences in cyber space amounts to  hundred billions euros a year; the trends are developing in a towering manner in this regard.  Persons committing criminal offences are interested not only in financial details, but in all data in  general. For this reason, the number of crimes which undermine electronic data and information  system security specified in Chapter XXX of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania has  been continuously growing (according to the data of the Institutional Register of Crimes, in  2017, as many as 594 criminal offences of this type were recorded, in 2016, there were 336 of  them). As the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) operating within the European Police Office  (hereinafter referred to as the “Europol”) states, criminal offences in cyber space are most often  encountered by those European Union Member States which have a well-developed broadband  infrastructure and have well-functioning online payment systems3.   17. Referring to the data of a survey conducted by PwC in 2018 (Global Economic  Crime Survey 2018), in 2018, fraud offences in cyber space were among the most frequent  crimes which cause the most considerable damage to private sector. The European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3) operating within the Europol forecasts that the rapid development of ICT and  methods of social engineering and other reasons are leading to the fact that the number of  criminal offences in cyber space has been increasing. Besides, cyber space has been seeing an  increasing number of criminal offences which do not necessarily involve the use of ICT, for  instance, fraud or extortion. To carry out such crimes or to conceal their traces the latest ICT  solutions, cryptocurrency are employed and criminal services, which are offered in an  anonymous network, are used.   18. Cybersecurity Ventures company calculated in 2017 that damage caused by criminal  offences in cyber space, where malicious software was used had been annually growing and  forecast that by the year 2019, the world would suffer more than USD 11 billion damages due to  the spread of ransom malware. The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) within the Europol  foresees that such harm will continue to augment, in particular, for the reason of increase in  devices of the Internet of Things (IoT). Although malware is often only one of the ways for  criminal offences in cyber space, the European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security (ENISA), in 2018, indicated ransomware in its Threat Landscape Report 2017 as the  most frequent cyber threat which had been dominating for a few years.     2 Center for Strategic and International Studies, McAfee (2018). Economic Impact of Cybercrime – No Slowing  Down, Cybersecurity Ventures, Herjavec Group (2017). 2017 Cybercrime Report.  3 Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) (2017). 2017 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment  (IOCTA)     7        19. Criminal offences related to sexual exploitation of children in cyber space are  considered the ones of the most harmful and injurious criminal offences the spread of which is  prompted by rapidly developing ICT and the increasing potentials of its use. This type of crimes  in cyber space has been gaining an increasing extent and their number pursuant to the data of the  Institutional Register of Crimes and the Europol has been growing both in Lithuania4 and in  Europe5. Seeking to prevent criminal offences related to sexual exploitation of children Lithuania  has transposed Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of  13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and  child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA (OJ 2011 L 335,  p. 1), and on 6 November 2012 ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of  Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse dated 25 October 2007.   20. To prevent criminal offences in cyber space which trespass the borders of countries, it  is important to develop close cross-border cooperation and exchange of information, maintain  and deepen relationship based on international agreements and membership. To this end, a  crucial role is played by strong political will to fulfil international obligations effectively and  comply with international standards to ensure cyber security and tackle crime in cyber space.  Expressing its political will Lithuania ratified the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of  Europe of 23 November 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the “Budapest Convention”) and its  additional protocols. In addition, Lithuania transposed Directive 2013/40/EU of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against information systems and  replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA (OJ 2013 L 218, p. 8). Obligations are  fulfilled successfully not only on a legal but also on a practical level by cooperating with the  International Criminal Police Organisation (hereinafter referred to as the “Interpol”) and the  Interpol’s Global Complex for Innovation, the Europol and European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  operating within the Europol as well as with the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit  (Eurojust). Moreover, Lithuania has taken part in the activities of continuously operating contact  points of the network specialising in the field of cybercrime investigation which was founded on  the basis of the European Judicial Network (EJN) and in accordance with the Budapest  Convention.   21. Since criminal offences in cyber space kept evolving and have gained new forms,  staffs of law enforcement authorities which work in the field of investigation and prevention of  criminal offences must be properly prepared to assess cyber threats, identify criminal offences in  cyber space and investigate them effectively. Another important aspect is appropriate  competence of employees of the public prosecutor’s office and courts as well as of persons who  organise activities of the said authorities and are involved in leadership. To investigate such  crimes law enforcement authorities must be capable of finding, recording and investigating  electronic evidence fast.     4 According to the data of the Institutional Register of Crime, in 2016, as many as 123 crimed were registered as  per definition provided in Article 309(2) of the Criminal Code, in 2017 – 132.  5 European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) (2017). Europol Review 2016–2017.     8        22. Objectives for achieving the second target of the Strategy:  22.1. The first objective of the second target is to develop capabilities and capacities of   the country to deal with criminal offences in cyber space. This objective will be attained by  improving the legal system, enhancing professional capabilities of law enforcement authorities  while investigating criminal offences in cyber space, by developing analytical systems,  implementing advanced methods and procedures of operation and technical tools intended to  tackle criminal offences in cyber space.   22.2. The second objective of the second target is to strengthen prevention and control of  criminal offences in cyber space. This objective will be fulfilled by advocating the society’s self- defence culture and promoting responsible behaviour in cyber space, by improving the fulfilment  of functions of law enforcement authorities in tackling criminal offences in cyber space and by  ensuring more expedient international cooperation while investigating such criminal offices,  developing effective cooperation of law enforcement authorities with educational institutions,  representatives of private and public sector and the general public.        SECTION THREE  CYBER SECURITY CULTURE AND INNOVATION     23. The third target of the Strategy is to promote cyber security culture and   development of innovation.  24. Cyber incidents are inevitable in the modern world. It is impossible to avoid them and   be protected from them even if all existing cyber security measures are applied. For this reason,  representatives of the public and private sectors must take care of improving their staffs’ cyber  culture. According to the data received from a survey carried out by IBM in 20176, the number  of incidents which were caused due to negligence or ignorance of workers of the private sector  which was surveyed (in 2017, the number of cyber incidents constituted more than 20%, in 2016  – 15%) has been increasing. More than 30% of such cyber incidents took place because workers  opened the links or documents sent to them by offenders by email. In Lithuania, the number of  emails created using social engineering methods has been also growing7.   25. According to the summary data on the results of the implementation of European  Innovation dated 2018, representatives of private sector in Europe have been increasingly  focusing on the training of their staff members in the field of ICT, however, in Lithuania, this  index slightly exceeds 10% (the average index in Europe is 21%). Public service employees in  Lithuania are also provided with the opportunity to improve their skills in the field of cyber  security. The number of civil servants who have taken cyber security course is annually growing  (according to the data of the Civil Service Department, there were 146 such civil servants in     6 IBM. IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2018 (2018).  7 Nacionalinis kibernetinio saugumo centras prie Krašto apsaugos ministerijos (2018). 2017 m. Nacionalinio  kibernetinio saugumo būklės ataskaita.     9        2015, 249 – in 2015 and 289 – in 2017). But regular training in cyber security for employees of  the public and private sectors which could be organised taking into consideration the latest cyber  security trends in Lithuania and in the world, would increase employees’ vigilance, carefulness  and cyber security culture.   26. To improve cyber security culture among the Lithuanian population continuous  dissemination of information covering all relevant information on the latest cyber incidents and  other actions that might pose threat to the security of personal data or make people the victims of  criminal offences in cyber space must be ensured. According to the data of a special  Eurobarometer survey 464a designed to identify the Europeans’ attitude to cyber security, only  16% of the internet users in Lithuania think that the risk to become a victim of criminal offences  in cyber space has not increased (the EU average – 11 %). Nevertheless, the extent of  dissemination of this type of information should be greater since 46% of the internet users in  Lithuania feel too little aware of the risks of criminal offences in cyber space (the EU average –  51%).   27. There have been a number of surveys and forecasts conducted in the world.  Conclusions usually identify that people lack cyber security skills8 and that this shortage will  prevail in the future. The required competence may be ensured by quality education which meets  labour market needs. Presently, cyber security programmes are offered by four universities in  Lithuania, however, referring to the results of the survey carried out by the association Infobalt  and a public institution Invest Lithuania titled “The ICT Specialists in Lithuania: Situation in the  Labour Market and Employers’ Needs”, the existing situation fails to meet the needs of the  labour market, for this reason, to reduce the gap between the demand and supply of cyber  security specialists, the existing study programmes must be developed and strengthened and new  study programmes aimed at training cyber security specialists must be created.   To achieve higher cyber security culture, it is important that children are taught the basics  of cyber security according to pre-school and/or pre-primary general education programmes and  schoolchildren – according to primary, basic and secondary education programmes since ICT is  used on an increasingly wider scale to ensure educational and learning process.   To carry out reorganisation of teacher training and qualification improvement system as  stipulated in the programme of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, effort should be  also put to improve teachers’ qualification in the field of cyber security. Teachers of different  education areas who have the opportunity to expand and deepen their competences in the field of  cyber security will have “tools” to succeed in educating schoolchildren and students and in this  way will contribute to the development of a knowledge and innovation based society as well as  to the strengthening of cyber security.   28. Many cyber security experts9 estimate that by the year 2019 there will be at least 1.5  million vacancies for cyber security specialists in the world. The study “ICT Specialists in     8 ISACA. State of Cybersecurity 2018 (2018), Information Security Community on LinkedIn, (ISC)2.  Cybersecurity Trends. 2017 Spotlight Report (2017).2017 Spotlight Report (2017).  9 Silensec. Addressing the Cyber Security Skills Gap (2017).     10        Lithuania: Situation in the Labour Market and Employers’ Needs” conducted by the association  Infobalt and public organisation Invest Lithuania in 2018 revealed that the number of ICT  specialists in Lithuania amounted to 22,600 and that about 13,300 different ICT specialists  would be needed within the following three years. Regrettably, researchers provided no details  about the lack of cyber security specialists in Lithuania, however, an assumption may be made  that cyber security specialists constitute a considerable number of specialists that are in high  demand. To tackle the problem of the shortage of cyber security specialists, first, it should be  identified, what type of cyber security specialists are most wanted since, based on the  conclusions of studies carried out in other countries10, different number of cyber security  specialists might be needed in different countries, problems related to the lack of cyber security  skills might differ; besides, specialists might be in demand only some areas of cyber security.   29. Rapid development of cyber space leads to emergence of opportunities to promote  innovation which drives efficiency and economic growth: it prompts the creation of new and  better jobs, increase in social mobility and entails a response to global social and security  challenges.   Lithuania joined the European Union relatively not long ago; for this reason, there is no  in-depth scientific research on cyber security or its teaching traditions. The latter have been well- established in in other EU Member States. Lithuania has a lot of possibilities to improve the use  of the opportunity given by the EU to promote investment in scientific research, notably, to avail  of the general research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 (2014–2020) and this way  contribute to the strengthening of digital economy development and defence policy on the  national as well as on the EU scale. The state’s effort must be focused on different support  measures which allow the representatives of private sector to get access to and affiliate with  international networks when looking for potential employees and partners. This would stimulate  the private sector to invest in the areas of scientific research, experimental development and  innovation, create new products and services – in the cyber security area as well. The designing  of innovative cyber security products would serve as an additional impetus and as a tool for  boosting the competitiveness of Lithuania’s industry. Besides, innovative cyber security products  are necessary to resist modern cyber incidents. It is also important to promote the participation of  Lithuania’s researchers in organising international joint research publications in the field of cyber  security, to attract as many students as possible, to participate directly in high level projects of  experimental development focused on cyber security and, to expand cooperation of public and  private sectors with science and education institutions, to increase the number of foreign doctoral  students in the area of cyber security.   30. According to the data of the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018, to compare with  other EU Member States, Lithuania is a moderate innovator; however, it has advanced  considerably in terms of promotion of innovation and improvement of the ecosystem of     10 Indeed. Indeed Spotlight: The Global Cybersecurity Skills Gap (2017), Information Security Community on  LinkedIn, (ISC)2. Cybersecurity Trends. 2017 Spotlight Report (2017)2017 Spotlight Report (2017).     11        innovation11. In the European Union, private sector still allocates fewer funds to innovation than  its rivals beyond the borders of the EU. No reliable measurements of the cyber security market  have been carried out in Lithuania yet. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the market has been  growing; for this reason, innovation would help coherently create and strengthen the status of  Lithuania as of a competitive country which develops innovative cyber security products and  services. This synergy may be attained by joining the initiatives of innovation with the general  country’s policy while seeking for a long-term science, technology and innovation development.   31. Lithuania has a regulatory and supervisory environment which is favourable to the  activities of financial services and promotes innovation in the finance sector. Pursuant to the data  of Lithuania Fintech Report 2017, in 2017, there were117 FinTech enterprises operating in  Lithuania. This area is one of the strategic activity directions of the Bank of Lithuania, thus, its  activity in one of the most promising and prospective financial technology innovation, namely,  block chain technology, will effectively contribute to the development of FinTech innovation.   32. Objectives for achieving the third target of the Strategy:  32.1. The first objective of the third target is to expand scientific research and activities   which create high added value in the area of cyber security. This objective will be fulfilled by  creating suitable conditions for the creation of new, advanced capabilities which develop cyber  security initiatives by promoting the growth of the cyber security market, export of cyber  security services to foreign markets, by expanding the cyber security sector of financial  technology and by carrying out corresponding research.   32.2. The second objective of the third target is to develop creativity, advanced  capabilities and cyber security skills and qualification which match with the needs of the market.  This objective will be attained by having representatives of public and private sector as well as  science and education institutions create a cyber security competence model, establish cyber  security competence standards, develop systems of training, accreditation and certification all of  which would be oriented towards the needs of the labour market, also have them attract and  develop talents, create training and testing environment of cyber security, teach the  beginners/newcomers and provide opportunities of re-training/re-qualification to persons  working in the ICT field, improve knowledge on cyber security of persons who work with  sensitive data.   32.3. The third objective of the third target is to promote the cooperation between the  public and private sector and science and education institutions in developing cyber security  innovation. This objective will be fulfilled by identifying the common needs of private and  public sectors, their importance to scientific cyber security research, by creating technical  measures, methods and other resources, by developing competences to resolve cyber security  problems and carry out specific cyber security objectives.     SECTION FOUR     11 European Commission. 2018. The European Innovation Scoreboard (2018).       12        PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR COOPERATION    33. The fourth target of the Strategy is to strengthen a close cooperation between   private and public sectors.  34. In modern states, in which broadband infrastructure is well developed,   representatives of the public sector can no longer combat dangerous cyber incident or cyber  incidents, which have a substantial impact, on their own. Managers of critical information  infrastructure – often representatives of the private sector – are not always capable of containing  cyber incidents, the extent of which exceeds their organisation’s capacity all by themselves. Thus  cooperation between public and private sectors becomes inevitable in order to ensure full cyber  security. The main condition for cooperation between private and public sectors is a fully- fledged partnership which entails trust and benefit; for this reason, public and private sector  cooperation should make an endeavour to this end.   35. The Cyber Security Council set up following the approval of Resolution No. 422 of  the Government of the Republic of Lithuania of 23 April 2015 “On the Approval of  Establishment of a Cyber Security Council and its Rules of Procedure” is an example of  cooperation between private and public sectors on a political level. All effort must be made to  effectively enjoy the rights of a Cyber Security Council which are defined in the Law on Cyber  Security.   36. To ensure cooperation between private and public sectors Cyber Security Information  Network (hereinafter referred to as the “Network”) is used. One of the purposes of the Network  is to share information on potential and past cyber incidents as well as exchange  recommendations, instructions, technical solutions and other measures which ensure cyber  security and cooperation among the members of the Network in the field of cyber security. It is  necessary to integrate measures in the Network which help ensure efficient and mutual trust so as  to promote communication among the Network Members.   37. The ICT is used on a broad scale and its advantages in the 21st century is undoubtful,  however, the prevalence of the ICT raises questions of how about respond to the identified ICT  security loopholes in an effective manner. Gaps in the ICT security are searched for by the  persons who have different goals; however, in order to develop a responsible approach for  unveiling the gaps in the ICT security, it is important to create suitable conditions for a person,  who has detected a gap and wants to remedy it, to cooperate with the cyber security entities  whose ICT security loophole was disclosed. Having identified and publicly announced the  procedure for disclosure of ICT security gaps, cyber security entities would thus be protected  from possible damage caused by cyber incidents or would considerably diminish it.  Establishment of the procedure for revelation of gaps in the ICT security and their public  announcement would contribute to the assurance of the country’s cyber security and would  provide more opportunities for cooperation between private and public sectors.   38. Objectives for the attainment of the fourth target of the Strategy:     13        38.1. The first objective of the fourth target is to improve the coordination of cooperation  between private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by creating a sustainable  model of cooperation between private and public sectors in the field of cyber security, by  identifying responsibility and capabilities, by strengthening the country’s cyber security, by  making exchange of relevant information on cyber threats, cyber incidents which have taken  place and lessons learned between private and public sectors more effective, by developing  early warning system, by creating new and improving the existing communication methods and  processes.   38.2. The second objective of the fourth target is to increase the degree of cyber security  maturity of the representatives of private small and medium-sized businesses. This objective will  be fulfilled by encouraging (urging) the representatives of small and medium-sized businesses to  check the status of their cyber security and plug the gaps in cyber security.   38.3. The third objective of the fourth target is to create responsible practice of disclosing  the ICT security gaps in private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by initiating a  responsible practice of disclosing ICT gaps in private and public sectors, by establishing  operational principles of this field, the procedure of application of methods, technical capacities  and other measures designed for this purpose.     SECTION FIVE  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION     39. The fifth target of the Strategy is to enhance international cooperation and ensure   the fulfilment of international obligations in the field of cyber security.  40. Lithuania’s national security and prosperity of its society is directly dependent on   stable, easily and freely accessible and secure cyber space. Taking into consideration the fact that  cyber threats and risks have become of cross-border nature and no longer respect but rather defy  national borders, Lithuania will seek to strengthen its national cyber security by actively  cooperating with bilateral and multilateral partners and by taking part in international forums  designed for settlement of cyber security related problems and problems of managing the global  virtual space in a targeted manner.   41. Lithuania aspires to become an active part of an international community which seeks  to resolve cyber security and internet management problems, to actively cooperate with partners  and allies by signing an international agreement on legal regulation of cyber space which shall be  based on the compliance with the provisions of international law, provisions and principles  applied to activities in this space, security of the open internet, and protection of human rights  and freedoms in cyber space. Lithuania will put particularly much focus on the cooperation with  NATO, the European Union and other countries which adhere to democratic principles in the  field of cyber defence. Lithuania supports as close and sustainable cooperation with NATO and  the European Union in the area as possible with the aim to avoid overlapping of functions and     14        activities. Lithuania will strengthen bilateral cooperation on political and technical levels with  the United States of America, in particular.   42. Objectives for the fulfilment of the fifth target of the Strategy:  42.1. The first objective of the fifth target is to develop international, cross-border   cooperation and cooperation among the countries of the Baltic region in the field of cyber  security. This objective will be fulfilled by taking part in the activities of the European Union,  NATO, the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe,  organisations of the Baltic region and other international organisations.   42.2. The second objective of the fifth target is to strengthen international cyber security  capabilities and capacities. This objective will be accomplished by initiating and managing a  project of Permanent Structured Cooperation with the aim to consolidate cooperation in the  field of cyber security and defence of those European Union Member States, the civil and  military capabilities of which meet higher criteria and are tied by greater commitments.   42.3. The third objective of the fifth target is to further develop the dialogue with the  United States in the field of cyber defence, to strive for the involvement of the US in Lithuania’s  cyber security assurance projects. This objective will be attained by developing bilateral  cooperation between Lithuania and the US on political and technical scale and by pursuing  activities which strengthen cyber defence and security of Lithuania in cooperation with the  United States of America.

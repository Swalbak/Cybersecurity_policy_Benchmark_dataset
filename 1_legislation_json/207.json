Theft.  10  PART 2  Theft and Related Offences  4.—(1) Subject to section 5, a person is guilty of theft if he or she dishonestly appropriates property without the consent of its owner and with the intention of depriving its owner of it.  (2) For the purposes of this section a person does not appropriate property without the consent of its owner if—  (a) the person believes that he or she has the owner’s consent, or would have the owner’s consent if the owner knew of the appropriation of the property and the circumstances in which it was appropriated, or  (b) (except where the property came to the person as trustee or personal representative) he or she appropriates the prop- erty in the belief that the owner cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps,  but consent obtained by deception or intimidation is not consent for those purposes.  (3) (a) This subsection applies to a person who in the course of business holds property in trust for, or on behalf of, more than one owner.  (b) Where a person to whom this subsection applies appropri- ates some of the property so held to his or her own use or benefit, the person shall, for the purposes of subsection (1) but subject to subsection (2), be deemed to have appropriated the property or, as the case may be, a sum representing it without the consent of its owner or owners.  (c) If in any proceedings against a person to whom this sub- section applies for theft of some or all of the property so held by him or her it is proved that—  (i) there is a deficiency in the property or a sum rep- resenting it, and  (ii) the person has failed to provide a satisfactory expla- nation for the whole or any part of the deficiency,  it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, for the purposes of subsection (1) but subject to subsection (2), that the person appropriated, without the consent of its owner or owners, the whole or that part of the deficiency.  (4) If at the trial of a person for theft the court or jury, as the case may be, has to consider whether the person believed—  (a) that he or she had not acted dishonestly, or  (b) that the owner of the property concerned had consented or would have consented to its appropriation, or  (c) that the owner could not be discovered by taking reasonable steps,    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.  the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for such a belief is a matter to which the court or jury shall have regard, in conjunction with any other relevant matters, in considering whether the person so believed.  (5) In this section—  ‘‘appropriates’’, in relation to property, means usurps or adversely interferes with the proprietary rights of the owner of the property;  ‘‘depriving’’ means temporarily or permanently depriving.  (6) A person guilty of theft is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.  5.—(1) Where property or a right or interest in property is or purports to be transferred for value to a person acting in good faith, no later assumption by that person of rights which that person believes himself or herself to be acquiring shall, by reason of any defect in the transferor’s title, amount to theft of the property.  (2) A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by or under his or her directions, except where the person—  (a) being a trustee, personal representative or other person authorised by power of attorney or as liquidator of a company or otherwise to sell or dispose of land owned by another, appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him or her, or  (b) not being in possession of the land, appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed, or  (c) being in possession of the land under a tenancy or licence, appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let or licensed to be used with the land.  (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)—  (a) ‘‘land’’ does not include incorporeal hereditaments,  ‘‘tenancy’’ means a tenancy for years or any less period and includes an agreement for such a tenancy,  ‘‘licence’’ includes an agreement for a licence,  and  (b) a person who after the expiration of a tenancy or licence remains in possession of land shall be treated as having possession under the tenancy or licence, and ‘‘let’’ and ‘‘licensed’’ shall be construed accordingly.  (4) A person who picks mushrooms or any other fungus growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant (including any shrub or tree) growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what is picked, unless he or she does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.  11  Pt.2 S.4  Exceptions to theft.

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), a person obtains services where the other is induced to make a loan, or to cause or permit a loan to be made, on the understanding that any payment (whether by way of interest or otherwise) will be or has been made in respect of the loan.  (4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  8.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person who, knowing that pay- ment on the spot for any goods obtained or any service done is required or expected, dishonestly makes off without having paid as required or expected and with the intention of avoiding payment on the spot is guilty of an offence.  (2) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the supply of the goods or the doing of the service is contrary to law or where the service done is such that payment is not legally enforceable.  (3) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), any person may arrest with- out warrant anyone who is or whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under this section.  (4) Where a member of the Garda Sı́ochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that an offence under this section has been commit- ted, he or she may arrest without warrant any person whom the member, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.  (5) An arrest other than by a member of the Garda Sı́ochána may be effected by a person under subsection (3) only where the person, with reasonable cause, suspects that the person to be arrested by him or her would otherwise attempt to avoid, or is avoiding, arrest by a member of the Garda Sı́ochána.

(2) For the purposes of this Part, a person is reckless if he or she disregards a substantial risk that the property handled is stolen, and for those purposes ‘‘substantial risk’’ means a risk of such a nature and degree that, having regard to the circumstances in which the person acquired the property and the extent of the information then available to him or her, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.  (3) This Part is without prejudice to section 31 (as substituted by section 21 of this Act) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  17.—(1) A person is guilty of handling stolen property if (otherwise than in the course of the stealing) he or she, knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, dishonestly—  (a) receives or arranges to receive it, or  (b) undertakes, or assists in, its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or arranges to do so.  (2) Where a person—  (a) receives or arranges to receive property, or  (b) undertakes, or assists in, its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or arranges to do so,  in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that the per- son either knew that the property was stolen or was reckless as to whether it was stolen, he or she shall be taken for the purposes of this section to have so known or to have been so reckless, unless the    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.  court or the jury, as the case may be, is satisfied having regard to all the evidence that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether he or she so knew or was so reckless.  (3) A person to whom this section applies may be tried and con- victed whether the principal offender has or has not been previously convicted or is or is not amenable to justice.  (4) A person guilty of handling stolen property is liable on convic- tion on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both, but is not liable to a higher fine or longer term of imprisonment than that which applies to the principal offence.  18.—(1) A person who, without lawful authority or excuse, pos- sesses stolen property (otherwise than in the course of the stealing), knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, is guilty of an offence.  (2) Where a person has in his or her possession stolen property in such circumstances (including purchase of the property at a price below its market value) that it is reasonable to conclude that the person either knew that the property was stolen or was reckless as to whether it was stolen, he or she shall be taken for the purposes of this section to have so known or to have been so reckless, unless the court or the jury, as the case may be, is satisfied having regard to all the evidence that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether he or she so knew or was so reckless.  (3) A person to whom this section applies may be tried and con- victed whether the principal offender has or has not been previously convicted or is or is not amenable to justice.  (4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both, but is not liable to a higher fine or longer term of imprisonment than that which applies to the principal offence.  19.—(1) Where a member of the Garda Sı́ochána—  (a) has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence con- sisting of stealing property or of handling stolen property has been committed,  (b) finds any person in possession of any property,  (c) has reasonable grounds for believing that the property referred to in paragraph (b) includes, or may include, property referred to in paragraph (a) or part of it, or the whole or any part of the proceeds of that property or part, and  (d) informs the person of his or her belief,  the member may require the person to give an account of how he or she came by the property.  (2) If the person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give such account or gives information that the person knows to be false or misleading, he or she is guilty of an offence and is liable on  17  Pt.3 S.17  Possession of stolen property.

(4) Any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his or her spouse in any criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).  20.—(1) The provisions of this Part relating to property which has been stolen apply—  (a) whether the stealing occurred before or after the com- mencement of this Act, and  (b) to stealing outside the State if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen,  and references to stolen property shall be construed accordingly.  (2) For the purposes of those provisions references to stolen prop- erty include, in addition to the property originally stolen and parts of it (whether in their original state or not)—  (a) any property which directly or indirectly represents, or has at any time represented, the stolen property in the hands of the person who stole the property as being the pro- ceeds of any disposal or realisation of the whole or part of the stolen property or of property so representing the stolen property, and  (b) any property which directly or indirectly represents, or has at any time represented, the stolen property in the hands of a handler or possessor of the stolen property or any part of it as being the proceeds of any disposal or realis- ation of the whole or part of the stolen property handled or possessed by him or her or of property so representing it.  (3) However, property shall not be regarded as having continued to be stolen property after it has been restored to the person from whom it was stolen or to other lawful possession or custody, or after that person and any other person claiming through him or her have otherwise ceased, as regards that property, to have any right to resti- tution in respect of the stealing.  21.—The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 31 (money laun- dering, etc.):  ‘‘31.—(1) A person is guilty of money laundering if, knowing or believing that property is or represents the proceeds of crimi- nal conduct or being reckless as to whether it is or represents such proceeds, the person, without lawful authority or excuse (the proof of which shall lie on him or her)—    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.

(2) Where the court has power on a person’s conviction to make an order against him or her under both paragraph (ii) and paragraph (iii) of subsection (1) with reference to the stealing of the same prop- erty, the court may make orders under both paragraphs, if the person in whose favour the orders are made does not thereby recover more than the value of that property.  (3) Where—  (a) the court makes an order under subsection (1)(i) for the res- toration of any property, and  (b) it appears to the court that the convicted person has sold the property to a person acting in good faith or has borrowed money on the security of it from a person so acting,  then, on the application of the purchaser or lender the court may order that there shall be paid to the applicant, out of any money of the convicted person which was taken out of his or her possession when arrested, a sum not exceeding the amount paid for the pur- chase by the applicant or, as the case may be, the amount owed to the applicant in respect of the loan.  (4) (a) The court shall not exercise the powers conferred by this section unless in its opinion the relevant facts sufficiently appear from evidence given at the trial or the available documents, together with admissions made by or on behalf of any person in connection with any proposed exercise of the powers.  (b) In paragraph (a) ‘‘available documents’’ means—  (i) any written statements or admissions which were made for use, and would have been admissible in evidence, at the trial,  (ii) any depositions taken in any proceedings before the trial, and  (iii) any written statements or admissions used as evi- dence at the trial or in any such proceedings.  (5) The provisions of section 20 in relation to property which has been stolen shall have effect also in relation to the property referred to in this section.  (6) This section is without prejudice to the Police (Property) Act, 1897 (disposal of property in the possession of the Garda Sı́ochána).    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.  57.—(1) In a trial on indictment of an offence under this Act, the trial judge may order that copies of any or all of the following docu- ments shall be given to the jury in any form that the judge considers appropriate:  (a) any document admitted in evidence at the trial,  (b) the transcript of the opening speeches of counsel,  (c) any charts, diagrams, graphics, schedules or agreed summar- ies of evidence produced at the trial,  (d) the transcript of the whole or any part of the evidence given at the trial,  (e) the transcript of the closing speeches of counsel,  (f) the transcript of the trial judge’s charge to the jury,  (g) any other document that in the opinion of the trial judge would be of assistance to the jury in its deliberations including, where appropriate, an affidavit by an account- ant summarising, in a form which is likely to be compre- hended by the jury, any transactions by the accused or other persons which are relevant to the offence.  (2) If the prosecutor proposes to apply to the trial judge for an order that a document mentioned in subsection (1)(g) shall be given to the jury, the prosecutor shall give a copy of the document to the accused in advance of the trial and, on the hearing of the application, the trial judge shall take into account any representations made by or on behalf of the accused in relation to it.

(4) Except as regards offences committed before the commence- ment of this Act and except where the context otherwise requires—  (a) references in any enactment passed before this Act to an offence abolished by this Act shall, subject to any express amendment or repeal made by this Act, have effect as references to the corresponding offence under this Act, and  (b) without prejudice to paragraph (a), references, however expressed, in any enactment, whenever passed, to theft or stealing (including references to stolen goods) or related offences, and references to robbery, burglary, aggravated burglary, receiving or handling stolen property, forgery or counterfeiting shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and any such enactment shall have effect accordingly, with any necessary modifications.

NOTING that fraud affecting Community revenue and expenditure in many cases is not confined to a single country and is often commit- ted by organized criminal networks;  CONVINCED that protection of the European Communities’ finan- cial interests calls for the criminal prosecution of fraudulent conduct injuring those interests and requires, for that purpose, the adoption of a common definition;  CONVINCED of the need to make such conduct punishable with effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties, without prejudice to the possibility of applying other penalties in appropriate cases, and of the need, at least in serious cases, to make such conduct punishable with deprivation of liberty which can give rise to extradition;  RECOGNIZING that businesses play an important role in the areas financed by the European Communities and that those with decision- making powers in business should not escape criminal responsibility in appropriate circumstances;  DETERMINED to combat together fraud affecting the European Communities’ financial interests by undertaking obligations concern- ing jurisdiction, extradition, and mutual cooperation,  HAVE AGREED ON THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS:  Article 1  General provisions  1. For the purposes of this Convention, fraud affecting the Euro- pean Communities’ financial interests shall consist of:  (a) in respect of expenditure, any intentional act or omission relating to:  — the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents, which has as its effect the mis- appropriation or wrongful retention of funds from the general budget of the European Communities or budg- ets managed by, or on behalf of, the European Com- munities,  — non-disclosure of information in violation of a specific obligation, with the same effect,  — the misapplication of such funds for purposes other than those for which they were originally granted;  (b) in respect of revenue, any intentional act or omission relat- ing to:  — the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents, which has as its effect the illegal diminution of the resources of the general budget of the European Communities or budgets managed by, or on behalf of, the European Communities,  49  Sch.2    [No. 50.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [2001.] Offences) Act, 2001.  Sch.2  50  — non-disclosure of information in violation of a specific obligation, with the same effect,  — misapplication of a legally obtained benefit, with the same effect.  2. Subject to Article 2(2), each Member State shall take the neces- sary and appropriate measures to transpose paragraph 1 into their national criminal law in such a way that the conduct referred to ther- ein constitutes criminal offences.  3. Subject to Article 2(2), each Member State shall also take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional preparation or sup- ply of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents having the effect described in paragraph 1 constitutes a criminal offence if it is not already punishable as a principal offence or as participation in, instigation of, or attempt to commit, fraud as defined in paragraph 1.  4. The intentional nature of an act or omission as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 may be inferred from objective, factual cir- cumstances.  Article 2  Penalties  1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in Article 1, and participating in, instigat- ing, or attempting the conduct referred to in Article 1 (1), are punish- able by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties, including, at least in cases of serious fraud, penalties involving depri- vation of liberty which can give rise to extradition, it being under- stood that serious fraud shall be considered to be fraud involving a minimum amount to be set in each Member State. This minimum amount may not be set at a sum exceeding ECU 50 000.  2. However in cases of minor fraud involving a total amount of less than ECU 4 000 and not involving particularly serious circum- stances under its laws, a Member State may provide for penalties of a different type from those laid down in paragraph 1.  3. The Council of the European Union, acting unanimously, may alter the amount referred to in paragraph 2.  Article 3  Criminal liability of heads of businesses  Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to allow heads of businesses or any persons having power to take decisions or exer- cise control within a business to be declared criminally liable in accordance with the principles defined by its national law in cases of fraud affecting the European Community’s financial interests, as referred to in Article 1, by a person under their authority acting on behalf of the business.    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.  Article 4  Jurisdiction  1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to estab- lish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established in accordance with Article 1 and 2 (1) when:  — fraud, participation in fraud or attempted fraud affecting the European Communities’ financial interests is committed in whole or in part within its territory, including fraud for which the benefit was obtained in that territory,  — a person within its territory knowingly assists or induces the commission of such fraud within the territory of any other State,  — the offender is a national of the Member State concerned, provided that the law of that Member State may require the conduct to be punishable also in the country where it occurred.  2. Each Member State may declare, when giving the notification referred to in Article 11 (2), that it will not apply the rule laid down in the third indent of paragraph 1 of this Article.  Article 5  Extradition and prosecution  1. Any Member State which, under its law, does not extradite its own nationals shall take the necessary measures to establish its juris- diction over the offences it has established in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 (1), when committed by its own nationals outside its territory.  2. Each Member State shall, when one of its nationals is alleged to have committed in another Member State a criminal offence involving the conduct described in Articles 1 and 2 (1), and it does not extradite that person to that other Member State solely on the ground of his or her nationality, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution if appropriate. In order to enable prosecution to take place, the files, information and exhibits relating to the offence shall be transmitted in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 6 of the European Convention on Extradition. The requesting Member State shall be informed of the prosecution initiated and of its outcome.  3. A Member State may not refuse extradition in the event of fraud affecting the European Communities’ financial interests for the sole reason that it concerns a tax or customs duty offence.  4. For the purposes of this Article, a Member State’s own nationals shall be construed in accordance with any declaration made by it under Article 6 (1) (b) of the European Convention on Extra- dition and with paragraph 1 (c) of the Article.  51  Sch.2    [No. 50.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [2001.] Offences) Act, 2001.  Sch.2  52  Article 6  Cooperation  1. If a fraud as defined in Article 1 constitutes a criminal offence and concerns at least two Member States, those States shall cooper- ate effectively in the investigation, the prosecution and in carrying out the punishment imposed by means, for example, of mutual legal assistance, extradition, transfer of proceedings or enforcement of sentences passed in another Member State.  2. Where more than one Member State has jurisdiction and has the possibility of viable prosecution of an offence based on the same facts, the Member States involved shall cooperate in deciding which shall prosecute the offender or offenders with a view to centralizing the prosecution in a single Member State where possible.  Article 7  Ne bis in idem  1. Member States shall apply in their national criminal laws the ‘ne bis in idem’ rule, under which a person whose trial has been finally disposed of in a Member State may not be prosecuted in another Member State in respect of the same facts, provided that if a penalty was imposed, it has been enforced, is actually in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the laws of the sentencing State.  2. A Member State may, when giving the notification referred to in Article 11 (2), declare that it shall not be bound by paragraph 1 of this Article in one or more of the following cases:  (a) if the facts which were the subject of the judgement rendered abroad took place on its own territory either in whole or in part; in the latter case this exception shall not apply if those facts took place partly on the territory of the Member State where the judgement was rendered;  (b) if the facts which were the subject of the judgment rendered abroad constitute an offence directed against the security or other equally essential interests of that Member State;  (c) if the facts which were the subject of the judgment rendered abroad were committed by an official of the Member State contrary to the duties of his office.  3. The exceptions which may be the subject of a declaration under paragraph 2 shall not apply if the Member State concerned in respect of the same facts requested the other Member State to bring the prosecution or granted extradition of the person concerned.  4. Relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements concluded between Member States and relevant declarations shall remain unaf- fected by this Article.  Article 8  Court of Justice  1. Any dispute between Member States on the interpretation or application of this Convention must in an initial stage be examined    [2001.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [No. 50.] Offences) Act, 2001.  by the Council in accordance with the procedure set out in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union with a view to reaching a solution.  If no solution is found within six months, the matter may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities by a party to the dispute.  2. Any dispute between one or more Member States and the Com- mission of the European Communities concerning the application of Article 1 or 10 of this Convention which it has proved impossible to settle through negotiation may be submitted to the Court of Justice.  Article 9  Internal provisions  No provision in this Convention shall prevent Member States from adopting internal legal provisions which go beyond the obligations deriving from this Convention.  Article 10  Transmission  1. Member States shall transmit to the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities the text of the provisions transposing into their domestic law the obligations imposed on them under the provisions of this Convention.  2. For the purposes of implementing this Convention, the High Contracting Parties shall determine, within the Council of the Euro- pean Union, the information to be communicated or exchanged between the Member States or between the Member States and the Commission, and also the arrangements for doing so.  Article 11  Entry into force  1. This Convention shall be subject to adoption by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  2. Member States shall notify the Secretary-General of the Coun- cil of the European Union of the completion of their constitutional requirements for adopting this Convention.  3. This Convention shall enter into force 90 days after the notifi- cation, referred to in paragraph 2, by the last Member State to fulfil that formality.  Article 12  Accession  1. This Convention shall be open to accession by any State that becomes a member of the European Union.  53  Sch.2    [No. 50.] Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud [2001.] Offences) Act, 2001.  Sch.2  Section 41.  54  2. The text of this Convention in the language of the acceding State, drawn up by the Council of the European Union, shall be authentic.  3. Instruments of accession shall be deposited with the depositary.  4. This Convention shall enter into force with respect to any State that accedes to it 90 days after the deposit of its instrument of accession or on the date of entry into force of the Convention if it has not already entered into force at the time of expiry of the said period 90 days.  Article 13  Depositary  1. The Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union shall act as depositary of this Convention.  2.

Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that conduct of the type referred to in paragraph 1 is made a criminal offence.  Article 4  Assimilation  1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that in its criminal law the descriptions of the offences constituting conduct of the type referred to in Article 1 of the Convention com- mitted by its national officials in the exercise of their functions apply similarly in cases where such offences are committed by Community officials in the exercise of their duties.  2. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that in its criminal law the descriptions of the offences referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and in Articles 2 and 3 committed by or against its Government Ministers, elected members of its parliamen- tary chambers, the members of its highest Courts or the members of (1) OJ No. C 316, 27.11.1995, p. 49.

Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be without prejudice to the pro- visions applicable in each Member State concerning criminal pro- ceedings and the determination of the competent court.  5.

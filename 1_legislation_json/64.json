PART 4  OPERATORS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES  Designation of Operators of Essential Services 12. (1) A competent authority shall designate a person as an operator of  essential services in respect of an essential service in a sector in respect of which the competent authority is designated as the competent authority where that competent authority is satisfied that—    [360] 15  (a) the person provides the essential service in the State,  (b) the person has an establishment in the State,  (c) the person is a person of a type set out in Column (3) of Schedule 1,  (d) the sector and, where appropriate, subsector in which the essential service is provided are each a sector and subsector set out in Sched- ule 1;  (e) the provision by the person of the essential service depends on net- work and information systems, and  (f) an incident affecting the provision by the person of the essential service would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service in the State.

(5) In determining the significance of a disruptive effect referred to in para- graph (1) (f) insofar as it relates to the provision by a person of an essential service in the State, a competent authority shall, where it considers it appro- priate to do so, take into account factors specific to the sector to which the 5O.J. No. L 257, 28.8.2014, p.73    16 [360]  person providing the service belongs and, in every case, shall take into account the following:  (a) the number of users relying on the service provided by the person;  (b) the extent to which other sectors set out in Schedule 1 depend on the service provided by the person;  (c) the impact that an incident could have in terms of degree and duration on economic or societal activities or public safety;  (d) the market share of the service provided by the person;  (e) the geographic spread with regard to the area that may be affected by an incident;  (f) the importance of the person in the maintenance of a sufficient level of the service in the State taking into account the availability of alter- native means for the provision of the service concerned.

(2) Where a competent authority proposes to designate a person as an oper- ator of essential services, the competent authority shall notify the person in writing accordingly—  (a) stating the reasons why the person is proposed to be designated,  (b) specifying the category of sector and, where appropriate, subsector and the essential service in respect of which the person is to be so designated, and  (c) giving the person an opportunity to make representations in writing to the competent authority in respect of the proposed designation within 15 working days of the date of the notification.  (3) The competent authority shall consider any representations made by a person under paragraph (2) and shall, within 20 working days of the earlier of—  (a) the receipt of the representations, or  (b) the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2)(c),    [360] 17  decide whether to designate the person as an operator of essential services in respect of a particular category of sector, subsector or essential service.  (4) Where a competent authority decides to designate a person as an operator of essential services, the competent authority shall notify the person in writing stating—  (a) that that person is so designated,  (b) the category of sector and, where appropriate, subsector and the essential service in respect of which that person is so designated, and  (c) where that person has made representations in accordance with para- graph (2), the reasons why that person is so designated.  (5) Where a person, in addition to providing an essential service in the State, provides the essential service in another member state, the competent authority shall consult with the competent authority in that member state before deciding whether to designate the person as an operator of essential services in respect of that service.

CHAPTER THREE   REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS   ACTIVITIES      Article 14. Supervision of competition in the field of electronic communications   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall seek to create conditions for   effective competition and its development in the field of electronic communications as well   as conditions to prevent the abuse of market power by undertakings.   2. The Competition Council shall exercise supervision of competition in the field of   electronic communications in accordance with the Law on Competition.      Article 15. Significant market power on a relevant market   1. An undertaking shall be considered to have significant market power if, either   individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position equivalent to dominance, i.e. a   position of economic strength affording it a power to behave to an appreciable extent   independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers.   2. Where an undertaking has significant market power on the relevant market, it may   also be considered to have significant market power on a closely related market, if the links   between the two markets are such as to allow the market power held in one market to be   leveraged into the other market, thereby strengthening the market power of the undertaking.   3. An undertaking shall be identified as having significant market power where this   has been determined by a decision of the Communications Regulatory Authority based on   market analysis, and it shall be deemed as such until the Communications Regulatory   Authority determines by its decision based on another market analysis that the undertaking   does not have significant market power.         27      Article 16. Market analysis   1. Market analysis shall be conducted by the Communications Regulatory Authority.   The objective of a market analysis conducted by the Communications Regulatory Authority   shall be to ensure effective competition in the field of electronic communications and   prevent the abuse of market power by undertakings with significant market power. The   Communications regulatory Authority shall lay down the rules on market analysis.   2. The market analysis procedure shall include the following stages:   1) definition of a relevant market (product/service and geographic), the   characteristics of which may justify the imposition of obligations referred to in Article 17   of this Law;   2) analysis whether a relevant market is effectively competitive and in the case it is   not effectively competitive, identification of undertakings with significant market power on   that market;   3) imposition, amendment and/or withdrawal of obligations referred to in Article 17   of this Law with respect to undertakings with significant market power.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall carry out a market analysis after   the European Commission adopts a recommendation defining relevant product and service   markets or a decision defining the European Union market or in the event of amendment of   these legal acts.   4. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall also have the right to conduct a   market analysis:   1) at the request of interested undertakings;   2) at the request of state or municipal institutions;   3) at its own initiative.   5. The market analysis shall be initiated by a decision of the Communications   Regulatory Authority. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to   complete individual stages of the market analysis procedure where it reasonably and justly   considers that the completion of other stages is not expedient.   6. In investigating markets, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall rely on   legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania, European Union legislation and take into account   the European Commission guidelines and recommendations, as well as the opinions and   common positions adopted by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic   Communications.         28   7. When conducting a market analysis, the Communications Regulatory Authority   shall have the right to consult the Competition Council. The Communications Regulatory   Authority must obtain the Competition Council’s opinion on the definition of a relevant   market if the market definition differs from the recommendation of the European   Commission referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. In all cases, the final decision shall   be taken by the Communications Regulatory Authority.   8. Where a market analysis is conducted after the adoption by the European   Commission of a decision defining the European Union market, the Communications   Regulatory Authority shall conduct a market analysis together with the national regulatory   authorities of the relevant European Union Member States in accordance with the procedure   and conditions set out in the European Union legal acts and mutual agreements with the   national regulatory authorities of other European Union Member States.   9. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall perform the market analysis of   the relevant market at least once every three years after the adoption of the previous final   decision regarding results of this market analysis, if the relevant market was previously   analysed, or at least once every two years, after the European Commission changes their   recommendation on the relevant product and service markets, if the market has not been   analysed. The Communications Regulatory Authority, in coordination with the European   Commission, shall have the right to extend the three-year term referred to in this paragraph,   but no more than by three additional years.   10. In case the Communications Regulatory Authority does not finish the market   analysis in accordance with the terms referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article, it has the   right to apply to the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications with a   request for assistance in performing the relevant market analysis and determining the   obligations for undertakings having significant market power. Having received the   assistance, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall present their decision to the   interested parties and the European Commission within six months in accordance with the   procedure laid down in Article 11(1) and paragraph 12 of this Article of this Law.   11. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall complete the market analysis   procedure within four months after the decision to initiate a market analysis, excluding time   for consultations on market analysis referred to in Article 11(1) and paragraphs 12 to 16 of   this Article of this Law. By a reasoned decision of the director of the Communications   Regulatory Authority, this period may be extended, but not more than three times and by   not more than three months each time. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall         29   seek to complete the market analysis within the shortest period of time possible. The market   analysis shall be completed by a decision of the director of the Communications Regulatory   Authority concerning the results of market analysis. The decision shall indicate the results   of every completed stage of the market analysis.   12. The Communications Regulatory Authority, prior to adoption of a decision   defining a relevant product or service market, identifying or not identifying undertakings   with significant market power on the relevant market or imposing, not imposing or   withdrawing all or several obligations on these undertakings referred to in Article 17 of this   Law where such a decision would affect trade between European Union Member States,   shall, at the end of public consultations period set by the Communications Regulatory   Authority pursuant to Article 11(1) of this Law, submit a draft of the aforementioned   decision to the European Commission, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic   Communications and national regulatory authorities of other European Union Member   States. The European Commission, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic   Communications and other national regulatory authorities of European Union Member   States may submit their opinions within one month. After the European Commission adopts   guidelines and/or recommendations establishing other public consultation procedure and   time limits than those specified in this Article, the public consultation procedure and time   limits applicable pursuant to the European Commission's guidelines and/or   recommendations shall apply.   13. Should the draft decision referred to in Article 12 define a relevant market   differently than it is defined in the recommendation of the European Commission referred   to in paragraph 3 of this Article or identify or not identify undertakings with significant   market power on the relevant market and should the European Commission notify the   Communications Regulatory Authority about its opinion that such a draft decision would   create a barrier to a single market or about its serious doubts as to its compatibility with the   European Union law, the Communications Regulatory Authority may not adopt such a draft   decision for a further two months. If the European Commission within this time limit   notifies the Communications Regulatory Authority not to adopt such draft decision, the   Communications Regulatory Authority must within a period of six months change the said   draft decision or not adopt it. If the Communications Regulatory Authority, having regard   to the European Commission notification, amends its draft decision, they shall, in   accordance with Article 11(1) and paragraph 12 of this Article of this Law, submit a revised   draft decision to the interested persons and the European Commission.         30   14. If the draft decision referred to in paragraph 12 of this Article is to establish,   modify, and/or withdraw one or more obligations on undertakings referred to in Article 17   of this Law and the European Commission notifies the Communications Regulatory   Authority that in their opinion such a decision would create barriers to a single market, or   they seriously doubt whether the draft decision is in line with European Union law, the   Communications Regulatory Authority may not adopt such draft decision for a further three   months after such notification is issued by the European Commission. During this three-  month period, the Communications Regulatory Authority, taking into consideration opinion   of the interested persons and the need to ensure a consistent regulatory practice, shall work   closely with the European Commission and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic   Communications, in order to set the most appropriate and effective obligation. After the end   of a three-month period, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall, having regard to   the instruction of the European Commission referred to in this paragraph and the opinion   and proposals of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, amend,   reject or leave unchanged their draft decision.   15. If the Communications Regulatory Authority amends its draft decision or leaves   it unchanged, it may not adopt its final decision for another month after the end of a three-  month period referred to in paragraph 14 of this Article. If the European Commission during   a one-month period referred to in this paragraph adopts a recommendation prescribing the   Communications Regulatory Authority to amend their draft decision or not to adopt it, and   the Communications Regulatory Authority does not consider this in adopting their final   decision, the Communications Regulatory Authority must submit to the European   Commission a reasoned explanation.   16. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall adopt their final decision in the   case specified in paragraph 14 of this Article within one month after the end of one month   term referred to in paragraph 15 of this Article. This term does not include the period of   consultations on market analysis, provided for in Article 11(1) of this Law.   17. When adopting their final decision, the Communications Regulatory Authority   shall assess the opinions of the European Commission, the Body of European Regulators   for Electronic Communications and the national regulatory authorities of the European   Union Member States and may adopt a decision at their own discretion, except for the case   referred to in paragraph 13 of this Article. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall   submit their final decision to the institution authorised by the Government, the Body of   European Regulators for Electronic Communications, and the European Commission.         31   18. In exceptional circumstances, when the Communications Regulatory Authority   considers that there is an urgent need to act by way of derogation from the procedure set out   in paragraphs 12 and 13 of this Article so as to safeguard competition and protect the   interests of users, it may immediately adopt proportionate and provisional measures, i.e.   define a relevant market, identify or not identify undertakings with significant market power   on the relevant market and/or impose, not impose or withdraw one or more of the obligations   referred to in Article 17 of this Law with respect to such undertakings. Such provisional   measures may be imposed for a period no longer than nine months. In this case, the   Communications Regulatory Authority must, without delay, communicate those measures,   with full reasons, to the European Commission, the Body of European Regulators for   Electronic Communications, and the national regulatory authorities of other European   Union Member States. The Communications Regulatory Authority may render such   measures permanent or extend the time for which they are applicable in accordance with the   procedure established in paragraphs 12 and 13 of this Article.   19. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall publish the list of relevant   markets for which undertakings with significant market power have been identified and the   list of undertakings with significant market power as well as the obligations imposed on   them, including information on the measures provided for in paragraph 18 of this Article   and any changes in such information, on their website and shall submit such lists to the   European Commission.   20. When conducting a market analysis, and deciding whether an undertaking has   significant market power and imposing obligations on undertakings with significant market   power, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall take account of the relevant   provisions of international treaties and/or agreements and shall ensure, within the scope of   its competence, compliance with and implementation of such treaties and/or agreements in   the Republic of Lithuania. When implementing and ensuring compliance with international   treaties and/or agreements, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right,   after consulting the European Commission and mutatis mutandis subject to the procedure   and conditions set out in paragraphs 10, 14 and -18 of this Article, to impose, amend or   withdraw the obligations referred to in Article 17 of this Law with respect to undertakings   other than those with significant market power on the relevant market.      Article 17. Imposition of obligations on undertakings having significant market   power on the relevant market         32   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall impose the following   obligations on undertakings having significant market power on the relevant market, taking   account of their appropriateness in each specific case and setting the starting moment in   time for the fulfilment of such obligations:   1) obligation of transparency in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of this   Law;   2) obligation of non-discrimination in accordance with the provisions of Article 19   of this Law;   3) obligation of accounting separation in accordance with the provisions of Article   20 of this Law;   4) obligation to provide access in accordance with the provisions of Articles 21 and   22 of this Law;   5) obligations of price control and cost accounting in accordance with the provisions   of Article 23 of this Law;   6) obligation of functional separation in accordance with the provisions of Article   231 of this Law;   7) obligations concerning the provision of services to end users in accordance with   the provisions of Article 32 of this Law.   2. In the cases referred to in Article 26 of this Law, undertakings having significant   market power on the relevant market must fulfil the relevant obligations without a separate   decision by the Communications Regulatory Authority. Undertakings must also, without a   separate decision by the Communications Regulatory Authority, fulfil the additional   obligation specified in paragraph 5 of Article 18 of this Law. The undertaking must fulfil   the obligations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph as of the moment of its   identification as having significant market power on the relevant market and the obligation   referred to in the second sentence – as of the moment that the undertaking must start   fulfilling the main obligation. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the   right to set another moment for the start of fulfilment of obligations, but not an earlier   moment than those referred to in this paragraph.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to impose specific   detailed obligations without exceeding the obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of   this Article.   4. In exceptional circumstances (i.e. where the Communications Regulatory   Authority, having regard to paragraph 6 of this Article and/or Article 16(20), determines         33   that the obligations referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article would not be sufficient   to achieve the objectives set forth in Article 16(1)), the Communications Regulatory   Authority shall have the right to impose on operators with significant market power other   obligations for access, including interconnection, than those set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and   3 of this Article, subject to a consent from the European Commission.   5. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to attach to those   obligations conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness. The   Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to specify the obligations   provided for in this Article and lay down the conditions of their fulfilment by approving, in   the cases provided for in this Law, the rules, procedures and/or conditions mandatory for all   undertakings that have to fulfil the relevant obligations as well as by imposing, in all cases,   specific detailed obligations and/or conditions of their fulfilment on specific undertakings.   6. The obligations imposed on undertakings by the Communications Regulatory   Authority must be reasonable, based on the nature of the problem identified, proportionate   and justified in the light of the principles and objectives of the regulation of electronic   communications activities.   7. Where it is established on the basis of a relevant market analysis that the market   characteristics do not justify the imposition of obligations referred to in this Article and/or   that there are no undertakings having significant market power in the said market, the   Communications Regulatory Authority shall not impose, in accordance with the procedure   and conditions set out in this Law, the obligations referred to in this Article and/or shall   withdraw the obligations, if any, imposed on the undertakings having significant market   power. When withdrawing obligations, the Communications Regulatory Authority may by   a reasoned decision set the final date for their implementation which should not be later than   28 days from the publication of the information referred to in Article 16(19) of this Law on   the website of the Communications Regulatory Authority.   8. After having conducted a repeated market analysis, the Communications   Regulatory Authority may amend the imposed obligations by applying mutatis mutandis the   provisions of this Article concerning the imposition of obligations.      Article 18. Obligation of transparency   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority may require an operator having   significant market power on the relevant market to make public the information specified         34   by the Communications Regulatory Authority and relating to access, including   interconnection and:   1) accounting information;   2) technical specifications;   3) network characteristics;   4) the provision of access and conditions of use, including access to services, and/or   applications are legitimate restrictions;   5) prices of access and related services.   2. The Communications Regulatory Authority may require operators having   significant market power on the relevant market to publish a reference offer to provide   access, including interconnection. The offer must be sufficiently detailed to ensure that   undertakings are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service   requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components   according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions including prices. The   Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to request that the operator   having significant market power change, within the time limit set by the Communications   Regulatory Authority, the terms and conditions of a reference offer in order to give effect to   obligations imposed under this Law on operators with significant market power.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority may specify the precise information   to be made available under paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of this Article, the level of detail required,   the manner of publication and other terms and conditions of publication.   4. The information referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of this Article, including   geographic network interconnection points, conditions of interconnection testing, electronic   communications infrastructure sharing and payment terms, conditions for selecting the   electronic communications service provider and tariffs, may not be considered a commercial   secret.   5. The operator, obliged to provide wholesale access to physical infrastructure   including full or shared access at a fixed location, must in accordance with the conditions   of the Communications Regulatory Authority, publish a reference offer, including the   content of the reference offer. Provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply to   such a reference offer.      Article 19. Obligation of non-discrimination         35   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority may impose obligations of non-  discrimination, in relation to access, on an operator having significant market power on the   relevant market so that the operator does not discriminate against other undertakings and, in   particular, applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other undertakings   providing equivalent services, and provides services and information to others under the   same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services, or those of its   subunits or subsidiaries.   2. The Communications Regulatory Authority must impose the obligation defined   in paragraph 1 above, where necessary, to ensure that vertically integrated undertakings   controlled by the State or municipalities, which provide electronic communications   networks built subject to exclusive or special rights and which have significant market   power, do not discriminate against other undertakings thus giving advantage to their own   operations.      Article 20. Obligation of accounting separation   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority may impose obligations for   accounting separation in relation to specified activity or activities related to access on an   operator having significant market power on the relevant market.   2. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall establish the rules on accounting   separation and the related requirements, including the auditing requirement.      Article 21. Obligation to provide access   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority may impose obligations on an   operator having significant market power on the relevant market to satisfy reasonable   requests by other undertakings for access to, and use of, specific network elements and   associated facilities, including:   1) to provide access to specific network elements and/or other facilities of   undertakings, including access to a network of passive elements, and/or unbundled access   to the local loop, in order to allow provider of public fixed telephone service, in advance   and on an individual basis, make his choice, and/or submit a proposal to provide the   wholesale local loop for provision of public telephone services;   2) to negotiate in good faith with undertakings requesting access;   3) not to withdraw access to facilities already granted;   4) to provide specified services for resale;         36   5) to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies   that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or provision of virtual network   services;   6) to provide co-location or other forms of sharing of electronic communications   infrastructure;   7) to provide specific services needed to ensure the provision of service to users;   8) to provide access to operational support systems or other similar software systems   necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services;   9) to interconnect networks or network facilities, including the possibility to   interconnect networks at any network point where this is technically feasible;   10) to provide access to associated services, including the identity, location and   presence services.   2. When adopting a decision on imposing or withdrawing the obligations referred to   in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Communications Regulatory Authority shall take account   of the principles and objectives of this Law and of the following factors:   1) technical and economic feasibility of using or installing competing technical   facilities in accordance with market developments, taking into account nature and type of   access, including interconnection, as well as the ability to access other facilities;   2) the feasibility of providing the access requested, in relation to the capacity   (resources) available;   3) initial investments of the facility owner, taking into consideration investments   made by public sector and investment risk;   4) the need to ensure long-term competition, including expansion of electronic   communications infrastructure and cost-effectiveness of development;   5) intellectual property rights;   6) the provision of services covering more than one European Union Member State.   3. When imposing a specific obligation, the Communications Regulatory Authority   shall have the right to set forth the conditions for providing access and/or technical   specifications that are mandatory for access provider and/or user in order to ensure proper   network operation.      Article 22. Access   1. Undertakings that are legitimately engaged in an electronic communications   activity shall have the right to negotiate access freely. Operators shall have a right and, when         37   requested by another operator or a public electronic communications service provider   seeking to provide public electronic communications services or to secure such provision,   an obligation to negotiate network interconnection in order to ensure provision and   interoperability of services.   2. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall encourage and where   appropriate ensure, in accordance with the procedure established by this Law, adequate   access and compatibility of services in order to promote efficiency, long-term competition,   effective investments and innovation implementation and give the maximum possible   benefit to end users. With this aim in view the Communications Regulatory Authority shall   have the right to impose, in accordance with the procedure established by this Law,   obligations on undertakings with significant market power as well as on other undertakings,   in particular:   1) to the extent that is necessary to ensure end-to-end connectivity, obligations on   undertakings that control access to end users, including the obligation to interconnect their   networks where this is not already the case;   2) to the extent that is necessary to ensure accessibility for end users to specific   digital radio and television broadcasting services, obligations on operators to ensure access   to application program interfaces and electronic programme guides on fair, reasonable and   non-discriminatory terms.   3) to the extent it is necessary to ensure service consistency, the obligations on   undertakings that control access to end-users.   3. Obligations to provide access imposed by the Communications Regulatory   Authority and/or the related conditions imposed thereby shall be objective, transparent,   proportionate and non-discriminatory and the relevant decisions shall be taken pursuant to   the rules applied to the cases specified in Article 11(1) of this Law and, mutatis mutandis,   the rules laid down in Article 16(12), (14) to (16) of this Law.   4. In the case referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, an undertaking may refuse to   provide, to unilaterally suspend or discontinue access only in the event that such actions are   based on objective criteria, including technical non-feasibility or the necessity to ensure   network integrity.   5. Undertakings shall ensure that any information acquired from other undertakings   before, during or after negotiations for access, except for the information which may not be   confidential subject to the procedure, cases and conditions set out in this Law, be used solely   for the purpose for which it was supplied and respect the confidentiality of information         38   transmitted or stored. Such information may not be passed on to any other party, in particular   other subdivisions, subsidiaries or partners for whom such information could provide a   competitive advantage. The Communications Regulatory Authority may adopt rules   detailing the measures to secure such requirements.   6. When resolving a dispute between undertakings, the Communications Regulatory   Authority shall have the right, in conformity with the principles established by this Law and   in cases justified by the objectives thereof, to issue at its own initiative or in accordance   with the procedure established in Article 28 of this Law a decision on the granting of   undertaking-binding access, including network interconnection, where the granting covers   the imposition of obligations in respect of specific access as specified in paragraph 2 of this   Article.   7. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to adopt rules for   granting and providing access, including network interconnection.      Article 23. Price control and cost accounting obligations   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to impose   obligations on an operator having significant market power relating to cost recovery and   price controls, including obligations to provide access at prices that are based on costs   (taking into account a reasonable rate of return on investment) and obligations concerning   cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of access, in situations where a   market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition (the presence of undertakings   having significant power on the relevant market) means that the operator concerned might   sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-  users. In order to promote investments of the operators, including investment in expansion   of electronic communications networks and development of technologies, when imposing   obligations, the operator's right to receive a reasonable return on investments estimated after   the assessment of the risk of new investments in expansion of electronic communications   networks and development of technologies.   2. Established cost recovery mechanism and/or pricing methodology must promote   efficiency and long-term competition and maximise consumer benefits. In this regard the   Communications Regulatory Authority may take account of prices available in comparable   competitive markets.   3. Where an operator has an obligation for cost orientation of prices, the burden of   proof that prices are cost-oriented taking into account a reasonable rate of return on         39   investment shall lie with the operator having an obligation for cost orientation of prices. The   Communications Regulatory Authority may lay down cost accounting rules for the purpose   of calculating the cost of efficient provision of services and/or networks. The   Communications Regulatory Authority may require an operator who has an obligation for   cost orientation of its prices to provide full justification for cost-oriented pricing; the   Authority may set a reasonable mandatory time limit for the submission of such justification.   Should the operator fail to provide justification for its cost-oriented pricing within the   established time limit, it shall be deemed that its prices are not cost-orientated. The   Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to require that the data submitted   by the operator be audited at the operator's expense. Until an operator who has an obligation   for cost orientation of its prices provides full justification for its cost-oriented pricing, the   Communications Regulatory Authority may temporary set price caps taking into account   the data about relevant costs obtained on the basis of indirect cost assessment methods,   including the comparison of prices for relevant services, having regard to the best practice   of European Union Member States, the practice of countries with a similar level of   development and the practice of the Republic of Lithuania, and the assessment of the ratio   between relevant wholesale and retail prices.   4. The Communications Regulatory Authority may require an operator who has an   obligation regarding the cost control to provide evidence of relevance of its prices and set a   reasonable mandatory time limit for the submission of such evidence. In case the operator   fails, within the time limit set by the Communications Regulatory Authority, to provide   relevance of prices, the prices shall be considered as irrelevant. The Communications   Regulatory Authority shall have the right to require that the data submitted by the operator   be audited at the operator's expense. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have   the right to request a change in the prices or establish price caps by comparing the prices of   the services concerned, taking into account the best practice of the European Union Member   States, practice of similarly developed states, and the practice of the Republic of Lithuania   as well as assessing the wholesale and retail price ratio.   5. Should the Communications Regulatory Authority, in order to ensure a price   control system, authorise the operator to implement the cost accounting system, the operator   must, within the time limit and in accordance with the procedure and conditions set by the   Communications Regulatory Authority, prepare a cost accounting system, make its   description public, submit it to the Communications Regulatory Authority, and maintain   compliance with it. The cost accounting system and the manner of its publication must be         40   in compliance with the cost accounting rules laid down by the Communications Regulatory   Authority. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to establish a   cost accounting system, methodology and/or model to be used by an operator or operators   having significant market power on the relevant market. Such accounting system, method,   and/or model, the Communications Regulatory Authority is required to publish on its   website. Compliance with cost accounting rules and other legal acts as well as with the cost   accounting system, methodology and/or model prepared by the operator and/or established   by the Communications Regulatory Authority must be verified by an audit. The audit   opinion must be published annually in accordance with the rules established by the   Communications Regulatory Authority.      Article 231. Obligation of functional separation   1. Under exceptional circumstances (when the Communications Regulatory   Authority identifies that the obligations imposed by the Article 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 are   not sufficient to ensure effective competition and where important and persisting   competition problems on the market relating to access provision occur), the   Communications Regulatory Authority shall, with regard to Article 17(4) of this Law, have   the right to oblige a vertically integrated undertaking to separate its relevant wholesale   access services from the rest of the undertaking's activities, by transferring it to a separate   legal entity.   2. An undertaking, which has the functional separation obligation, shall provide   access to all undertakings, including subsidiaries of a vertically integrated undertaking   referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, on the same terms and conditions, including the   price and quality of services, and using the same systems and processes.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall notify the European   Commission about their intention to establish a functional separation obligation stating:   1) the grounds on which imposition of the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of   this Article are based;   2) a grounded assessment that effective and long-term competition will not arise in   the electronic communications infrastructure within a reasonable period of time or it will   not be sufficiently effective;   3) the expected impact on the Communications Regulatory Authority, on the   undertaking which is imposed the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article,   particularly on the employees of the undertaking, and the entire electronic communications         41   market, as well as incentives to invest in the electronic communications market in order to   ensure social and territorial cohesion, impact on other interested persons, including the   expected impact on competition and the likely consequences for consumers;   4) evaluation of the reasons underlying implementation of effectiveness of this   obligation for elimination of competition problems for the provision of access in respective   market.   4. In the decision, which is to impose the functional separation obligation, the   Communications Regulatory Authority shall state:   1) the exact nature and level of functional separation;   2) assets to be separated and access to be provided;   3) the governance arrangements to ensure structural staff and promotion   independence;   4) the rules ensuring compliance with the obligation;   5) the rules for ensuring business process transparency, particularly with regard to   the persons concerned;   6) monitoring program of compliance with the obligation, including publication of   the annual report.   5. The decision of the Communications Regulatory Authority to set, leave effective,   amend or repeal obligations shall be made only after the analysis of wholesale market for   provision of relevant access and in accordance with the rules applied to cases referred to in   Article 11(1) of this Law, and, mutatis mutandis, the rules laid down in Article 16 of this   Law.   6. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to impose on the   undertaking, which has a functional separation obligation, the obligations provided for in   Article 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 or other obligations which are legitimate, consistent with   the nature of the identified problem, proportionate and justified by electronic   communications regulatory principles and purposes and which are not provided for in   Article 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of this Law, if the European Commission allows it.      Article 232. Voluntary separation of a vertically integrated undertaking   1. With the intention to separate the management of all assets of the access to the   network or a substantial part of the management of the undertaking from other activities of   this undertaking or with the intention to transfer assets related to network access or a   substantial part of the assets by the right of ownership to another undertaking, with which it         42   is not linked by virtue of control or dependency, and thus render analogous access services   to retail market public communications networks service providers and/or public electronic   communications service providers, including its own retailers, the undertaking that has a   significant power on one or several relevant markets must notify the Communications   Regulatory Authority thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions provided for in   the rules of the Communications Regulatory Authority, in order they evaluate the impact of   the expected transaction. The undertaking must also notify the Communications Regulatory   Authority of any changes in the intentions of voluntary separation of and the final results of   the voluntary separation according to the terms and conditions set in the rules of the   Communications Regulatory Authority.   2. Having received the information provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the   Communications Regulatory Authority shall impose, leave effective, amend or repeal   obligations only after the analysis of the markets providing network access and in   accordance with the rules applicable to cases referred to in Article 11(1) of this Law and,   mutatis mutandis, the rules laid down in Article 16 of this Law and after the assessment of   the impact of a voluntary separation of an undertaking having significant market power in   one or several relevant markets on the obligations imposed on this undertaking.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to impose on the   undertaking, which has taken over all or a substantial part of the management and control   of the access to network assets, the obligations set In Article 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of   this Law or other obligations which are legitimate, consistent with the nature of the problem   identified, proportionate and justified by the electronic communications regulatory   principles and purposes and which are provided for in Article 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of   this Law, if the European Commission allows it.      Article 24. Digital television distribution   Providers of electronic communications networks used for the distribution of digital   television services shall ensure the possibility to distribute wide-screen digital television   services and programmes. Operators that receive and redistribute wide-screen digital   television services or programmes shall maintain that wide-screen format.      Article 25. Conditional access services and associated facilities   1. Undertakings controlling conditional access systems shall use only such systems   of conditional access to digital radio and/or television services, irrespective of the means of         43   transmission, that would have the necessary technical capability for cost-effective   transmission control (i.e. technical procedures enabling to transfer conditional access   control from one broadcaster (transmission provider) to another broadcaster (transmission   provider), allowing the possibility for full control at local or regional level of the services   by operators using such systems.   2. Undertakings that provide conditional access services to digital radio and/or   television services, irrespective of the means of transmission, whose services broadcasters   depend on to reach any group of potential viewers or listeners, irrespective of the means of   transmission, must:   1) offer to all broadcasters, on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis,   technical services enabling the broadcasters’ digitally-transmitted services to be received by   viewers or listeners authorised by means of decoders provided and administered by the   service providers (operators);   2) if undertakings are engaged, apart from the provision of conditional access to   digital radio and/or television services, in other activities, keep separate financial accounts   regarding their activity as conditional access providers in accordance with the rules for   accounting separation laid down by the Communications Regulatory Authority and in   conformity with requirements related to accounting separation, including the auditing   requirement.   3. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to establish the   procedure and conditions for implementing the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this   Article.   4. When granting licences to manufacturers of consumer equipment or otherwise   granting them the right to use relevant intellectual property rights, holders of intellectual   property rights to conditional access to digital radio and/or television service products and   systems must ensure that this is done on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.   Taking into account technical and commercial factors, holders of rights may not subject the   granting of rights to conditions prohibiting, deterring or discouraging the inclusion in the   same product of a common interface allowing connection with several other access systems   as well as means specific to another access system, provided that the assignee of rights   complies with the relevant and reasonable conditions ensuring, as far as he is concerned, the   security of transactions of conditional access system operators.         44   5. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to establish   requirements for the provision and use of electronic programme guides and similar listing   and navigation facilities.   6. It shall be prohibited to manufacture, keep, use, import, export, sell, lease or   otherwise transfer, modify, install and maintain decoders, other equipment or software for   commercial purposes enabling illegal access to protected services. The advertising of such   equipment and software shall be prohibited. Persons having committed the aforementioned   illm -egal actions shall be held liable in accordance with the procedure established by the   law. The State Consumer Rights Protection Authority shall supervise compliance with the   provisions set out in this paragraph in accordance with the procedure established by the   Government.      Article 26. Special measures ensuring effective competition   1. Undertakings controlled by the State or municipalities or holding exclusive or   special rights, which have significant market power in a considerable part of the common   market for the provision of public communications networks and public telephone services   and which control a cable television network installed using exclusive or special rights held   or being held in the same geographical area, may provide a cable television network only   through a legal person other than the legal person used for the provision of a public   communications network.   2. Providers of public communications networks and/or public electronic   communications services which have also been granted special or exclusive rights for the   provision of services in other economic sectors of the Republic of Lithuania or other   European Union Member States shall keep separate accounts for the activities associated   with the provision of electronic communications networks and/or services in accordance   with the accounting separation rules and related requirements including the audit   requirement and the requirement to have structural separation for the activities associated   with the provision of electronic communications networks and/or services as established by   the Communications Regulatory Authority. The Communications Regulatory Authority   shall have the right to specify the requirements for structural separation.   3. Paragraph 2 of this Article shall not apply to undertakings the annual turnover of   which in activities associated with electronic communications networks and/or services in   the Republic of Lithuania is less than EUR 50 million.         45   4. Any undertakings providing public electronic communications networks or public   electronic communications services, except for small and medium-sized enterprises, must   ensure that their annual financial reports are audited and published. This provision shall also   apply to all separate accounts kept pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article. The   Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to specify the procedure and   conditions for implementing the provisions of this paragraph.      Article 27. Measures ensuring the interoperability of electronic   communications   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall adopt legal acts obligating to   comply with the standards set by international and European standardisation organisations,   which have been transposed into Lithuanian standards in accordance with the established   procedure, as well as with original Lithuanian standards, international and European   specifications and/or recommendations for the provision of electronic communications   networks and services as well as associated facilities and services including the broadcasting   of radio and/or television programmes, technical interfaces and/or network functions, and   the interoperability of terminal equipment, including radio and television programme   reception equipment.

Until international or European standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 1   above have not been transposed into Lithuanian standards, the Communications Regulatory   Authority may request direct compliance with the relevant standards. After having   transposed the relevant standard into a Lithuanian standard, any reference to the   international or European standard shall be considered to be a reference to the relevant   Lithuanian standard. A person or undertaking shall be considered as having fulfilled the   obligation to comply with international or European standards in the areas referred to in   paragraph 1 above if the person/undertaking complies with the relevant standards   transposing international or European standards.   3. Technical requirements of the standards declared by persons or undertakings   which have submitted on a voluntary basis a declaration of conformity of their products or   services to such standards, including international, European, foreign and Lithuanian   standards, shall be binding on the said persons/undertakings.         46   4. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall have the right to establish   independent technical requirements in the areas referred to in paragraph 1 above.   5. The Lithuanian national standardisation authority shall ensure, within the scope   of its competence, that international and European standards for the provision of electronic   communications networks and services, associated facilities and services including the   broadcasting of radio and/or television programmes, technical interfaces and/or network   functions, and the interoperability of terminal equipment, including radio and television   reception equipment, are transposed into Lithuanian standards.   6. The owners of application program interfaces shall make available on fair,   reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and against appropriate remuneration, all such   information as is necessary to enable providers of digital television services to provide all   services supported by the application program interface in a fully functional form, including   digital television services provision to disabled end-users.   7. Certificates of conformity issued by the relevant EU institutions and the relevant   institutions authorised by EU Member States in respect of measuring instruments and   standards recognised in EU Member States shall be recognised in the Republic of Lithuania.   The procedure of such recognition shall be established by the Government in conformity   with international commitments.      Article 28. Settlement of disputes between undertakings   1. The Communications Regulatory Authority shall, in the framework of mandatory   preliminary out-of-court procedure, resolve disputes over social relations pertaining to the   subject of this Law which arise between undertakings providing electronic communications   networks and/or services. For solving disputes between the infrastructure users and   infrastructure managers over social relations regulated by Articles 381 and 39 of this Law,   provisions of this Article shall apply.

Access prices related to the enforcement of such rights shall be cost   oriented. For this purpose, the rules set out in Article 23 of this Law shall apply. Tariffs   imposed on subscribers for the exercise of such rights may not act as a disincentive for the   use of such a possibility. For this purpose, the Communications Regulatory Authority may   fix a tariff ceiling.   2. The obligation referred to in paragraph 1 above may be imposed by the   Communications Regulatory Authority on any undertaking having significant market power   on the relevant market as well as in relation to the imposition of the obligation referred to   in Article 17(1)(4) of this Law.

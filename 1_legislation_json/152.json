The Internet today is the perfect illustration of the possibilities afforded by information  and communication technologies, which, through the services it offers (digital  technologies for the communication, transmission and archiving of information, etc.),  remains a powerful means of communication used by millions of people.    In fact, the transition from analog to digital heralds the arrival of a new age and of a  genuine \"digital revolution\" that has profoundly changed the face of traditional society,  which has very quickly been transformed into an information society where the  possession of information has become a coveted strategic asset.    However, while the permanent interconnectedness of computer networks offers States a  major opportunity to exploit the potential of information and communication  technologies to promote the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration and  the development of commercial transactions and good governance, the digital  environment offered by information and communication technologies, particularly the  Internet, is increasingly a place where reprehensible acts of all kinds are committed,  damaging the interests both of private individuals and of the general public.    The emergence of this new criminal phenomenon known as cybercrime, which is  transnational, intangible and volatile in nature and whose perpetrators are anonymous,  has contributed to the blurring of reference points in the penal system, whose traditional  and ongoing responses, conceived and developed for a tangible and nationally based  environment, have quickly proved to be inappropriate and unsuitable for dealing with the  new reality of the digital era.    A review of Senegalese criminal legislation has thus shown that it is ill-equipped to deal  with the specific nature of digital crime in terms of both substantive and procedural law.    With regard to substantive criminal law, the analysis of Senegalese legislation has  revealed legal situations in which computer systems, computerized data and computer  networks are targeted by cybercrime. It has also highlighted other cases in which the law  has been found to be inadequate, where information and communication technologies, in  particular the Internet, are used as a means to commit wrongdoing.    In criminal procedural law, the regulations that should govern all stages of cybercrime  proceedings (investigation, prosecution, examination proceedings and judgment) have  been found to be inadequate.       e24702_SN008  Translated from French   2  Computer-related crime concerns any offense involving the use of information and  communication technologies. In this regard, the concepts of cybercrime, computer- related crime, cybercriminal, computer-related offenses, hi-tech crime, etc., have the  same meaning.    Therefore, for obvious crime-policy reasons, a cyberstrategy for dealing with cybercrime  needs to be developed in Senegal by adapting the penal system, in particular updating  traditional definitions of criminal offenses and adjusting traditional procedural  instruments in the light of information and communication technologies.    The present draft law consists of two parts:    (1) part one, relating to substantive criminal law, consists of three titles dealing with the  establishment of offenses specific to information and communication technologies and  the adaptation of certain definitions of offenses and certain penalties to the context of  information and communication technologies;    (2) part two, relating to criminal procedural law, consists of two titles concerning, on the  one hand, adjustments to traditional procedures in the light of information and  communication technologies and, on the other, the adoption of a procedure specific to  offenses relating to personal data.    This is the subject of the present draft law.     e24702_SN008  Translated from French   3  REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL  One People – One Goal – One Faith     Law No. 2008-11 on Cybercrime     The National Assembly adopted, at its session of Friday, November 30, 2007,  The Senate adopted, at its session of Tuesday, January 15, 2008,  And the President of the Republic hereby promulgates the Law set out below:    Article 1  Title III, \"Offenses relating to information and communication technologies\", consisting  of Articles 431-7 to 431-65 set out below, shall be inserted after Article 431-6 of the  Penal Code.

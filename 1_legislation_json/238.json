(2) The processing of special categories of personal data as referred to in Article 9 (1) of  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for a purpose other than the one for which the data were collected  shall be permitted if the conditions of subsection 1 are met and an exception pursuant to   Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or pursuant to Section 22 applies.   Section 24  Processing for other purposes by private bodies   (1) Private bodies shall be permitted to process personal data for a purpose other than the   one for which the data were collected if   1. processing is necessary to prevent threats to state or public security or to  prosecute criminal offences; or   2. processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal  claims,   unless the data subject has an overriding interest in not having the data processed.

Employees’ personal data may be processed to detect crimes only if there is a   documented reason to believe the data subject has committed a crime while employed, the  processing of such data is necessary to investigate the crime and is not outweighed by the  data subject’s legitimate interest in not processing the data, and in particular the type and   extent are not disproportionate to the reason.  (2) If personal data of employees are processed on the basis of consent, then the  employee’s level of dependence in the employment relationship and the circumstances   under which consent was given shall be taken into account in assessing whether such  consent was freely given. Consent may be freely given in particular if it is associated with a  legal or economic advantage for the employee, or if the employer and employee are  pursuing the same interests.

Subsection 2 shall also apply to consent to the   processing of special categories of personal data; consent must explicitly refer to these data.  Section 22 (2) shall apply accordingly.  (4) The processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data of   employees for employment-related purposes, shall be permitted on the basis of collective  agreements.

The controller shall take appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the interests   of the data subject in accordance with Section 22 (2), second sentence.  (2) The rights of data subjects provided in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 of Regulation (EU)  2016/679 shall be limited to the extent that these rights are likely to render impossible or   seriously impair the achievement of the research or statistical purposes, and such limits are  necessary for the fulfilment of the research or statistical purposes. Further, the right of  access according to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall not apply if the data are   necessary for purposes of scientific research and the provision of information would involve  disproportionate effort.

Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 17 of 43   (2) The right of access according to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall not apply if  the archival material is not identified with the person’s name or no information is g iven which  would enable the archival material to be found with reasonable administrative effort.   (3) The right of the data subject to rectification according to Article 16 of Regulation (EU)  2016/679 shall not apply if the personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the  public interest. If the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data, he or she shall   have the opportunity to present his or her version. The responsible archive shall be obligated  to add this version to the files.  (4) The rights provided in Article 18 (1) (a), (b) and (d) and in Articles 20 and 21 of   Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall not apply as far as these rights are likely to render  impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the archiving purposes in the public  interest, and the exceptions are necessary to fulfil those purposes.

By derogation from the exception pursuant to the third sentence, the data subject  pursuant to Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be informed if the interests of the   data subject outweigh the interest in secrecy, in particular taking into account the threat of  damage.  (2) If in the context of a client-lawyer relationship the data of third persons are transferred to   persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy, the transferring body shall not  be obligated to inform the data subject according to Article 13 (3) of Regulation (EU)  2016/679 unless the data subject has an overriding interest in being informed.

Section  13 (4), fourth to seventh sentences shall apply accordingly.   (4) The bodies subject to monitoring and the persons responsible for their management shall  provide a supervisory authority on request with the information necessary to perform their  tasks. The person required to provide information may refuse to answer those questions   which would expose him- or herself or a relative as referred to in Section 383 (1) nos. 1 to 3  of the Code of Civil Procedure to the risk of criminal prosecution or proceedings under the  Administrative Offences Act. The person required to provide information shall be informed   accordingly.

Section 56  Notification of data subjects   (1) If special legislation provides for or requires notifying data subjects of the processing of  their personal data, especially in the case of undercover operations, such notification shall  include at least the following information:   1. the information listed in Section 55;   2. the legal basis for the processing;   3. the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible,  the criteria used to determine that period;   4. the categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 29 of 43   5. where necessary, further information, in particular where the personal data were  collected without the knowledge of the data subject.   (2) In the cases of subsection 1, the controller may postpone, limit or refrain from notification   if and so long as   1. the performance of the tasks listed in Section 45,   2. public security, or   3. the legally protected interests of third parties   would otherwise be threatened, if the interest in avoiding these threats overrides the interest  of the data subject in the information.  (3) If the notification relates to the transfer of personal data to the authorities for the   protection of the Constitution, the Federal Intelligence Service, the Military  Counterintelligence Service and, as far as the security of the Federation is affected, other  authorities of the Federal Ministry of Defence, such notification shall be permitted only with   the approval of these bodies.  (4) Section 57 (7) shall apply accordingly in case of restriction pursuant to subsection 2.   Section 57  Right of access   (1) The controller shall inform data subjects on request whether data concerning them are  being processed. Data subjects shall also have the right to information about   1. the personal data being processed and the categories to which they belong;   2. the available information on the origin of the data;   3. the purposes of and legal basis for the processing;   4. the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data have been disclosed,  in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;   5. the period for which the data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria  used to determine that period;   6. the existence of the right to rectification or erasure of data or restriction of  processing of data by the controller;   7. the right pursuant to Section 60 to lodge a complaint with the Federal  Commissioner, and   8. the contact details of the Federal Commissioner.   (2) Subsection 1 shall not apply to personal data recorded only because they may not be  erased due to legal or statutory provisions on retention, or only for purposes of monitoring   data protection or safeguarding data, if providing information would require a  disproportionate effort, and appropriate technical and organizational measures make  processing for other purposes impossible.   (3) No information shall be provided if the data subject does not provide information enabling  the data to be located and if the effort required is therefore disproportionate to the data  subject’s interest in the information.   (4) Subject to the conditions of Section 56 (2), the controller may dispense with the provision  of information pursuant to subsection 1, first sentence, or restrict, wholly or partly, the  provision of information pursuant to subsection 1, second sentence.   (5) If the information to be provided relates to the transfer of personal data to the authorities  for the protection of the Constitution, the Federal Intelligence Service, the Military  Counterintelligence Service and, as far as the security of the Federation is affected, other      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 30 of 43   authorities of the Federal Ministry of Defence, such provision shall be permitted only with the  approval of these bodies.  (6) The controller shall notify the data subject, without delay, in writing of any refusal or   restriction of access. This shall not apply if providing this information would entail a threat as  referred to in Section 56 (2). The notification pursuant to the first sentence shall include the  reasons for the refusal or the restriction unless providing the reasons would undermine the   intended purpose of the refusal or restriction of access.  (7) If the data subject is notified pursuant to subsection 6 of the refusal or restriction of  access, he or she may exercise his or her right of access also via the Federal   Commissioner. The controller shall inform the data subject of this possibility and that, in  accordance with Section 60, the data subject may lodge a complaint with the Federal  Commissioner or seek a judicial remedy. If the data subject exercises his or her right   pursuant to the first sentence, the information shall be provided to the Federal Commissioner  at the request of the data subject, unless the responsible supreme federal authority  determines in the individual case that doing so would threaten the security of the Federation   or a Land. The Federal Commissioner shall at least inform the data subject that all  necessary checks have been conducted or that the Federal Commissioner has conducted a  review. This notification may include information as to whether violations of data protection   law were found. The notification from the Federal Commissioner to the data subject shall not  permit any conclusions to be drawn concerning the information held by the controller unless  the latter agrees to the provision of more extensive information. The controller may refuse to   such provision only as far as and for as long as he or she could dispense with or restrict  information pursuant to subsection 4. The Federal Commissioner shall also inform the data  subject of his or her right to seek a judicial remedy.   (8) The controller shall document the factual or legal reasons on which the decision is based.   Section 58  Right to rectification and erasure and to restriction of processing   (1) The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without delay the   rectification of inaccurate data concerning him or her. In particular in the case of statements  or assessments, the question of accuracy is not relevant for the content of the statement or  assessment. If the accuracy or inaccuracy of the data cannot be ascertained, the controller   shall restrict processing instead of erasing the data. In this case, the controller shall inform  the data subject before lifting the restriction of processing. The data subject may also ask to  have incomplete personal data completed, if doing so is appropriate when taking into   account the purposes of processing.  (2) The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal  data concerning him or her without delay where processing such data is unlawful, knowledge   of the data is no longer necessary for the performance of tasks, or the data must be erased  to comply with a legal obligation.  (3) Instead of erasure, the controller may restrict processing where   1. there is reason to assume that erasure would adversely affect legitimate  interests of the data subject,   2. the data must be retained for the purposes of evidence in proceedings serving  the purposes of Section 45, or   3. erasure would be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort due to  the specific mode of storage.   Data subject to restricted processing pursuant to the first sentence may be processed only   for the purpose which prevented their erasure.  (4) In automated filing systems, technical measures shall ensure that the restriction of  processing is clearly recognizable and processing for other purposes is not possible without   further examination.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 31 of 43   (5) If the controller has rectified inaccurate data, he or she shall communicate the  rectification to the body from which he or she received the personal data. In cases of  rectification, erasure or restriction of processing pursuant to subsections 1 to 3, the controller   shall inform recipients to whom the data were transferred about these measures . The  recipient shall rectify or erase the data or restrict their processing.  (6) The controller shall inform the data subject in writing of any refusal to rectify or erase   personal data or restrict its processing. This shall not apply if providing this information would  entail a threat as referred to in Section 56 (2). The information pursuant to the first sentence  shall include the reasons for the refusal unless providing the reasons would undermine the   intended purpose of the refusal.  (7) Section 57 (7) and (8) shall apply accordingly.   Section 59  Modalities for exercising the rights of the data subject   (1) The controller shall communicate with data subjects in a concise, intelligible and easily  accessible form, using clear and plain language. Regardless of special formal requirements,  when responding to requests, the controller shall provide the information in the same form as   the request.  (2) When responding to requests, without prejudice to Section 57 (6) and Section 58 (6) the  controller shall inform the data subject in writing about the follow-up to his or her request   without delay.  (3) Information provided pursuant to Section 55, any communication made pursuant to  Sections 56 and 66, and requests processed pursuant to Sections 57 and 58 shall be free of   charge. Where a request pursuant to Sections 57 and 58 is manifestly unfounded or  excessive, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on its administrative costs, or  may refuse to act on the request. In this case, the controller must be able to demonstrate the   manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.  (4) Where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a data subject  making the request pursuant to Sections 57 or 58, the controller may request the provision of   additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.   Section 60  Right to lodge a complaint with the Federal Commissioner   (1) Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall  have the right to lodge a complaint with the Federal Commissioner, if the data subject   believes that the processing by public bodies of personal data relating to him or her for the  purposes listed in Section 45 infringes his or her rights. This shall not apply to the processing  of personal data by courts, if they have processed these data in the context of their judicial   activities. The Federal Commissioner shall inform the data subject of the progress and the  outcome of the complaint and of the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Section 61.  (2) If a complaint about processing is lodged with the Federal Commissioner instead of the   competent supervisory authority in another Member State of the European Union, the  Federal Commissioner shall transmit the complaint to the competent supervisory authority  without delay. In this case, the Federal Commissioner shall inform the data subject about the   transmission of his or her complaint and shall provide further support at the data subject’s  request.   Section 61  Legal remedies against decisions of the Federal Commissioner or if he or she fails to   take action  (1) Without prejudice to any other legal remedy, every natural or legal person shall have the  right to take legal action against a legally binding decision of the Federal Commissioner.   (2) Subsection 1 shall apply accordingly to data subjects if the Federal Commissioner does  not handle a complaint pursuant to Section 60 or does not inform the data subject within  three months of the progress or outcome of the complaint.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 32 of 43   Chapter 4  Obligations of controllers and processors   Section 62  Processing carried out on behalf of a controller   (1) Where personal data are processed by other persons or bodies on behalf of a controller,  the controller shall ensure compliance with the provisions of this Act and other data  protection provisions. The data subject shall assert his or her rights to access, rectification,   erasure, restriction of processing and the right to receive compensation against the  controller.  (2) A controller may use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement   appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will  meet the requirements of the law and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subjects.  (3) Processors shall not engage other processors without prior written authorization by the   controller. If the controller has given the processor general authorization to engage other  processors, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the  addition or replacement of other processors. In this case, the controller may object to such   changes.  (4) Where a processor engages another processor, the former shall impose on the latter the  same data protection obligations as set out in the contract between the controller and the   processor as referred to in subsection 5 if these obligations are not already binding for the  latter processor because of other legislation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil these  obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance   of that other processor's obligations.  (5) Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal instrument that  is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject matter   and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of  personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.  That contract or other legal instrument shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor   1. acts only on instructions from the controller; if the processor believes that an  instruction is unlawful, the processor shall inform the controller without delay;   2. ensures that persons authorized to process the personal data have committed  themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of  confidentiality;   3. assists the controller by any appropriate means to ensure compliance with the  provisions on the data subject's rights;   4. at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the  controller after the end of the provision of data processing services, and deletes existing  copies unless law requires storage of the personal data;   5. makes available to the controller all information necessary, in particular the logs  kept in accordance with Section 76, to demonstrate compliance with these obligations;   6. allows for and contributes to audits conducted by the controller or another  auditor mandated by the controller;   7. complies with the conditions referred to in subsections 3 and 4 for engaging  another processor;   8. takes all measures required pursuant to Section 64; and   9. assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to  Sections 64 to 67 and 69 taking into account the nature of processing and the information  available to the processor.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 33 of 43   (6) The contract referred to in subsection 5 shall be in writing or in an electronic form.  (7) A processor that determines, in violation of this provision, the purposes and means of  processing, shall be considered a controller in respect of that processing.   Section 63  Joint controllers   Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they  shall be considered joint controllers. Joint controllers shall determine their respective tasks   and responsibilities under data protection law in a transparent manner in an agreement,  unless these tasks and responsibilities are already determined by law. In particular, this  agreement must indicate which of them must meet which information obligations, and how   and with respect to whom data subjects may exercise their rights. Such an agreement shall  not prevent data subjects from asserting their rights against each of the joint controllers.   Section 64  Requirements for the security of data processing   (1) The controller and the processor, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of  implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the  risk of varying likelihood and severity for the legally protected interests of natural persons,   shall implement the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of  security appropriate to the risk when processing personal data, in particular as regards the  processing of special categories of personal data. In doing so, the controller shall take into   account the relevant Technical Guidelines and recommendations from the Federal Office for  Information Security.  (2) The measures referred to in subsection 1 may include pseudonymization and encryption   of personal data, if such means are possible in view of the purposes of processing. The  measures pursuant to subsection 1 should ensure   1. the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing  systems and services in connection with processing; and   2. the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely  manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.   (3) In respect of automated processing, the controller and processor, following an evaluation  of the risks, shall implement measures designed to   1. deny unauthorized persons access to processing equipment used for  processing (‘equipment access control’);   2. prevent the unauthorized reading, copying, modification or erasure of data  media (‘data media control’);   3. prevent the unauthorized input of personal data and the unauthorized  inspection, modification or deletion of stored personal data (‘storage control’);   4. prevent the use of automated processing systems by unauthorized persons  using data communication equipment (‘user control’);   5. ensure that persons authorized to use an automated processing system have  access only to the personal data covered by their access authorization (‘data access   control’);   6. ensure that it is possible to verify and establish the bodies to which personal  data have been or may be transmitted or made available using data communication  equipment (‘communication control’);      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 34 of 43   7. ensure that it is subsequently possible to verify and establish which personal  data have been input into automated processing systems and when and by whom the  personal data were input (‘input control’);   8. ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of personal data are protec ted during  transfers of personal data or during transport of data media (‘transport control’);   9. ensure that installed systems may, in the case of interruption, be restored  (‘recovery’);   10. ensure that all system functions perform and that the appearance of faults in the  functions is reported (‘reliability’);   11. ensure that stored personal data cannot be corrupted by means of a  malfunctioning of the system (‘integrity’);   12. ensure that personal data processed on behalf of the controller can only be  processed in compliance with the controller’s instructions (‘processing control’);   13. ensure that personal data are protected against loss and destruction  (‘availability control’);   14. ensure that personal data collected for different purposes can be processed  separately (‘separability’).   A purpose pursuant to the first sentence, nos. 2 to 5 may be achieved in particular by using  state-of-the-art encryption.   Section 65  Notifying the Federal Commissioner of a personal data breach   (1) In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the Federal   Commissioner without delay and, if possible, not later than 72 hours after having become  aware of it, of the personal data breach, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result  in a risk to the legally protected interests of natural persons. If the Federal Commissioner is   not notified within 72 hours, the notification shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.  (2) A processor shall notify the controller of a personal data breach without delay.  (3) The notification referred to in subsection 1 shall include at least the following information:   1. a description of the nature of the personal data breach including, where  possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the  categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;   2. the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point  where more information can be obtained;   3. a description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and   4. a description of the measures taken or proposed by the controller to address  the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.   (4) If it is not possible to provide the information pursuant to subsection 3 with the  notification, the controller shall provide this information as soon as it is available.  (5) The controller shall document any personal data breaches. This documentation shall   include all the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action  taken.  (6) If the personal data breach involves personal data that have been transmitted by or to a   controller in another Member State of the European Union, the information referred to in  subsection 3 shall be communicated to the controller in that Member State without delay.  (7) Section 42 (4) shall apply accordingly.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 35 of 43   (8) Additional obligations of the controller regarding notifications of personal data breaches  shall remain unaffected.   Section 66  Notifying data subjects affected by a personal data breach   (1) If a personal data breach is likely to result in a substantial risk to the legally protected  interests of natural persons, the controller shall notify the data subject of the personal data  breach without delay.   (2) The notification of the data subject pursuant to subsection 1 shall describe in clear and  plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information  and measures referred to in Section 65 (3) nos. 2 to 4.   (3) Notification shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:   1. the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational  protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by  the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to   any person who is not authorized to access them, such as encryption;   2. the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the substantial  risk referred to in subsection 1 is no longer likely to exist;   3. it would involve a disproportionate effort; in this case, a public communication  shall be made or a similar measure taken to inform the data subjects in an equally  effective manner.   (4) If the controller has not informed the data subjects of a personal data breach, the Federal  Commissioner may formally determine that, in his or her opinion, the conditions referred to in  subsection 3 have not been met. In doing so, the Federal Commissioner shall consider the   likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk as referred to in subsection 1.  (5) The notification of data subjects pursuant to subsection 1 may be delayed, restricted or  omitted under the conditions referred to in Section 56 (2) unless the interests of the data   subjects outweigh those of the controller owing to the high risk resulting from the personal  data breach as referred to in subsection 1.  (6) Section 42 (4) shall apply accordingly.   Section 67  Conducting a data protection impact assessment   (1) Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account  the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a substantial   risk to the legally protected interests of data subjects, the controller shall, prior to the  processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations  on the data subjects.   (2) A joint assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present  similar substantial risks.  (3) The controller shall involve the Federal Commissioner in carrying out the impact   assessment.  (4) The impact assessment shall take the rights of the data subjects affected by the  processing into account and shall contain at least the following:   1. a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the  purposes of the processing;   2. an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations  in relation to their purposes;   3. an assessment of the risks to the legally protected interests of the data  subjects; and      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 36 of 43   4. the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security  measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate  compliance with the law.   (5) Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess whether processing is  performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment.   Section 68  Cooperation with the Federal Commissioner   The controller shall cooperate with the Federal Commissioner in carrying out the latter’s  tasks.   Section 69  Prior consultation of the Federal Commissioner   (1) The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing which will form  part of a new filing system if   1. a data protection impact assessment pursuant to Section 67 indicates that the  processing would result in a substantial risk to the legally protected interests of data  subjects in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk; or   2. the type of processing, in particular, where using new technologies,  mechanisms or procedures, involves a substantial risk to the legally protected interests of  data subjects.   The Federal Commissioner may draw up a list of the processing operations which are   subject to prior consultation pursuant to the first sentence.  (2) In the case of subsection 1, the Federal Commissioner shall be presented with   1. the data protection impact assessment carried out pursuant to Section 67;   2. where applicable, information on the respective responsibilities of the controller,  joint controllers and processors involved in the processing;   3. information on the purposes and means of the envisaged processing;   4. information on the measures and safeguards intended to protect the legally  protected interests of the data subjects; and   5. the name and contact details of the data protection officer.   On request, the Federal Commissioner shall be given any other information he or she  requires to assess the lawfulness of the processing and, in particular, the existing risks to the  protection of the data subjects’ personal data and the related safeguards.   (3) If the Federal Commissioner believes that the planned processing would violate the law,  in particular because the controller has not sufficiently identified the risk or has not taken  sufficient measures to mitigate the risk, he or she may provide, within a period of up to six   weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, written advice to the controller and, where  applicable, to the processor, as to which additional measures should be taken. The Federal  Commissioner may extend this period by a month, if the planned processing is especially   complex. In this case, the Federal Commissioner shall inform the controller and, where  applicable, the processor of the extension within one month of receipt of the request for  consultation.   (4) If the envisaged processing has substantial significance for the controller’s performance  of tasks and is therefore especially urgent, the controller may initiate processing after the  consultation has started but before the period referred to in subsection 3, first sentence, has   expired. In this case, the recommendations of the Federal Commissioner shall be taken into  account after the fact, and the way the processing is carried out shall be adjusted where  applicable.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 37 of 43   Section 70  Records of processing activities   (1) The controller shall keep a record of all categories of processing activities under its   responsibility. This record shall contain all of the following information:   1. the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the joint  controller; and the name and contact details of the data protection officer;   2. the purposes of the processing;   3. the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or are to be  disclosed;   4. a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of  personal data;   5. where applicable, the use of profiling;   6. where applicable, the categories of transfers of personal data to bodies in a  third country or to an international organization;   7. information about the legal basis for the processing;   8. the envisaged time limits for the erasure or for a review of the need to store the  various categories of personal data; and   9. a general description of the technical and organizational security measures  referred to in Section 64.   (2) The processor shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out   on behalf of a controller, containing   1. the name and contact details of the processor, of each controller on behalf of  which the processor is acting and, where applicable, the data protection officer;   2. where applicable, transfers of personal data to bodies in a third country or to an  international organization, including the identification of that third country or international   organization; and   3. a general description of the technical and organizational security measures  according to Section 64.   (3) The records referred to in subsections 1 and 2 shall be in writing or in electronic form.  (4) Controllers and processors shall make these records available to the Federal   Commissioner on request.   Section 71  Data protection by design and by default   (1) The controller, both at the time the means of processing are determined and at the time   of the processing itself, shall take appropriate measures to implement data protection  principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner, to ensure compliance with  legal requirements and to protect the rights of data subjects. In doing so, the controller shall   take into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope,  context and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for  the legally protected interests of the data subject posed by the processing. In particular,   personal data shall be processed, and processing systems shall be selected and designed in  accordance with the aim of processing as few personal data as possible. Personal data shall  be rendered anonymous or pseudonymized as early as possible, as far as possible in   accordance with the purpose of processing.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 38 of 43   (2) The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to  ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of  the processing are processed. That applies to the amount of data collected, the extent of   their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, the  measures must ensure that by default the data are not made accessible by automated  means to an indefinite number of persons.   Section 72  Distinction between different categories of data subjects   When processing personal data, the controller shall, as far as possible, make a clear  distinction between different categories of data subjects. This applies in part icular to the   following categories:   1. persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they  have committed a criminal offence;   2. persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they  are about to commit a criminal offence;   3. persons convicted of a criminal offence;   4. victims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to whom certain facts  indicate that they could be the victim of a criminal offence; and   5. other persons, such as witnesses, persons who can provide information, or  contacts or associates of the persons referred to in nos. 1 to 4.   Section 73  Distinction between facts and personal assessments   In processing, the controller shall distinguish, as far as possible, personal data based on   facts from personal data based on personal assessments. To this end, the controller shall  identify evaluations based on personal assessments as such, as far as possible and  reasonable in the context of the processing in question. It must also be possible to determine  which body keeps the records on which an evaluation based on a personal assessment is   based.   Section 74  Procedures for data transfers   (1) The controller shall take appropriate measures to ensure that personal data which are   inaccurate or no longer up to date are not transmitted or otherwise made available. To that  end, the controller shall, as far as possible with reasonable effort, verify the quality of the  data before they are transmitted or made available. The controller shall also, as far as   possible and reasonable, in all transmissions of personal data include the necessary  information to enable the recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness and  reliability of the data, and the extent to which they are up to date.   (2) If the processing of personal data is subject to special conditions, in transmissions of data  the transmitting body shall inform the recipient of these conditions and the requirement to  respect them. The obligation of providing information may be met by marking the data   accordingly.  (3) The transmitting body shall not apply conditions to recipients in other Member States of  the European Union or to agencies, offices and bodies established pursuant to Chapters 4   and 5 of Title V of the Third Part of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  other than those applicable to similar domestic transmissions.   Section 75  Rectification and erasure of personal data and restriction of processing   (1) The controller shall rectify inaccurate personal data.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 39 of 43   (2) The controller shall erase personal data without delay if their processing is unlawful, they  must be erased to comply with a legal obligation, or knowledge of the data is no longer  necessary for the controller to perform its tasks.   (3) Section 58 (3) to (5) shall apply accordingly. The recipient shall also be informed if  inaccurate personal data have been transmitted, or if personal data have been transmitted  unlawfully.   (4) Without prejudice to any time limits for storing or erasing data defined in law, the  controller shall provide for appropriate time limits for the erasure of personal data or for a  periodic review of the need for the storage of personal data and shall take procedural   measures to ensure that these time limits are observed.   Section 76  Logging   (1) Controllers and processors shall provide for logs to be kept for at least the following   processing operations in automated processing systems:   1. collection,   2. alteration,   3. consultation,   4. disclosure including transfers,   5. combination, and   6. erasure.   (2) The logs of consultation and disclosure must make it possible to ascertain the  justification, date and time of such operations and, as far as possible, the identity of the  person who consulted or disclosed personal data, and the identity of the recipients of the   data.  (3) The logs may be used only by the data protection officer, the Federal Commissioner or  the data subject to verify the lawfulness of the processing; and for self-monitoring, ensuring  the integrity and security of the personal data, and for criminal proceedings.   (4) The log data shall be erased at the end of the year following the year in which they were  generated.  (5) The controller and the processor shall make the logs available to the Federal   Commissioner on request.   Section 77  Confidential reporting of violations   The controller shall ensure that it is able to receive confidential reports of violations of data   protection law which have occurred in its area of responsibility.   Chapter 5  Transfers of data to third countries and to international organizations   Section 78  General requirements   (1) If all other conditions applicable to data transfers are met, the transfer of personal data to  bodies in third countries or to international organizations shall be permitted if   1. the body or international organization is responsible for the purposes referred to  in Section 45, and   2. the European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision pursuant to  Article 36 (3) of Directive (EU) 2016/680.      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 40 of 43   (2) No transfer of personal data shall be permitted, despite an adequacy decision as referred  to in subsection 1 no. 2 and the public interest in the data transfer to be taken into account, if  in the individual case it cannot be ensured that the data will be handled appropriately in   terms of data protection law and in accordance with fundamental human rights in the area of  responsibility of the recipient, or if a transfer would conflict with other overriding legitimate  interests of a data subject. The controller shall base its assessment on whether the recipient   in the individual case guarantees appropriate protection of the transferred data.  (3) If personal data which have been transmitted or made available from another  European Union Member State are to be transferred pursuant to subsection 1, the   competent body of the other Member State must provide prior authorization of the transfer.  Transfers without the prior authorization shall be permitted only if the transfer is necessary to  prevent an immediate and serious threat to the public security of a country or to essential   interests of a Member State and the prior authorization cannot be obtained in time. In the  case of the second sentence, the other Member State’s body responsible for giving prior  authorization shall be informed of the transfer without delay.   (4) The controller transferring data pursuant to subsection 1 shall take appropriate measures  to ensure that the recipient will transfer the data onward to other third countries or other  international organizations only with the prior authorization of the controller. When deciding   whether to authorize the transfer, the controller shall take into account all relevant factors,  including the seriousness of the criminal offence, the purpose for which the personal data  were originally transferred and the level of personal data protection in the third country or   international organization to which the data are to be transferred onward. The transfer shall  be authorized only if a direct transfer to the other third country or international organization  would be lawful. The responsibility for issuing authorization may also be otherwise provided   for.   Section 79  Data transfers with appropriate safeguards   (1) In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 36 (3) of Directive (EU) 2016/680,   transfers which meet the remaining requirements of Section 78 shall be permitted also if   1. appropriate safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data are  provided for in a legally binding instrument; or   2. the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the transfer and  concludes that appropriate safeguards exist for the protection of personal data.   (2) The controller shall document transfers pursuant to subsection 1 no. 2. The   documentation shall include the date and time of the transfer, the identity of the recipient, the  reason for the transfer and the personal data transferred. It shall be provided to the Federal  Commissioner on request.   (3) The controller shall file a report to the Federal Commissioner at least once a year  covering transfers conducted on the basis of an assessment pursuant to subsection 1 no. 2.  In this report, the controller may categorize the recipients and the purpose of the transfers   appropriately.   Section 80  Data transfers without appropriate safeguards   (1) If in derogation from Section 78 (1) no. 2, no decision pursuant to Article 36 (3) of   Directive (EU) 2016/680 or appropriate safeguards as referred to in Section 79 (1) exist,  transfers which meet the remaining requirements of Section 78 shall be permitted also if they  are necessary   1. to protect the vital interests of a natural person;   2. to safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject;      Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice   and the Federal Office of Justice ‒     Page 41 of 43   3. to prevent an immediate and serious threat to the public security of a country;   4. in individual cases for the purposes referred to in Section 45; or   5. in an individual case for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims  relating to the purposes referred to in Section 45.   (2) The controller shall not transfer data pursuant to subsection 1 if the fundamental rights of   the data subject override the public interest in the transfer.  (3) Section 79 (2) shall apply accordingly to transfers pursuant to subsection 1.   Section 81  Other data transfers to recipients in third countries   (1) In special individual cases and if all other requirements for data transfers to third   countries are met, controllers may transfer personal data directly to recipients in third  countries not referred to in Section 78 (1) no. 1 if the transfer is strictly necessary for the  performance of their tasks and   1. in the specific case no fundamental rights of the data subject override the public  interest in the transfer;   2. transfer to the bodies referred to in Section 78 (1) no. 1 would be ineffective or  inappropriate, in particular because the transfer cannot be carried out in time; and   3. the controller informs the recipient of the purposes of processing and instructs  the recipient that the transferred data may be processed only to the extent necessary for   these purposes.

STATEMDNTo F OBJECTS ANI) ITIiASoNS  Currently Pakistan has no law to comprehensively deal with the  growing threat of cybercrime. The centuries old criminal juetice legal  hamework ie inadequate and ill equipped to addreee the sophisticated online threate of the 21\"t Century cyber age. While this rew age haa exacerbated  both existing crimee when colducted with the use of the Internet, which arc  adequately addreesed by the application of the Electronic Tlansactions Ordinance, 2002 in conjuncti,rn with existing criminal justice legislation, it has aleo grven birth to comp letely new $rpes of cybercriue and criminals  which cannot be elfectively dealt with through the use of exiting iegislation. The latter cannot be addreesed einply by amending exieting legislation or through a patchwork of enarling provisions. 1'he unique nature of these  crimes filde no adequate or analogous provisiona in existing legislation that deal with trafitional olTline crime. Effectivoly addressing these unique and  unprecedented crimes with similarly unique and necesaary procedural  powere, requires a completely uew and comprehensive legal framework that focuses on online conduct of :.ndividuala/ortanizations in the virtual world. The legislation therefore, establishee new offencos inclufing illegal access of data (hackiug), ae well as ini.erference with data and informatior Bystems  @OS and DDOS attacks), specialized cyber related electronic forgery and  electronic fraud, cyber terrorism (electronic or cyber attack on the critical information i.ofrastructure), ulrauthorized ilterception conducted by civili.ans,  use of malicious code viruses, ilentity theft etc.  The legielation providee new inveetigative powers hitherto unavailable euch aa eearch anil seiz\\rre ol'digital forensic evidence ueing technological  neans, production ordere f,rr electronic evidence, electronic evidence  preservation ordere, partial di:closure of traffic data, real time coliection of data under certain circumstances and other enabling powere which are  necsaaary to effectively invesl,igate cyber crime casee. The very technical oature of the new powera that are neceasary to inve8tigate and proaecute  these crimes require their exerciee to be proportionate with the civil liberty    !rotc(l.ions afforded !.o citizcns rrnder tlie Corrstiiul.ion. This can ortly bc  ,](:hic\\od tl,rough strengthcnrng cxisting protecljons and cstablishmg new  safegr. ards cspc0ially againsl ;rl)us. of these new lnd rntruslvc p<rwers- Thc [iill a so rnciudcs spccific saleguatds to balance againsl, these intrusive and  cxtenrive proccdural powers in order trr protect the privacy of citizens and  avoi<l 'rbuse of the exercise of these powers.  I'he introduction of this legislation will effectively prevent cyber crimes  and shall also contribute to thc national security of the Nation whilst providing and enabling a secure environment or investment in IT, c-  c,)mmorce and e-paymcnts systems. This llill shall also afford protection to  crtizers which has hitherto not been completely effectrve, exposing theul to tlre unrnitigal,cd threats posed by cyber crrmrnals both at home and abroad.  r\\NUSHA RAHMAN KHAN Mioi6ter of State for Inforrlation Technology  Member'in'Charge",

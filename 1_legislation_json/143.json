(2) An act of unfair competition includes-     (a) an abuse by a licensee, either inde- pendently or with others, of a significant  market power which unfairly excludes or  limits competition between the licensee and  any other person;     (b) entering into an agreement or engaging in a   concerted practice with any other party,  which unfairly prevents, restricts or distorts  competition;     (c) the perpetuation of anti-competitive   changes in the market structure in and, in  particular, anti-competitive mergers and  acquisitions in the communications sector;  and        (d) any other practice or act which is prohibited  under any other written law.     Market analysis     47. (1) The Authority is charged with-     (a) defining the relevant markets of products  and services within the information and  communications sectors, including the  relevant geographic markets, in accordance  with the principles of this Act; and      (b) carrying out an analysis of the relevant   markets.        68        (2) The Authority has the right to conduct a market  analysis-     (a) at the request of the Minister;     (b) at the request of interested operators; or     (c) on its own initiative.    (3) The Authority also has the right to complete  only parts of the market analysis procedure where  it considers for justified reasons that it is not  feasible to complete the whole procedure.    (4) The Authority shall endeavour to complete the  market analysis within the shortest period of time  possible and in any case within four months after  the decision to initiate a market analysis was  taken.    (5) The Authority may extend the period stipulated  in subsection (4) for a maximum of three times and  in each case for a maximum period of three  months.    (6) The market analysis shall be completed by a  decision of the Authority and shall indicate the  results of every completed stage of the market  analysis.    (7) The Authority shall make publicly available the  list of relevant markets for which undertakings hav- ing significant market power as defined in  subsection (1) have been identified and the list of  undertakings having significant market power as  well as the obligations imposed on them.    (8) The analysis of the market shall be reviewed if  a new definition of the markets is established or  where the Authority deems that there are grounds  for the review.     Relevant  markets         48. (1) Within the scope of market analysis, the  Authority shall determine whether or not a relevant  market is effectively competitive, for the purposes        69                                                  No. 4 of 2007      of imposing, maintaining, amending or suppressing  obligations set forth in the present Act    (2) The Authority shall determine the relevant  markets by-     (a) collecting information about each identified  market so as to measure the extent of  “significant market power;     (b) consulting the concerned information and   communications market players regarding  market relevance for the purpose of  analyzing those markets;     (c) seeking the advice of the Competition Com-  mission established under the Competition  Act 2007;     (d) defining the criteria to measure the   significant market power; and     (e) consulting with the concerned information  and communications market players about  obligations to be imposed on operators  having significant market power.     (3) When conducting a market analysis, deciding  whether an operator has significant market power  and imposing obligations on it, the Authority shall-     (a) take account of the relevant provisions of   international treaties and agreements; and     (b) ensure, within the scope of its competence,   compliance with and implementation of  those treaties and agreements in The  Gambia.     (4) Where the Authority determines that a relevant  market is not effectively competitive, it shall identify  undertakings having significant market power in  that market and impose appropriate and specific  regulatory obligations, or maintain or amend the  obligations where they already exist.          70      (5) If the analysis shows the market to be compe- titive, the Authority shall abolish any existing  obligations.     Determination of  significant  market power      49. (1) For the purposes of this Act, an operator is  deemed to have significant market power if, either  individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a  position equivalent to dominance, that is, a position  of economic strength affording it the power to  behave to an appreciable extent independently of  competitors, customers and consumers.    (2) The Authority may consider that two or more  operators have joint significant market power if,  even in the absence of structural or other links  between them, they operate in a market whose  structure is considered to be conducive to  coordinated effects.    (3) The Authority shall, in its assessment, use  criteria based on specific market characteristics, in  particular in terms of market concentration and  transparency, giving weight, to the following  factors-     (a) fully developed market;    (b) stagnant or moderate growth on the   demand side;     (c) low elasticity of demand;     (d) homogeneous products;     (e) similar cost structures;     (f) similar market shares;     (g) lack of technical innovation or fully  developed technology;     (h) absence of excess capacity;     (i) high barriers to entry;     (j) lack of countervailing buying power;        71        (k) lack of potential competition;     (l) various kinds of informal or other links   between the undertakings concerned;     (m) retaliatory mechanisms; and     (n) lack or reduced scope for price competition.    (4) Where an operator has significant market  power in a specific market, it may also be deemed  to have significant market power in an adjacent  market, where the links between the two markets  are such as to allow the market power held in one  market to be leveraged into the other market,  thereby strengthening the market power of the  undertaking.     Imposition of  obligations on  undertakings  having signi- ficant market  power      50. (1) The Authority has the right to impose  obligations on operators having significant market  power on the relevant market, taking account of  their appropriateness in each specific case and  setting the starting moment in time for the  fulfillment of those obligations.    (2) The obligations imposed on operators by the  Authority must be reasonable, based on the nature  of the problem identified, proportionate and  justified in the light of the principles and objectives  of the regulation of information and  communications activities.    (3) Where it is established on the basis of a rele- vant market analysis that the market charac- teristics do not justify the imposition of obligations  referred to in this section or that there are no  operators having significant market power in the  market, the Authority shall-     (a) not impose, in accordance with the proce-  dure and conditions set out in this Act, the  obligations referred to in this Act; and      (b) withdraw the obligations, if any, imposed on   the operators having significant market        72      power.    (4) When withdrawing obligations, the Authority  may, by a reasoned decision, set the final date for  their implementation.    (5) After having conducted a repeated market  analysis, the Authority may amend the imposed  obligations by applying the necessary changes  according to the provisions of this section  concerning the imposition of obligations.     Cost accounting  obligation      51. (1) The Authority shall require operators having  significant market power to establish cost account- ting for the purposes of regulation.    (2) Cost accounting must show separate accounts,  in accordance with international best practices.    (3) Costs relating to regulated and non-regulated  activities are kept separate.    (4) Cost accounting must be by activity-based  costing.    (5) The cost accounting system must be audited  annually by an independent body appointed by the  Authority, the costs of the audit to be borne by the  operator having significant market power which  allow the Authority to publish a cost nomenclature  prior to submission of the reference inter- connection offer for approval.    (6) Pending the implementation of cost accounting,  the interconnection rates shall be calculated on the  basis of the following recommendations-     (a) using a regional benchmark;     (b) using an existing cost calculation tool;     (c) using, for an initial period of three years, a  top-down model based on forward-looking  historical costs, before moving to a  model based on a long-run incremental  costs, which gives the operator with a        73      an incentive for greater efficiency;     (d) using marketing data for setting the  appropriate rate of return based on the  cost of capital;     (e) using the hybrid capital asset pricing model   incorporating the country risk and  correction coefficient for calculating the  cost of equity,     Local loop  unbundling      52. The Authority shall ensure that-     (a) new entrants are authorized to access the  local loop on the basis of a pre- established schedule;     (b) new entrants commit, in their respective   proposals, to install some minimum infra- structure capacity, whereas operators  having significant market power commit to  provide access to copper pairs to the new  entrant as well as the possibility of co- location on its premises in order to facilitate  unbundling;     (c) the unbundling offer, including the list of   services offered at the request of the  Authority, shall be approved by the  Authority;     (d) the new entrant has access to the inform-  ation needed for unbundling purposes  and the information related to unbundling  is exchanged electronically between ope-  rators and competitors;     (e) a schedule for unbundling established with   a view to liberalization of fixed communica- tions, privileging unbundling with shared  line access initially; and     (f) guidelines are provided on use of the   “scissors test” in order to compare retail  prices and unbundling.           74      Carrier selection        53. (1) The Authority shall ensure that carrier  selection is introduced in the call-by-call form, as a  minimum, in order to establish effective  competition and allow consumers to choose their  local-loop operator freely and have access to the  services of an alternative operator.    (2) The selection possibility shall be offered by all  operators having significant market power who  must be invited to undertake the technical changes  that are necessary to adapt their automatic  exchanges so as to be able to offer, in the initial  phase, call-by-call selection service which shall be  included in the reference interconnect offer.    (3) The Authority shall assign prefixes to operators  who fall within the category of carriers and take  decisions on-     (a) type of carrier selection;     (b) operators eligible to act as carriers;     (c) operators subject to the obligation to offer  carrier selection;     (d) types of calls carried;     (e) problems involved in carrier selection such   as invoicing and calling line identification;  and        (f) unfair competition issues, such as,  \"slamming\".

(1) The Authority shall encourage infrastructure  sharing and ensure that sharing between the ope- rators of public communication networks takes  place under conditions of fairness, non- discrimination and equality of access.    (2) The Authority, in consultation with other stake- holders, shall elaborate a procedure for handling  relations between the operators of public networks  in the matter of the conditions and the sharing of        75      infrastructure, in particular lead-times and access  to the information needed to put it into place.    (3) The Authority shall encourage infrastructure  sharing between the operator concerning, in  particular, posts, ducts and elevated points to be  made available mutually on a commercial basis,  where there is limited access to posts, ducts and  elevated points resources through natural or  structural obstacles.    (4) The Authority shall-     (a) encourage access to alternative infrastruc-   ture on the basis of commercial  negotiations, in order to foster and entrench  competition as rapidly as possible; and      (b) ensure that the access is provided under   conditions of fairness, non-discrimination  and equality of access.     Number  portability      55. (1) The Authority shall conduct market studies  to assess consumers' portability needs and identify  what categories of consumers are likely to request  a portability service.    (2) Where a need has been clearly identified, the  regulations shall be made to allow consumers to  keep their telephone numbers when they change  operators.    (3) The Authority shall-     (a) ensure that dialogue takes place between   the market players and the Authority, and  that the numbering plan is also revised so  as to adapt it to the requirements of number  portability;      (b) establish tariff and technical conditions; and     (c) provide information on national roaming   contracts, in consultation with the market  players.           76      International  roaming      56.

(3) A point of interconnection shall be established  as soon as practicable following a request, but, in  any case, not later than the period specified in the  agreement from the date of the request.    (4) A network controller is responsible for the cost  of-     (a) building and maintaining its ports, data fill  and switching capacity to support the inter- connection; and     (b) transport of all material from its origination   to points of interconnection.    (5) Where parties providing interconnect services  to each other are information and communications  system providers, they may mutually agree on the  point of interconnection and share the costs of        86      establishing the point of interconnection.     Requests for  new forms of  interconnect-ion      70. (1) A request by an interconnecting operator  for a new form of interconnection shall be in writing  and provide the network controller with information  about the form of interconnection, the approximate  date the interconnection is required and an  estimate of the capacity required.    (2) The interconnecting operator shall forward a  copy of the request for interconnection to the  Authority.    (3) The network controller shall, within fifteen days  of receipt of the request for interconnection, inform  the interconnecting operator in writing-     (a) of its ability to supply the form of inter- connection requested and its schedule of  supply; and     (b) whether it is able to do so within the time   frame requested by the interconnection  operator.     (4) If a dispute in negotiations arises, either the  network controller or the interconnection operator  may request the Authority’s assistance in resolving  the dispute through mediation.      (5) The Authority shall resolve disputes brought to  it within one hundred and twenty days of its receipt  of the referral or of receipt of information requested  from the parties following the referral.    (6) The network controller shall, where it has  informed the interconnecting operator that it is able  to provide interconnection, ensure that the system  conditioning and provisioning procedures required  to provide the interconnection are undertaken  within forty-five days from the date of notification.    (7) A network controller shall provide ninety days  written notice to an interconnecting operator of any  planned changes to its information and commu-       87      nications system that may have material impact on  the interconnecting operator.     Confidentiality of  information      71. (1) A party who receives information in relation  to interconnection from another party that is  designated by the party as confidential shall keep  the information confidential and may disclose it  only to-     (a) employees, agents, or advisers, who need  to have that information for the purpose of  the provision of or advising on  interconnection;     (b) persons to whom the disclosure is   authorized by that other party, where the  disclosure is authorized or required by law;  and     (c) the Authority.     (2) A confidential information related to-     (a) interconnection of a party received by  another party; or     (b) business information generated by the   information and communications system of  a party as a result of interconnection,       shall be used solely for the purpose of providing  interconnection, and shall not be disclosed to any  person involved in the development or provision of  retail services of the other party or its subsidiaries  or affiliates.    (3) The confidentiality provision of an inter- connection agreement shall not prevent or frustrate  the public disclosure by the Authority of a provision  of the agreement in the public interest.     Review of  interconnection  agreements      72. (1) The Authority may review all inter- connection agreements entered into or proposed to  be entered into between authorized providers.           88      (2) The Authority may require information from  either the interconnecting operator or from the  network controller, or from both of them.    (3) The Authority shall, in reviewing interconnection  agreements, ensure that-     (a) the agreements comply with the applicable  regulatory and legal texts, in particular  those provisions relating to interconnection  and the terms of reference of operators;  and     (b) the provisions of the agreement and con-  tain no discriminatory measures liable to  ad-vantage or disadvantage one of the  parties vis-à-vis other operators or service  providers.     (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection  (2), the Authority shall in particular take into  account-     (a) the need to ensure satisfactory end-to-end  information and communications services  for users;     (b) the objective of stimulating a competitive   market;       (c) the need to promote co-operation with  counterparts in other countries;     (d) the principles of non-discrimination, includ-  ing equal access and proportionality;     (e) the need to maintain and develop universal  access;     (f) the need to ensure fair and incremental   cost oriented access charges; and   (g) the dominance of the operator requesting   interconnection from whom interconnection  is requested.           89      Modification of  interconnection  agreements      73. (1) When indispensable in order to guarantee  fair competition, non-discrimination between  operators and the interoperability of networks and  services, the Authority may request the parties to  modify the interconnection agreement.    (2) In the case of a request for modification, the  Authority shall send the parties concerned its  requests for modification, duly substantiated.    (3) The parties concerned have a period of one  month, as from the date of the request for modifi- cation, to amend the interconnection agreement.    (4) The Authority may, on its own or at the request  of one of the parties, set a deadline for signature of  the agreement, after which they must intervene to  bring the negotiations to a conclusion so that  negotiations do not become a barrier to the entry of  new operators.    (5) Operators who so request under subsection (4)  shall be allowed to consult, in the offices of the  Authority, in the manner that the Authority shall  decide and respecting normal business confi- dentiality, the interconnection agreements  concluded by operators.    (6) Where the Authority considers it urgent to take  action to safeguard competition and protect users'  interests, it may request that interconnection  between the two networks be provided  immediately, pending conclusion of the agreement.    (7) Where the Authority has not formulated a  request for modification within three months as  from receipt of the interconnection agreement,  requests for modification shall cover only those  amendments aimed at guaranteeing that each  party receives no worse treatment in terms of non- discrimination as compared to those offered in  more recent agreements signed by the other party.     Reference  interconnection  offer      74. (1) The Authority shall publish a clear and  trans-parent procedure governing approval of the  reference interconnection offer of operators having        90      significant market power.    (2) The Authority is entitled to request the operator  having significant market power to add or modify  the services set out in their offers, when those  additions or modifications are justified for com- pliance with the principles of non-discrimination  and cost-orientation of interconnection.      (3) The offers must be as detailed as possible in  order to facilitate and smooth interconnection con- tract negotiations.    (4) The operator having significant market power is  required to publish annually a reference inter- connection offer, reflecting its price list and the  technical services offered which shall contain at  least the following services-     (a) services for the routing of switched traffic   (call termination and origination);     (b) leased lines;     (c) interconnection links;     (d) supplementary services and implementation   arrangements for them;     (e) description of all points of interconnection   and conditions of access to them, for the   purposes of physical co-location;     (f) comprehensive description of proposed   interconnection interfaces, including the  signaling protocol and possibly the  encryption methods used for the interfaces;  and      (g) technical and tariff conditions governing the   selection of carrier and portability.    (5) The Authority may impose transparency obliga- tions in line with international best practices.          91      (6) The Authority shall also ensure that any  reference interconnect offer on the part of ope- rators includes a list of the subscriber-serving  exchanges that are not available for inter- connection for valid technical or security reasons,  along with the provisional timing to open such  subscriber exchanges to interconnection.    (7) Where the forwarding of expected operator  traffic to or from subscribers connected to  exchanges on the list mentioned in subsection (6)  is justified, the Authority shall ensure that the  operator is required, at the request of the Authority,  to establish a transitional offer for that exchange.    (8) Transitional offer under subsection (7) shall  allow the requesting operator to define a fee  schedule that reflects the costs which, in the  absence of technical access restrictions, would  have been incurred for switching communications  to or from, first, the subscribers connected to that  exchange, and second, the subscribers who would  have been accessible without the need for routing  through a higher-echelon exchange.     Publication of a  reference  interconnect  offer      75. The reference interconnect offers approved by  the Authority shall be made available on the web- sites of operators having significant market power  and shall be accessible by a web link available on  the Authority's website.       Relevant cost  orientation      76. (1) Operators having significant market power  shall respect the principle of relevant cost  orientation, that is, the costs of network com- ponents or the management structures of the  operator effectively involved in the provision of  interconnection.    (2) The relevant costs shall include-     (a) general network costs, that is, costs relating   to network components used by the  operator both for services for its own  customers and for interconnection services;  and        92         (b) costs specific to interconnection services,   that is, costs directly incurred solely by  those services.     (3) Relevant costs must take account of long-term  economic efficiency, in particular, the investments  required for network renewal and expansion with a  view to sustain quality of service and incorporate  the cost of return on capital invested.    (4) Non-relevant costs include costs specific to  services other than interconnection.     Monitoring of  interconnection  tariffs      77. (1) Operators having significant market power  shall attach to the draft reference interconnection  offer submitted to the Authority a detailed  presentation justifying the main tariffs proposed  and once the harmonized method for calculating  interconnection costs has been adopted, the  operators shall use that method to provide the  requested justification.    (2) The Authority shall ensure that the methods  and data used are valid, and as required, it shall  request the operator having significant market  power to adjust its calculations to rectify errors  identified.    (3) If an operator having significant market power  fails to provide the justifications required, the  Authority may, in the operator’s stead evaluate the  costs based on the information available to it.    (4) The Authority shall ensure that tariff setting for  access and interconnection in so far as the  operators having significant market power are  concerned is cost-oriented and, as appropriate,  that the fees payable by consumers are not  dissuasive.     Communication  of information to  the Authority   78. (1) Operators having significant market power  shall communicate to the Authority, at least once a  year, the basic information required for checking  the calculation of interconnection costs.          93      (2) The Authority shall prepare and communicate  to operators a detailed list of that information and  regularly update the list, taking account, inter alia,  of steps taken to harmonize the calculation  methods.    (3) Operators having significant market power are  required to allow the duly authorized staff or agents  of the Authority to have access to their installations  and information system in order to check the  validity of the information received.    (4) The Authority shall respect the confidentiality of  non-public information to which it has access within  the framework of auditing the interconnection costs  in order to eliminate any anti-competitive practices  by the operators having significant market power.     Co-location     79. (1) The Authority shall ensure that there is an  obligation for operators who have to provide co- location that a co-location offer presenting no  barrier to the entry of competitors, is included in  the reference interconnect offer for network inter- connection and in the unbundling offer for  unbundling.    (2) The Authority shall ensure that-     (a) where physical co-location is impossible   for some valid reason, such as lack of  space, an alternative co-location offer must  be made by the operators having significant  market power;      (b) it has a map of self-contained routing   switches that are open to interconnection  and are available for competitors’ co- location.     (3) For purpose of subsection (2), a working  group comprising the Authority, the incumbent  operator and alternative operators shall, in a fully  transparent manner, examine the problems of  co-location and propose different solutions in  order to solve problems that might arise.          94      (4) The Authority shall prevent the creation of any  entry barriers inherent to co-location and provide  solutions to conflicts relating to it as rapidly as  possible.    (5) The Authority shall establish the minimal set of  conditions that must be fulfilled in any co-location  offer, after consultation with the operators of public  telecommunication networks.    (6) The conditions established under subsection  (5) may lead to the specification, in every co- location offer, of the following-     (a) information on co-location sites;     (b) precise location of the operator’s sites   suitable for co-location;     (c) publication or notification of an updated list   of sites;     (d) indications as to the availability of alternative   solutions in the event that physical space for   co-location is not available;     (e) information on what types of co-location are   available, and on the availability of elec-   tric systems and cooling equipment on the   sites, as well as the rules governing sub-   lease of the co-location premises;     (f) indications on the time required to   conduct feasibility studies for any co- location request;      (g) information on equipment characteristics   and any restrictions on equipment that can  be accepted for co-location;     (g) measures that operators offering co-   location must take to ensure the security of   their premises and to identify and resolve   problems;     (h) conditions under which competing ope-        95       rator personnel may enter the premises;  and     (i) conditions under which competing opera-   tors and the Authority may inspect a site   where physical co-location is impossible,   or a site where co-location has been   refused on the grounds of lack of capacity.        Interconnec  tion disputes      80. (1) Disputes relating to refusal to interconnect,  interconnection agreements and conditions of  access shall be submitted to the Authority in the  form of a petition from the petitioner requesting the  Authority to resolve the dispute.    (2) The petition shall contain-     (a) a detailed statement of the matters and   facts at issue;    (b) a statement of attempts made to resolve   the dispute;    (c) a copy of the interconnection agreement,   if any; and    (d) any other information as the petitioner   deems relevant or the Authority may  require.     (3) The party against whom the petition is filed  shall be given the opportunity to respond to the  petition.    (4) The Authority shall in considering a petition  take such steps as are necessary to enable it to  decide the dispute, and may establish, by way of  written notice to the parties, all dates and  deadlines not established.    (5) The Authority shall decide on a petition under  this section within a period of two months of its  submission, which period may be extended to four  months when additional investigations and expert  opinions are required.        96        (6) The decision of the Authority shall be  substantiated, and shall specify the equitable  conditions, both technical and financial, under  which the interconnection is to be effected and  matters remaining in dispute shall be brought  before the competent jurisdictions.    (7) In the case of serious and blatant breach of the  rules governing the information and communication  sector, the Authority may, after inviting the parties  to submit their remarks, order appropriate  provisional measures to be taken to ensure the  continued functioning of networks and services.      PART VI – REGULATIONS OF TARIFFS AND  QUALITY OF SERVICE     Tariff regulation     81. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the  Regulatory Authority Act or any other law, tariffs in  the information and communications sector which-     (a) are, in the opinion of the Authority, subject  to effective competition, shall be established  by the operation of the market;     (b) in the opinion of the Authority, lack effective   competition, shall be subject to such pro- portionate controls and non-discriminatory  controls set out in the guidelines provided  by the Authority, taking into account the  mechanisms specified in section 82.     (2) Where guidelines have been provided pursuant  to this section, any rate mechanism in force at the  time of the publication of the guidelines shall cease  to have effect, without prejudice to its validity in  respect of any preceding period, with regard to the  market or markets segments to which the  guidelines refer.     Price caps     82. (1) Unless and until guidelines are provided  pursuant to section 81, the general structure of the  tariff regulation mechanism shall be price cap, in  accordance with the following provision-     (a) all authorized providers under this Act who        97      provide Information and communications  services and systems to the public shall  file with the Authority schedules of their  tariffs, including those of their agents and  correspondents;     (b) all authorization providers whose tariffs are   subject to regulation by the Authority shall  be subject to a price cap mechanism and  shall file with the Authority all the  necessary documents as required in their  licences;     (c) all proposed tariffs or changes to the   existing tariffs, including the terms and  conditions applicable to them, but  excluding special offers and other  promotions, shall be filed with the Authority  within thirty days before being  implemented by an authorized provider;     (d) if the Authority takes no action before the   expiration of thirty days from the date on  which the proposed tariffs are filed, the  authorized provider may implement the  proposed tariffs, provided that a proposed  tariff shall not be implemented where a  complaint, as to the appropriateness of the  proposed tariff, has been filed with the  Authority and has not been determined;     (e) authorized providers subject to tariff   regulation by the Authority shall ensure  that all filed tariffs are printed and kept  open for public review and inspection  and furnish them to customers on request;     (f) authorized providers whose tariffs are   subject to regulation by the Authority  pursuant to the price cap mechanism  who wish to change the tariff, shall file  with the Authority an application that they  intend to adjust the tariff.     (2) In this section, “price cap” means a  methodology where the price charged for an        98      information and communications service or system  is allowed to change by the rate of inflation over  the initial price with an adjustment factor (X), based  on factors, such as-     (a) technological changes;     (b) the need to finance development  infrastructure; and     (c) need to adopt efficient working systems,     provided that the overall rate of the basket of  services in which the rate is included, does not  exceed a limit set by the operation of a price cap  formula.     Quality of  service      83. In the context of the responsibilities of the  Authority under this Act, the Authority shall  undertake the following as it finds appropriate-     (a) measure some or all quality of service  indicators;     (b) audit the quality of service reports   submitted by licensees;     (c) apply the appropriate sanctions when  failure to meet targets or to provide  adequate information occurs; and     (d) publish quality of service indicators as it   deems appropriate.

(2) Information incorporated into an agreement and  that is not in the public domain is regarded as  having been incorporated into a data message if  the information is-     (a) referred to in a way in which a reasonable  person would have noticed the reference to  it and incorporation of it; and     (b) accessible in a form in which it may be   read, stored and retrieved by the other  party, whether electronically or as a  computer printout as long as the  information is reasonably capable of being  reduced to electronic form by the party  incorporating it.     Incorporation by  reference      178. Information shall not be denied legal effect,  validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that  it is not contained in the data message purporting  to give rise to the legal effect, but is merely  referred to  in that data message.     Requirement for  writing      179. Where an enactment requires any information  or record to be in writing, that requirement shall be  satisfied by an electronic record where the  information contained in it is accessible so as to be  usable for subsequent reference.     Other  requirements      180. (1) A requirement in a law for multiple copies  of a document to be submitted to a single  addressee at the same time is satisfied by the  submission of a single data message that is  capable of being reproduced by that addressee.    (2) An expression in a law, whether used as a  noun or verb, including the terms \"document\",  \"record\", \"file\", \"submit\", \"lodge\", \"deliver\", \"issue\",  \"publish\", \"write in\", \"print\" or words or expressions  of similar effect, shall be interpreted so as to  include or permit the form, format or action in  relation to a data message unless otherwise        175      provided for in this Act.    (3) Where a seal is required by law to be affixed to  a document and the law does not prescribe the  method or form by which the document may be  sealed by electronic means, that requirement is  met if the document indicates that it is required to  be under seal and it includes the advanced  electronic signature of the person by whom it is  required to be sealed.    (4) Where a law requires or permits a person to  send a document or information by registered or  certified post or similar service, that requirement is  met if an electronic copy of the document or  information is sent to a service provider authorized  by the Authority, is registered by the service  provider and sent by that service provider to the  electronic address provided by the sender.     Retention of  information      181. (1) Where a rule of law requires that  certain documents, records or information be  retained, that requirement is satisfied by retaining  them in the form of electronic records, if the  following conditions are satisfied-     (a) the information contained in them remains  accessible so as to be usable for sub- sequent reference;     (b) the electronic record is retained in the   format in which it was originally generated,  sent or received, or in a format which can  be demonstrated to represent accurately  the information originally generated, sent or  received;     (c) such information, if any, as enables the   identification of the origin and destination of  an electronic record and the date and time  when it was sent or received, is retained;  and     (d) the consent of the department of the   Government, organ of State or the statutory  body, which has supervision over the        176      requirement for the retention of such  records, has been obtained.     (2) An obligation to retain documents, records or  information in accordance with subsection (1)(c)  does not extend to any information necessarily and  automatically generated solely for the purpose of  enabling a record to be sent or received.    (3) A person may satisfy the requirement referred  to in subsection (1) by using the services of any  other person, if the conditions in subsection (1)(a)  to (d) are complied with.    (4) Nothing in this section-     (a) applies to any rule of law which expressly  provides for the retention of documents,  records or information in the form of  electronic records;      (b) precludes any department of the Govern-  ment, organ of State or a statutory corpo- ration from specifying additional require- ments for the retention of electronic records  that are subject to the jurisdiction of the  Ministry or other organ of State or statutory  body.        Retention of  information in  original form        182. (1) Where the law requires information to be  presented or retained in its original form, that  requirement is met by electronic record if-     (a) there exists a reliable assurance as to the  integrity of the information from the time  when it was first generated in its final form,  as an electronic message or otherwise; and     (b) where it is required that information be   presented, that information is capable of  being displayed to the person to whom it is  to be presented.     (2) Subsection (1) applies whether the require- ment in that subsection is in the form of an        177      obligation or whether the law simply provides  consequences for the information not being  presented or retained in its original form.    (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)-     (a) the criteria for assessing integrity are   whether the information has remained  complete and unaltered, except for-     (i) the addition of any endorsement; or     (ii) any change which arises in the normal   course of communication, storage and  display; and      (b) the standard of reliability required shall be   assessed in the light of the purpose for  which the information was generated and in  the light of all the relevant circumstances.     Production of  document or  information   183. (1) Where a law requires a person to produce  a document or information, that requirement is met  if the person produces, by means of a data  message, an electronic form of that document or  information, and if-     (a) considering all the relevant circumstances   at the time that the data message was sent,  the method of generating the electronic  form of that document provided a reliable  means of assuring the maintenance of the  integrity of the information contained in that  document; and      (b) at the time the data message was sent, it   was reasonable to expect that the  information contained in it would be readily  accessible so as to be usable for  subsequent reference.     (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the  integrity of the information contained in a document  is maintained if the information has remained  complete and unaltered, except for-          178       (a) the addition of any endorsement; or     (b) any immaterial change, which arises in the   normal course of communication, storage  or display.     Expression of  intent or other  statement      184. As between the originator and the addressee  of a data message, an expression of intent or other  statement is not without legal force and effect  merely on the grounds that it is-     (a) in the form of a data message; or    (b) not evidenced by an electronic signature but   by other means from which the person’s  intent or other statement can be inferred.     Attribution of  electronic record  and signature      185. (1) An electronic record or electronic  signature shall be attributable to a person where it  was the act of that person.    (2) The act of a person referred to in subsection (1)  may be shown in the manner set out in this  section, which includes the proper application of  any security procedure to determine the person to  whom the electronic record or electronic signature  is attri-butable.    (3) An electronic record is deemed to be that of  the originator where it was sent-     (a) by a person who had the authority to act on  behalf of the originator in respect of that  electronic record; or       (b) by an information processing system   programmed by or on behalf of the originator  to operate automatically.     (4) Subject to subsection (5), an addressee is  entitled to regard an electronic record as being that  of the originator and to act on that assumption  where-     (a) in order to ascertain whether the electronic        179      record was that of the originator, the  addressee properly applied a procedure  previously agreed to by the originator for  that purpose; or      (b) the data message as received by the   addressee resulted from the actions of a  person whose relationship with the  originator or with any agent of the originator  enabled that person to gain access to a  method used by the originator to identify an  electronic record as its own.     (5) Subsection (4) does not apply-     (a) from the time when the addressee has both   received notice from the originator that the  electronic record is not that of the  originator, and had reasonable time to act  accordingly;      (b) in a case referred to in subsection (4)(b), at   any time when the addressee knew or  ought to have known, had it exercised  reasonable care or used any agreed  procedure, that the electronic record was  not that of the originator; or      (c) where, in all the circumstances of the   case, there are reasonable grounds for the  addressee to regard the electronic record  as that of the originator or to act on that  assumption.     (6) Subject to subsection (7), where an electronic  record is that of the originator or is deemed to be  that of the originator, or where the addressee is  entitled to act on that assumption, the addressee is  entitled to regard the electronic record received as  being what the originator intended to send, and to  act on that assumption.    (7) The addressee is not entitled to regard the  electronic record received as being what the  originator intended to send where the addressee  knew or ought to have known, had the addressee        180      exercised reasonable care or used any agreed  procedure, that the transmission resulted in an  error in the electronic record as received.    (8) The addressee is entitled to regard each  electronic record received as a separate electronic  record and to act on that assumption, except to the  extent that the addressee duplicates another  electronic record and the addressee knew or ought  to have known, had the addressee exercised  reasonable care or used any agreed procedure,  that the electronic record was a duplicate.     Effect of change  or error      186. If a change or error occurs in the transmission  of an electronic record in a case where-     (a) the originator and the addressee have  agreed to use an information security  procedure in respect of the electronic record  and one of them has conformed to the  procedure, but the other has not, and the  non-conforming person would have detected  the change or error had he also conformed,  the conforming person may avoid the effect  of the change or erroneous electronic  record;     (b) an individual is either the originator or the   addressee of the electronic record, he or she  may avoid the effect of the electronic record  if the error was made by the individual in  dealing with the electronic agent of another  person and the electronic agent did not  provide an opportunity for the prevention or  correction of the error and, at the time the  individual learns of the error, the individual-     (i) promptly notifies the other person of   the error and that he or she did not  intend to be bound by the electronic  record received by the other person,     (ii) takes reasonable steps, including steps   that conform to the other person's  reasonable instructions, to return to  the other person or, if instructed by the        181      other person, to return the  consideration received, if any, as a  result of the erroneous electronic  record, and     (iii) has not used or received any benefit   or value from the consideration, if any,  received from the other person; and      (c) if paragraph (a) or (b) does not apply, the   change or error shall have the effect  provided for in any contract between the  originator and the addressee.     Acknowledge- ment of receipt  of electronic  message      187. (1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) apply where,  on or before sending an electronic record, or by  means of that electronic record, the originator has  requested, or agreed with, the addressee that  receipt of the electronic record be acknowledged  by the addressee.    (2) Where the originator has not agreed with the  addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a  particular form or by a particular method, an  acknowledgement may be given by-     (a) a communication by the addressee to the   originator, automated or otherwise; or       (b) the conduct of the addressee, that is   reasonably sufficient to indicate to the  originator, that the electronic record has  been received.     (3) Where the originator has stated that an  electronic record is conditional, on receipt by him  or her of an acknowledgement, the record is  presumed not to have been sent until an  acknowledgment has been received by him or her.    (4) Where the originator has not stated that the  electronic record is conditional on receipt of the  acknowledgement and the acknowledgement has  not been received by the originator within the time  specified or agreed or, if no time has been        182      specified or agreed, within a reasonable time, the  originator     (a) may give notice to the addressee-     (i) stating that no acknowledgement has   been received and that the electronic  record is to be treated as though it had  never been sent, or     (ii) specifying a reasonable time by   which the acknowledgement must be  received; and      (b) if the acknowledgement is not received   within the time specified in paragraph (a),  may, on  notice to the addressee-     (i) treat the electronic record as though it   had never been sent, and     (ii) exercise any other rights he or she may  have.     (5) Where the originator receives the addressee’s  acknowledgement of receipt it may be presumed  that the related electronic record has been  received by the addressee but that presumption  does not imply that the electronic record received  corresponds to the electronic record as sent.    (6) Where the addressee’s received acknow- ledgement states that the related electronic record  met the technical requirements that the originator  and the addressee have agreed should be met, it  is presumed that the requirements have been met.    (7) Except in so far as it relates to the sending or  receipt of an electronic record, this section does  not affect the legal or equitable consequences that  may flow either from that electronic record or from  the acknowledgement of its receipt.     Admissibility  and evidential  weight of data   188. (1) In any legal proceedings, the rules of  evidence shall not be applied so as to deny the        183      messages admissibility of a data message, in evidence-     (a) on the mere grounds that it is constituted   by a data message; or      (b) if it is the best evidence that the person  adducing it could reasonably be expected  to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its  original form.     (2) Information in the form of a data message shall  be given due evidential weight.    (3) In assessing the evidential weight of a data  message, regard shall be had to-     (a) the reliability of the manner in which the   data message was generated, stored or  communicated;      (b) the reliability of the manner in which the   integrity of the data message was  maintained;      (c) the manner in which its originator was   identified; and     (d) any other relevant factor.    (4) A data message made by a person in the  ordinary course of business, or a copy or print out  of or an extract from the data message certified to  be correct by an officer in the service of the  person, is on its mere production in any civil,  criminal, administrative or disciplinary proceedings  under any law, the rules of a self regulatory  organization or any other law or the common law,  admissible in evidence against any person and  rebuttable proof of the facts contained in the  record, copy, printout or extract.     Signature     189. (1) Where the law requires a signature of a  person, that requirement is met in relation to a data  message if-     (a) a method is used to identify that person and        184      to indicate that person’s approval of the  information contained in the data message;  and      (b) that method is as reliable as was appro-  priate for the purpose for which the data  message was generated or communicated,  in the light of all the circumstances,  including any relevant agreement.     (2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement  in that subsection is in the form of an obligation or  whether the law simply provides consequences for  the absence of a signature.    (3)An electronic signature is considered to be  reliable for the purpose of satisfying the  requirement referred to in subsection (1) if-     (a) the signature creation data are, within the   context in which they are used, linked to the  signatory and to no other person;      (b) the signature creation data were, at the time   of signing, under the control of the  signatory and of no other person;      (c) any alteration to the electronic signature,   made after the time of signing, is  detectable; and      (d) where a purpose of the legal requirement   for a signature is to provide assurance as to  the integrity of the information to which it  relates, any alteration made to that  information after the time of signing is  detectable.     (4) Subsection (3) does not limit the ability of a  person to-     (a) establish in any other way, for the purpose   of satisfying the requirement referred to in  subsection (1), the reliability of an  electronic signature; or           185       (b) adduce evidence of the non-reliability of an  electronic signature.     Recognition of  foreign  certificates and  electronic  signatures   190. (1) In determining whether, or to what extent,  a certificate or an electronic signature is legally  effective, no regard shall be had to-     (a) the geographic location where the  certificate is issued or the electronic  signature created or used; or     (b) the geographic location of the place of   business of the issuer or signatory.     (2) A certificate issued outside The Gambia has  the same legal effect in The Gambia as a  certificate issued in The Gambia if it offers a  substantially equivalent level of reliability.    (3) An electronic signature created or used outside  The Gambia has the same legal effect in The  Gambia as an electronic signature created or used  in The Gambia if it offers a substantially equivalent  level of reliability.    (4) In determining whether a certificate or an  electronic signature offers a substantially  equivalent level of reliability for the purposes of  subsection (2) or (3), regard shall be had to  recognized inter-national standards and to any  other relevant factors.    (5) Where, notwithstanding subsections (2), (3)  and (4), parties agree, as between themselves, to  the use of certain types of electronic signatures or  certificates, that agreement shall be recognized as  sufficient for the purposes of cross-border  recognition, unless that agreement would not be  valid or effective under applicable law.     Notarisation,  acknowledgeme nt and  certification   191. (1) Where a law requires a signature, state- ment or document to be notarized, acknowledged,  verified or made under oath, that requirement is  met if the advanced or secure electronic signature  of the person authorized to perform those acts is  attached to, incorporated in, or logically associated        186      with, the electronic signature or data message.    (2) Where a law requires or permits a person to  provide a certified copy of a document and the  document exists in electronic form, that  requirement is met if the person provides a print  out certified to be a true reproduction of the  document or information.    (3) Where a law requires or permits a person to  provide a certified copy of a document and the  document exists in paper or other physical form,  that requirement is met if an electronic copy of the  document is certified to be a true copy of the  document and the certification is confirmed by the  use of an advanced electronic signature.      Equal treatment  of signature  technologies      192. Nothing in this Act, except where there is  variation by agreement, shall be applied so as to  exclude, restrict, or deprive of legal effect, any  method of creating an electronic signature that  satisfies the requirements for compliance with the  requirement for a signature, or otherwise meets the  requirements of applicable law.     Conduct of a  person relying  on an electronic  signature   193. (1) Where signature creation data can be  used to create a signature that has legal effect,  each signatory shall-     (a) exercise reasonable care to avoid   unauthorized use of its signature creation  data;      (b) without undue delay, utilize means made   available by the certification service  provider pursuant to the provisions of this  Act, or otherwise use reasonable efforts,  to notify a person who may reasonably be  expected by the signatory to rely on or to  provide services in support of the  electronic signature if-     (i) the signatory knows that the signature   creation data have been com- promised, or           187      (ii) the circumstances known to the sig- natory give rise to a substantial risk  that the signature creation data may  have been compromised;      (c) where a certificate is used to support the   electronic signature, exercise reasonable  care to ensure the accuracy and  completeness of all material represent- ations made by the signatory that are  relevant to the certificate throughout its  life cycle or that are to be included in the  certificate.     (2) A signatory shall bear the legal consequences  of his or her failure to satisfy the requirements of  subsection (1).     Conduct of the  certifica-tion  service provider   194. (1) Where a certification service provider  provides services to support an electronic  signature that may be used for legal effect as a  signature, that certification service provider shall-     (a) act in accordance with representations   made by it with respect to its policies and  practices;      (b) exercise reasonable care to ensure the   accuracy and completeness of all material  representations made by it that are relevant  to the certificate throughout its life cycle or  that are included in the certificate;      (c) provide reasonably accessible means that   enable a relying party to ascertain from the  certificate-     (i) the identity of the certification service   provider,     (ii) that the signatory that is identified in  the certificate had control of the  signature creation data at the time  when the certificate was issued,     (iii) that signature creation data were valid        188      at or before the time when the certificate  was issued;      (d) provide reasonably accessible means that   enable a relying party to ascertain, where  relevant, from the certificate or otherwise-        (i) the method used to identify the sig- natory,     (ii) any limitation on the purpose or value   for which the signature creation data or  the certificate may be used,     (iii) that the signature creation data are   valid and have not been compromised,     (iv) any limitation on the scope or extent of  liability stipulated by the certification  service provider,     (v) whether means exist for the signatory   to give notice pursuant to this Act,     (vi) whether a timely revocation service is  offered;      (e) where services under paragraph (d)(v) are   offered, provide a means for a signatory to  give notice pursuant to article of this Act  and, where services under subsection  (d)(vi) are offered, ensure the availability of  a timely revocation service; and      (f) utilize trustworthy systems, procedures and   human resources in performing its services.     (2) A certification service provider shall bear the  legal consequences of its failure to satisfy the  requirements of subsection (1).     Trustworthiness     195. For the purposes of determining whether, or  to what extent, any systems, procedures and  human resources utilized by a certification service  provider are trustworthy, regard may be had to the        189      following factors-     (a) financial and human resources, including   existence of assets;     (b) quality of hardware and software systems;     (c) procedures for processing of certificates   and applications for certificates and  retention of records;      (d) availability of information to signatories   identified in certificates and to potential  relying parties;      (e) regularity and extent of audit by an inde-  pendent body; and     (f) the existence of a declaration by the State,   an accreditation body, or the certification  service provider, regarding compliance with  or existence of the factors set out in  paragraphs (a) to (e).

PART VI - ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS     Formation and 200. (1) In the context of contract formation, unless        191      validity of  contracts      otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and  acceptance of an offer may be expressed by  means of electronic messages.    (2) Where an electronic message is used in the  formation of a contract, the contract shall not be  denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground  that a electronic message was used for the  purpose.    (3) Nothing in this section applies to any law that  expressly provides a different method for the  formation of a valid contract.     Automated  transactions      201. (1) In an automated transaction-     (a) an agreement may be formed where an  electronic agent performs an action  required by law for agreement formation;     (b) an agreement may be formed where all   parties to a transaction or either one of  them uses an electronic agent;     (c) a party using an electronic agent to form an   agreement is, subject to paragraph (d),  presumed to be bound by the terms of that  agreement irrespective of whether that  person reviewed the actions of the  electronic agent or the terms of the  agreement;     (d) a party interacting with an electronic agent   to form an agreement is not bound by the  terms of the agreement unless those terms  were capable of being reviewed by a  natural person representing that party prior  to agreement formation; and     (e) no agreement is formed where a natural   person interacts directly with the electronic  agent of another person and has made a  material error during the creation of a data  message and-     (i) the electronic agent did not provide that        192      person with an opportunity to prevent or  correct the error,     (ii) that person notifies the other person of   the error as soon as practicable after  that person has learned of it,      (iii) that person takes reasonable steps,   including steps that conform to the other  person’s instructions to return any  performance received, or, if instructed to  do so, to destroy that performance, and     (iv) that person has not used or received   any material benefit or value from any  performance received from the other  person.     Variation by  agreement  between parties   202. As between parties involved in generating,  sending, receiving, storing, or otherwise  processing data messages, any provisions relating  to the formation and validity of agreements for  electronic transactions, the time and place of  communications, dispatch and receipt, the  expression of intent or other statement, the  attribution of data messages to the originator, or  the acknowledgement of receipt of data messages,  may be varied by agreement.     Time of dispatch     203 (1) Unless otherwise agreed to between the  originator and the addressee of a data message, if  a data message enters a single information system  outside the control of the originator, or the person  who sent the message on behalf of the originator,  the dispatch of the data message occurs when it  enters that information system.    (2) If a data message enters successively two or  more information systems outside the control of the  originator, then unless otherwise agreed between  the originator and the addressee of the data  message, the dispatch of the data message occurs  when it enters the first of those information  systems.     Time of receipt 204. (1) Unless otherwise agreed between the        193      originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of  a data message is determined as follows-     (a) if the addressee has designated an  information system for the purpose of  receiving data messages, receipt occurs, at  the time when the data message enters the  designated information system;     (b) if the data message is sent to an   information system of the addressee that is  not the designated information system,  receipt occurs at the time when the data  message is received by the addressee; or     (c) if the addressee has not designated an   information system, receipt occurs when  the data message enters an information  system of the addressee.     (2) Subsection (1) applies notwithstanding that the  place where the information system is located may  be different from the place where the data  message is deemed to be received under that  subsection.     Place of  dispatch and  receipt   205. (1) Unless otherwise agreed between the  originator and addressee, a data message is  deemed to be dispatched at the place where the  originator has it’s place of business, and is deemed  to be received at the place where the addressee  has it’s place of business.    (2) For purposes of application of subsection (1) to  a data message-     (a) if the originator or addressee has more  than one place of business, one of those  places has a closer relation to the  underlying transaction it is assumed that  the place of business is the originator’s or  addressee’s only place of business;     (b) if the originator or addressee has more than   one place of business, but paragraph (a)  does not apply, it is assumed that the        194      originator’s or addressee’s principal place  of business is the originator’s or  addressee’s only place of business; and     (c) if the originator or addressee does not have   a place of business, it is to be assumed the  originator’s or addressee’s place of  business is the place where the originator  or addressee ordinarily resides.     (3) This section shall not apply in such circum- stances as the Minister may by regulations  prescribe.     Information to  be provided      206.

For the purposes of this law 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an  identified or identifiable natural person, hereinafter the 'data subject'; an identifiable person is  one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification  number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic,  cultural or social identity.  § 2. 'Processing' shall mean any operation or set of operations that is performed upon  personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording,  organisation, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by  transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, as well as  blocking, erasure or destruction of personal data.  § 3. 'Filing system' shall mean any structured set of personal data that are accessible  according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional  or geographical basis.  § 4. 'Controller' shall mean the natural or legal person, the factual association or public  authority that alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the  processing of personal data.  If the purposes and means of processing are determined by or by virtue of a law, decree or  ordinance3, the controller shall be the natural person, legal person, factual association or  public authority that has been designated by or by virtue of that law, decree or ordinance as  the controller.  1 Belgian State Gazette, 3 February 1999, 3049. 2 Belgian State Gazette, 26 June 2003. 3 The terms law, decree and ordinance have a specific meaning in Belgian Constitutional Law, which excels in complexity. A  law applies in the entire Belgian territory, whereas a decree only applies in part of the territory (Flemish Region, Walloon  Region, Flemish Community, French-speaking Community, German-speaking Community; Communities have competences  relating to cultural and person-related matters (e.g. education), whereas Regions are competent for non-person-related matters  (e.g. economic matters,…)). Ordinances apply in the Region of Brussels-Capital and have a legal status that is slightly different  from that of Decrees. If the term Decree in the present translation is used not in connection with law and ordinance, it has the meaning of an  implementing measure (e.g. Royal Decree).  1    § 5. 'Processor' shall mean any natural person, legal person, factual association or public  authority that processes personal data on behalf of the controller, except for the persons who,  under the direct authority of the controller or the processor, are authorised to process the  data.  § 6. 'Third party' shall mean any natural person, legal person, factual association or public  authority other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under  the direct authority of the controller or the processor, are authorised to process the data.  § 7. 'Recipient' shall mean any natural person, legal person, factual association or public  authority to which data are disclosed, whether a third party or not; however, administrative or  judicial authorities to which data may be disclosed in the context of a particular inquiry shall  not be regarded as recipients;  § 8. 'Consent of the data subject' shall mean any freely given, specific and informed indication  of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to  him being processed.  Article 2  Any natural person shall be entitled to the protection of his fundamental rights and freedoms,  in particular the protection of his privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data  relating to him.  Article 3  § 1. This law shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic  means, as well as to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data that  form part of or are intended to form part of a filing system.  § 2. This law shall not apply to the processing of personal data carried out by a natural person  in the course of purely personal or household activities.  § 3. a) The Articles 6, 7 and 8 shall not apply to the processing of personal data carried out  solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, if the  processing relates to personal data that have been apparently made public by the data  subject or that are closely related to the public character of the data subject or of the fact in  which the data subject is involved.  b) Article 9 § 1 shall not apply to the processing of personal data carried out solely for  journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, if the application thereof  would interfere with the collection of data from the data subject.  Article 9 § 2 shall not apply to the processing of personal data carried out solely for  journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, if the application thereof  would have one or more of the following effects:  • the application would interfere with the collection of the data; • the application would interfere with an intended publication; • the application would give indications on the sources of information.  c) The Articles 10 and 12 shall not apply to the processing of personal data carried out solely  for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, as far as the  application thereof would interfere with an intended publication or give indications on the  sources of information.  2    d) The Articles 17 § 3, 9° and 12°, § 4 and § 8, as well as the Articles 18, 21 and 22 shall not  apply to the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the  purpose of artistic or literary expression.  § 4. The Articles 6 to 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 17bis, first section, 18, 20 and 31, §§ 1 to 3 shall not  apply to the processing of personal data by the State Security, the General Intelligence and  Security Service of the Armed Forces, the Security Authority, the security officers and the  Permanent Supervisory Committee for the intelligence services and its Inquiry Service, if the  processing is necessary for the fulfilment of their duties.  § 5. The Articles 9, 10 § 1 and 12 of this law shall not apply to:  1° the processing of personal data managed by public authorities in view of the fulfilment of  their duties of judicial police;  2° the processing of personal data managed by police services referred to in Article 3 of the  law of July 18, 1991 on the regulation of supervision of police and intelligence services in view  of the fulfilment of their duties of administrative police;  3° the processing of personal data managed by any other public authority that has been  designated in a Royal decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy in view of the fulfilment of their duties of  administrative police;  4° the processing of personal data that has become necessary as a result of the application of  the law of January 11, 1993 on the prevention of using the financial system for money  laundry;  5° the processing of personal data managed by the Permanent Supervisory Committee for  the police services and its Inquiry Service in view of the fulfilment of their legal duties.  § 6. The Articles 6, 8, 9, 10 § 1 and 12 shall not apply after royal authorisation in a decree  agreed upon in the Council of Ministers to the processing managed by the European Centre  for missing and sexually abused children, hereinafter 'the Centre', being a public utility  institution that has been established by deed of June 25, 1997 and recognised by Royal  decree of July 10, 1997 with regard to the collection, transmission to the judicial authority and  follow-up of data relating to persons who are under suspicion of a crime or misdemeanour in  a specific dossier of absence or sexual abuse. The said decree shall lay down the duration  and conditions of the authorisation after the advice of the Commission for the protection of  privacy.  The Centre may not keep any filing system relating to persons who are under suspicion of a  crime or misdemeanour or who have been convicted.  The Administrative Board of the Centre shall designate among the staff members of the  Centre an appointee in charge of the processing of data, who has knowledge of the  management and protection of personal data. The fulfilment of his duties shall not result in  any adverse effect for the appointee. In particular he shall not be dismissed or replaced as  appointee on grounds of the fulfilment of the duties that have been assigned to him. The King  shall lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after the advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy the duties of the appointee and the way in which  they shall be fulfilled as well as the way in which the Centre shall report to the Commission for  the protection of privacy on the processing of personal data under the terms of the given  authorisation.  The staff members and those who process personal data for the Centre shall be obliged to  secrecy.  3    Any violation of the obligation of secrecy shall be punished in accordance with the provisions  laid down in Article 458 of the Penal Code.  In the context of its supporting duties in respect to the tracing of persons who have been  reported as missing or kidnapped the Centre may register telephone calls only if the caller is  informed thereof and as far as he has not opposed thereto.  Article 3bis  This law shall apply to:  1° the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the effective and actual  activities of a permanent establishment of the controller on Belgian territory or on a place  where Belgian law applies by virtue of international public law;  2° the processing of personal data by a controller who has no permanent establishment on  the territory of the European Community, if for purposes of the processing use is made of  equipment, automated or otherwise, situated on Belgian territory, unless such equipment is  used only for purposes of transit over the Belgian territory.  In circumstances referred to in the previous section sub 2° the controller shall designate a  representative established on Belgian territory, without prejudice of legal actions that may be  brought against the controller himself.     Chapter II - General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data.  Article 4  § 1. Personal data shall be:  1° processed fairly and lawfully;  2° collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way  incompatible with those purposes, taking into account all relevant factors, in particular the  reasonable expectations of the data subject and the applicable legal and regulatory  provisions. Under the terms established by the King after the advice of the Commission for  the protection of privacy further processing of data for historical, statistical or scientific  purposes shall not be considered incompatible.  3° adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are  collected or further processed;  4° accurate and, if necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step shall be taken to ensure  that data that are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they are  collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;  5° kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for  the purposes for which the data are collected or for which they are further processed. After  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy the King shall lay down appropriate  safeguards for personal data that are stored for a period longer than stated above for  historical, statistical or scientific purposes.  §2. It shall be for the controller to ensure that § 1 is complied with.  Article 5  4    Personal data shall only be processed in one of the following cases:  a) if the data subject has unambiguously given his consent;  b) if processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is  party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a  contract;  c) if processing is necessary for compliance with an obligation to which the controller is  subject by or by virtue of a law, decree or ordinance;  d) if processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject;  e) if processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or  in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data  are disclosed;  f) if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the  controller or by the third party to whom the data are disclosed, provided that the interests or  fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who has a claim to protection under this  law, do not prevail.  The King may specify in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy in which circumstances the condition laid down sub  f) shall be considered not being complied with.  Article 6  § 1. The processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,  religious or philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership as well as the processing of data  concerning sex life, shall be prohibited.  § 2. The prohibition of processing data referred to in § 1 shall not apply in one of the following  cases:  a. if the data subject has given his written consent to the processing of those data, on  the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the data subject at any time;  the King may lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy, in which cases the prohibition  of processing data referred to in this Article may not be lifted by the explicit consent of  the data subject;  b. if processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the specific obligations and  rights of the controller in the field of employment law;  c. if processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another  person, provided that the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving his  consent;  d. if processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities by a foundation,  association or any other non-profit-seeking body with a political, philosophical,  religious, mutual-benefit or trade-union aim provided that the processing relates  solely to the members of the foundation, association or body or to persons who have  regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not  disclosed to a third party without the consent of the persons concerned;  e. if processing relates to data that are apparently made public by the data subject; f. if processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; g. if processing is necessary for scientific research and carried out under the terms   established by the King in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy;  h. if the processing is necessary for the realisation of an objective laid down by or by  virtue of the law in view of the application of social security;  5    i. if processing is carried out in pursuance of the law of July 4, 1962 on public statistics; j. if processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine or medical   diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment to the data subject or one of his  relatives, or the management of health-care services operating in the interest of the  data subject, and if those data are processed under the supervision of a health  professional;  k. if processing is carried out by associations with legal personality or public utility  institutions, of which the main objective is the protection of human rights and  fundamental freedoms, for purposes of the realisation of that objective, provided that  the processing has been authorised by the King after advice of the Commission for  the protection of privacy;  l. if processing of personal data referred to in § 1 is permitted by a law, decree or  ordinance for another important reason of public interest.  The health professional and his appointees or agents shall be obliged to secrecy with regard  to the case referred to sub j).  § 3. Without prejudice to the application of the Articles 7 and 8 of this law, the processing of  personal data relating to sexual life is permitted if the processing is carried out by an  association with legal personality or by a public utility institution of which the main objective is  the evaluation, support and treatment of persons of whom the sexual conduct may be  qualified as a criminal offence, and that has been recognised and subsidised for that purpose  by the competent authority; for such processing, of which the objective shall consist of the  evaluation, support and treatment of the persons referred to in this paragraph and that solely  concerns personal data relating to those persons, a specific, individualised authorisation has  to be given by the King in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy.  The decree referred to in this paragraph shall specify the duration of the authorisation, the  modalities for the supervision of the authorised association or body by the competent  authority, and the way in which the said authority has to report to the Commission for the  protection of privacy on the processing of personal data under the conditions of the given  authorisation.  § 4. The King shall lay down in an decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice  of the Commission for the protection of privacy, the specific conditions with which the  processing of personal data referred to in this Article, has to comply.  Article 7  § 1. The processing of health-related personal data shall be prohibited.  § 2. The prohibition of processing data referred to in § 1 shall not apply in the following cases:  a. if the data subject has given his written consent to the processing of those data, on  the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the data subject at any time;  the King may lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy, in which cases the prohibition  of processing health-related data may not be lifted by the explicit consent of the data  subject;  b. if processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the specific obligations and  rights of the controller in the field of employment law;  c. if the processing is necessary for the realisation of an objective laid down by or by  virtue of the law in view of the application of social security;  d. if processing is necessary for the promotion and protection of public health, including  examination of the population;  e. if processing is made obligatory by or by virtue of a law, decree or ordinance for  reasons of an important public interest;  6    f. if processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another  person, provided that the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving his  consent;  g. if processing is necessary for the prevention of a concrete danger or the suppression  of a specific criminal offence;  h. if processing relates to data that are apparently made public by the data subject; i. if processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; j. if processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine or medical   diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment to the data subject or to one of his  relatives, or the management of health-care services operating in the interest of the  data subject, and if those data are processed under the supervision of a health  professional;  k. if processing is necessary for scientific research and carried out under the conditions  established by the King in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy.  § 3. The King shall lay down in an decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice  of the Commission for the protection of privacy, the specific conditions with which the  processing of personal data referred to in this Article, has to comply.  § 4. Health-related personal data shall only be processed under the responsibility of a health  professional, except for the written consent of the data subject or if the processing is  necessary for the prevention of a concrete danger or for the suppression of a specific criminal  offence.  The King may lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy, which categories of persons are to be considered  health professionals in the meaning of this law.  The health professional and his appointees or agents shall be obliged to secrecy with regard  to the processing of personal data referred to in the first section.  § 5. Health-related personal data shall be collected from the data subject.  They may solely be collected from other sources if this is in compliance with the paragraphs 3  and 4 of this Article and necessary for the purposes of the processing or if the data subject is  incapable of procuring the data.  Article 8  § 1. The processing of personal data relating to litigations that have been submitted to courts  and tribunals4 as well as to administrative judicial bodies, relating to suspicions, persecutions  or convictions in matters of criminal offences, administrative sanctions or security measures,  shall be prohibited.  § 2. The prohibition of processing personal data referred to in § 1 shall not apply to  processing:  a. under supervision of a public authority or ministerial officer in the meaning of the  Code of Civil Procedure, if processing is necessary for the fulfilment of their duties;  b. by other persons, if processing is necessary for the realisation of objectives that have  been laid down by or by virtue of a law, decree or ordinance;  c. by natural persons or private or public legal persons, as far as necessary for the  management of their own litigations;  d. by attorneys at law or other legal advisers, as far as necessary for the protection of  the interests of their clients;  4 Court (Hof / Cour) is the technical legal term used to designate the five courts of appeal in Belgium, whereas tribunal  (rechtbank / tribunal) corresponds to a court of first instance.  7    e. that is necessary for scientific research and carried out under the conditions  established by the King in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy.  § 3. Persons authorised on the basis of § 2 to process personal data referred to in § 1 shall  be obliged to secrecy.  § 4. The King shall lay down in an decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice  of the Commission for the protection of privacy, the specific conditions, with which the  processing of the personal data referred to in § 1 Article has to comply.  Chapter III - Rights of the data subject.  Article 9  § 1. If personal data are obtained directly from the data subject, the controller or his  representative shall provide the data subject no later than the moment on which the data are  obtained, with at least the following information, unless he already has it:  a. name and address of the controller and, if such is the case, of his representative; b. the purposes of the processing; c. the existence of a right to object on request and free of charges against the intended   processing, if personal data are obtained for purposes of direct marketing; d. other additional information, in particular:  • the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, • whether or not replies to the questions are obligatory as well as possible   consequences of a failure to reply, • the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify the personal data   concerning him,  unless such additional information is not necessary to guarantee fair  processing towards the data subject, taking into account the specific  circumstances in which the data are obtained.  a. further information, dependent on the specific nature of the processing, that will be  specified by the King after advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy.  § 2. If personal data are not obtained from the data subject, the controller or his  representative shall at the time of undertaking the recording of personal data or, if a  communication to a third party is envisaged, no later than the moment on which the data are  first disclosed, provide the data subject with at least the following information, unless he  already has it:  a. name and address of the controller and, if such is the case, of his representative; b. the purposes of the processing; c. the existence of a right to object on request and free of charges against the intended   processing, if personal data are obtained for purposes of direct marketing; in that  case, the data subject has to be informed before the personal data are for the first  time disclosed to a third party or used for purposes of direct marketing on behalf of  third parties;  d. other additional information, in particular:  • the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, • whether or not replies to the questions are obligatory as well as possible   consequences of a failure to reply, • the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify these data,  8    unless such further information is not necessary to guarantee fair processing  towards the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances in  which the data are collected,.  a. further information, dependent on the specific nature of the processing, that will be  specified by the King after advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy.  The controller shall be exempt from the obligation to inform referred to in this paragraph:  a. if, in particular for statistical purposes or for the purposes of historical or scientific  research or for the purpose of public health screening with the intention of public  health protection and promotion, the provision of such notification appears to be  impossible or involves a disproportionate effort;  b. if the recording or communication of personal data is carried out in view of the  application of a provision laid down by or by virtue of a law, decree or ordinance.  The King shall lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of  the Commission for the protection of privacy, the conditions for the application of the previous  section.  [transitory provision]  Article 10  § 1. The data subject proving his identity, has the right to obtain from the controller:  a. confirmation as to whether or not data relating to him are being processed and  information at least as to the purposes of the processing, the categories of data  concerned, and the categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed;  b. communication in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing and of any  available information as to their source;  c. knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing of data concerning him  in the case of automated decisions referred to in Article 12bis;  d. knowledge of the possibility to lodge an appeal referred to in the Articles 12 and 14  and, possibly, to consult the public register referred to in Article 18.  For that purpose the data subject shall submit a signed and dated request to the controller or  to any other person indicated by the King.  The information shall be communicated immediately and no later than forty-five days after  receipt of the request.  The King may specify the modalities relating to the exercise of the right referred to in the first  section.  § 2. Any person shall have the right to get knowledge of the personal data that are processed  relating to his health, either directly or with the assistance of a health professional.  Upon request of the controller or of the data subject, communication may be done through  mediation of a health professional who has been chosen by the data subject.  If there is apparently no risk of offending against the privacy of the data subject and if the data  are not used for taking measures and decisions with regard to an individual data subject,  communication may be postponed if the health-related data are processed for purposes of  medical scientific research, yet only to the extent that communication would interfere seriously  with the research and no later than the moment on which the research is terminated.  9    In that case the data subject must have given in advance his explicit consent to the controller  that the personal data relating to him may be processed for purposes of medical scientific  research and that communication of the personal data relating to him may be postponed for  that reason.  § 3. No effect shall be given to a request referred to in § 1 and § 2 but after expiration of a  reasonable period of time, counting from the date of a prior request of the same person that  has been answered or from the date on which the data have been disclosed to him on own  initiative.  Article 11  [cancelled]  Article 12  Any person shall have the right to obtain free of charge rectification of inaccurate personal  data relating to him.  In addition any person shall have the right to object against the processing of data relating to  him for serious and legitimate reasons that have regard to his particular situation, unless the  lawfulness of the processing is based on grounds referred to in Article 5 b) and c).  If personal data are obtained for purposes of direct marketing the data subject may object free  of charge and without any grounds against the intended processing of personal data relating  to him.  In case of legitimate objection the processing carried out by the controller may no longer  relate to these personal data.  Any person shall also have the right to obtain free of charge the erasure of all personal data  relating to him or the prohibition of using such data that are incomplete or irrelevant in view of  the purpose of the processing, or of which the recording, communication or storage are  prohibited, or that have been stored longer than the authorised period of time.  § 2. In order to exercise the right referred to in § 1 the data subject shall submit a signed and  dated request to the controller or to any other person as the King may indicate.  § 3. Within a period of one month counting from the time of submission of the request in  accordance with § 2, the controller shall disclose the corrections or erasures of data in  accordance with § 1 to the data subject himself as well as to the persons to whom the  inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant data have been disclosed, as far as he still has  knowledge of the addressees of the communication and the notification to these addressees  does not appear to be impossible or does not involve a disproportionate effort.  If the data subject objects against the processing or the intended processing of personal data  relating to him in application of § 1, first and second section, the controller shall communicate  within the same period of time to the data subject which effect he has given to the request.  § 4. [cancelled]  Article 12bis  A decision resulting into legal effects for a person or affecting him seriously, may not be taken  purely on the basis of automatic data processing that is destined for the evaluation of certain  aspects of his personality.  10    The prohibition laid down in the first section is not applicable if the decision is taken in the  context of an agreement or if it has its ground in a provision laid down by or by virtue of a law,  decree or ordinance. In such agreement or provision appropriate measures shall be taken for  the protection of the legitimate interests of the data subject. At least he shall be allowed to  bring up his standpoint in a useful way.  Article 13  Any person proving his identity shall have the right to apply to the Commission for the  protection of privacy in order to exercise the rights referred to in the Articles 10 and 12 with  regard to the processing of personal data referred to in Article 3, paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.  The King shall lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after advice of  the Commission for the protection of privacy, the way in which these rights are exercised.  The Commission for the protection of privacy shall communicate to the data subject only that  the necessary verifications have been carried out.  Nevertheless the King shall lay down in a decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers after  advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy, which information the Commission  may communicate to the data subject if the request of the data subject relates to the  processing of personal data by police services in view of identity verification.  Article 14  § 1. The President of the tribunal of first instance5, sitting as in summary proceedings, shall  take cognisance of claims relating to the right of access to personal data granted by or by  virtue of the law, as well as of claims for the correction, erasure or prohibition of the use of  inaccurate personal data or personal data that are incomplete or irrelevant for the purposes of  the processing, or of which the recording, communication or storage is prohibited, or against  the processing of which the data subject has objected, or that have been stored longer than  the authorised period of time.  § 2. The President of the tribunal in the district of the place of residence of the plaintiff shall  have jurisdiction over the claims referred to in § 1. If the plaintiff has no place of residence in  Belgium, the President of the tribunal in the district of the place of residence of the controller  shall have jurisdiction, if the latter is a natural person. If the controller is a legal person, the  President of the tribunal in the district of the registered or administrative office shall have  jurisdiction.  The order shall be delivered in open court. It shall be immediately enforceable  notwithstanding any appeal or opposition.  § 3. The claim shall be submitted in the form of an application for a court hearing.  The petition shall contain the following elements and shall be declared null and void in the  event of failure to do so:  1° date, month and year;  2° surname, first name, occupation and place of residence of the plaintiff  3° surname, first name and place of residence of the person to be summoned;  4° object of the claim and brief summary of the arguments;  5 See footnote 4.  11    5° signature of the plaintiff or his attorney at law.  § 4. The petition shall be sent by recorded delivery letter to the registrar of the court or be  deposited in person in the registrar's office.  Following payment of the fee to enter the case on the case listing, if applicable, the parties  shall be summoned by letter of the registrar to appear in a session fixed by the judge. A copy  of the petition shall be attached to the summons.  § 5. The claim made in accordance with § 1 is only admissible if the request referred to in  Article 10 § 1 or referred to in Article 12 § 2 has been rejected or if no effect has been given to  it within a period of time as prescribed in Article 10 §1 second section or Article 12 § 3 first  section, according to the case.  § 6. If inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant data or data of which the storage is prohibited, are  disclosed to third parties or if communication of data has taken place after expiration of the  period of time during which the storage of these data was permitted, the President of the  tribunal may order that the controller shall notify the third parties concerned about the  correction or erasure of these data.  § 7. If urgent reasons raise the fear that evidence that may be presented under a claim  referred to in § 1 might be concealed or disappear, the President of the tribunal of first  instance shall direct all measures to prevent such concealment or disappearance, upon  unilateral request signed and submitted by the party or his attorney at law.  § 8. The provisions of §§ 6 and 7 do not limit the general competence of the President of the  tribunal of first instance, sitting in summary proceedings.

These measures shall ensure an appropriate level of security taking into account the state of  the art in this field and the cost of implementing the measures on the one hand, and the  nature of the data to be protected and the potential risks on the other hand.  On the advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy the King may promulgate  appropriate standards in the matter of informatics security for all or certain categories of  processing.  Chapter V - Prior notification and public nature of the processing.  Article 17  § 1.

The previous section does not apply to the processing of which the sole purpose is the  keeping of a register that is intended by law or by virtue of a law, decree or ordinance to  provide information to the public and that is open to consultation either by the public in  general or by any person demonstrating a legitimate interest.  § 2. The Commission shall return within three working days a written receipt of the  notification.

Upon submission of the notification the controller shall pay a sum to a person who has  been appointed as accountable by the Commission for the protection of privacy in accordance  with the laws on Government accounts. The King shall determine the amount of this sum that  may not exceed ten thousand francs. He shall also lay down the modalities of payment.  Article 17bis  The King shall determine after advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy the  categories of processing operations that imply specific risks with regard to the personal rights  and freedoms of the persons concerned and shall lay down in respect of these processing  operations, also on the proposal of the Commission for the protection of privacy, the specific  conditions for guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.  In particular he may determine that the controller, alone or along with other persons  responsible for the processing6, shall designate an appointee for the protection of data, who  shall take care in a independent manner of the application of this law and of its implementing  measures.  Article 18  The Commission for the protection of privacy shall keep a register of all automatic processing  operations of personal data.  Any entry in the register shall include the information referred to in Article 17, §§ 3 and 6.  The register is open to consultation by the public in the manner as laid down by the King.   Article 19  If the Commission for the protection of privacy holds the view that a non-automatic processing  operation of personal data that are contained in a filing system or that are intended to be  contained therein, implies a possible violation of the privacy, it may either on its own initiative   6 The passage ‘alone or along with other persons responsible for the processing’ only figures in the Dutch version of the law and  not in the French. Apparently this is a lapsus of the legislator.  15    or on the request of a data subject oblige the controller to disclose the entirety or part of the  items of information as enumerated in Article 17 to it.  Article 20  If a specific system of prior authorisations or notifications of data processing operations has  been provided by or by virtue of a law, prescribing the communication of the information  referred to in Article 17 §§ 3 and 6 to a special supervisory committee and the entry in a  public register of the items of information referred to in Article 17 §§ 3 and 6, the obligations  laid down in the Articles 17, 18 and 19 shall be considered to have been complied with, if the  entirety of this information is kept on a permanent basis at the disposal of the Commission for  the protection of privacy.  Article 17 § 9 shall be applicable.  Chapter VI - Transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Community  Article 21  § 1. Personal data that are undergoing processing or that are intended for processing after  transfer may be transferred to a country outside the European Community only if, without  prejudice to compliance with the provisions laid down by or by virtue of this law, the third  country in question ensures an adequate level of protection.  The adequacy of the level of protection shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances  surrounding a data transfer operation or a category of data transfer operations; particular  consideration shall be given to the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the  intended processing operation or operations, the country of origin and country of final  destination, the rules of law, both general and sectoral, in force in the country in question and  the professional rules and security measures that are complied with in that country.  § 2. The King shall lay down after advice of the Commission for the protection of privacy and  in accordance with Article 25 of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard  to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, for which  categories of processing operations of personal data and under which circumstances the  transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Community is not authorised.  Article 22  § 1. As a derogation from Article 21 a transfer or category of transfers of personal data to a  country outside the European Community that does not ensure an adequate level of  protection may take place in one of the following cases:  1° the data subject has given his consent unambiguously to the intended transfer;  2° the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and  the controller or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the  request of the data subject;  3° the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded or to  be concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and a third party;  4° the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds, or for the  establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;  5° the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject;  16    6° the transfer is made from a public register that according to legal or regulatory provisions is  intended to provide information to the public and that is open to consultation either by the  public in general or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, to the extent  that the conditions laid down in law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case.  § 2. Without prejudice to the provisions of the previous section the King may after advice of  the Commission for the protection of privacy authorise a transfer or a category of transfers to  a country outside the European Community that does not ensure an adequate level of  protection, if the controller adduces adequate safeguards with regard to the protection of the  privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals as well as with regard to the  exercise of the corresponding rights; such safeguards may in particular result from  appropriate contractual clauses.     Chapter VII - The Commission for the protection of privacy  Article 23  An independent Commission shall be established at the House of Representatives, called  \"Commission for the protection of privacy\", that shall be composed of members, including the  chairman and vice-chairman, to be appointed by the House of Representatives7.

The law establishes within the Commission sectoral committees competent to examine  requests concerning the processing or the notification of data to which special legislation  applies and to decide on the given case within the limits set out by law.  § 2. Without prejudice to article 37 of the law of 15 January 1990 concerning the formation  and organization of a Crossroads Bank of the social security, every sectoral committee  consists of three full or substitute members of the Commission, among which the chairman or  a member appointed as chairman by the Commission, as well as three external members  appointed by the House of Representatives in accordance with the conditions and further  rules stipulated in or under the special legislation regulating the committee in question. In  case of equality of votes the chairman has the casting vote.  The leading official of the supervising organization of the sector concerned can be invited to  take part to the meetings of the committee with an advisory vote.  § 3. The filed requests concerning the processing or the notification of data to which special  legislation applies are sent by the Commission to the competent sectoral committee, if any  such committee has been set up, and to the supervising organization of the sector concerned.  The latter transmits a technical and legal advice to the committee, within fifteen days from  receipt of the request and provided the file is prepared. With the same reservation, the   20    committee decides within thirty days from receipt of the said advice or, when the occasion  arises, when the aforesaid term of fifteen days has expired. Otherwise, its decision is  considered to be in accordance with the technical and legal advice of the supervising  organization.  In case a request, as referred to in the previous section, needs to be dealt with for urgent  reasons and within a period of time shorter than the one stipulated in that section, the  chairman transmits the request, the technical and legal advice and the draft decree to the  members as soon as possible. The members are then requested to inform the chairman of  their opinion concerning the draft decree, within the time limit prescribed by the chairman.  The draft decree will only become enforced when not a single member, within the time limit  prescribed by the chairman, raises an objection with reference to the essential elements of  the decree. When necessary, the chairman schedules a special session of the sectoral  committee. In consultation with the leading official of the organization concerned, the  chairman checks the existence of urgent reasons justifying the application of the two previous  sections.   Without prejudice to article 44 of the aforesaid law of 15 January 1990, the chairman of the  committee can suspend the examination of the file for it to be handed over to the Commission  who will give a decision within a month.  § 4. The chaimanship of a department gives rise to a double attendance fee, except when  the chairman or the vice-chairman of the Commission hold the chair.  § 5. Without prejudice to article 41 of the aforesaid law of 15 January 1990, the sectoral  committees are established and meetings take place in the main office of the Commission,  except when the supervising organization in question requests for the committee to be  established and the meetings to be held at its own premises.  The Commission can agree to this request, on the condition that beforehand the supervising  organisation places the offices and office equipment necessary for the well functioning of the  committee and its chairmanship at the disposal of the chairman of the sectoral committee, as  well as a secretary chosen by the chairman in consultation with the leading official of the  organisation in question, and a specialised staff, notably jurists and information scientists,  insofar the effective conclusion of the sectoral committees duties require this. The chairman  of the sectoral committee bears the functional responsibility over the staff with regard to the  duties they perform for this committee.  Article 32  For the fulfilment of its duties the Commission may call upon the assistance of experts. It may  instruct one or more of its members, accompanied by an expert, if necessary, to carry out  investigations on the spot.  In that case the members of the Commission shall have the quality of an officer of judicial  police, assisting officer of the procurator of the King13.  They may require, among other things, the communication of any document that may be of  use for their investigation.  They shall also have access to all the premises of which they may suppose in reason that  activities relating to the application of this law are performed therein.  § 2. Unless otherwise provided for by law the Commission shall inform the Procurator of the  King of any offence of which it has knowledge.  13 The procurator of the King (procureur des Konings / procureur du Roi) is the head of the public prosecutor’s department at the  tribunals (See footnote 4).  21    The Commission shall submit on a yearly basis a report on its activities to the Legislative  Chambers.  This report, which has a public nature, shall contain, in addition to the general information on  the application of this law and on the activities of the Commission, specific information on the  application of the Articles 3 § 3 and 6, 13, 17 and 18.  § 3. Without prejudice to the competence of the regular courts and tribunals in respect to the  application of the general principles concerning the protection of the privacy, the chairman of  the Commission may submit to the tribunal of first instance any dispute relating to the  application of this law and its implementing measures.  Article 32bis  § 1. In view of the application of international agreements the King may appoint in a decree  agreed upon in the Council of Ministers the Commission for the protection of privacy to fulfil in  pursuance of these treaties duties identical to those that are assigned to the Commission by  this law.  § 2. In view of the application of international agreements the Commission shall be authorised  to appoint certain of its members or staff members as representatives to international  authorities that are in charge of duties identical to those that are assigned to the Commission  by this law.  The King shall lay down specific rules relating to the representation after advice of the  Commission for the protection of privacy.  Article 33  Without prejudice to Article 32 § 2 the members and staff members of the Commission and  the experts of whom the assistance is requested for, are obliged to maintain the confidential  nature of the facts, actions or information of which they have knowledge because of their  function.  Article 34  Every year, the House of Representatives draws up an estimate, on the proposal of the  Commission, which is to be included in the estimate of the state grants.  The Commission attaches a concise management strategy to the proposal of estimate of  which it, notwithstanding any remarks of the House of Representatives, determines the  content and form; the annual report on its activities, as referred to in article 32, § 2, section  two, contains a subdivision in which the compliance with this plan is described.  The contributions referred to in the Articles 17 § 9 and 20, second section, shall be paid by  the person appointed as accountable by the Commission on a special item of the ways and  means budget.  Article 35  § 1. The Commission shall have a secretariat at its disposal of which the establishment, the  statute and the method of recruitment are prescribed by the House of Representatives, on the  proposal of the Commission. The establishment can, to a restricted and reasonably justified  extent, provide for the possibility to employ employees with an employment contract for a  definite period.  22    Except when the Commission decides otherwise, for the sake of the well functioning of its  services, in an order approved by the House of Representatives, the staff of the secretariat is  subordinate to the legal and statutory provisions applicable to full government officials.  § 2. The personnel in service at the time the law of 26 February 2003 amending the law of 8  December 1992 on privacy protection in relation to the processing of personal data and the  law of 15 January 1990 concerning the establishment and organisation of a Crossroads Bank  of the social security to adjust the statute of the Commission for the protection of privacy and  to extend its powers, comes into force, hold their position and their statute until the measures,  taken in implementation of § 1, are approved. If the officials, as a result of the directions  given in accordance with the aforesaid measures, aren’t confirmed in their position, they  return to the services of the Federal Public Service Justice, holding the statute applicable to  those services.  Article 36  The chairman shall be entitled to receive an indemnity equal to the salary supplement  accorded to an examining magistrate with nine years seniority in a tribunal having jurisdiction  over a population of at least 500,000 inhabitants.  The substitute chairman, the substitute vice-chairman and the full and substitute members  shall be entitled to receive an attendance fee for an amount of 223,18 EUR (index 1,2682).  This figure is linked to the evolution of the price index of the consumption prices.  They shall be entitled to receive indemnities for travel and accommodation expenses in  accordance with the provisions applying to the staff members of the Ministries. Those who do  not belong to the administration or of whom no ranking of their grade is determined shall be  assimilated to civil servants of grade 13.

The experts of whom the assistance is requested for by the Commission or who assist the  members in their investigations on the spot, may be indemnified according to the conditions  laid down by the Minister of Justice in consultation with the ministers competent for civil  service and the budget.  The indemnity referred to in the first section shall be linked to the mobility regulations  applicable to the salary of the civil servants on active duty.     Chapter VII bis - Sectoral committees  Article 36bis  Within the Commission for the protection of privacy a sectoral committee for the federal  government is established, within the meaning of article 31bis. The Federal Public Service  Information and Communication Technology is looked upon as the supervising organization,  referred to in article 31bis, of the sectoral committee for the federal government.  The King determines the conditions and further rules applicable to the three external  members of the sectoral committee for the federal government, in an order enacted after  consultation with the Council of Ministers.  Except for the cases determined by the King, every electronic notification of personal data by  a federal public service or a public institution with legal personality that comes under the  federal government, requires a fundamental authorization of this sectoral committee, unless   23    the notification is already subject to a fundamental authorization of another sectoral  committee established within the Commission for the protection of privacy.  Before granting its authorization, the sectoral committee for the federal government checks  whether the notification is in line with the legal and regulatory provisions.  The authorizations granted by the sectoral committee for the federal government are public,  as soon as they are definitive. They are published on the website of the Commission for the  protection of privacy.  The leading official of the federal public service concerned or of the public institution with legal  personality in question that comes under the federal government, or a co-worker designated  by him, can take part to the meetings of the sectoral committee for the federal government  with an advisory vote.

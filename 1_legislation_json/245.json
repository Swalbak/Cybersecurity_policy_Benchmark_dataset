(2A) If any proceedings are taken by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred by this sec‐ tion, it is a defence to prove that the act or omission would not have been an offence under the law of the country of which the person charged was a national or citizen at the time of the act or omission, if it had occurred in that country.  (3) Where at any place beyond New Zealand any person who belongs, or within 3 months previously has belonged, to any Commonwealth ship does or omits any act, whether on shore or afloat, not being an act or omission to which subsec‐ tion (1) applies, and that act or omission would, if it occurred within New Zea‐ land, be an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or by 2 or more years’ imprisonment, then this section shall apply in respect of that act or omission in the same manner in all respects as if it had occurred on board a Commonwealth ship.

Fine  19 Enforcement of fines by High Court (1) If the High Court imposes 1 or more fines, Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings  Act 1957 applies to the fine or fines, subject to any necessary modifications and subject to the modifications in subsections (2) to (5).  (2) Without limiting the actions that the High Court may take under Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 in relation to the fine or fines, the High Court may make any orders that it thinks fit, including a charging order or sale order in relation to the offender’s real property.  (3) To avoid doubt, section 88A of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 does not apply if the High Court makes, in accordance with subsection (2), a charging order or sale order in relation to real property.  (4) If an offender is sentenced by the High Court to community work, community detention, or home detention under section 88AE(1) of the Summary Proceed‐ ings Act 1957 or is imprisoned under a warrant of commitment issued under that section,— (a) section 89(2) and (3) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 apply with  any necessary modifications as if— (i) the references in those subsections to a District Court Judge were  references to a High Court Judge; and (ii) the reference to the High Court was a reference to the Court of  Appeal; and  Version as at 6 November 2021 Crimes Act 1961 Part 2 s 19  37           (b) sections 244 and 250 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 and any other relevant provisions of that Act relating to appeals against sentence apply with any necessary modifications.  (5) Despite section 90 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the period of imprisonment that the High Court may impose on the offender for the non-pay‐ ment of 1 or more fines must not exceed, for each fine, the lesser of— (a) the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender was liable on  the conviction; or (b) a period of 2 years.  (6) If the High Court enforces 1 or more fines under this section, the court may, at the same time, enforce any outstanding fine or fines imposed on the offender by the District Court.  (7) For the purposes of subsection (6), the outstanding fine or fines imposed by the District Court must be treated as if the fine or fines were imposed by the High Court and, in accordance with subsection (1), Part 3 of the Summary Proceed‐ ings Act 1957 applies to the fine or fines, subject to— (a) any necessary modifications; and (b) the modifications in subsections (2) and (4), but not the modification in  subsection (5), if the outstanding fine or fines were imposed in the Dis‐ trict Court.  (8) A Registrar of the District Court or of the High Court may exercise any juris‐ diction and powers conferred on a Registrar of the District Court by Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 in respect of the fine or fines imposed by the High Court to which, under subsection (1), that Part applies.  (9) A bailiff of the District Court may exercise any jurisdiction and powers con‐ ferred on a bailiff of the District Court by Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 in respect of the fine or fines imposed by the High Court to which, under subsection (1), that Part applies.  (10) The amount of the fee payable if default is made in the payment of 1 or more fines imposed by the High Court to which, under subsection (1), Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 applies is the same as that prescribed by regu‐ lations, made under the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, in respect of enforce‐ ment action taken under that Act to enforce the fine or fines.  (11) To avoid doubt, sections 92A to 92I of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 apply, subject to any necessary modifications, to any fine or fines imposed by the High Court, and accordingly, the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice may, among other things authorised by those sections, disclose information about default balances relating to such fine or fines in accordance with those sections.  (12) For the purposes of this section, and subject to subsection (4), any reference in Part 3 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 to—  Part 2 s 19 Crimes Act 1961 Version as at  6 November 2021  38              (a) a court is, unless the context otherwise requires, taken to be a reference to the High Court; and  (b) a District Court Judge is, unless the context otherwise requires, taken to be a reference to a High Court Judge; and  (c) a Registrar is, unless the context otherwise requires, taken to be a refer‐ ence to a Registrar of the High Court or of the District Court and includes a Deputy Registrar.  (13) In this section, fine has the meaning given to it in section 79 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957.

(3) Insanity before or after the time when he or she did or omitted the act, and  insane delusions, though only partial, may be evidence that the offender was, at the time when he or she did or omitted the act, in such a condition of mind as to render him or her irresponsible for the act or omission.  (4) The fact that by virtue of this section any person has not been or is not liable to be convicted of an offence shall not affect the question whether any other per‐ son who is alleged to be a party to that offence is guilty of that offence.

Freeing Portugal from dictatorship, oppression and colonialism represented a revolutionary change and  the beginning of an historic turning point for Portuguese society.    The Revolution restored their fundamental rights and freedoms to the people of Portugal. In the exercise  of those rights and freedoms, the people’s legitimate representatives are gathered to draw up a  Constitution that matches the country’s aspirations.    The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people’s decision to defend national independence,  guarantee citizens’ fundamental rights, establish the basic principles of democracy, ensure the primacy of  a democratic state based on the rule of law and open up a path towards a socialist society, with respect for  the will of the Portuguese people and with a view to the construction of a country that is freer, more just  and more fraternal.    Meeting in plenary sitting on 2 April 1976, the Constituent Assembly does hereby pass and decree the  following Constitution of the Portuguese Republic:        Fundamental principles      Article 1    (Portuguese Republic)    Portugal is a sovereign Republic, based on the dignity of the human person and the will of the people and  committed to building a free, just and solidary society.        Article 2    (Democratic state based on the rule of law)    The Portuguese Republic is a democratic state based on the rule of law, the sovereignty of the people,  plural democratic expression and political organisation, respect for and the guarantee of the effective  implementation of the fundamental rights and freedoms, and the separation and interdependence of  powers, with a view to achieving economic, social and cultural democracy and deepening participatory  democracy.        Article 3    (Sovereignty and legality)    1. Sovereignty is single and indivisible and lies with the people, who exercise it in the forms provided for  in the Constitution.    2. The state is subject to the Constitution and is based on democratic legality.    3. The validity of laws and other acts of the state, the autonomous regions, local government and any  other public entities is dependent on their conformity with the Constitution.           Article 4    (Portuguese citizenship)    All persons whom the law or an international convention considers to be Portuguese citizens are such  citizens.        Article 5    (Territory)    1. Portugal comprises the territory on the European mainland that is historically defined as Portuguese,  and the Azores and Madeira archipelagos.    2. The law shall define the extent and limit of Portugal’s territorial waters, its exclusive economic zone  and its rights to the adjacent seabeds.    3. Without prejudice to the rectification of borders, the state shall not dispose of any part of Portuguese  territory or of the sovereign rights that it exercises thereover.        Article 6    (Unitary state)    1. The state is unitary and the way in which it is organised and functions shall respect the autonomous  island system of self-government and the principles of subsidiarity, the autonomy of local authorities and  the democratic decentralisation of the Public Administration.    2. The Azores and Madeira archipelagos are autonomous regions with their own political and  administrative statutes and self-government institutions.        Article 7    (International relations)    1. In its international relations Portugal is governed by the principles of national independence, respect for  human rights, the rights of peoples, equality between states, the peaceful settlement of international  conflicts, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and cooperation with all other peoples  with a view to the emancipation and progress of mankind.    2. Portugal advocates the abolition of imperialism, colonialism and any other forms of aggression,  dominion and exploitation in the relations between peoples, as well as simultaneous and controlled  general disarmament, the dissolution of the political-military blocs and the establishment of a collective  security system, with a view to the creation of an international order that is capable of ensuring peace and  justice in the relations between peoples.    3. Portugal recognises peoples’ rights to self-determination and independence and to development, as well  as the right of insurrection against all forms of oppression.    4. Portugal maintains privileged ties of friendship and cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries.       5. Portugal is committed to reinforcing the European identity and to strengthening the European states’  actions in favour of democracy, peace, economic progress and justice in the relations between peoples.    6. Subject to reciprocity and with respect for the fundamental principles of a democratic state based on  the rule of law and for the principle of subsidiarity, and with a view to the achievement of the economic,  social and territorial cohesion of an area of freedom, security and justice and the definition and  implementation of a common external, security and defence policy, Portugal may agree to the joint  exercise, in cooperation or by the Union’s institutions, of the powers needed to construct and deepen the  European Union.    7. With a view to achieving an international justice that promotes respect for the rights of the human  person and of peoples, and subject to the provisions governing complementarity and the other terms laid  down in the Rome Statute, Portugal may accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.      Article 8    (International law)    1. The norms and principles of general or common international law form an integral part of Portuguese  law.    2. The norms contained in duly ratified or approved international conventions come into force in  Portuguese internal law once they have been officially published, and remain so for as long as they are  internationally binding on the Portuguese state.    3. The norms issued by the competent organs of international organisations to which Portugal belongs  come directly into force in Portuguese internal law, on condition that this is laid down in the respective  constituent treaties.    4. The provisions of the treaties that govern the European Union and the norms issued by its institutions  in the exercise of their respective competences are applicable in Portuguese internal law in accordance  with Union law and with respect for the fundamental principles of a democratic state based on the rule of  law.      Article 9    (Fundamental tasks of the state)    The fundamental tasks of the state are:    a) To guarantee national independence and create the political, economic, social and cultural conditions  that promote it;    b) To guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms and respect for the principles of a democratic state  based on the rule of law;    c) To defend political democracy and safeguard and encourage citizens’ democratic participation in the  resolution of national problems;    d) To promote the people’s well-being and quality of life and real equality between the Portuguese, as  well as the effective implementation of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights by means of  the transformation and modernisation of economic and social structures;    e) To protect and enhance the Portuguese people’s cultural heritage, defend nature and the environment,  preserve natural resources and ensure correct town and country planning;    f) To ensure that the Portuguese language is taught and constantly valued, defend its use and promote its  international dissemination;       g) To promote the harmonious development of the whole of Portuguese territory, with particular regard to  the ultraperipheral nature of the Azores and Madeira archipelagos;    h) To promote equality between men and women.      Article 10    (Universal suffrage and political parties)    1. The people exercise political power by means of universal, equal, direct, secret and periodic suffrage,  referendum and the other forms provided for in the Constitution.    2. Political parties exist in order to contribute to the organisation and expression of the will of the people,  with respect for the principles of national independence, the unity of the state and political democracy.        Article 11    (National symbols and official language)    1. The National Flag, which is the symbol of the sovereignty of the Republic and of Portugal’s  independence, unity and integrity, is that adopted by the Republic formed by the Revolution of the 5th of  October 1910.    2. The national anthem is A Portuguesa.    3. The official language is Portuguese.        PART I    Fundamental rights and duties    TITLE I    General principles    Article 12    (Principle of universality)    1. Every citizen enjoys the rights and is subject to the duties enshrined in the Constitution.    2. Legal persons enjoy the rights and are subject to the duties that are compatible with their nature.        Article 13    (Principle of equality)    1. All citizens possess the same social dignity and are equal before the law.    2. No one may be privileged, favoured, prejudiced, deprived of any right or exempted from any duty for  reasons of ancestry, sex, race, language, territory of origin, religion, political or ideological beliefs,  education, economic situation, social circumstances or sexual orientation.           Article 14    (Portuguese abroad)    Portuguese citizens who find themselves or who reside abroad enjoy the state’s protection in the exercise  of the rights and are subject to the duties that are not incompatible with their absence from the country.        Article 15    (Foreigners, stateless persons, European citizens)    1. Foreigners and stateless persons who find themselves or who reside in Portugal enjoy the same rights  and are subject to the same duties as Portuguese citizens.    2. Political rights, the exercise of public functions that are not predominantly technical in nature, and the  rights and duties that the Constitution and the law reserve exclusively to Portuguese citizens are excepted  from the provisions of the previous paragraph.    3. Save for access to appointment to the offices of President of the Republic, President of the Assembly of  the Republic, Prime Minister and President of any of the supreme courts, and for service in the armed  forces and the diplomatic corps, rights that are not otherwise granted to foreigners are accorded, as laid  down by law and under reciprocal terms, to the citizens of Portuguese-speaking states who reside  permanently in Portugal.    4. Under reciprocal terms, the law may accord foreigners who reside in Portugal the eligibility to vote for  and stand for election as officeholders of local authority organs.    5. Under reciprocal terms, the law may also accord citizens of European Union Member States who reside  in Portugal the eligibility to vote for and stand for election as Members of the European Parliament.        Article 16    (Scope and interpretation of fundamental rights)    1. The fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution shall not exclude any others set out in applicable  international laws and legal rules.    2. The constitutional and legal precepts concerning fundamental rights must be interpreted and completed  in harmony with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.        Article 17    (Regime governing rights, freedoms and guarantees)    The regime governing rights, freedoms and guarantees applies to those set out in Title II and to  fundamental rights of an analogous nature.        Article 18       (Legal force)    1. The constitutional precepts with regard to rights, freedoms and guarantees are directly applicable and  are binding on public and private entities.    2. The law may only restrict rights, freedoms and guarantees in cases expressly provided for in the  Constitution, and such restrictions must be limited to those needed to safeguard other constitutionally  protected rights and interests.    3. Laws that restrict rights, freedoms and guarantees must have a general and abstract nature and may not  have a retroactive effect or reduce the extent or scope of the essential content of the constitutional  precepts.        Article 19    (Suspension of the exercise of rights)    1. Entities that exercise sovereignty may not jointly or separately suspend the exercise of the rights,  freedoms and guarantees, save in the case of a state of siege or a state of emergency declared in the form  provided for in the Constitution.    2. A state of siege or a state of emergency may only be declared in part or all of Portuguese territory in  cases of actual or imminent aggression by foreign forces, a serious threat to or disturbance of democratic  constitutional order, or public disaster.    3. A state of emergency is declared when the preconditions referred to in the previous paragraph are less  serious, and may only cause the suspension of some of the rights, freedoms and guarantees that are  capable of being suspended.    4. Both the choice between a state of siege and a state of emergency and the declaration and  implementation thereof must respect the principle of proportionality and limit themselves, particularly as  regards their extent and duration and the means employed, to that which is strictly necessary for the  prompt restoration of constitutional normality.    5. Declarations of a state of siege or a state of emergency shall set out adequate grounds therefore and  specify the rights, freedoms and guarantees whose exercise is to be suspended. Without prejudice to the  possibility of renewals subject to the same limits, neither state may last for more than fifteen days, or,  when it results from a declaration of war, for more than the duration laid down by law.    6.

No Member of the Assembly of the Republic, parliamentary group or group of registered electors may  submit draft referenda which, during the then current financial year, involve an increase in the state’s  expenditure or a decrease in its revenues as set out in the Budget.    4. Bills and draft referenda that are definitively rejected may not be resubmitted in the same legislative  session, unless a new Assembly of the Republic is elected.    5. Bills and draft referenda that are not put to the vote in the legislative session in which they are  submitted do not require resubmission in the following legislative session, save in the event that the  legislature itself comes to an end.    6. Government bills and draft referenda lapse upon the resignation or removal of the Government.    7. Government bills that are initiated by Legislative Assemblies of the autonomous regions lapse at the  end of the respective legislature, save for those whose general principles have already been passed, which  only lapse upon the end of the legislature of the Assembly of the Republic.    8. Without prejudice to the bills and draft referenda to which they refer, when they are not withdrawn,  parliamentary committees may submit replacement texts.        Article 168    (Discussion and voting)    1. Discussion of bills comprises a debate on the general principles and another on the details.    2. Voting comprises a vote on the general principles, a vote on the details and a final overall vote.    3. If the Assembly so decides, texts that are passed on the general principles shall be put to the vote on the  details in committee, without prejudice to the Assembly’s power to mandate the Plenary to put the details  to the vote, or to the final overall vote by the Plenary.    4. The details of laws on the matters provided for in Articles 164(a) to (f), (h), (n) and (o) and 165(1)(q)  shall obligatorily be put to the vote by the Plenary.    5. When put to the overall final vote, organic laws require passage by an absolute majority of all the  Members of the Assembly of the Republic in full exercise of their office. The same majority is required  for passage by the Plenary of the details of provisions concerning the territorial delimitation of regions  provided for in Article 255.    6. Passage of the following requires a majority that is at least equal to two thirds of all Members present  and greater than an absolute majority of all the Members in full exercise of their office:    a) The law concerning the media regulatory entity;    b) The norms that govern the provisions of Article 118(2);    c) The law that regulates the exercise of the right provided for in Article 121(2);    d) The provisions of the laws that regulate the matters referred to in Articles 148 and 149, and those  concerning the system and method for electing the organs provided for in Article 239(3);    e) The provisions that regulate the subject matter of Article 164(o);    f) Those provisions of the political and administrative statutes of the autonomous regions that set out the  matters which are included in the respective power to legislate.           Article 169    (Parliamentary consideration of legislative acts)    1. Save for those passed in the exercise of the Government’s exclusive legislative competence, executive  laws may, upon a motion made by ten Members of the Assembly of the Republic within the thirty days  following their publication, excluding periods in which the Assembly of the Republic’s proceedings are  suspended, be subjected to consideration by the Assembly of the Republic with a view to causing them to  cease to be in force or amending them.    2. Once a motion to consider an executive law drawn up under the terms of an authorisation to legislate  has been made and in cases in which one or more draft amendments are submitted, the Assembly may  suspend the force of all or part of the executive law until either the law that amends it is published, or all  the draft amendments are rejected.    3. Such suspensions expire after ten plenary sittings if the Assembly has not pronounced itself finally by  then.    4. If approval is given for the legislative act to cease to be in force, it shall so cease on the day on which  the respective resolution is published in the Diário da República, and may not be republished during the  same legislative session.    5. If a motion to consider has been made and the Assembly has not pronounced thereon, or in the event  that the Assembly has decided to make amendments, but has not put the respective law to the vote by the  end of the then current legislative session, and on condition that at least fifteen plenary sittings have  passed, the consideration process shall be deemed to have lapsed.    6. Proceedings concerning the parliamentary consideration of executive laws enjoy priority, as laid down  in the Rules of Procedure.        Article 170    (Urgent proceedings)    1. Upon the initiative of any Member of the Assembly of the Republic, any parliamentary group or the  Government, the Assembly may declare any bill or draft resolution to be the object of urgent proceedings.    2. Upon the initiative of the Legislative Assemblies of the autonomous regions, the Assembly may also  declare any government bill submitted by them to be the object of urgent proceedings.        CHAPTER III    Organisation and modus operandi    Article 171    (Legislature)    1. The duration of each legislature is four legislative sessions.    2. In cases of dissolution, the Assembly that is then elected shall commence a new legislature, the  duration of which shall be extended at the beginning by the time needed to complete the period that  corresponds to the legislative session that was in progress at the date of the election.           Article 172    (Dissolution)    1. The Assembly of the Republic may not be dissolved during the six months following its election,  during the last six months of the President of the Republic’s term of office, or while a state of siege or a  state of emergency is in force.    2. Failure to comply with the provisions of the previous paragraph renders the dissolution decree legally  nugatory.    3. Dissolution of the Assembly does not prejudice the continuation of its Members’ term of office, or the  competences of the Standing Committee, until the first sitting of the Assembly following the subsequent  election.        Article 173    (Sitting following elections)    1. The Assembly of the Republic shall sit by right on the third day following the calculation of the general  results of the election, or, in the case of elections called because a legislature is due to reach its term and  the said third day falls before the legislature reaches that term, on the first day of the following  legislature.    2. In the event that such a date falls when the Assembly is not in full session, it shall sit for the purposes  of Article 175.        Article 174    (Legislative sessions, full sessions and calling)    1. Legislative sessions last for one year and begin on 15 September.    2. Without prejudice to suspensions decided by a two-thirds majority of all the Members of the Assembly  of the Republic who are present, the Assembly of the Republic’s normal parliamentary term is from 15  September to 15 June.    3. Following a Plenary decision to extend the normal parliamentary term, or on the initiative of the  Standing Committee, or, in the event that the latter is unable to function and there is a serious emergency,  on the initiative of more than half of all the Members, the Assembly of the Republic may function outside  the term set out in the previous paragraph.    4. The President of the Republic may also call the Assembly on an extraordinary basis in order to address  specific subjects.    5. When the Assembly so decides under the same terms as those set out in paragraph (2), committees may  function regardless of whether the Assembly’s Plenary is in full session.        Article 175    (The Assembly’s internal competences)       The Assembly of the Republic has the competences:    a) To draw up and pass its Rules of Procedure, in accordance with the Constitution;    b) To elect its President and the remaining members of the Bureau by absolute majority of all the  Members of the Assembly of the Republic in full exercise of their office. The four Vice-Presidents shall  be elected upon proposals from the four largest parliamentary groups;    c) To form the Standing Committee and the remaining committees.      Article 176    (Order of business of plenary sittings)    1. The President of the Assembly of the Republic shall set the order of business in accordance with the  priority accorded to each matter in the Rules of Procedure, and without prejudice to the right of appeal to  the Assembly’s Plenary and to the competence of the President of the Republic provided for in  Article 174(4).    2. The Government and parliamentary groups may request that priority be given to matters of national  interest that require urgent resolution.    3. Every parliamentary group has the right to set the order of business of a certain number of sittings in  accordance with a criterion that shall be laid down in the Rules of Procedure, in which respect the  position of minority parties and parties that are not represented in the Government must always be  safeguarded.    4. Legislative Assemblies of autonomous regions may request that priority be given to matters of regional  interest that require urgent resolution.        Article 177    (Attendance by members of the Government)    1. Ministers have the right to attend the Assembly of the Republic’s plenary sittings, at which they may  be assisted or substituted by their Secretaries of State, and both have the right to speak, as laid down in  the Rules of Procedure.    2. Sittings shall be scheduled at which members of the Government shall be present in order to respond to  questions and requests for clarification from Members of the Assembly of the Republic. These sittings  shall take place with the minimum frequency laid down in the Rules of Procedure and on dates that shall  be set by agreement with the Government.    3. Members of the Government may ask to participate in committee proceedings, and must appear before  committees when asked to do so.        Article 178    (Committees)    1. The Assembly of the Republic shall have the committees provided for in the Rules of Procedure, and  may form ad hoc committees of inquiry or for any other given purpose.    2. Committees shall be composed in proportion to the number of seats each party holds in the Assembly  of the Republic.       3. Petitions addressed to the Assembly shall be considered by the committees or by a committee formed  specially for the purpose, which may consult the other committees with competence for the matter in  question. In all cases any citizens may be asked to testify.    4. Without prejudice to their formation in accordance with the normal provisions, parliamentary  committees of inquiry shall obligatorily be formed whenever a motion is made to that effect by one fifth  of all the Members of the Assembly of the Republic in full exercise of their office, up to a limit of one per  Member and per legislative session.    5. Parliamentary committees of inquiry have the investigative powers of the judicial authorities.    6. The chairmanships of the various committees shall be divided between the parliamentary groups in  proportion to the number of Members of the Assembly of the Republic in each group.    7. Representatives of the Legislative Assembly of the proposing autonomous region may participate in the  committee meetings at which regional legislative proposals are discussed, as laid down in the Rules of  Procedure.        Article 179    (Standing Committee)    1.

Representatives of the Republic may also ask the Constitutional Court to undertake the prior  consideration of the constitutionality of any norm contained in a regional legislative decree that is sent to  them for signature.    3. The prior consideration of constitutionality must be requested within a time limit of eight days counting  from the date on which the legislative act is received.    4. In addition to the President of the Republic himself, the Prime Minister or one fifth of all the Members  of the Assembly of the Republic in full exercise of their office may ask the Constitutional Court to  undertake the prior consideration of the constitutionality of any norm contained in any decree that is sent  to the President of the Republic for enactment as an organic law.    5. On the date on which he sends any decree that must be enacted as an organic law to the President of the  Republic for enactment, the President of the Assembly of the Republic shall notify the Prime Minister and  the parliamentary groups in the Assembly of the Republic thereof.    6. The prior consideration of constitutionality provided for in paragraph (4) must be requested within a  time limit of eight days counting from the date provided for in paragraph (5).    7. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph (1), the President of the Republic may not enact the  decrees referred to in paragraph (4) unless eight days have passed since their receipt, or, when the  Constitutional Court has been asked to intervene, until it has pronounced itself on them.    8. The Constitutional Court must pronounce within a time limit of twenty-five days, which the President  of the Republic may reduce for urgent reasons in the case provided for in paragraph (1).        Article 279    (Effects of decision)    1. If the Constitutional Court pronounces the unconstitutionality of a norm contained in any decree or  international treaty, the President of the Republic or the Representative of the Republic, as appropriate,  must veto the legislative act and return it to the entity or organ that passed it.    2. In the case provided for in paragraph (1), the decree may not be enacted or signed unless the entity or  organ that passed it expunges the norm that has been held unconstitutional, or, where applicable, the  entity or organ confirms the norm by a majority that is at least equal to two thirds of all Members who are  present and is greater than an absolute majority of all the Members in full exercise of their office.       3. If the legislative act is reformulated, the President of the Republic or the Representative of the  Republic, as appropriate, may request the prior review of the constitutionality of any of the norms in the  reformulated text.    4. If the Constitutional Court pronounces the unconstitutionality of any norm contained in a treaty, the  latter may only be ratified if the Assembly of the Republic then approves it by a majority that is at least  equal to two thirds of all Members present and greater than an absolute majority of all the Members in  full exercise of their office.        Article 280    (Concrete review of constitutionality and legality)    1. Appeal may be made to the Constitutional Court against court decisions:    a) That refuse the application of any norm on the grounds of its unconstitutionality;    b) That apply a norm whose unconstitutionality has been raised during the proceedings.    2. Appeal may also be made to the Constitutional Court against court decisions:    a) That refuse the application of a norm contained in a legislative act, on the grounds that it is illegal  because it is in breach of a law which possesses superior legal force;    b) That refuse the application of a norm contained in a regional legislative act, on the grounds that it is  illegal because it is in breach of the autonomous region’s statute;    c) That refuse the application of a norm contained in a legislative act issued by an entity that exercises  sovereignty, on the grounds that it is illegal because it is in breach of an autonomous region’s statute;    d) That apply any norm whose illegality on any of the grounds referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b) and  (c) has been raised during the proceedings.    3. When the norm whose application has been refused is contained in an international convention, a  legislative act or a regulatory decree, the Public Prosecution Service shall obligatorily lodge the appeal  provided for in paragraph (1)(a) or 2(a).    4. The appeals provided for in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2)(d) may only be lodged by the party that raised  the question of unconstitutionality or illegality, and the law must regulate the regime governing the  admission of such appeals.    5. Appeal may also be made to the Constitutional Court, and the Public Prosecution Service shall  obligatorily lodge such appeals, against court decisions that apply norms which the Constitutional Court  itself has previously held unconstitutional or illegal.    6. Appeals to the Constitutional Court are restricted to the question of unconstitutionality or illegality, as  appropriate.        Article 281    (Abstract review of constitutionality and legality)    1. The Constitutional Court may consider and declare with generally binding force:    a) The unconstitutionality of any norm;       b) The illegality of any norms contained in a legislative act, on the grounds of the breach of a law with  superior legal force;    c) The illegality of any norms contained in a regional legislative act, on the grounds of the breach of the  autonomous region’s statute;    d) The illegality of any norms contained in a legislative act issued by an entity that exercises sovereignty,  on the grounds of a breach of those of an autonomous region’s rights that are enshrined in its statute.    2. The following may ask the Constitutional Court for a declaration of unconstitutionality or illegality  with generally binding force:    a) The President of the Republic;    b) The President of the Assembly of the Republic;    c) The Prime Minister;    d) The Ombudsman;    e) The Prosecutor General;    f) One tenth of the Members of the Assembly of the Republic;    g) When the grounds for the request for a declaration of unconstitutionality are the breach of the rights of  the autonomous regions, or the grounds for the request for a declaration of illegality are the breach of the  respective statute, Representatives of the Republic, Legislative Assemblies of the autonomous regions,  presidents of Legislative Assemblies of the autonomous regions, presidents of Regional Governments, or  one tenth of the members of the respective Legislative Assembly.    3. The Constitutional Court may also consider and declare with generally binding force the  unconstitutionality or illegality of any norm, on condition that it has already held the norm  unconstitutional or illegal in three concrete cases.        Article 282    (Effects of declarations of unconstitutionality or illegality)    1. A declaration of unconstitutionality or illegality with generally binding force has effect as of the  moment at which the norm declared unconstitutional or illegal came into force, and causes the  revalidation of any norms that the said norm repealed.    2. However, in the case of unconstitutionality or illegality due to breach of a subsequent constitutional or  legal norm, the declaration only has effect as of the moment at which the latter came into force.    3. Res judicata are excepted, save when the Constitutional Court decides to the contrary in relation to a  norm that concerns penal or disciplinary matters or administrative offences and whose contents are less  favourable to the accused person.    4. When required for the purposes of legal security, reasons of fairness or an exceptionally important  public interest, the grounds for which must be given, the Constitutional Court may determine a scope for  the effects of the unconstitutionality or illegality that is more restricted than that provided for in  paragraphs (1) and (2).        Article 283       (Unconstitutionality by omission)    1. At the request of the President of the Republic, the Ombudsman, or, on the grounds of the breach of  rights of the autonomous regions, presidents of the Legislative Assemblies of autonomous regions, the  Constitutional Court shall consider and verify whether there is a failure to comply with the Constitution  due to the omission of legislative measures needed to make constitutional norms executable.    2. When the Constitutional Court verifies that an unconstitutionality by omission exists, it shall notify the  competent legislative entity thereof.        TITLE II    Revision of the Constitution    Article 284    (Competence and time for revisions)    1.

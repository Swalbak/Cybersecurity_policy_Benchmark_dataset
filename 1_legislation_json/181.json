[RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (5) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority finds that the performance of an obligation imposed on an undertaking by a decision made in accordance with subsection 1 of this section does not ensure competition in the specific market, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority shall prepare a new draft decision for the imposition of a new obligation on the undertaking with significant market power by amending the obligation imposed on the undertaking with significant market power in accordance with this Act. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (6) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority, as a result of the market analysis provided in §§ 44 and 441 of this Act, establishes that competition is present in the respective communications services market, it revokes the decision provided in subsection 1 of this section, notifies the undertaking thereof by post or electronic means and publishes a notice concerning revocation of the decision in the official publication Ametlikud Teadaanded.

Obligations related to interconnection of networks and equipment and provision of access thereto on undertaking with significant market power   (1) In the framework of the obligation specified in clause 5 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may additionally require an undertaking with significant market power to: [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  1) provide a communications undertaking with access to specific network elements or network facilities, including full access or shared access to the local loop or local sub-loop; [RT I, 23.03.2011, 1 – entry into force 25.05.2011]  11) provide another communications undertaking with access to elements and services of an active or virtual communications network; [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  12) provide another communication undertaking with mandated access to buildings, irrespective of whether the assets that are affected by the obligation are part of the relevant market in accordance with the market analysis, provided that the obligation is necessary and proportionate to meet the objectives provided in § 134 of this Act; [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  2) negotiate in good faith with communications undertakings requesting access;  3) maintain already granted access;  4) provide specific services on a wholesale basis for resale of such services by communications undertakings;  5) grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services; [RT I, 17.05.2016, 1 – entry into force 13.06.2016]  6) to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including sharing of ducts, buildings or masts;  7) provide services necessary to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to end-users, including facilities for intelligent network services or roaming service on mobile networks; [RT I 2007, 63, 397 – entry into force 17.12.2007]  8) provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services;  9) interconnect networks or network facilities;  10) [repealed – RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  11) [repealed – RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  12) provide access to an associated service. [RT I, 23.03.2011, 1 – entry into force 25.05.2011]   (11) When considering whether the provisions of subsection 1 of this section are necessary and proportionate to the objectives provided in § 134 of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority analyses whether other forms of access to wholesale services, either on the same or on a related wholesale market, would be sufficient to address the identified problem in the end-user's interest. The specified analysis includes commercial access offers, the access provided in Chapter 6 of this Act or existing or planned access to other wholesale inputs pursuant to this section. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (2) When conducting the analysis provided in subsection 11of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority asses primarily the following conditions: [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  1) the technical and economic feasibility of using or installing competing facilities, in the light of the rate of market development and taking into account the nature and type of interconnection and access involved, including feasibility of access to ducts; [RT I, 23.03.2011, 1 – entry into force 25.05.2011]  11) the expected technological development affecting the design and management of communications networks; [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  12) the need to ensure technology neutrality enabling the communications undertakings to design and manage their own communications networks;  Electronic Communications Act Page 31 / 89    [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  2) the feasibility of providing the access proposed, in relation to the capacity available;  3) the initial investment by the facility owner, taking account of any public investment made, including investments in very high capacity communications networks, and the risks involved in making the investment; [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  4) the need to safeguard competition in the long term, with particular attention to competition based on economically efficient infrastructure and new business models that support it; [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  5) the need to create effective competition at the retail level and ensuring of protection of the rights of end- users;  6) any relevant intellectual property rights;  7) the possibility of providing pan-European services.   (21) When the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority considers the imposition of obligations on an undertaking with significant market power, it first assesses whether the imposition of the obligation specified in clause 5 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act alone is a proportionate means to promote competition and protect the interests of end-users. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (3) When imposing an obligation provided for in subsection 1 of this section the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may specify the manner of performance of the obligation. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]  § 52. Obligations related to charges and costs of access and interconnection on undertaking with significant market power   (1) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may impose on an undertaking with significant market power obligations related to the costs and charges of access and interconnection provided for in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act, including obligations related to cost orientation and cost accounting system, provided that it has established by a market analysis that due to lack of effective competition the undertaking with significant market power is able to sustain prices at an excessively high or low level, distorting competition and damaging the interests of end-users. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (2) Upon imposing the obligations specified in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act and encouraging investment by the communications undertaking in the next generation communications networks, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority takes account of the investments made by the communications undertaking and that an undertaking with significant market power must be allowed a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account the risks that are involved and specific to investing in such new network project. The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority imposes the obligations specified in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act on communications undertakings also on the basis of the principle that any cost recovery mechanism or pricing methodology that is mandated by the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority must serve to promote efficiency and sustainable competition and maximise the benefits of end-consumers related to the deployment of next-generation networks, in particular very high capacity networks. In this regard the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may also take account of prices available in other comparable markets. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (21) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may choose not to impose the obligation provided in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act if it establishes that a retail price constraint is present and all the obligations imposed in accordance with §§ 50 and 51 of this Act, in particular an economic replicability test imposed in accordance with clause 3 of subsection 1 of § 50, ensure effective and non-discriminatory access. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (22) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority imposes the obligation provided in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act in relation to access to existing network elements, it takes account of the benefits of predictable and stable wholesale prices in ensuring efficient market entry and sufficient incentives for all communications undertakings to deploy new and enhanced communications networks. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (3) Where an undertaking with significant market power has an obligation imposed by the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority regarding the cost orientation of its charges provided for in clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act, the undertaking with significant market power must, at the request of the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority, prove that its service charges are derived from costs, which are added a reasonable rate of return. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (4) For the purpose of calculating the costs for the provision of the services provided for in subsection 3 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may, if necessary, use cost accounting methods which are different from those used by the undertaking. If it becomes evident that charges are not  Page 32 / 89 Electronic Communications Act    derived from the costs for the provision of the services, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority has the right to require that the charges be brought into conformity with the costs for the provision of the services. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (5) The cost accounting methods specified in subsection 4 of this section used by the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority for the verification of the costs shall be established by the minister in charge of the policy sector. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (6) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority has imposed on an undertaking with significant market power an obligation to use a specific cost accounting system in accordance with clause 7 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority or a qualified independent person commissioned by the communications undertaking with the approval of the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority shall verify compliance with the requirements of the cost accounting system each year. If compliance with the cost accounting system is confirmed by a qualified independent person, the costs of the person shall be covered by the undertaking with significant market power. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (7) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority publishes a statement concerning compliance of an undertaking with significant market power with the requirements of the cost accounting system on its website once a year. The corresponding statement must, among other things, set out the categories under which costs are grouped and the rules used for the allocation of costs. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (8) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may verify whether an undertaking with significant market power complies with the cost accounting system correctly.

Obligation to publish reference offer regarding access and interconnection on undertaking with significant market power   (1) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority imposes on an undertaking with significant market power the obligation to publish a reference offer for the access or interconnection service in accordance with clause 2 of subsection 1 of § 50 of this Act, the specified undertaking must prepare the reference offer regarding the access or interconnection. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (2) [Repealed – RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (3) Upon mutual agreement, communications undertakings have the right to enter into an access or interconnection agreement under the conditions different from those of the reference offer, unless the conditions of the agreement to be entered into are contrary to the objectives of the obligation to publish the reference offer.   (4) A communications undertaking on whom the obligation to publish a reference offer has been imposed, is required to publish the reference offer on its website or, in the absence thereof, in any other reasonable manner and submit a copy of the access or interconnection agreement entered into to the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority at the request of the latter. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (5) If the reference offer specified in subsection 1 of this section does not conform to the objectives of the obligation to publish the reference offer, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority has the right to require that the communications undertaking amend the reference offer. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (6) A communications undertaking must submit a copy of an access or interconnection agreement entered into under the conditions different from those of the reference offer to the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (7) The composition of data of the reference offer for the access or interconnection service is established by a regulation of the minister in charge of the policy sector. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  § 54. Obligations on retail market of services on undertaking with significant market power   (1) If, as a result of a market analysis conducted in accordance with §§ 44 and 441of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority determines that a retail market defined pursuant to subsection 1  Electronic Communications Act Page 33 / 89    of § 43 of this Act is not effectively competitive and imposition of the obligation of access and interconnection provided in subsection 1 of § 50 on a communications undertaking does not ensure competition, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority imposes on the undertaking designated as having significant market power in the relevant service market one or more obligations provided in subsections 2 and 21of this section. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (2) On the basis provided for in subsection 1 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may require that an undertaking with significant market power avoid: [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]  1) applying excessively high prices;  2) preventing competitors from entering a market or restricting competition by applying excessively low prices;  3) showing undue preference to certain end-users;  4) linking the provided services to each other without reason such that, upon use of one service, a subscriber is also forced to use another service and pay for it.   (21) In addition to the obligation specified in subsection 2 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may establish a retail price cap, price control measures or measures to orient prices towards costs or prices on comparable markets in order to protect the interests of end-users and ensure efficient competition. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (3) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may impose obligations not listed in subsections 2 and 21of this section only pursuant to the procedure provided in subsection 8 of § 481of this Act. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (4) If obligations are imposed on an undertaking with significant market power pursuant to this section, the undertaking with significant market power must use the necessary and appropriate methodology of cost accounting. The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority has the right to determine the methodology of cost accounting and the reporting forms. [RT I 2007, 66, 408 – entry into force 01.01.2008]   (5) The performance of the obligations imposed on an undertaking with significant market power on the basis of this section is verified each year by the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority or, on the order of the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority, by a qualified independent person.

[RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (6) Without prejudice to §§ 74 and 79 of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority does not apply the obligations specified in subsections 2 and 21of this section to the geographical markets or retail markets where competition is present. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  § 55. Obligation to ensure functional separation on undertaking with significant market power   (1) If, as a result of market analysis conducted pursuant to §§ 43–442of this Act, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority concludes that the appropriate obligations imposed on the basis of §§ 51–53 have failed to achieve effective competition and that there are important and persisting competition problems or market failures identified in relation to the market of wholesale provision of certain access products, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may, as an exceptional measure, impose an obligation on vertically integrated undertakings to place activities related to the wholesale provision of relevant access products in an independently operating business entity. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]   (2) The independently operating business entity must supply access products and services to all undertakings, including to other business entities of the parent company, on the same timescales, terms and conditions, including those relating to price and service levels, and by means of the same systems and processes.

[RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  § 561. Co-investment in very high capacity communications network   (1) An undertaking with significant market power may propose to the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority in accordance with § 562of this Act that it assumes an obligation to offer communications undertakings an opportunity to co-invest in a new, very high capacity communications network that it opens for co-investment up to the base station or end-user premises. Such co-investment includes for example co- ownership or long-term risk sharing through co-financing or through purchase agreements giving rise to specific rights of a structural character for other communications undertakings.   (2) Upon assessing the commitment specified in subsection 1 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority proceeds from the following criteria:  1) the undertaking with significant market power provides access to the full capacity of the communications network on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the participation of each co-investor, the possibility of a co-investor to increase its participation in the future, and reciprocal rights awarded by the co-investors after the deployment of the co-invested infrastructure;  2) the undertaking makes the co-investment offer public in a timely manner and, where the communications undertaking does not comply with the conditions specified in clause 1 of § 563of this Act, at least six months before deployment of the new communications network;  3) communications undertakings not participating in the co-investment are provided with the same quality, speed, conditions and end-user reach as before the deployment of the new very high capacity communications network that is accompanied by a mechanism of adoption over time approved by the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority in light of developments on the related retail markets and that maintains the incentives to participate in the co-investment;  4) the co-investment offer is open to all communications undertakings over the lifetime of the network built under a co-investment offer on a non-discriminatory basis;  5) the undertaking designated as having significant market power may include in the offer reasonable conditions regarding the financial capacity of any undertaking, so that for instance potential co-investors need to demonstrate their ability to deliver phased payments on the basis of which the deployment is planned and to accept a strategic plan on the basis of which medium-term deployment plans are prepared;  6) the co-investment offer is published on the website of the undertaking with significant market power;  7) full detailed terms are made available without undue delay to any potential bidder that has expressed an interest, including the legal form of the co-investment agreement and, when relevant, the heads of term of the governance rules of the co-investment vehicle;  8) the procedure for making available specified in clause 7 of this subsection as well as the road map for the establishment and development of the co-investment project are established in advance and each potential co- investor is provided with an opportunity to present written explanations thereon and all significant milestones are clearly communicated to all communications undertakings without any discrimination;  9) all communications undertakings are provided with fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions upon joining the co-investment, including in terms of financial consideration required for the acquisition of specific rights, in terms of the protection awarded to the co-investors by those rights both during the building phase and during the exploitation phase, and in terms of the conditions for joining and potentially terminating the co-investment agreement;  10) the co-investment offer allows flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the commitment provided by each co-investor;  11) the determination of the financial consideration to be provided by each co-investor needs to reflect the fact that early investors accept greater risks and engage capital sooner;  12) a premium increasing over time is considered to be justified for commitments made at later stages and for new co-investors entering the co-investment after the commencement of the project;  13) the co-investment agreement allows the assignment of acquired rights by co-investors to other co-investors, or to third parties willing to enter into the co-investment agreement subject to the transferee undertaking being obliged to fulfil all original obligations of the transferor under the co-investment agreement;  14) the co-investment offer ensures a sustainable investment and meets all future needs by deploying new network elements that contribute to the deployment of very high capacity networks.   (3) In addition to the criteria specified in subsection 2 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may consider upon assessment any additional criteria to the extent they are necessary to  Page 36 / 89 Electronic Communications Act    ensure accessibility of potential investors to the co-investment, in light of specific local conditions and market structure.   (4) If the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority reaches a conclusion during the analysis specified in clauses 4–6 of § 562of this Act that the co-investment offer specified in subsection 1 of this section meets the criteria provided in subsections 2 and 3, it imposes the corresponding obligation on the undertaking with significant market power on the basis of subsections 7 and 8 of § 562of this Act and does not impose the obligations specified in clause 1 of subsection 2 of § 41 of this Act in respect of a new very high capacity communications network to which the obligations provided in this section apply if at least one potential co- investor has entered into a co-investment agreement with the undertaking designated as having significant market power.   (5) In addition to the obligation specified in subsection 4 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may, in justified circumstances, establish, maintain or change the obligations provided in §§ 50–52 of this Act in respect of new very high capacity networks if the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority establishes that, given the specific characteristics of the market, those competition problems cannot otherwise be addressed.   (6) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority monitors the performance of the obligation specified in subsection 4 of this section and may demand a statement concerning the performance of the obligation from the undertaking with significant market power once a year. [RT I, 15.12.2021, 1 – entry into force 01.02.2022]  § 562. Commitments procedure   (1) An undertaking with significant market power may propose to the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority the imposing of an obligation on its communications network regarding conditions for access, co-investment, or both.

(3) The proposal specified in subsection 1 of this section must also include the timing, scope and duration of performance of the obligation.   (4) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority conducts an analysis of the obligations and a public consultation with interested parties to assess the obligation specified in subsection 2 of this section unless the obligation is not related to the activities specified in subsection 2. The effective term of the obligation may exceed the term established for the conduct of the market analysis specified in subsection 1 of section § 442of this Act.   (5) Upon assessment of the proposal specified in subsection 1 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority takes into account, in particular:  1) the fair and reasonable character of the obligation;  2) the openness of the obligation to all market participants;  3) access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms;  4) the adequacy of the obligation to facilitate cooperative deployment of very high capacity networks and promote competition in the downstream retail market.   (6) As a result of the analysis specified in subsection 4 of this section, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority may amend the decision on designating an undertaking with significant market power granted on the basis of § 49 of this Act and make the obligations of subsection 1 of this section offered by a communications undertaking binding on it, taking account of the circumstance that the co-investment obligation must be effective at least seven years.   (7) Upon making the obligations binding, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority takes account of their impact on market developments and further relevance of the obligations provided in §§ 50–53 of this Act.   (8) The Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority monitors the performance of the obligations made binding in accordance with subsection 6 of this section and considers the extension of their term if necessary.

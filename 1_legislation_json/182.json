(3) Questions concerning matters governed by this Act which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which this Act is based.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions12 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  Application.   4. (1) Parts II or IV shall not apply to any rule of law requiring writing or signatures in any of the following matters —   (a) the creation of any legal instrument or document under any written law relating to Islamic law;   (b) the creation or execution of a will under any written law relating wills;   (c) negotiable instruments;   (d) the creation, performance or enforcement of an indenture, declaration of trust or power of attorney with the exception of constructive and resulting trusts;   (e) any contract for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in such property;   (f) the conveyance of immovable property or the transfer of any interest in such property;   (g) documents of title relating to immovable property.

Variation by agreement.   5. As between parties involved in generating, sending, receiving, storing or otherwise processing electronic records, any provision of Parts II or IV may be varied by agreement.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 132008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  PART II   ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES GENERALLY   Legal recognition of electronic records.   6. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record.   Requirement for writing.   7. Where any rule of law requires information to be written in writing to be presented in writing or provides for certain consequences if it is not, an electronic record satisfies that rule of law if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.   Electronic signatures.   8. (1) Where any rule of law requires a signature, or provides for certain consequences if a document is not signed, an electronic signature satisfies that rule of law.   (2) An electronic signature may be proved in any manner, including by showing that a procedure existed by which it is necessary for a party, in order to proceed further with a transaction, to have executed a symbol or security procedure for the purpose of verifying that an electronic record is that of such party.   Retention of electronic records.   9. (1) Where any rule of law requires that certain documents, records or information be retained, that requirement is satisfied by retaining them in the form of electronic records if the following conditions are satisfied —   (a) the information contained therein remains accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;   (b) the electronic record is retained in the format in which it was originally generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately the information originally generated, sent or received;     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions14 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  (c) such information, if any, as enables the identification of the origin and destination of an electronic record and the date and time when it was sent or received, is retained; and   (d) the consent of the department or ministry of the Government, organ of State, or the statutory corporation which has supervision over the requirement for the retention of such records has been obtained.   (2) An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with subsection (1)(c) shall not extend to any information necessarily and automatically generated solely for the purpose of enabling a record to be sent or received.   (3) A person may satisfy the requirement referred to in subsection (1) by using the services of any other person, if the conditions in subsections (1)(a) to (d) are complied with.   (4) Nothing in this section shall —   (a) apply to any rule of law which expressly provides for the retention of documents, records or information in the form of electronic records;   (b) preclude any department or ministry of the Government, organ of State or a statutory corporation from specifying additional requirements for the retention of electronic records that are subject to the jurisdiction of such department, ministry, organ of State or statutory corporation.   PART III   LIABILITY OF NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS   Liability of network service providers.   10. (1) A network service provider shall not be subject to any civil or criminal liability under any rule of law in respect of third-party material in the form of electronic records to which he merely provides access if such liability is founded on —   (a) the making, publication, dissemination or distribution of such materials or any statement made in such material; or     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 152008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  (b) the infringement of any rights subsisting in or in relation to such material.   (2) Nothing in this section shall affect —   (a) any obligation founded on contract;   (b) the obligation of a network service provider as such under a licensing or other regulatory regime established under any written law; or   (c) any obligation imposed under any written law or by a court to remove, block or deny access to any material.   (3) For the purposes of this section —   “providing access”, in relation to third-party material, means the provision of the necessary technical means by which third-party material may be accessed and includes the automatic and temporary storage of the third-party material for the purpose of providing access;   “third-party”, in relation to a network service provider, means a person over whom the provider has no effective control.   PART IV   ELECTRONIC CONTRACTS   Formation and validity.   11. (1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that in the context of the formation of contracts, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of electronic records.  (2) Where an electronic record is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that an electronic record was used for that purpose.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions16 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  Effectiveness between parties.   12. As between the originator and the addressee of an electronic record, a declaration of intent or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record.   Attribution.   13. (1) An electronic record is that of the originator if it was sent by the originator himself.   (2) As between the originator and the addressee, an electronic record is deemed to be that of the originator if it was sent —   (a) by a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that electronic record; or   (b) by an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically.   (3) As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard an electronic record as being that of the originator and to act on that assumption if —   (a) in order to ascertain whether the electronic record was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or   (b) the data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify electronic records as its own.   (4) Subsection (3) shall not apply —   (a) from the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the electronic record is not that of the originator and had reasonable time to act accordingly;   (b) in a case within subsection (3)(b), at any time when the addressee knew or ought to have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the electronic record was not that of the originator; or     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 172008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  (c) if in all the circumstances of the case, it is unconscionable for the addressee to regard the electronic record as that of the originator or to act on that assumption.   (5) Where an electronic record is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the electronic record received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption.   (6) The addressee is not so entitled when the addressee knew or should have known, had the addressee exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the electronic record as received.   (7) The addressee is entitled to regard each electronic record received as a separate electronic record and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that the addressee duplicates another electronic record and the addressee knew or should have known, had the addressee exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the electronic record was a duplicate.   (8) Nothing in this section shall affect the law of agency or the law on the formation of contracts.   Acknowledgement of receipt.   14. (1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) shall apply where, on or before sending an electronic record, or by means of that electronic record, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the electronic record be acknowledged.   (2) Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by —   (a) any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or   (b) any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the electronic record has been received.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions18 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  (3) Where the originator has stated that the electronic record is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the electronic record shall be treated as though it had never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received.   (4) Where the originator has not stated that the electronic record is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time, specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed within a reasonable time, the originator —   (a) may give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and   (b) if the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in paragraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the electronic record as though it has never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have.   (5) Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the related electronic record was received by the addressee, but that presumption does not imply that the content of the electronic record corresponds to the content of the record received.   (6) Where the received acknowledgement states that the related electronic record meets technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that those requirements have been met.   (7) Except in so far as it relates to the sending or receipt of the electronic record, this Part is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that electronic record or from the acknowledgement of its receipt.   Time and place of dispatch and receipt.   15. (1) Unless otherwise agreed to between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of an electronic record occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or the person who sent the electronic record on behalf of the originator.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 192008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  (2) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of an electronic record is determined as follows —   (a) if the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving electronic records, receipt occurs —  (i) at the time when the electronic record enters the designated information system; or   (ii) if the electronic record is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the electronic record is retrieved by the addressee;   (b) if the addressee has not designated such an information system, receipt occurs when the electronic record enters an information system of the addressee.   (3) Subsection (2) shall apply notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the electronic record is deemed to be received under subsection (4).   (4) Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, an electronic record is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business.   (5) For the purposes of this section —   (a) if the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business;   (b) if the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to the usual place of residence; and   (c) “usual place of residence” in relation to a body corporate, means the place where it is incorporated or otherwise legally constituted.   (6) This section shall not apply to such circumstances as the Minister may by regulations prescribe.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions20 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  PART V   SECURE ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES   Secure electronic record.   16. (1) If a prescribed security procedure or a commercially reasonable security procedure agreed to by the parties involved has been properly applied to an electronic record to verify that the electronic record has not been altered since a specified point in time, such record shall be treated as a secure electronic record from such specified point in time to the time of verification.   (2) For the purposes of this section and of section 17, whether a security procedure is commercially reasonable shall be determined having regard to the purposes of the procedure and the commercial circumstances at the time the procedure was used, including —   (a) the nature of the transaction;   (b) the sophistication of the parties;   (c) the volume of similar transactions engaged in by either or all parties;   (d) the availability of alternatives offered to but rejected by any party;   (e) the cost of alternative procedures; and   (f) the procedures in general use for similar types of transactions.   Secure electronic signature.   17. If, through the application of a prescribed security procedure or a commercially reasonable security procedure agreed to by the parties involved, it can be verified that all electronic signature was, at the time it was made —   (a) unique to the person using it;   (b) capable of identifying such person;     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 212008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  (c) created in a manner or using a means under the sole control of the person using it; and   (d) linked to the electronic record to which it relates in a manner such that if the record was changed the electronic signature would be invalidated,   such signature shall be treated as a secure electronic signature.   Presumptions relating to secure electronic records and signatures.   18. (1) In any proceedings involving a secure electronic record, it shall be presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the secure electronic record has not been altered since the specific point in time to which the secure status relates.   (2) In any proceedings involving a secure electronic signature, it shall be presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that —   (a) the secure electronic signature is the signature of the person with whom it correlates; and   (b) the secure electronic signature was affixed by that person with the intention of signing or approving the electronic record.   (3) In the absence of a secure electronic record or a secure electronic signature, nothing in this Part shall create any presumption relating to the authenticity and integrity of the electronic record or an electronic signature.   (4) For the purposes of this section —   “secure electronic record” means an electronic record treated as a secure electronic record by virtue of sections 16 or 19;   “secure electronic signature” means an electronic signature treated as a secure electronic signature by virtue of sections 17 or 20.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions22 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  PART VI   EFFECT OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES   Secure electronic record with digital signature.   19. The portion of an electronic record that is signed with a digital signature shall be treated as a secure electronic record if the digital signature is a secure electronic signature by virtue of section 20.   Secure digital signature.   20. When any portion of an electronic record is signed with a digital signature, the digital signature shall be treated as a secure electronic signature with respect to such portion of the record if —   (a) the digital signature was created during the operational period of a valid certificate and is verified by reference to the public key listed in such certificate; and   (b) the certificate is considered trustworthy, in that it is an accurate binding of a public key to a person’s identity because —  (i) the certificate was issued by a licensed certification authority operating in compliance with the regulations made under section 42;  (ii) the certificate was issued by a certification authority outside Brunei Darussalam recognised for this purpose by the Controller pursuant to requirements made under section 43;   (iii) the certificate was issued by a department or ministry of the Government, an organ of State or a statutory body or corporation approved by the Minister to act as a certification authority on such conditions as he may by regulations impose or specify; or   (iv) the parties have expressly agreed between themselves (sender and recipient) to use digital signatures as a security procedure, and the digital signature was properly verified by reference to the sender’s public key.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 232008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  Presumptions regarding certificates.   21. It shall be presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the information listed in a certificate issued by a licensed certification authority is correct, except for information identified as subscriber information which has not been verified, if the certificate was accepted by the subscriber.   Unreliable digital signatures.   22. Unless otherwise provided by any rule of law or by contract, a person relying on a digitally signed electronic record assumes the risk that the digital signature is invalid as a signature or authentication of the signed electronic record, if reliance on the digital signature is not reasonable under the circumstances having regard to the following factors —   (a) facts which the person relying on the digitally signed electronic record knows or has notice of, including all facts listed in the certificate or incorporated in it by reference;   (b) the value or importance of the digitally signed record, if known;   (c) the course of dealing between the person relying on the digitally signed electronic record and the subscriber and any available indicia of reliability or unreliability apart from the digital signature; and   (d) usage of trade, particularly trade conducted by trustworthy systems or other electronic means.   PART VII   GENERAL DUTIES RELATING TO DIGITAL SIGNATURES   Reliance on certificates forseeable.   23. It is foreseeable that persons relying on a digital signature will also rely on a valid certificate containing the public key by which the digital signature can be verified.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions24 2008 Ed.CAP. 196  Prerequisites to publication of certificate.   24. No person shall publish a certificate or otherwise make it available to a person known by that first-mentioned person to be in a position to rely on the certificate or on a digital signature that is verifiable with reference to a public key listed in the certificate, if that first-mentioned person knows that —   (a) the certification authority listed in the certificate has not issued it;   (b) the subscriber listed in the certificate has not accepted it; or   (c) the certificate has been revoked or suspended, unless such publication is for the purpose of verifying a digital signature created prior to such suspension or revocation.   Publication for fraudulent purpose.   25. Any person who knowingly creates, publishes or otherwise makes available a certificate for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.   False or unauthorised request.   26. Any person who knowingly misrepresents to a certification authority his identity or authorisation for the purpose of requesting for a certificate or for suspension or revocation of a certificate shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.   PART VIII   DUTIES OF CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES   Trustworthy system.   27. A certification authority must utilise trustworthy systems in performing its services.     LAWS OF BRUNEI  Electronic Transactions 252008 Ed. CAP. 196  B.L.R.O. 4/2008  Disclosure.   28. (1) A certification authority shall disclose —   (a) its certificate that contains the public key corresponding to the private key used by that certification authority to digitally sign another certificate (referred to in this section as a certification authority certificate);   (b) any relevant certification practice statement;   (c) notice of the revocation or suspension of its certification authority certificate; and   (d) any other fact that materially and adversely affects either the reliability of a certificate that the authority has issued or the authority’s ability to perform its services.

EXPLANATORY NOTE  (This note is not part of the Regulations)  These Regulations implement Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (OJ No L194, 19.7.2016, p1). Part 2 of these Regulations provides a national framework for the security of network and information systems in the United Kingdom (“UK”). Under regulation 2, a Minister of the Crown must designate and publish a “national strategy” covering the sectors specified in column 1 of the table in Schedule 1 (“the relevant sectors”) and digital services. Regulation 3(1) designates national competent authorities, specified in column 3 of the table in Schedule 1, for the subsectors specified in column 2 of that table. Regulation 3(2) designates the Information Commissioner as the national competent authority for relevant digital service providers (“RDSPs”). The national competent authorities designated under regulation 3(1) and (2) (referred to as “NIS enforcement authorities”) are required to carry out the duties mentioned in regulation 3(3), (4) and (6). Regulation 4 designates the ‘single point of contact’ (“SPOC”) for the UK and regulation 5 designates the UK’s computer security incident response team for the relevant sectors and RDSPs. Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision regarding the designation of operators of essential services and the duties which apply to them. Under regulation 8, a person is identified as an operator of an essential service (an “OES”) by virtue of either falling within regulation 8(1) or (3). A person is deemed to be an OES under regulation 8(1) if they provide an essential service of kind specified in paragraphs 1 to 9 of Schedule 2 which also satisfies the threshold requirements specified for that kind of essential service. A person may be designated by a competent authority as an OES if they meet the conditions mentioned in regulation 8(3)(a) to (c). The deemed designation of an OES under regulation 8(1), or designation of an OES under regulation 8(3), may be revoked by a competent authority under regulation 9. An OES must fulfil the security duties set out in regulation 10 and the duty to notify incidents set out in regulation 11.  38    Document Generated: 2022-06-22 Status: This is the original version (as it was originally made).

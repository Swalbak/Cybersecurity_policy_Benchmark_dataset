Art.1 No person shall be punished without being convicted of conduct which is   punishable according to law or can be regarded as fully equivalent to conduct that   is considered an offence according to law.    [Sanctions under Chapter VII of this Act may not be applied unless they are   prescribed in the sources referred to in the first paragraph of this Article.]1)    1)L. 31/1961, 1. gr.    Art. 2 Where penal legislation is amended between the commission of a deed   and the delivery of judgment, the case shall be judged according to the newer   legislation, both as regards the criminality of the deed and the punishment. At no   time, however, may punishment be imposed unless it was authorised in law at the   time when the deed was committed; nor may a more severe punishment be imposed   than would have been imposed under that law. If penal provisions in law have   ceased to apply for reasons that do not indicate a change in the legislature’s   assessment of the criminality of the deed, the case shall be judged according to the   law applying when the offence was committed.    If the criminality of a deed ceases to apply for reasons other than those described   in the preceding paragraph, punishment imposed for the deed shall be waived, to   the extent that it has not already been enforced. In addition, other consequences of   the deed entailed by its criminality under the older law shall be waived, with the   exception of the obligation to pay legal costs. The question of whether punishment   imposed is to be waived or reduced in cases where the judgment also covered other   offences may be referred to the court which judged the case at the district court   level, or to a court in the party’s venue. Appeals may be lodged against conclusions   by district courts.    [Art. 2a Sanctions for the offences referred to in Chapter VII of this Act may not   be applied unless they were prescribed in the sources listed in the first paragraph of   this article at the time of the offence, and the principles of Article 2 shall be   observed when they are determined.]1)    1)L. 31/1961, 2. gr.    Art. 3 When criminal legislation makes repetition of an offence entail a heavier   punishment, or other sanctions, a sentence under older law shall have this iterative   effect in accordance with its wording as if it had been imposed according to the   newer law    Art. 4 Punishment shall be imposed under the Icelandic Penal Code as follows:    1. For offences committed within the Icelandic state. If the offence is committed   by a person employed, or by a passenger, on board a foreign ship or aircraft   travelling within Icelandic jurisdiction against someone travelling with the craft, or   against interests closely associated with the craft, then punishment shall only be   imposed in Iceland if [the minister]1) orders an investigation and prosecution.    2. For offences committed on board Icelandic ships or aircraft, irrespective of   where they were at the time. If the offence was committed in a place covered by the        criminal jurisdiction of another state under international law, and by a person who   was neither a permanent employee nor a passenger on the craft, then punishment   shall nevertheless only be imposed in Iceland if this is provided for under Article 5   or 6.

If the offence was committed in a place outside the criminal jurisdiction of   other states under international law, provided that it was also punishable at the time   under the law of the defendant’s home state.    2. If the offence was committed in a place under the criminal jurisdiction of   another state under International law, provided it was also punishable at the time   under the law of that state.    [The provisions of the first paragraph may be applied to deeds by a person who is   a citizen of Denmark, Finland, Norway or Sweden, or is domiciled there, and who   is resident in Iceland.]1)    [In the instances covered in item 2 of the first paragraph, punishment shall be   imposed under the Icelandic Penal Code for offences committed by a person who   was an Icelandic citizen, or was domiciled in Iceland, at the time of the deed, which   are covered by [Article 194, the second, third or fourth paragraph of Article 206,   the first paragraph of Article 210 b, the second paragraph of Article 216, Article   218 a, the second paragraph of Article 225]2) and item 2 of the first paragraph of   Article 227 a, and were committed abroad even if the deed is not considered a   punishable offence under the laws of the state involved.

General conditions for punishment.    Art. 12 An act committed as an emergency defence measure shall not be   punishable to the extent that it was necessary in defence against, or to avert, an   unlawful attack that was already initiated or was imminent, provided that the   defensive measures taken were not obviously more dangerous than were warranted   by the attack and the injury or damage it could be expected to cause.    A person who has exceeded the limits of permitted emergency defence as a   result of having been so frightened or startled that he or she could not exercise full   restraint, shall not be punished.    Art. 13 Any act that was necessary in order to protect lawful interests against   imminent danger shall not be punishable, even if it led to the abridgement of other   interests that must be regarded as considerably smaller.    Art. 14 No person shall be punished for a deed committed before he or she   attained the age of 15 years.    Art. 15 Persons who, due to mental illness, mental retardation or degeneration,   diminished cognition or another comparable condition were completely incapable   of controlling their actions at the time of the commission of the deed shall not be   punished.    Art. 16 If the perpetrator of a deed had impaired mental capacity due, for   example, to retardation, degeneration, abnormal sexual development or other   disturbance, this condition not being as pronounced as is described in Article 15, he   or she shall be punished for the offence if, as appropriate and after medical opinion   has been obtained, it is reasonable to consider that punishment will produce results.    If an institution intended for persons such as those mentioned in this Article is   established, it may be stated in the sentence that the offender is to serve his or her   [sentence]1) in that institution.    1)L. 82/1998, 1. gr.    Art. 17 Punishment shall be imposed even though the offence was committed   while the perpetrator was drunk or under the influence of other intoxicants. In cases   of complete lack of self-awareness, however, punishment shall not be imposed   unless the accused knew in advance, or had full reason to be aware, that he would   commit the offence while under the influence, or that the offence would follow   from his or her being in that condition.    Art. 18 Deeds for which punishments are prescribed in this Act are not   punishable unless they are committed by intent or through negligence. Punishment   shall only be imposed for offences committed through negligence if special   authorisation for this is made in this Act.       Art. 19 If the criminality of a deed, or aggravation of the punishment for it, is   made contingent in this Act on its having specific consequences, then this condition   shall not be considered met unless the consequences, at least, may be attributed to   the defendant’s negligence, or the fact that the defendant made no effort to avert as   far as possible the danger that the deed entailed when he or she became aware of it.

For an attempted offence, a more lenient punishment may be imposed than for a           completed offence. This shall, in particular, be done in cases where the attempt   indicates that the offender is less dangerous and his/her resolution not as firm as   that of persons who bring such offences to completion.    If, in terms of the interests targeted or the act itself, the attempt could not have   resulted in the offence being brought to completion, it may be decided that   punishment is to be waived.    Art. 21 Punishment for an attempted offence shall be waived if the person guilty   of it abandons, of his or her own accord, the decision to commit the offence before   it is brought to completion, providing its commission was not aborted or   obstructions or other accidental circumstances did not prevent the attainment of the   intended result   and, assuming that the perpetrator, through his or her action, caused or believed he   or she had caused, a danger that the offence would be brought to completion, he or   she moreover prevented this, or took measures which would have prevented it, if   the completion of the offence had not been hindered in another manner, without his   or her knowledge, or been impossible.    Art. 22 Any person who, by assisting in word or deed, through persuasion,   encouragement or in any other manner, contributes to the commission of an offence   under this Act shall incur the punishment prescribed for the offence.    If the share of a contributor to the offence is minor, or if it consists of   strengthening another person’s resolve that has already been formed, and if the   offence is not brought to completion or if the intended participation in it is   unsuccessful, the contributor may be sentenced to a more lenient punishment than   is prescribed in law for the offence.    Under the circumstances described in the second paragraph, and also if a person   has chanced by negligence to participate in an offence, punishment may be waived   if the offence falls under a punitive provision in which the prescribed punishment is   not greater than [up to one year’s imprisonment].1)    If the offence is brought to completion, a person who provides the actual   perpetrator or another person with assistance in maintaining an unlawful situation   that has come into being as a result of the offence, or who derives profit from it,   shall be punished according to the provisions of this Article providing that his or   her actions are not covered by other provisions in law.    1)L. 82/1998, 2. gr.    Art. 23 An accessory to an offence shall not be punished if he or she averts an   offence or takes measures in the way described in Article 21 that would have   prevented it had its realisation not, without his or her knowing, been aborted in   another manner, failed or been impossible.

Liens on items that are confiscated may only be lifted in accordance with the   decision of a court in cases where the lien-holder is not in good faith.    If any of the persons named in the first and second paragraphs takes measures,   after the commission of the offence, regarding ownership or lien rights on gains or   items that are to be confiscated, the gains or items may be confiscated from a third   party if he or she was aware of the connection between the gains or items and the   offence or has demonstrated gross negligence in that regard.

Where the identity of the offender, or that of the lien-holder, is not known,   confiscation may be effected by a court judgment without any person being   indicted.

Factors influencing the severity of punishment.    Art. 70 When punishment is decided, the following factors, in particular, are to   be considered.    1. The importance of the object of the offence.    2. The extent of the damage or loss caused.    3. How much of a threat the action posed, particularly when consideration is   given to when, where and how it was carried out.    4. The age of the perpetrator.    5. The perpetrator’s former conduct.    6. The strength and degree of the perpetrator’s resolve.    7. The perpetrator’s motive.    8. The perpetrator’s conduct after committing the offence.    [9. Whether he gave, on his own initiative, assistance or information that was of   substantial significance for the establishment of his offence, the participation of   other persons in the offence or other offences]1)    Where more than one person collaborated in the commission of the offence, this   shall normally be considered as aggravating the punishment.    [If the action was directed against a man, woman or child closely related to the   perpetrator, and the relationship between them is considered as having aggravated   the seriousness of the offence, this shall normally be considered as aggravating the   punishment.]2)    1)L. 47/2015, 1. gr. a 2)L. 27/2006, 1. gr.    Art. 71 When the law provides for, or permits, a more severe punishment or   other sanction in the event of a repeated offence, such provision may not be applied   unless, prior to the commission of the latter offence, the offender was convicted of   an offence or punished in Iceland for an offence which has an iterative effect on the          latter offence, or for an attempted offence or acting as an accessory to such an   offence, and in addition must have attained the age of 18 when he or she committed   the former offence.    The courts may allow sentences passed abroad to have an iterative effect as if   they had been passed in Iceland.    Iterative effects shall cease to apply when 5 years have elapsed since the   perpetrator served his or her former sentence, or since it expired or was lifted,   before the commission of the latter offence. If the former punishment took the form   of a fine, the period shall be counted as running from the date on which final   judgment was delivered or the perpetrator agreed to pay the fine.    Art. 72 Where a person has become an habitual offender, committing one or   more types of crime, or commits crimes on a professional basis, punishment may   be increased by the addition of up to one half. If this is repeated, the punishment   may be doubled.    Art. 73 Where prisoners serving sentences or held in remand for other reasons   commit offences against Articles 106., …1) 126, 127, 164, 211, 217, 218, 225, 226,   233 or the second paragraph of Article 257, then when punishment is determined,   the maximum prescribed under the aforementioned provisions may be exceeded,   though not beyond a doubling of the sentence. In such cases, more lenient   punishment than [imprisonment].2) may not be imposed. …2)    The provisions of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph may also be   applied when the offence mentioned there is committed by a former prison convict   against the superiors or staff of the penal institution where he or she was held, or   when the offence is directed against the institution or its property, and also when a   former prison convict commits an offence against the provisions of Article 111   involving prisoners serving sentences in the penal institution in which he or she   was held.    If a person who has been sentenced to life imprisonment and has not been   pardoned commits a new offence inside or outside the prison, it shall be determined   in a judgment what punishment would have been imposed if the previous   punishment had not been life imprisonment. In addition, the court may impose a   sanction under Article 47, even though the sentence period under item 3 of that   article may be doubled.    1)L. 71/1995, 1. gr. 2)L. 82/1998, 14. gr.    Art. 74 The punishment prescribed in law for an offence may be reduced to   below the minimum specified under the following circumstances.    1. When someone has exceeded the limits of an emergency defence measure or   emergency action.    2. When the offence was committed by a person who at the time had not reached       the age of 18 and it may be argued that in view of his or her youth, full punishment   would not be necessary or would be harmful. In no case may the punishment   imposed for offences committed by persons under this age exceed 8 years’   imprisonment.    3. If the perpetrator believed that the deed he or she committed did not constitute   a violation of the law, this being either due to excusable ignorance of the law or a   misunderstanding of the legal provisions prohibiting the commission of the action.    4. Where someone has committed an offence in extreme anger or in great mental   agitation aroused by the offended party through an unlawful attack or grave insult.    5. Where someone is persuaded to commit an offence due to dependence on   another person.    6. Where someone is compelled to commit an offence, though the compulsion is   not of such a nature as to make the action completely non-punishable.    7. Where the perpetrator, acting on his or her own initiative, averted the danger   that it involved.    8. Where the perpetrator, acting on his or her own initiative, made full   compensation for the damage or loss that resulted from it, and also where he or she   made great efforts to prevent the harmful consequences of the offence, or made all   efforts within his or her power to remedy the damage or loss.    9. Where the perpetrator, acting on his or her own initiative, reports the offence   and gives a full account of all the circumstances relating to it [or gives, on his or   her own initiative, assistance or information that is of substantial significance for   the establishment of his offence, the participation of other persons in the offence or   other offences.]1)   L. 47/2015, 1. gr. b.    Under the circumstances covered in items 1-8 it may be decided that punishment   is to be waived in full.    Art. 75 If a person commits an offence in extreme mental excitement, or due to   an otherwise temporary state of mental imbalance, or if other circumstances are   such that the action is not considered as punishable as is generally the case with   offences of the same type, then punishment may be reduced and even, if the offence   is not punishable by a more severe punishment than [up to 1 year’s   imprisonment],1) waived. If the perpetrator put himself or herself into the condition   described through the consumption of alcohol, the application of this provision may   only be considered if there are extenuating circumstances and the perpetrator has   not previously been convicted of an offence of the same, or similar, type or of an   offence against the first or second paragraph of Article 123.    …2)    1)L. 82/1998, 15. gr. 2)L. 22/1955, 9. gr.         Art. 76 Where the offender was held in detention and this is not on account of his   or her conduct during the prosecution of the case or its investigation, it shall be   decided in the judgment that all or part of the detention period shall take the place   of punishment    Art. 77 If, while the same case is being heard, a person is found guilty of the   commission of more than one offence, punishment for them shall be determined   jointly in one sentence in such a way that they will both or all be covered; if life   imprisonment is the punishment prescribed for the most serious offence then no   further punishments shall be imposed for the others.    Punishment shall normally be determined within the limits laid down in the penal   provision covering the offences; if they are not all covered by the same penal   provision, then within the limits laid down by the penal provision specifying the   most serious punishment. Nevertheless, according to the circumstances of the case,   the punishment may be aggravated by the addition of up to one half of it. However,   the courts may, in cases when a person is sentenced at the same time for a serious   offence and another which is relatively trivial, apply even the lightest punishment   prescribed for the more serious offence.    …1)    If sentence is passed at the same time covering two or more offences, one or   some of which are punishable by [imprisonment],1) and the others by fines, then the   court may impose both fines and [imprisonment].1)    1)L. 82/1998, 16. gr.    Art. 78 If someone who has been sentenced for one or more offences is   convicted of having committed other offences before being sentenced, an additional   punishment shall be imposed corresponding to the aggravation of punishment that   would have been imposed if sentence had been passed in respect of all the offences   in the former case.

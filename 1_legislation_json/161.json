Requirement to Hold Licence  (1) No person shall:  (a) provide a telecommunications service to the public for direct or indirect  compensation; or  (b) own or operate a telecommunications network used to provide a  telecommunications service to the public for direct or indirect compensation,               except under and in accordance with a licence or an exemption order issued by the  LTA.  (2) For the purposes of this Act, the provision of telecommunications services to the public  includes the provision or offering of such a service to any segment of the public, including  the resale of telecommunications services obtained from another person, even if only one  person is provided or offered such a service.  (3) All telecommunications services and telecommunications networks other than those  described in Section 15 (1) and 15 (2) may be provided with a licence or permit issued by the  LTA.  16. General Provisions Related to Licences  (1) The LTA shall determine the terms, conditions, procedures and criteria for granting  telecommunications licences, in accordance with this Act and any related regulations, rules,  orders or notices.  (2) The LTA may issue regulations, rules, orders or notices clarifying the requirements of  telecommunications licensing from time to time.  (3) Licences shall be issued by the LTA, and shall be signed by a simple majority of the  Commissioners or another representative of the LTA to whom authority has been delegated  in accordance with the bylaws or operating rules adopted by the Commission from time to  time.  (4) A licence is a unilateral grant of permission from the LTA to provide a telecommunications  service or operate a telecommunications network, and shall not be regarded as a contract or  bilateral agreement.  (5) Licences shall be in writing, and the LTA shall make copies of them available for inspection  by the public.  (6) In all circumstances where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly  available by the LTA:  (a) the applicable licensing procedures and licensing criteria; and  (b) the time periods within which the LTA is expected to assess applications,  notify applicants and reach any related decision.      (7) If a license application is denied, the reasons for denial shall be provided in writing by the  LTA.  (8) Licences for service providers that provide substantially the same telecommunications  services or own or operate substantially the same telecommunications networks shall not  unfairly discriminate between such licensees.           (9) The LTA shall retain at least one copy of each application and copies of all correspondence  and decisions regarding the application, and shall make them available to the public upon  reasonable request.  17. Exemption Orders  (1) The LTA may issue an order (an “exemption order”) exempting specified activities or classes  of persons from the requirement to hold a licence.  (2) An exemption order may be made subject to such conditions as the LTA deems necessary  and that are consistent with this Act and any applicable regulations and rules.  18. Types of Licences  (1) The LTA may issue two types of licences:  (a) individual licences; and  (b) class licences.      (2) The LTA shall specify which types of telecommunications services require individual  licences, and which types of telecommunications services require class licences. The  specification of licence types shall be included in a regulation, rule, order or notice issued by  the LTA pursuant to Section 16 (2).  19. Licensing Procedures and Conditions  (1) The procedures for issuing licences, including applicable licence terms and conditions, shall  be transparent, fair and objective.  (2) Once established, licence procedures and conditions shall be published by the LTA in  accordance with Section 11 (5).  (3) It is a long-term objective to regulate licensees using rules of general application rather than  conditions of individual licences. The LTA may seek to amend licences from time to time to  achieve this objective.  20. Changes to Licences  (1) The LTA may amend, modify, suspend or revoke a licence (a licence “change”) if:  (a) the change has been requested or agreed to by the licensee;  (b) the licensee has been in breach of a material licence condition, this Act, a  regulation, rule or order;  (c) changes to international treaties, commitments, recommendations, standards  or the laws of Liberia require the change; or               (d) the LTA decides that the change is required to implement this Act in a  manner consistent with the objectives listed in Section 3.      (2) Prior to implementing a licence change pursuant to this Section, the LTA shall notify the  licensee in writing that it is considering the change, and consider any comments made by the  licensee in a timely manner. The notice:  (a) shall give the licensee sufficient time to prepare comments on the identified  change;  (b) shall set out any procedures the LTA will use in considering the change; and  (c) may invite comments from other interested parties or the general public.      (3) If the LTA implements a licence change pursuant to this Section, it shall provide the licensee  with sufficient time to implement any other changes needed to comply with the licence  change.  (4) The LTA shall not suspend or revoke a licence without giving the licensee sufficient time to  remedy any breach or misconduct that is the basis for the revocation.  (5) Where a licence is suspended, revoked or not renewed, the LTA shall take into account  continuity of service to customers and include in its order such terms and conditions as it  deems appropriate.  21. Term and Renewal  (1) The term of a licence shall be stated in the licence.  (2) Upon application for renewal by a licensee, and except as otherwise determined by the LTA  pursuant to Section 21 (3), a licence shall be renewed by the LTA on substantially the same  conditions.  (3) The LTA may renew a licence on new conditions or deny the renewal of a licence if:  (a) the licensee has been in breach of one or more material licence conditions,  this Act, a regulation, a rule or an order;  (b) changes to international treaties, commitments, recommendations, standards  or the laws of Liberia require a renewal on new conditions or the denial of a  renewal; or  (c) the LTA decides that a renewal on new conditions or the denial of a renewal  are required to implement this Act in a manner consistent with the objectives  listed in Section 3.                     PART V  UNIVERSAL ACCESS  22.

(2) In proposing a universal access policy, and in any implementation of that policy once  approved by the Minister, the LTA shall consider:  (a) the objectives for the development of universal access;  (b) the basic telecommunications services to be included in universal access  offerings;  (c) the geographical areas in which specified levels of universal access should be  achieved; and  (d) the costs of the universal access service obligations.      (3) In implementing a universal access policy approved by the Minister the LTA shall also  ensure that any universal access obligations of service providers:  (a) are administered in a legally transparent, non-discriminatory and  competitively neutral manner; and  (b) are not more burdensome than necessary for the universal access objectives  to be achieved.      (4) The LTA shall consult with service providers and other interested parties when preparing a  universal access policy.  23. Universal Access Fund  (1) Following approval of a universal access policy the Minister may approve a regulation  prepared by the LTA to establish a Universal Access Fund to be used to subsidize, in whole  or in part, the net costs of providing universal access.  (2) An account called the Universal Access Fund shall be established as an “Escrow Account” in  a registered and recognized bank in Liberia. Any disbursement from the Universal Access  Account shall be in line with the Universal Access Policy and shall meet the approval of the  Legislature.  (3) Operation of the Universal Access Fund shall be subject to specific reporting, accounting and  audit requirements established by the Ministry of Finance; and to include budget approval  process to the Legislature established by other laws.

Abuse of Dominance  Dominant service providers are prohibited from undertaking activities or actions that  abuse their dominant position. The following types of actions and activities shall be  considered an abuse of dominant position:      (a) failing to supply essential facilities to a competitor within a reasonable time  after a request and on reasonable conditions, or discriminating in the  provision of interconnection or other telecommunications services or  facilities to other service providers; except under circumstances that are  objectively justified based on differences in supply conditions, including  different costs or a shortage of available facilities or resources;  (b) bundling of telecommunications services, whereby the service provider  requires, as a condition of supplying a service to a competitor, that the  competitor acquire another service that it does not require;  (c) offering a competitor more favourable terms or conditions that are not  justified by cost differences if it acquires another service that it does not  require;  (d) pre-emptively acquiring or securing scarce facilities or resources, including  rights of way, required by another service provider for the operation of its  business, with the effect of denying the use of the facilities or resources to the  other service provider;  (e) supplying competitive telecommunications services at prices below long run  average incremental costs or such other cost standard as is established by the  LTA;  (f) using revenues or the allocation of costs from one telecommunications  service to cross-subsidize a competitive telecommunications service with the  objective of lessening competition, except where such cross subsidy is  specifically approved by order of the LTA or by approval of tariffs for  relevant telecommunications services;  (g) failing to comply with the interconnection obligations of a dominant service  provider that are specified in Part VIII of this Act;               (h) performing any of the following actions, where such actions have the effect  of impeding or preventing the competitor’s entry into, or expansion in, a  market:  i) deliberately reducing the margin of profit available to a competitor  that requires wholesale telecommunications services from the  dominant service provider, by increasing the prices for the wholesale  telecommunications services required by that competitor, or  decreasing the prices of the retail telecommunications services in  markets where they compete, or both;  ii) requiring or inducing a supplier to refrain from selling to a  competitor;  iii) adopting technical specifications for networks or systems to  deliberately prevent interoperability with a network or system of a  competitor;  iv) failing to make available to other service providers on a timely basis  technical specifications, information about essential facilities, or  other commercially relevant information which is required by such  other service providers to provide telecommunications services and  which is not available from other sources; and  v) using information obtained from competitors, for purposes related to  interconnection or supply of telecommunications services by the  dominant service provider, to compete with such competitors;      (i) any other action or activity engaged in by a dominant service provider that  the LTA determines in accordance with Section 29 to have the effect, or to be  likely to have the effect, of materially restricting or distorting competition in  a telecommunications market.      29. Other Anti-Competitive Practices  No person shall engage in a practice restricting or distorting competition in  telecommunications markets, including the following:      (a) arrangements between two or more service providers that directly or  indirectly fix the prices or other terms or conditions of telecommunications  service in telecommunications markets;  (b) arrangements between two or more service providers that directly or  indirectly determine which person will win a contract or business opportunity  in a telecommunications market; and               (c) arrangements between two or more service providers to apportion, share or  allocate telecommunications markets among themselves or other service  providers.      30. Determination of Abuse of Dominance and Anti-Competitive Practices  The LTA may, on application by any person, or on its own initiative, determine:      (a) whether or not the actions or activities of a dominant service provider  constitute an abuse of its dominant position, within the meaning of Section  28;  (b) whether or not the actions or activities of any service provider amount to an  anti-competitive practice within the meaning of Section 29; and  (c) that an action or activity of a service provider under Sections 28 or 29 are  authorized and shall not be considered to contravene this Act, on the grounds  that such actions or activities are in the public interest and are otherwise  consistent with the objectives set out in Section 3 of this Act.      31. Remedies for Abuse of Dominance and Anti-Competitive Practices  If the LTA determines that in a particular case, or in a number of cases, the actions or  activities of a service provider constitute an abuse of its dominant position or an anti-  competitive practice within the meaning of this Act, a regulation or rule, the LTA  may issue an order to:      (a) require one or more persons named in the order to take one or more of the  following actions:  i) cease the actions or activities specified in the order immediately, or at  such time prescribed in the order, and subject to such conditions  prescribed in the order; and  ii) make specific changes in actions or activities specified in the order,  as a means of eliminating or reducing the abusive or anti-competitive  impact;      (b) impose a fine for breach of this Act pursuant to Sections 77 and 79;  (c) require the service provider involved in the abusive actions or activities or  anti-competitive practices, and the persons affected by such actions, activities  or practices, to meet and attempt to determine remedies to prevent or  eliminate continuation of such actions, activities or practices, and to resolve  any remaining dispute;  (d) require the service provider responsible for the abusive or anti-competitive  actions or activities specified in the order to publish an acknowledgement and               apology for such actions, in such form and at such times as the LTA specifies  in the order; and  (e) require the service provider to provide periodic reports to the LTA to assist in  determining whether the actions or activities are continuing and to determine  their impact on telecommunications markets, competitors and customers.      32. Transfers of Control of Service Providers  (1) Subject to this Section, no approvals shall be required for the transfer of control of a  service provider.  (2) No transfer of control of a service provider shall be effected without the prior approval  of the LTA if:  (a) a dominant service provider, or an affiliate of a dominant service provider is:  i) the person ultimately acquiring control of the service provider; or  ii) the person whose control is being transferred; or      (b) as a result of the transfer, a person, alone or with its affiliates, would become  a dominant service provider according to any applicable criteria,  methodology or processes for the designation of dominant service providers  published by the LTA.      (3) No transfer of control that requires approval under Section 32 (2) shall be completed  or have any legal force or effect unless the person applying for approval of the transfer  has received written approval for the transfer from the LTA.  (4) Applications for transfers of control that require approval under Section 32 (2) shall  include detailed information on the proposed transfer transaction. Such information  shall, at a minimum, include:  (a) the identification of all persons involved in the transfer transaction, including  buyers and sellers, their shareholders and affiliated companies, and any other  persons that have a greater than five per cent (5%) ownership interest in all  such persons;  (b) a description of the nature of the transaction and a summary of its  commercial terms;  (c) financial information on the persons involved in the transaction, including  their annual revenues from telecommunications markets, identified by  specific markets, value of assets devoted to telecommunications business and  copies of any recent annual or quarterly financial reports; and                   (d) a description of the relevant telecommunications markets in which the  persons involved in the transaction operate.      (5) The LTA may request additional information regarding an application for a transfer of  control that requires approval under Section 32(2) at any time.  (6) Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a duly completed application for a transfer of  control that requires approval under Section 32(2), the LTA shall:  (a) approve the transfer of control without conditions;  (b) approve the transfer of control with such conditions as are reasonably related  to promoting the development of open and competitive telecommunications  markets in Liberia, and maximizing the benefits of the transaction for  telecommunications customers;  (c) deny the transfer of control; or  (d) issue a notice initiating an investigation of the proposed transfer of control,  and following such investigation it shall take one of the actions set out in  subsections (6) (a), (b) or (c).                    PART VIII  INTERCONNECTION  33. Functions and Duties of the LTA Regarding Interconnection  The LTA shall perform the following functions and duties in relation to  interconnection of telecommunications networks:      (a) promote adequate, efficient and cost-oriented interconnection of  telecommunications networks and access by service providers to  telecommunications facilities of other service providers in order to permit  interoperability of telecommunications services that originate or terminate in  Liberia and to promote the development of competitive telecommunications  service markets;  (b) establish and maintain an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and  commercially viable regulatory framework for interconnection and access  with a view to minimizing regulatory and other barriers to entry into  telecommunications markets;  (c) promote interconnection arrangements, including by facilitating negotiations  between the parties to reach interconnection agreements;               (d) ensure that interconnection agreements otherwise meet the objectives of this  Act;  (e) determine which service providers are dominant service providers in a  telecommunications market for interconnection;  (f) if considered appropriate by the LTA, regulate the prices for interconnection  and access services by dominant service providers in a telecommunications  market for interconnection;  (g) ensure that dominant service providers in a telecommunications market for  interconnection publish a reference interconnection offer in accordance with  Section 39 of this Act and any regulations, rules and orders applicable to  interconnection;  (h) resolve disputes related to interconnection in a timely and impartial manner;  and  (i) make orders specifying the terms of interconnection that shall be provided by  one or more LTA service providers in accordance to the LTA regulations,  rules and orders.      34. Interconnection by All Service Providers  (1) Upon receipt of a written request by another service provider, a service provider shall enter  into good faith negotiations to enter into an interconnection agreement to:  (a) connect and keep connected the telecommunications networks of both service  providers; and  (b) provide access to such telecommunications facilities, including central  offices and other equipment locations, mast sites, towers, conduits, poles,  subscriber access lines and underground facilities, as are reasonably  requested in order for the service providers to provide telecommunications  service to their customers.  (c) agree that interconnection is to be facilitated by the installation of appropriate  interconnection equipment, with each LTA licensed service provider  responsible for its own equipment to facilitate interconnection, and provided  that the equipment and infrastructure is such that the LTA can monitor calls  originating from Liberia and terminating in Liberia.      (2) The following actions or practices shall be deemed to violate the duty in Section 34 (1) to  negotiate in good faith:  (a) obstructing or delaying negotiations, or failing to make reasonable efforts to  resolve outstanding disputes;               (b) refusing to provide information about a service provider’s own  telecommunications services or telecommunications network or other  facilities that are necessary for the interconnection arrangements;  (c) misleading or coercing a party into reaching an agreement it would not  otherwise have made;  (d) interfering in any way with a service provider’s ability to communicate with  the LTA, including having a service provider sign a non-disclosure  agreement that precludes it from providing information requested by the  LTA; or  (e) refusing to permit amendment of the interconnection agreement to take into  account changes in circumstances, including changes to this Act or any  applicable regulation or rule.      (3) A service provider shall not be required to enter into an interconnection agreement on terms  that would, in its reasonable opinion, and where the LTA has not made an order otherwise:  (a) cause or be likely to cause material danger, damage or injury to any person or  to any property;  (b) cause material damage or otherwise interfere with the operation of its  telecommunications network, telecommunications facilities or the provision  of its telecommunications services; or  (c) not be reasonable, having regard to technical or economic constraints.      (4) Service providers and other interested parties may at any time request the LTA to issue an  order that clarifies or interprets the interconnection rights or obligations set out in this Act or  any applicable regulations or rules.  35. Interconnection by Dominant Service Providers  (1) Sections 36, 37, 38 and 39 apply only to service providers that the LTA has designated as  dominant service providers in one or more telecommunications markets relevant to  interconnection.  (2) The LTA may issue a regulation, rule or order clarifying the interconnection related  obligations of any dominant service provider.  36. Requests for Interconnection  (1) Interconnection arrangements offered by dominant service providers, in addition to meeting  the requirements of Section 34, shall:           (a) be consistent with this Act and any regulations, rules and orders made by the  LTA before the date of the offer, including any requirements prescribed  therein relating to interconnection charges and quality of service;  (b) be no less favourable than any reference interconnection offer that has been  approved by the LTA for the service provider;  (c) meet all reasonable requests for interconnection with the dominant service  provider’s telecommunications network at any technically feasible point; and  (d) in all other respects, incorporate reasonable terms and conditions, including  technical standards and specifications.

(2) Subject to Section 39 (3), the LTA shall place a copy of all interconnection agreements filed  in accordance with Section 39 (1) on its official web site, and shall make copies of filed  interconnection agreements available on request by any service provider seeking  interconnection.  (3) A dominant service provider may designate information contained in an interconnection  agreement that it has filed with the LTA in accordance with Section 39 (1) as confidential,  and request that such confidential information be excluded from the copy of the  interconnection agreement placed on the LTA’s official web site. However:  (a) details of interconnection charges and all other essential terms and conditions  shall not be considered confidential; and  (b) the LTA shall determine what other information will be treated as  confidential, and resolve in a final and binding manner all disputes regarding  disclosure of information designated as confidential.               40. Non-compliant Interconnection Agreements  If the LTA decides that an interconnection agreement is not in compliance with this Act, or  the requirements of any regulation, rule, order or licence, it may issue an order requiring one  or more of the parties to the interconnection agreement to amend the agreement.      41. Co-location  (1) If not otherwise addressed in interconnection or access terms determined pursuant to  Sections 34 to 38, and subject to any regulation, rule or order issued by the LTA,  service providers with existing telecommunications network facilities shall allow other  service providers to co-locate their telecommunications network facilities on those  existing facilities, including central office premises and other equipment locations,  land and roof tops, mast sites, towers, conduits, poles and underground facilities,  where such co-location is technically and economically feasible and where no  significant additional construction work is required.  (2) The party requesting co-location shall compensate the party required to provide co-  location for such an amount as the parties may agree or, where the parties are unable  to agree, as may be determined by the LTA.  (3) Where the parties are unable to agree on the terms and conditions of co-location, either  or both of the parties may submit the matter for dispute resolution pursuant to Section  73.            PART IX  TARIFFS  42. Tariff Filing and Approval  (1) Dominant service providers shall file with and obtain the approval of the LTA for all tariffs,  rates or charges for telecommunications service in markets in which the LTA has designated  them as dominant.  (2) The LTA may issue an order to remove any requirement for dominant service providers to  file and obtain approval of tariffs under this Part IX where the LTA determines that:  (a) competitive market forces will be sufficient to protect the interests of  customers; and  (b) there is not a significant risk of harm to competitive markets as a result of the  removal of the requirement to file and obtain approval of tariffs.      (3) The LTA may issue an order to require a change in the tariffs for telecommunications  services provided by a dominant service provider where the LTA determines, following a  process of consultation with the dominant service provider, that such tariffs include           excessive charges resulting from the service provider’s dominant position. Such an order  shall prescribe the tariff change to be made and shall identify the basis and reasons for the  required change.

(6) For the purposes of Section 48 (5), a claim or suggestion is misleading if, at the time it  was made, the service provider knew or reasonably ought to have known that it was  false or misleading in any material respect or that it was reasonably likely to confuse  or mislead the person to whom it was made.      49.

(4) The LTA may issue an order to regulate or prohibit the use by any person, whether or  not that person is a service provider, of the telecommunications network of a service  provider to provide unsolicited telecommunications, to the extent that the LTA  considers it necessary to reduce or eliminate the nuisance caused by such  telecommunications.      51.

No Unjustified Discrimination  (1) Unless otherwise specifically permitted by the LTA, dominant service providers shall  offer all customers the same terms and quality of service, including tariffs charged,  unless different terms are objectively justified, based on differences in supply  conditions, including different costs or a shortage of available facilities or resources.

Once approved, these terms of service will replace the customer terms then  in use by a service provider and shall become binding on the service provider and its  customers.               (4) The LTA may issue an order discontinuing the requirement for a service provider to  submit draft terms of service to the LTA for approval where it determines that its  approval is no longer required to protect the interests of customers.      56.

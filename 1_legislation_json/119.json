Article 25. 1. If prior to the issuance of a decision referred to in Article 24, there was   a telecommunications undertaking with significant market power or telecommunications   undertakings holding jointly significant market power in the same relevant market, which   have lost their SMP, the President of UKE, by means of a decision, shall specify the time   limit for withdrawing regulatory obligations, taking account of the situation of   telecommunications undertakings operating in that market and affected by this decision.   2. The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be published on the UKE BIP website.      Article 25a. 1. A telecommunications undertaking shall have significant market power if it   enjoys individually an economic position in a relevant market equivalent to dominance within   the meaning of Community law.   2. While assessing the telecommunications undertaking’s position in a relevant market, the   President of UKE shall take into account criteria listed in the Commission guidelines referred   to in Article 19 (3).   3. Two or more telecommunications undertakings shall have joint significant market power if,   even in the absence of organisational or other links between them, they have an economic   position in a relevant market equivalent to dominance within the meaning of Community law.   4. While finding whether two or more telecommunications undertakings have joint significant   power in a relevant market, the President of UKE shall assess characteristics of a relevant   market, in particular market shares of the undertakings and market transparency.     5.

Where the relevant market is found to be transnational by means of a decision of   the European Commission, the President of UKE shall carry out its analysis in agreement with   regulatory authorities of other Member States. The provision of Article 23 or 24 shall apply as   appropriate.      Article 25e. 1. An undertaking with significant market power in a relevant market may be   deemed to have significant market power in another relevant market, where the links between   the two markets are such as to allow the market power held in one relevant market to be   leveraged into the other relevant market (closely related market), thereby strengthening the   market power of the undertaking.   2. In order to prevent that significant market power is leveraged from a relevant market to   a closely related market, the President of UKE, following the analysis referred to in Article 21   (1), may impose in a closely related market regulatory obligations referred to in Articles 36-  40 and in Article 42 on an undertaking referred to in paragraph 1.   3. If imposing obligations referred to in Articles 36-40 and in Article 42 did not prevent the   leverage of significant market power from a relevant market to a closely related market, the   President of UKE may impose in a closely related market obligations referred to in Article 46   on the undertaking referred to in paragraph 1.      Article 25f. 1. The President of UKE, where the time limits referred to in Article 21 (2) to (4)   are not met, may request BEREC to consult on the analysis of a given market and the   maintenance, amendment or withdrawal of regulatory obligations imposed on   a telecommunications undertaking with significant market power or telecommunications   undertakings holding jointly significant market power before completion of market analysis.   2. Within six months of receiving from BEREC the results of consultations, the President of   UKE shall notify the draft measure to the European Commission.

The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply to agreements for the provision of   telecommunications services the conclusion of which is implied by the very performance of   certain actions referred to in Article 56 (2).   5. The conditions of an agreement for the provision of publicly available telecommunications   services, including connection to a public telecommunications network, may not render it   impossible or difficult for a subscriber to exercise its right to change the provider of publicly   available telecommunications services.   6. In the event of concluding an agreement for the provision of telecommunications services,   including connection to a public telecommunications network, associated with an allowance   granted to the subscriber, any claim resulting from unilateral termination of an agreement by   the subscriber or a service provider due to the subscriber's fault prior to the termination date   fixed in an agreement may not exceed the value of an allowance granted to the subscriber   reduced by its proportional value for the period from concluding the agreement to its   termination date.

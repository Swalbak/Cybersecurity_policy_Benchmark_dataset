Our Telecommunication Act 1983 generally cannot catch up with such developments  and advancement in telecommunication. Rather than amend the current Act to bring it in line  with modern trends, repealing it is inevitable, and putting a new regulatory system in place is  preferred. Whereas in the 1983 Act the licensing authority has been in the hands of Government  official, the new system takes that away from the Government and now vests it in the hand of an  Authority which is a statutory corporation having all the necessary powers to perform the powers  and functions covered by this Act.   The general objectives of the Authority is set out in Section 3 which includes promoting the  development of telecommunication systems and services in accordance with international  standards, practises and public demand; providing basic telecommunication services to as many  people as practicable in Kiribati at affordable prices; protecting the interests of consumer,  purchasers and other users of telecommunication system and service; promoting efficiency and  competition among persons engaged in the operation telecommunication system and service;  promoting research in telecommunication and fostering innovation in the provision of  telecommunication services; and encouraging the introduction of new services.

Part IV empowers an operator to enter land for the purpose of gaining access to existing works  or existing lines owned or used by the operator upon giving reasonable notice of intention to  enter to the landowner (s.29).

Part V deals with investigations, inspections and enforcement. S.48 empowers the Authority to  appoint or designate inspectors for the purposes of verifying compliance with the Act and with  the decisions of the Authority. His powers are set out under s.49 which include the power to  enter and inspect any place owned by the operator in which the Inspector believes there is a  document, information or equipment, relevant to the enforcement of this Act, to examine any  radio apparatus or interference-causing equipment, logs, books, etc and remove such documents  or information. A warrant can be issued to an Inspector to enter and search any premises (s.50).

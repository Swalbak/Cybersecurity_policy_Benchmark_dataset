Electronic transactions  Recognition of electronic message 5. Except as provided in this Act, where a law provides that informa-  tion or any other matter shall be in writing, typewritten or in printed form,  the requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the information  or matter is  (a) rendered or made available in an electronic form, (b) accessible, and (c) capable of being retained for a subsequent reference  despite the contrary intention in the law.  Original writing 6. (1) Where a law requires information to be presented or retained in   its original form, the requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied  by an electronic record if  (a) there is reliable assurance of the integrity of the electronic  record, and  (b) the electronic record is capable of being displayed to the  person to whom it is to be presented.  (2) The criteria to assess integrity shall be whether the  information has remained complete and unaltered and the information  shall be assessed taking into consideration the relevant circumstances  for which the information was generated to determine the standard of  reliability.    9  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772  Admissibility and evidential weight of electronic records 7. (1) The admissibility of an electronic record shall not be denied as   evidence in legal proceedings except as provided in this Act. (2) In assessing the evidential weight of an electronic record the   Court shall have regard to (a) the reliability of the manner in which the electronic record   was generated, displayed, stored or communicated, (b) the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the   information was maintained, (c) the manner in which its originator was identified, and (d) any other facts that the Court may consider relevant.  Retention of electronic records 8. (1) Where a law requires that a document, record or information   shall be retained, that requirement is deemed to have been met if the docu- ment, record or information is held in electronic form and  (a) is accessible, (b) is capable of retention for subsequent reference, (c) is retained in the format in which it was generated, sent or   received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to repre- sent accurately the information generated, sent or received,  and  (d) is retained to enable the identification of the origin and des- tination of the electronic record and the date and time when  it was sent or received.  (2) The document, record or information shall be kept in electronic  form for at least six years.   (3) An obligation to retain a document, record or information does  not extend to information which is only to enable the message to be sent  or received.    Secure electronic record  9. (1) Where a security procedure has been applied to an electronic  record at a specific point in time, the record is deemed to be a secure  electronic record during the period when the security procedure was applied.  (2) An unauthorised alteration of the security procedure renders the  record invalid.    10  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  (3) An alteration is unauthorised if it is done by a person without  the lawful authority of the person who originally applied the security  procedure.   Digital signature 10. (1) Where a law requires the signature of a person, that require-  ment is deemed to be satisfied in relation to an electronic record if a digital  signature is used.  (2) A digital signature is deemed to be authentic if (a) the means of creating the digital signature is, within the   context in which it is used, linked to the signatory and not  to another person,  (b) the means of creating the digital signature was, at the time of  signing, under the control of the signatory and not another  person without duress or undue influence , and  (c) an alteration to the digital signature, made after the time of  signing, is detectable.  (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the right of a person (a) to prove the authenticity of a digital signature in any other   way, or (b) to adduce evidence in respect of the non-authenticity of a   digital signature.   Equal treatment of digital signatures 11. Except as provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act do not   exclude, restrict, or deprive of legal effect, any method of creating a digital  signature which  (a) satisfies the requirements of this Act, (b) meets the requirements of other statutory provision, or (c) is provided for under a contract.  Signing of an electronic record 12. A person may sign an electronic record by affixing a personal digi-  tal signature or using any other recognized, secure and verifiable mode  of signing agreed by the parties or recognized by the industry to be safe,  reliable and acceptable.  Conduct of a person relying on a digital signature    11  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772  13. A person who relies on a digital signature shall bear the legal con- sequences of failure to  (a) take reasonable steps to verify the authenticity of a digital  signature, or  (b) take reasonable steps where a digital signature is supported  by a certificate, to  (i) verify the validity of the certificate, or (ii) observe any limitation with respect to the certificate.  Recognition of digital certificates and digital signatures 14.

Notarisation, acknowledgement and certification 15. (1) Where a law requires a signature, statement or document to be   notarised, acknowledged, verified or made under oath, that requirement is  deemed to be satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorised  to perform those acts is affixed to an electronic record.  (2) Where a law requires or permits a person to provide a certified  copy of a document and the document exists in paper or in another physical  form, that requirement is deemed to be satisfied if an electronic copy of  the document is certified to be a true copy by using the electronic signature  of the certifying person.  Other requirements 16. (1) A requirement in law for multiple copies of a document to be   submitted to a single addressee at the same time, is satisfied by the sub- mission of a single electronic record that is capable of being reproduced  by the addressee.  (2) Where a corporate seal is required to be affixed to a document,  that requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the electronic signature of the  corporate body is affixed to the electronic record in accordance with the  provisions relating to the use of the corporate seal.  Automated transactions 17. (1) An automated transaction is valid even if an electronic agent     12  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  is involved at any stage of its formation. (2) A party interacting with an electronic agent to make an agree-  ment is not bound by the terms of the agreement unless the terms were  capable at first of being accessed by the party prior to the formation of  the contract.  (3) An electronic contract is not valid where an individual interacts  directly with the electronic agent and has made a material error during  the creation of an electronic record and   (a) the electronic agent did not provide that person with an easy  opportunity to prevent or correct the error,  (b) that person notifies the party creating the electronic record  of the error as soon as practicable after noticing it,  (c) that person takes reasonable steps to return to the previous  situation, and  (d) that person has not used or received material benefit or value  from performance received from the other person.  Despatch of electronic record 18. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee,   the despatch of an electronic record occurs when it enters an information  processing system outside the control of the originator or the agent of the  originator.  Receipt of electronic record 19. The time of receipt of an electronic record shall be determined as   follows: (a) if the addressee has designated an information system for   the purpose of receiving electronic records, receipt occurs  at the time when the electronic record enters the designated  information system, or  (b) if the addressee has not designated an information system,  receipt occurs when the electronic record enters an informa- tion system of the addressee through which the addressee  retrieves the electronic record.  (2) An electronic record is deemed to be despatched at the origina- tor’s registered place of business and is deemed to be received at the regis-    13  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772  tered place where the addressee has its place of business unless otherwise  agreed by the originator and the addressee.  Expression of intent or other statement 20. An expression of intent or other electronic representation of an   electronic record between the originator and the addressee of an electronic  record is admissible in circumstances where the intent or other electronic  representation is relevant in law.  Attribution of electronic records to originator 21. (1) An electronic record is considered to be that of the originator   if it was sent by (a) the originator personally, (b) a person who has authority to act on behalf of the originator   in respect of that electronic record, or (c) an information system programmed by or on behalf of the   originator to operate automatically, unless it is proved that the  information system did not properly execute the programme.  (2) An addressee is entitled to regard an electronic record as being  that of the originator and to act on that assumption, if  (a) the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed  with the originator in order to ascertain whether the electronic  record was that of the originator, or  (b) the electronic record received by the addressee resulted from  the actions of a person whose relationship with the origina- tor or with an agent of the originator enabled that person to  gain access to a method used by the originator to identify an  electronic record as the originator’s own.  (3) Where a procedure has not been agreed by both parties to as- certain the originator, the person who appears to be the originator shall  be presumed to be the originator.  (4) The presumption in subsection (3) does not apply where: (a) the addressee has received notice from the originator that   the electronic record was issued without the knowledge or  consent of the originator;  (b) the addressee knew or should reasonably have known, or used     14  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  any agreed procedure to know that the electronic record was  not that of the originator and that the person who sent the  electronic record did not have the authority of the originator  to issue or send the electronic record; or  (c) the addressee knew or should reasonably have known, that  the transmission resulted in an error in the electronic record  as received.  Acknowledgement of receipt of electronic record 22. (1) An acknowledgement of receipt may be given through  (a) a communication by the addressee, whether automated or  otherwise, or   (b) any conduct of the addressee to indicate to the originator  that the electronic record has been received.  (2) An acknowledgement of receipt is not necessary to give legal  effect to a message unless otherwise agreed by the parties.  Formation and validity of agreements 23. An agreement is valid even if it was concluded partly or in whole   through an electronic medium.  Variation by agreement between parties 24.

MEMORANDUM  This Bill forms part of the e-legislation package for statutory authority  for the 2005 National Telecom Policy to provide a legal framework for  electronic transactions amongst others. The Bill provides for and facilitates  electronic communications and related transactions in the public interest  and applies to all electronic transactions and electronic records.   It is the object of Government to facilitate the use of electronic media  to speed up government and private business in recognition of the need to  provide a framework for the preparation, processing, storage, transmission  and receipt of electronic data in a secured, efficient, trustworthy manner.  Furthermore, Government desires to prevent the use of electronic media  for illegal or unlawful acts.  The Bill is divided into twelve groups of clauses. These deal with  electronic transactions, electronic government services, the certifying  agency and consumer protection. Other groups of clauses relate to the  Appeal forum, Industry forum, the duties of service providers and cyber  offences.   The first group of clauses, clause 1 – 4 sets the framework for the Bill  by providing the object of the legislation, application and scope of the Bill.   The second group of clauses, clause 5 - 24 deals with electronic  transactions and provides for the recognition and admissibility of electronic  records and electronic signatures, the recognition of electronic certificates,  electronic notarisation, acknowledgement and certification services, and  automated transactions, clause 5 – 17.   Electronic documents will satisfy the requirement of writing imposed  by any law and will not be denied admissibility in evidence if they are  accessible and capable of being retained for subsequent reference. Where  the law requires multiple copies of a document to be submitted to a single     66  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  addressee at the same time, that requirement will be satisfied by the  submission of a single electronic record that is capable of being reproduced  by that addressee, clause 16. A requirement by law that a document be  signed by a person will be satisfied in relation to an electronic document  if an electronic signature is used. The Bill specifies what constitutes an  authentic electronic signature in clause 16.  Agreements concluded partly or wholly through an electronic medium  are not of themselves invalid. For the purpose of electronic transactions,  an electronic agent may be involved at any stage except that a party dealing  with an electronic agent is not bound by the terms of the agreement  unless terms were first capable of being accessed by the party prior to the  formation of the contract, clause 17.  The Bill also deals with the time and place of despatch and receipt of  electronic records. Under clause 18 the despatch of an electronic record  occurs when it enters an information processing system outside the control  of the originator, unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the  addressee. Under clause 19, receipt occurs at the time when the electronic  record enters the designated information system of the addressee, unless  otherwise agreed. If the addressee has not designated an information  system, receipt occurs when the electronic record enters an information  system of the addressee or through which the addressee retrieves its  electronic record.  The place of despatch of an electronic record is deemed to be the  originator’s registered place of business, and deemed to be received at the  addressee’s registered place of business, unless otherwise agreed, clause   Date of Gazette notification: 19th December, 2008.  GOVERNMENT PRINTER, ASSEMBLY PRESS, ACCRA. GPC/A727/300/12/2008    67  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772   This printed impression has been carefully compared by me with the  Bill which has been passed by Parliament, and found by me to be a true copy  of that Bill.  Clerk to Parliament   Date of authentication:   I hereby signify assent to this Bill.  President  Date of Assent:    68  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008    69  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772  19. The Bill also clarifies in clause 21 how electronic documents may be  attributed to an originator.  The third group of clauses, clause 25 - 27 provides for e-Government  service which is public service provided by electronic means by a public  body. A public body is empowered by any law in clause 26 to accept for  filing, accept payment, issue permits, licences or approvals by electronic  means. The Bill does not seek to compel public bodies to process electronic  records, clause 25. A public body may however publish in the Gazette details  of the manner and format in which it will accept and retain electronic  records. The Bill also allows for the publication of the Official Gazette in  electronic format, clause 27.  The fourth group of clauses, clause 28 – 45 is on the Certifying Agency  which is to certify encryption or authentication services provided in the  country and monitor the conduct, systems and operations of encryption  and authentication service providers. The functions of the Certifying  Agency are provided in clause 31. Service and products of persons certified  by a Certifying Foreign Agency recognised by the local Agency will be  allowed, clause 34. Among other things, the Agency is also to act as the  repository of Digital Signature Certificates issued under this Bill and  maintain a computerised database of public keys to make them verifiable  by a member of the public, clause 35.  Consumer protection is dealt with in the fifth group of clauses, clause  46 – 54, which provides for the protection of consumers in electronic  transactions. The obligations of suppliers offering goods or services for  sale, hire or exchange to consumers on an electronic platform are spelt  out in clause 47. For instance, consumers will be entitled to information  relating to the supplier and the goods or services offered. Suppliers will  be duty-bound to utilise a payment system that is sufficiently secure with  reference to accepted technological standards at the time of the transaction  according to the type of transaction concerned. Suppliers will be liable  for any damage suffered by a consumer due to a failure by the supplier to  apply a sufficiently secure payment system. Unsolicited goods, services,  and communications are prohibited in clause 50. Financial institutions are  not to make available, lend, or sell a list or portion of a list of holders of  any electronic payment medium and their addresses and account numbers  to any person without the prior written consent of the holders, clause 51.  This will be subject to other laws related to credit reporting.  Electronic Transactions Bill    70  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  88 – 89. It will be a platform that brings the industry together from time to  time to discuss matters of common interest to and concerning the industry.  The National IT Agency may designate an industry body to be the forum,  clause 87. The forum may prepare a voluntary industry code on its own  initiative or upon request by the Agency clause 89.  The liability for service providers is imposed in the tenth group of  clauses, clause 90 – 96. It imposes liabilities on service providers for  electronically published matter that is illegal or unlawful. Other acts are  prohibited such as knowingly divulging to any person or entity the contents  of a communication while in electronic storage by that service, clause  96. It excludes from liability, intermediaries who merely provide access  to, transmit, or store/host electronic records under specified conditions.  A person claiming that any electronically published matter is illegal or  unlawful may notify the publisher and request that it be taken down,  (clause 94). An intermediary or service provider is generally speaking,  not required to monitor an electronic record processed by means of the  system in order to ascertain whether its processing will constitute or give  rise to an offence or give rise to civil liability, clause 92.  Law enforcement is dealt with in the eleventh group of clauses which  adds to the powers of arrest, search, and seizure of law enforcement  agencies by law. The Bill empowers law enforcement agents in the course  of the execution of court warrants to seize a computer, electronic record,  programme, information, document or thing if they reasonably believe  that it is evidence that an offence under the Bill has been or is about to be  committed, clause 98. Law enforcement agencies may also request the  preservation of evidence by providers of wire or electronic communication  services or a remote computing service pending the issuance of a Court  Order or other process clause 100. Controls against incrimination are  provided for under the Bill. The Court is empowered, upon application of  a law enforcement agency, to order an electronic communication service  provider to disclose the contents of an electronic communication, that is in  transit, held, maintained or has been in electronic storage in an electronic  communications system, if the disclosure is relevant and material for  investigative purposes or is in the interest of national security, clause 101.  Cyber offences are contained in the twelfth group of clauses, clause   i i  Electronic Transactions Bill    71  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 Act 772  Illegal access to protected computers is dealt with in the sixth group of  clauses clause 55 – 62. Information contained in the register of a critical  database is not to be disclosed to any person other than to the relevant  employees of the National Information Technology Agency, clause 60.  Protected computers and critical database which have been declared  by government are not to be accessed illegally. The protection extends to  computers and databases for national security, defence, public safety and  public health, emergency systems. Databases relating to the provision of  services directly related to communications infrastructure, banking and  financial services, public utilities, public transportation or public key  infrastructure, or used by the legislative, executive and judicial arms of  government, the public services and security agencies are also designated  as critical under the Bill, clause 55.  Provisions on the domain name register are in the seventh group of  clauses. A domain name Registry is established to assume responsibility  for the “.gh” country domain name space from a date to be determined  by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. After the commencement of the  Act, a person shall not update a repository or administer a second level  country domain name unless the person is licensed to do so by the Registry.  The governing body of the Registry is a Board composed of nine members  and may be converted into a company limited by guarantee, clause 63.  Its functions will include the administration and management of the  “.gh” domain name space. It will license and regulate registrars for the  respective registries and publish guidelines on the general administration  and management of the “.gh” domain name space.  The eighth group of clauses, clause 82 – 87 provides for an appeal  tribunal and establishes the Information Communication Technology  Tribunal in clause 81. This will be convened on an adhoc basis to consider  appeals against decisions of the National Information Technology Agency.  The three member tribunal is to be appointed by the Chairperson of the  Public Services Commission, clause 72. The expenses of the tribunal will  be paid out of income derived by the Agency and will be part of the annual  budget of the Agency. Decisions of the tribunal relating to points of law  can be appealed against to the Court of Appeal clause 87.  An industry forum is established in the ninth group of clauses clause i i i  Electronic Transactions Bill    72  Electronic Transactions Act, 2008  107 – 140. The provisions of the Criminal Code are extended to cover  various offences committed through electronic means. These offences  include stealing, appropriation, charlatanic advertisement and dishonest  receiving. Others are attempt to commit crimes, aiding and abetting,  conspiracy, forgery and criminal negligence. The publication of child  pornography by electronic means is also criminalised.  In addition to these, access to protected computers, obtaining  electronic payment medium falsely, electronic trafficking, possession  of electronic counterfeit-making equipment are offences. Fraudulent  electronic fund transfer, unauthorised access or interception, unauthorised  interference with electronic records, unauthorised access to devices are  also offences. The rest include unlawful access to stored communications,  unauthorised circumvention, causing a computer to cease to function and  child pornography. Conviction for these offences attracts heavy fines and  long terms of imprisonment  The last group of clause is on miscellaneous matters and contains  a general provision to the effect than an act which constitutes an offence  under a law here which is committed wholly or partly by use of an  electronic medium or in electronic form outside the country will be dealt  with as if the offence had been committed here. This group also contains  the powers to make Regulations and the interpretation clause.    DR.

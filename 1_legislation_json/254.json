Art. 11c Restriction of the right to information in relation to requests for arrest for the  purpose of extradition   1 Any person may request information on whether Switzerland has received a request from a  foreign state to make an arrest for the purpose of extradition. This right may be asserted at the  Federal Office. If the request is made to a different authority, that authority shall forward the  request immediately to the Federal Office.  2 If a person requests information on whether the Federal Office has received a request to make  an arrest for the purpose of extradition, the Federal Office shall notify the person that no data  about them has been unlawfully processed and that the person can request the Federal Data  Protection and Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) to enquire as to whether any  data on them has been lawfully processed.  3 The Commissioner shall conduct the enquiries; he shall notify the person concerned either  that no data about them has been unlawfully processed or that he has opened an investigation  under Article 22 of the Schengen Data Protection Act of 28 September 201835 in the case of  errors in the processing of personal data.      34 Inserted by No II 4 of the FA of 28 Sept. 2018 on the Implementation of Directive (EU) 2016/680 on  the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authori- ties for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or  the execution of criminal penalties, in force since 1 March 2019 (AS 2019 625; BBl 2017 6941).   35 SR 235.3     Mutual Assistance Act   7   351.1   4 If the Commissioner identifies errors in the data processing, he shall order the Federal Office  to rectify the same.  5 The notifications under paragraphs 2 and 3 shall always be worded in the same way and shall  not mention the grounds.  6 The notification under paragraph 3 may not be contested.  7 In derogation from paragraph 2, the Federal Office is entitled to provide the person concerned  with the requested information if the requesting state gives its advance consent.   Art. 11d Right to have personal data corrected or deleted  1 The person who is the object of a request for international cooperation in criminal matters  may request that the competent authority correct or delete the personal data relating to them  that is being processed in contravention of this Act.  2 Instead of deleting the personal data, the competent authority shall restrict the processing if:   a. the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data but it cannot be established  whether the data is correct or incorrect;   b. overriding interests, in particular those set out in Article 80b paragraph 2, so require; or   c. deletion may prejudice proceedings on international cooperation in criminal matters or  foreign proceedings giving rise to the request for cooperation in criminal matters.   3 The competent authority shall immediately notify the authority that has transmitted, made  available or disclosed the personal data about the measures taken in accordance with para- graph 1 or 2.  4 The relevant foreign authority is responsible for checking the accuracy of personal data that  has been obtained as evidence or personal data relating to criminal offences giving rise to the  request for international cooperation in criminal matters.   Art. 11e Equal treatment  1 The data protection rules that apply to the disclosure of personal data to the competent author- ities of States that are linked with Switzerland through one of the Schengen association agree- ments (the Schengen States) must not be stricter than the rules that apply to the disclosure of  personal data to Swiss law enforcement authorities.  2 Specific legislation that provides for stricter data protection rules for the disclosure of person- al data to the competent foreign authorities does not apply to disclosure to the competent au- thorities of the Schengen States.   Art. 11f Disclosure of personal data to a third country or an international body  1 Personal data may not be disclosed to the competent authority of a State that is not linked  with Switzerland through one of the Schengen association agreements (a third country) or to an  international body if, as a result, the privacy of the data subject would be seriously jeopardised,  in particular because of the lack of adequate protection.  2 Adequate protection is guaranteed by:   a. the legislation of the third country, provided the European Union has confirmed this in  a decision;   b. an international agreement;   c. specific guarantees.     Mutual Assistance   8   351.1   3 In derogation from paragraph 1, personal data may be disclosed to the competent authority of  a third country or to an international body if disclosure is necessary in the case in question:   a. to protect the life or physical integrity of the data subject or a third party;   b. to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the public security of a Schengen State or  of a third country;   c. to prevent, detect or prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a criminal judgment, un- less overriding legitimate interests of the data subject preclude disclosure;   d. to exercise or enforce legal rights against an authority competent to prevent, detect or  prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a criminal judgment, unless overriding legit- imate interests of the data subject preclude disclosure.   Art. 11g Disclosure of personal data by a Schengen State to a third country or an  international body   1 Personal data that are transmitted or made available by a Schengen State may be disclosed to  the competent authority of a third country or to an international body if:   a. disclosure is required to prevent, detect or prosecute a criminal offence or to execute a  criminal judgment;   b. the Schengen State that transmitted or made available the personal data has given prior  consent to disclosure; and   c. the requirements of Article 11f are met.  2 In derogation from paragraph 1 letter b, personal data may be disclosed in an individual case  if:   a. the prior consent of the Schengen State cannot be obtained in time; and   b. disclosure is necessary to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the public security  of a Schengen State or of a third country or to protect the essential interests of a  Schengen State.   3 The Schengen State shall be notified immediately of any disclosure under paragraph 2.   Art. 11h Procedure for the disclosure of personal data  1 The competent authority shall notify the recipient about the reliability of the personal data  disclosed and of the extent to which they are up to date.  2 It shall also disclose any additional information to the recipient that may as far as possible be  used to distinguish:   a. between the various categories of data subjects;   b. between personal data based on facts and personal data based on personal assessments.  3 The obligation to notify the recipient does not apply if the information mentioned in para- graphs 1 and 2 is evident from the personal data themselves or from the circumstances.     Mutual Assistance Act   9   351.1   Chapter 2 Applicable Law   Art. 12 General  1 Unless this Act specifies otherwise, the federal administrative authorities shall apply, by  analogy, the Federal Act of 20 December 196836 on Administrative Procedure, and the cantonal  authorities their own procedural rules. Procedural acts are governed by the procedural law in  criminal matters.  2 The cantonal and federal provisions on the suspension of time limits do not apply.37   Art. 13 Suspension of limitation periods38. Filing a criminal complaint  1 In proceedings under this Act, the following shall be considered to have effect in Switzerland:   a. the suspension of a limitation period under the law of the requesting State;   b. the filing of a criminal complaint with a foreign authority within the time limit provided  for if this is so required under Swiss law.   2 If a criminal complaint is required only under Swiss law, no sentence may be imposed or  executed in Switzerland if the victim makes objections.   Art. 14 Taking account of the period in detention   Article 69 of the Swiss Criminal Code39 applies when taking account of the period spent on  remand or in detention abroad due to proceedings under this Act.   Art. 15 Compensation  1 Articles 429 and 431 CrimPC40 apply by analogy in proceedings that have been conducted  against the defendant under this Act in Switzerland or at the instigation of a Swiss authority  abroad.41  2 The Confederation shall pay the compensation if a federal authority makes or executes a  request. It may require reimbursement from the canton that caused the request to be made.  3 The compensation may be reduced or refused if the defendant has provoked the investigation  or the detention through his fault, or has, without reason, obstructed or delayed the proceed- ings.42  4 Compensation for detention pending extradition served in Switzerland may also be reduced or  refused if the requesting State:   a. withdraws the request for search and arrest with a view to extradition; or      36 SR 172.021  37 Inserted by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, in force since 1 Feb. 1997 (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).  38 The suspension of the effects of the time limitation provisions has been abolished by Art. 97 ff. of the   Swiss Criminal Code (SR 311.0) and time limits for execution have been replaced by an extension of  the regular time limit (AS 2006 3459; BBl 1999 1979).   39 SR 311.0.

Unless federal law  provides otherwise, they are required to execute the requests for other forms of mutual assis- tance and the transfer of proceedings and to execute criminal judgments. The cantons shall be  subject to the supervision of the Confederation provided this Act applies.  2 …45   Art. 17 Federal authorities  1 The Federal Department of Justice and Police (the Department) shall decide on cases under  Article 1 letter a.46 The decision of the Department may be requested within 30 days of receiv- ing written notification of the final ruling.47  2 The Federal Office shall receive the requests from abroad and file Swiss requests. It shall  handle extradition requests and arrange for requests for other assistance, transfer of proceedings  and execution of criminal judgments to be examined by the appropriate cantonal or federal  authorities if their execution is not obviously inadmissible.  3 It shall decide:   a. whether to require a guarantee of reciprocity (Art. 8 para. 1);   b. on the appropriate procedure (Art. 19);   c. on the admissibility of Swiss requests (Art. 30, para. 1).  4 It may transfer the conduct of proceedings wholly or partly to the federal authority which  would be competent to prosecute the offence if it had been committed in Switzerland.  5 It may also decide on the admissibility of assistance and allow its execution in accordance  with Article 79 letter a.48   Art. 17a49 Obligation of promptness  1 The competent authority shall execute requests promptly.

If the delay is not justified,  the Federal Office may take the matter up with the appropriate supervisory authority.  3 When the competent authority, without reason, refuses to or delays in issuing a ruling, its  conduct shall be regarded as equivalent to a negative decision subject to appeal.   Art. 1850 Provisional measures  1 At the express request of another State, provisional measures may be taken by the competent  authority to preserve the existing situation, to safeguard threatened legal interests or to protect  jeopardised evidence unless the proceedings under this Act clearly appear to be inadmissible or  inappropriate.  2 If any delay would jeopardise the proceedings and if there is sufficient information to deter- mine whether all the conditions are met, the Federal Office may likewise order provisional  measures as soon as a request is announced.

Art. 20 Suspension of criminal proceedings or of the execution of a penalty  1 At the request of the Federal Office, the competent authority may temporarily suspend crimi- nal proceedings or the execution of a sentence against a defendant abroad for another offence  if:   a. the sentence imposed in Switzerland is not of great importance in comparison to the  one likely to be imposed abroad or   b. execution of the sentence in Switzerland does not seem appropriate.  2 On conclusion of the criminal proceedings abroad, the Swiss authority shall decide whether or  not to resume the suspended proceedings or the execution of the penalty.

Art. 5997 Handing over of objects and assets  1 If the conditions set for the extradition are met, objects and assets shall also be handed over  which:   a. can serve as evidence; or   b. derive from the offence.  2 If an authority, or a third party with rights acquired in good faith, or the victim who lives in  Switzerland asserts rights over the objects or assets which can serve as evidence, their handing  over shall be subject to the condition that the requesting State guarantees their return without  costs after the conclusion of its proceedings.  3 The objects or assets which derive from the offence include:   a. instruments which served to commit the offence;   b. products or profits of the offence, their replacement value and any unlawful advantage;   c. gifts and other benefits which served to instigate the offence or recompense the perpe- trator for the offence, as well as their replacement value.   4 The objects or assets which derive from the offence may be retained in Switzerland if:   a. the victim is habitually resident in Switzerland and they have to be returned to him;   b. an authority asserts rights over them; or   c. a person not involved in the offence and whose claims are not guaranteed by the re- questing State shows probable cause that he has acquired rights over the objects and as- sets in good faith in Switzerland, or, if he is habitually resident in Switzerland, in a for- eign country.   5 Objects or assets mentioned in the first paragraph and which are required for pending criminal  proceedings in Switzerland may also be retained in Switzerland.  6 If a person entitled to the objects or assets makes a claim under paragraph 4, the objects or  assets shall not be handed over until the legal position has been clarified. Objects or assets in  dispute shall be returned to the person entitled only if:   a. the requesting State gives its consent;   b. in the case of paragraph 4 letter b, the authority gives its consent; or   c. the justification of the claim is recognised by a Swiss judicial authority.  7 The handing over of objects and assets is not dependent on the execution of the extradition of  the defendant.      97 Amended by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, in force since 1 Feb. 1997 (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).

Art. 61 Time limit for taking over   If the requesting State does not take the necessary steps to take over the person to be extradited  within ten days of notification of the execution order, he shall be released. This time limit may  be extended up to 30 days in response to a justified request from the requesting State.   Art. 62 Costs  1 In the event of extradition to a foreign country, the Swiss Confederation shall pay the costs of  detention and transportation provided that it is customary in international relations for the  requested State to pay such costs.  2 The personal property of the defendant may be used to cover the costs provided it does not  have to be handed over to the requesting State.

Art. 66 Principle of «Ne bis in idem»107  1 Assistance may be denied if the defendant resides in Switzerland and proceedings are already  pending here regarding the offence to which the request relates.  2 However, assistance may be granted if the proceedings carried out abroad are not directed  solely against the defendant who is residing in Switzerland, or if the execution of the request  serves to exonerate him.108   Art. 67109 Principle of speciality  1 Information and documents obtained through mutual assistance may not be used for investiga- tive purposes or as evidence in the requesting State in any proceedings relating to an offence  for which assistance is not admissible.  2 Any further use shall be subject to approval by the Federal Office. This approval is not neces- sary if:   a. the act to which the request relates constitutes another offence for which mutual assis- tance would be granted; or   b. the foreign criminal proceedings are directed against other persons who have partici- pated in committing the offence.   3 Presence at the mutual assistance proceedings and access to the files shall be permitted under  the same conditions (Art. 65a para.1).

If the recipient so requires, the authority effecting service shall  ask the requesting State to give a written assurance thereof before proof of service is furnished.   Art. 70 Transfer of arrested persons  1 Persons held in custody in Switzerland may be transferred to a foreign authority for the pur- pose of investigations if they are guaranteed safe conduct and if it is guaranteed that they will  be kept in custody and returned to Switzerland on request.  2 Persons who are not indicted abroad and Swiss citizens may be transferred only with their  written consent. This is not necessary if the transfer is required for the execution of a Swiss  request or for confrontation with other persons abroad.   Art. 71111   Art. 72 Maintaining of custody  1 If a detained person is surrendered to the Swiss authorities in the course of an act of assis- tance, the warrant for his arrest issued abroad shall also be valid in Switzerland for the period  of his stay in Switzerland.  2 During transit the defendant shall be kept in custody by virtue of the order for transit given by  the Federal Office.  3 In those cases the detained person may be released only with the agreement of the competent  foreign authority.

If the deadline given is not respected, mutual assistance  may be granted on the points that are not subject to conditions.  3 The Federal Office shall examine if the response of the requesting State satisfies the condi- tions set.      128 Amended by Annex No 30 of the FA of 17 June 2005 on the Federal Administrative Court, in force  since 1 Jan. 2007 (AS 2006 2197; BBl 2001 4202).   129 Inserted by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, in force since 1 Feb. 1997 (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).  130 SR 311.0     Mutual Assistance Act   33   351.1   4 The ruling of the Federal Office is subject to an appeal to the Appeals Chamber of the Federal  Criminal Court within ten days of its notice being given in writing.

Art. 8–84132   Part Four Transfer of Proceedings   Chapter 1 Conditions   Section 1 Prosecution in Switzerland on behalf of another State   Art. 85 Principle  1 At the request of the State in which the offence was committed, Switzerland may prosecute on  its behalf an offence committed abroad if:   a. extradition is not permitted;   b. the defendant has to face charges in Switzerland for other more serious offences and   c. it is guaranteed that the requesting State will not prosecute him for the same offence  after acquittal or completing a sentence in Switzerland.   2 A foreign national who is habitually resident in Switzerland may also be prosecuted in Swit- zerland if his extradition cannot be justified and prosecution in Switzerland seems appropriate  with regard to his personal situation and social rehabilitation.  3 These provisions do not apply if the offence is subject to Swiss jurisdiction on the basis of  another provision.133   Art. 86 Applicable law  1 The offence shall be judged according to Swiss law as if it had been committed in Switzer- land.  2 The foreign law applies if it is more lenient. The court may impose only the sentences provid- ed for by Swiss law.  3 Proceedings in the absence of the defendant are not permitted.      131 Amended by Annex No 30 of the FA of 17 June 2005 on the Federal Administrative Court, in force  since 1 Jan. 2007 (AS 2006 2197; BBl 2001 4202).   132 Repealed by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, with effect from 1 Feb. 1997  (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).   133 Amended by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, in force since 1 Feb. 1997 (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).     Mutual Assistance   34   351.1   Art. 87134 Jurisdiction   If Swiss jurisdiction is not yet established, it shall be determined in accordance with Article 32  CrimPC135.   Section 2 Transfer to Foreign States   Art. 88136 Conditions   Another State may be requested to prosecute an offence subject to Swiss jurisdiction if its laws  allow the prosecution and judicial punishment of the offence and if:   a. the defendant is present there and his extradition to Switzerland is inappropriate or not  permitted; or   b. he is extradited to this State and the transfer of the prosecution offers the prospect of  better social rehabilitation.   Art. 89 Effects  1 If another State prosecutes the offence, the Swiss authorities may not take further measures  against the defendant for the same offence:   a. unless the requested State has given notice that it is not in a position to conclude the  prosecution, or   b. if, according to the decision made in the requested State, the conditions of Article 5 let- ter a or b are met.   2 The effect of the time limitation provisions under Swiss law is suspended provided the pro- ceedings including enforcement of the sentence are ongoing in the requested State.137  3 If the defendant was extradited to the requested State for other offences, this State need not  observe the conditions of extradition in accordance with Article 38 provided it grants the re- quest for prosecution.   Chapter 2 Procedure   Art. 90 Documents   In addition to the documents specified in Article 28 paragraph 3, the record of criminal pro- ceedings as well as any evidentiary productions must be enclosed with the request.   Art. 91 Decision on the request  1 The Federal Office shall decide on whether to accept the foreign request after consulting the  prosecuting authorities.      134 Amended by Annex 1 No II 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 5 Oct. 2007, in force since  1 Jan. 2011 (AS 2010 1881; BBl 2006 1085).   135 SR 312.0  136 Amended by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, in force since 1 Feb. 1997 (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).  137 The suspension of the effects of the time limitation provisions has been abolished by Art. 97 ff. of the   Swiss Criminal Code (SR 311.0) and time limits for execution have been replaced by an extension of  the regular time limit (AS 2006 3459; BBl 1999 1979).     Mutual Assistance Act   35   351.1   2 If it accepts the request, it shall transmit the file to the prosecuting authority and notify the  requesting State and the person concerned.  3 The decision does not create an obligation to institute criminal proceedings.  4 The Federal Office may refuse to assume responsibility for the prosecution if there is good  cause not to do so or if the seriousness of the offence does not justify it.   Art. 92 Foreign investigative measures   Any investigative measure carried out by the authorities of the requesting State under its law  shall be considered equivalent to a corresponding Swiss investigative measure.   Art. 93 Costs  1 The costs of the proceedings set by the requesting State shall be added to the costs of the  proceedings in Switzerland and collected. They are not refunded to the requesting State.  2 The cantons shall have a right of disposal over any fines paid and, subject to the provisions of  the Federal Act of 19 March 2004138 on the Division of Forfeited Assets, over forfeited ob- jects.139  3 The requested State shall be notified of the costs of the proceedings incurred in Switzerland if  the requested State takes over the prosecution. Their reimbursement shall not be requested.   Part Five Enforcement of Criminal Judgments   Chapter 1 Conditions   Section 1 Enforcement by Switzerland   Art. 94 Principle  1 Final and enforceable criminal judgments from another State may be enforced at that State's  request if:   a. the convicted person is habitually resident in Switzerland or has to face charges here for  a serious offence;   b. the subject of the conviction is an offence committed abroad which, if committed in  Switzerland, would be punishable here, and   c. enforcement in Switzerland seems to be appropriate for one of the reasons specified in  Article 85 paragraphs 1 and 2 or likely to be barred in the requesting State.   2 Sentences imposed abroad shall be executed provided they do not exceed the maximum  penalty provided by Swiss law for a corresponding offence. Sentences that remain below the  minimum penalty according to Swiss law may be executed.  3 …140  4 Fines as well as costs arising from proceedings under Article 63 may also be enforced if the  convicted person is habitually resident abroad but has assets at his disposal in Switzerland and  if the requesting State grants reciprocity.      138 SR 312.4  139 Amended by Annex No 2 of the FA of 19 March 2004 on the Division of Forfeited Assets, in force   since 1 August 2004 (AS 2004 3503; BBl 2002 441).  140 Repealed by No I of the FA of 4 Oct. 1996, with effect from 1 Feb. 1997   (AS 1997 114; BBl 1995 III 1).     Mutual Assistance   36   351.1   Art. 95 Inadmissibility of the enforcement order  1 The order permitting enforcement (exequatur) may not be issued if:   a.141 the conviction took place at a time when, under Swiss law, the prosecution would have  been time barred;   b. the sentence would have been time barred under Swiss law if a Swiss authority had im- posed it at the same time, or   c. the offence is also subject to Swiss jurisdiction and no sentence could be imposed under  Swiss law for other reasons.   2 Decisions on costs shall be declared enforceable only if the costs are to be paid to the State.   Art. 96 Refusal to enforce   The court shall refuse to enforce in whole or in part if:   a. the convicted person has incurred a sentence involving deprivation of liberty in Swit- zerland for other offences and enforcement as requested would result in an obviously  more severe punishment than if the offences taken as a whole were judged in Switzer- land, or   b. the execution of any of the accessory criminal measures in Switzerland is not permitted,  or   c. it is of the opinion that the convicted person has good reason to oppose the enforcement  of a judgment or penalty order that was issued in his absence and which is no longer  subject to a right of objection or appeal under the law of the requesting State.   Art. 97 Binding force of the findings in fact   In assessing criminal liability and the possibility of prosecution under Swiss law, the court shall  be bound to the findings in fact on which the decision relies. If they do not suffice, the gather- ing of evidence may be ordered.   Art. 98 Effects of enforcement   If Switzerland assumes responsibility for enforcement, no criminal proceedings against the  convicted person for the same offence may be instituted or continued here.   Art. 99 Use of Swiss institutions by foreign States  1 If the conditions of Article 94 paragraph 1 are not met, sentences involving restriction of  liberty that have been imposed on a non-Swiss national in another State may be enforced in  Switzerland under Swiss law if the other State cannot execute them itself.  2 In this case, the final and enforceable foreign decision shall constitute the legal basis for the  restriction of the convicted person’s liberty.      141 The amendment in accordance with Art. 97 ff. of the Swiss Criminal Code (SR 311.0) contains a  limitation system (AS 2006 3459; BBl 1999 1979).     Mutual Assistance Act   37   351.1   3 If persons are surrendered to Switzerland in accordance with paragraph 1, then unless ar- rangements to the contrary have been made with the competent authorities of the surrendering  State, they may neither be prosecuted nor punished nor extradited to a third State by the Swiss  authorities for offences that they committed before their surrender and that were not the subject  of their conviction. These effects shall expire ten days after release on parole or final release  from the institution.  4 The Federal Council shall regulate the details.   Section 2 Transfer to a Foreign State   Art. 100 Principle   Another State may be requested to enforce a Swiss criminal judgment if:   a. it is certain to accept the binding force of the judgment in accordance with Article 97,  and   b. the transfer of enforcement is likely to improve the prospects of the social rehabilitation  of the convicted person or if Switzerland cannot obtain his extradition.   Art. 101 Conditions for transfer  1 The convicted person who is detained in Switzerland may only be transferred with a view to  enforcement of the judgment under Article 100 if he agrees and if the requested State is ex- pected to accept the conditions set by the Federal Office.  2 The convicted person may be transferred without his consent if an international agreement  ratified by Switzerland so provides. In this case the conditions and effects of the transfer are  regulated exclusively by the said international agreement.142   Art. 102 Effects of transfer  1 If another State enforces the criminal judgment, the Swiss authority shall abandon enforce- ment provided the requested State has not given notice that it will not conclude it.  2 The convicted person may be taken into custody so as to ensure his transfer.  3 Article 89 paragraphs 2 and 3 apply by analogy.   Chapter 2 Procedure   Section 1 Request   Art. 103 Documents   In addition to the documents specified in Article 28 paragraph 3, the following shall be en- closed with a request:   a. the original or an officially authenticated copy of the judgment with a certificate attest- ing that it is legally enforceable;   b. a certificate attesting the period of detention undergone in the requesting State;      142 Inserted by art. 2 of the FD of 19 Dec. 2003, in force since 1 Oct. 2004 (AS 2004 4161 4162;  BBl 2002 4340).     Mutual Assistance   38   351.1   c. if the requested State so requests, the original or officially authenticated copy of the  criminal file.   Art. 104 Decision on the request  1 After consulting with the authority which will execute the request, the Federal Office shall  decide whether to accept the foreign request. If it accepts, it shall convey the file and its opin- ion to the executing authority and inform the requesting State. Article 91 paragraph 4 applies  by analogy.  2 If there is Swiss jurisdiction and if a sentence which is more severe than the one provided by  Swiss law was imposed abroad, the prosecution may be taken over instead of the enforcement  of the judgment if the requesting State so requests.   Section 2 Procedure of Exequatur   Art. 105143 Competent judge   The competent court under Article 32 CrimPC144 shall inform the convicted person of the  applicable procedure, hear him on the matter, as well as his counsel, and decide on enforce- ment.   Art. 106 Declaration of exequatur  1 The court shall examine ex officio whether the conditions for enforcement are met and gather  the necessary evidence.  2 If the conditions are met, the court shall declare that the decision may be enforced and take  the measures necessary for enforcement.  3 The decision shall be made in the form of a judgment containing a statement of the rationale  therefor. Cantonal law shall provide for an appeal.   Section 3 Enforcement   Art. 107 Execution of the sentence  1 The sentence determined by the court shall be executed in accordance with Swiss law.  2 Execution shall be discontinued if the decision is no longer enforceable in the requesting  State.  3 If enforcement relates solely to a decision on costs, the amounts collected after deduction of  the costs incurred shall be transferred to the requesting State if it guarantees reciprocity.   Art. 108 Costs   In addition to the costs for the execution of the sentence, the costs of exequatur proceedings  and other enforcement measures shall also be regarded as costs in accordance with Article 31.      143 Amended by Annex 1 No II 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 5 Oct. 2007, in force since  1 Jan. 2011 (AS 2010 1881; BBl 2006 1085).   144 SR 312.0     Mutual Assistance Act   39   351.1   Part Six Final Provisions   Art. 109 Repeal and amendment of current law  1 The Federal Act of 22 January 1892145 on Extradition to Foreign States is hereby repealed.  2–3 146   Art. 110 Transitional provisions  1 Extradition proceedings which are pending on the commencement of this Act shall be com- pleted in accordance with the procedural provisions of the Federal Act of 22 January 1892147  on Extradition to Foreign States.  2 The prosecution and the enforcement of decisions in accordance with Parts Four and Five of  this Act may be taken over only if the offence to which the request refers was committed after  the commencement of this Act.  3 Requests for extradition or other assistance in relation to offences which under Article 75bis of  the Swiss Criminal Code148 or Article 56bis of the Military Criminal Code149 are not subject to a  time limit may be granted by the Federal Council even if, on the date that these provisions  come into force, the prosecution or the penalty is time barred.   Art. 110a150 Transitional provision for the amendment of 4 October 1996   The provisions of the amendment of 4 October 1996 to this Act apply to all proceedings pend- ing when such provisions come into force.   Art. 110b151 Transitional provision for the amendment of 17 June 2005   The previous law applies to appeal proceedings against rulings issued by the court of first  instance before this amendment comes into force.   Art. 111 Implementation  1 The Federal Council shall issue the implementing provisions.  2 It may establish a standing committee to examine the question of whether the seriousness of  the offence justifies the disclosure of classified information. The members of the committee are  bound to secrecy like officials of the Confederation.

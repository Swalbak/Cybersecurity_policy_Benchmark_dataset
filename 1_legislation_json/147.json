(2) Pursuant to this Code, criminal liability shall be imposed by sentencing  adults who committed criminal offences on the basis of determined guilt.       No Criminal Offence or Sentence Without the Statute  Article 2      No sentence or other criminal sanction shall be imposed on any person for  committing an offence that did not constitute a criminal offence under the statute prior to  being committed, and for which a sentence was not prescribed by the statute.       System of Legal Criminal Sanctions  Article 3      (1) Criminal sanctions shall include: sentences, admonitory sanctions and  safety measures.     (2) The imposition of a sentence shall be prescribed for the perpetration of any  criminal offence, which shall be imposed on the perpetrator (hereinafter, the perpetrator)  in proportion to the weight of the committed act and his guilt. Admonitory sanctions  instead of a sentence and, in addition to a sentence or admonitory sanction, safety  measures may be imposed on the perpetrator under the conditions determined in the  general part of this Code.     (3) If the perpetrator has been convicted of a criminal offence, he may be  subject to the confiscation of property and to the publication of the judgement under the  conditions determined by the present Code.        (4)When rules determine that because of the conviction for the criminal offence  the offender’s (hereinafter, the offender) rights or certain rights shall be revoked or  limited in addition to the imposed criminal sanctions, the prohibition referred to in the  previous Article shall apply for such legal consequences as well.       Chapter Two     APPLICATION OF THE PENAL CODE     1. Personal Application     Equal Application of the Penal Code  Article 4      (1) If not otherwise determined in this Penal Code, the Penal Code shall apply  equally to all adults irrespective of the fact whether they are citizens (hereinafter, the  citizen) of the Republic of Slovenia or foreign citizens (hereinafter, the foreign citizen).     (2) The criminal law provision, which exceptionally refers only to the citizens of  the Republic of Slovenia, shall not apply to the citizens of other European Union  Member States and other aliens.     (3) If the criminal law provision applies exceptionally only to the aliens, it may  determine when the citizens of other European Union Member States shall not be  considered aliens.       Special Personal Application  Article 5      (1) If the statute determines that only persons with special characteristics,  rights, or status shall be punished for a criminal offence, then the penal law shall apply  to all such persons.     (2) Special penal laws shall determine the criminal liability of minors  (hereinafter, the minor) and legal persons.     (3) A special law that defines the criminal liability of minors may also determine  that persons, who were already adults at the time of committing a criminal offence but  under the age of 21 (young adults), may be imposed criminal sanctions for minors  instead of a sentence with regard to their personal development.       Exclusion of Personal Application  Article 6         (1) The penal law shall not be applied to acts of persons whose criminal liability  has been excluded because of immunity pursuant to the provisions of the constitution or  international law regulations.     (2) When the law determines that the perpetrator shall be prosecuted for a  criminal offence on the complaint or private action, then such provision shall not be  applied to the person, against whom the injured party (hereinafter, the injured party) did  not submit a complaint or a private action, or withdrew it.       2. Applicability in time     Application of a Later, Least Severe Law for the Perpetrator  Article 7      (1) The perpetrator of a criminal offence shall be subject to the statutory  provisions which were applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.     (2) If the law is altered subsequent to the committing of a criminal offence (one  or more times), provisions providing for the least severe sentence shall apply to the  perpetrator.     (3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply also in relation to the  applicability in time of regulations, to which the Penal Code refers. If because of the  change of such regulation the criminal offence is not only defined differently, but also  represents another unlawful action, the Penal Code shall be changed as well and the  provisions providing for the least severe sentence shall apply to the perpetrator,  because his act is not defined as a criminal offence.       Laws of Limited Duration  Article 8      The Penal Code or other regulation, to which the Penal Code refers, that should  be valid only for a limited duration, may be applied unless otherwise determined also  after the expiry of the duration if the criminal offence was committed, when the Penal  Code or the regulation was still valid.       Simultaneous Application of the General Part of This Penal Code  and Other Penal Laws   Article 9     (1) The provisions of the general part of this Penal Code shall apply also to  criminal offences, defined by other laws or ratified and issued international agreements  or European Union acts, unless otherwise determined therein.        (2) If the laws that determine the criminal liability of minors, legal persons, or  other special types of offenders or acts (special penal laws) simultaneously also mention  the application of the general part of this Penal Code in their general provisions, then the  existing Penal Code shall be applied.       3. Territorial Application     Application of the Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia to Any Person  Who Commits a Criminal Offence in Its Territory   Article 10     (1) The Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia shall apply to any person who  commits a criminal offense in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia.     (2) The Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia shall also apply to any person  who commits a criminal offence on a domestic vessel regardless of its location at the  time of the committing of the offence.

Application of the Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia to Citizens  of the Republic of Slovenia Who Committed a Criminal Offense Abroad   Article 12     The Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia shall be applicable to any citizen of  the Republic of Slovenia who commits any criminal offence abroad other than those  specified in the preceding article.       Application of the Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia to Foreign Citizens  Who Committed a Criminal Offense Abroad     Article 13     (1) The Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia shall apply to any foreign citizen  who has, in a foreign country, committed a criminal offence against the Republic of  Slovenia or any of its citizens, even though the offences in question are not covered by  Article 11 of this Penal Code.     (2) The Penal Code of the Republic of Slovenia shall also be applicable to any  foreign citizen who has, in a foreign country, committed a criminal offence against a third  country or any of its citizens if he has been apprehended in the territory of the Republic  of Slovenia, but was not extradited to the foreign country. In such cases, the court shall  not impose a sentence on the perpetrator heavier than the sentence prescribed by the  law of the country, in which the offence was committed.       Special Conditions for Prosecution  Article 14      (1) If, in cases under Article 10 and indent 1 of Article 11 of this Penal Code, the  criminal procedure has been initiated or discontinued in a foreign country, the  perpetrator may be prosecuted in the Republic of Slovenia only by permission of the  Minister (hereinafter, the Minister) of Justice with the notice, under which conditions the  prosecution shall not violate the double jeopardy.     (2) In cases under Articles 12 and 13 of this Penal Code, the perpetrator shall  not be prosecuted:  1) if he has served the sentence imposed on him in the foreign country or if it was   decided in accordance with an international agreement that the sentence imposed in  the foreign country is to be served in the Republic of Slovenia;   2) if he has been acquitted by a foreign court or if his sentence has been remitted or the  execution of the sentence has fallen under the statute of limitations;   3) if, according to foreign law, the criminal offence concerned may only be prosecuted  upon the complaint of the injured party and the latter has not been filed.      (3) In cases under Articles 12 and 13 the perpetrator shall be prosecuted only  insofar as his conduct constitutes a criminal offence in the country where it was  committed.     (4) If, in the case under Article 12 of this Penal Code, the criminal offence  committed against the Republic of Slovenia or the citizen thereof does not constitute a  criminal offence under the law of the country where it was committed, the perpetrator of  such an offence may be prosecuted only by permission of the Minister of Justice of the  Republic of Slovenia.     (5) If, in all other cases except the cases referred to in indent 2 of Article 11 and  paragraph 4 of this Article of this Penal Code, the criminal offence is not punished in the  country where it was committed, the perpetrator may be prosecuted only by permission     of the Minister of Justice and with the proviso that, according to the general principles of  law recognised by the international community, the offence in question constituted a  criminal act at the time it was committed.     (6) In the case under Article 10, the prosecution of a foreign person may be  transferred to another country under the conditions provided by the statute.       Credit for Detention Abroad  Article 15      Any period of detention and confinement during the extradition procedure, or  sentence of imprisonment served under the judgement of a foreign court, if it becomes  known at a later time, shall be credited towards the sentence imposed for the same  criminal offence by the domestic court. If sentences are of different types, the domestic  court shall decide on the appropriate method of deduction of the period served abroad. If  the convicted person server together more sentences than they were imposed on him in  the judgement before the domestic court, the surplus shall deem him wrongfully  convicted.       Chapter Three     GENERAL PROVISIONS ON CRIMINAL OFFENCE     1. Criminal Offence and Perpetrator     Criminal Offence  Article 16      A criminal offence shall mean unlawful conduct that the statute due to urgent  protection of legal values determines as a criminal offence, while defining the elements  thereof and the sentence for the guilty perpetrator.       Mode of Committing a Criminal Offence  Article 17      (1) A criminal offence may be committed by voluntary act or by omission.     (2) A criminal offence may be committed by omission only when the perpetrator  has failed to perform the act, which he was obliged to perform.     (3) A criminal offence may be committed by omission, though the offence does  not constitute criminal omission under the terms of the statute, when the perpetrator has  not prevented the occurrence of an unlawful consequence. In such cases, the  perpetrator shall be punished for omission only if he was obliged to prevent the     occurrence of the unlawful consequence and insofar as the occurrence of such a  consequence could not have been prevented even had he performed any positive act.       Time of Committing a Criminal Offence  Article 18      A criminal offence is committed at the time the perpetrator was acting or was  obliged to act irrespective of when the unlawful consequence occurred.       Place of Committing a Criminal Offence  Article 19      (1) A criminal offence is committed both in the place where the perpetrator was  acting and in the place where the unlawful consequence occurred.     (2) The criminal attempt shall be deemed to have been committed both in the  place where the perpetrator was acting and in the place where, according to his  intention, the unlawful consequence should or could have occurred.       Perpetrator and Accomplice  Article 20      (1) Perpetrator of a criminal offence is any person, who commits it personally or  by using and directing the actions of another person (indirect perpetrator).     (2) Perpetrator of a criminal offence is also any person who together with the  other person commits a criminal offence by wilfully collaborating in the execution thereof  or in any other way decisively contributes thereto (the accomplice (hereinafter, the  accomplice)).       Limits of Criminal Liability in Relation to the Age of Perpetrators  Article 21      (1) Any person who committed a criminal offence when he was under the age of  14 years (a child), cannot be a perpetrator of a criminal offence.       Self-defence  Article 22      (1) An act committed in self-defence shall not constitute a criminal offence.        (2) Self-defence shall be understood to mean such defence as is absolutely  necessary for the perpetrator to avert an immediate and unlawful attack on himself or on  any other person.     (3) In the event that the perpetrator has acted beyond the limits of justifiable self  defence, his sentence may be reduced; if he has so acted by reason of great excitement  or fright provoked by the attack, the sentence may be withdrawn.       Coercion  Article 23      Any act committed under coercion, which the perpetrator was not able to  withstand, shall not constitute a criminal offence.       2. Guilt and Punishability of Perpetrators     Guilt  Article 24      (1) Criminal liability shall be imposed against the person with the court  judgement, which alleges that he is either guilty of the committing or omission,  determined by law as a criminal offence, and on the basis thereof it shall impose a lawful  criminal sanction or remit the sentence.     (2) The perpetrator shall be guilty if he has committed a criminal offence with  intent or by negligence and when he must have or could have been aware that his  conduct was unlawful.       Intent  Article 25      A criminal offence shall be committed with an intent if the perpetrator was aware  of his act and wanted to perform it, or was aware that an unlawful consequence might  result from his conduct but he nevertheless let such consequence to occur.       Negligence  Article 26      (1) A criminal offence shall be committed through negligence if the perpetrator  does not act with the required carefulness, with which he has to or is able to perform an  act or omit to perform an act under the given circumstances and with respect to his  personal attributes.        (2) A criminal offence shall not be committed with an intent but through  negligence, when the perpetrator was aware that an unlawful consequence might result  from his conduct but believed that it would not occur, and then the consequence occurs,  because he was reckless and did not prevent it in due time.     (3) A criminal offence shall not be committed through negligence if the  perpetrator despite the required carefulness causes the unlawful consequence, which  could not have been expected or prevented.       Punishability of Negligence  Article 27      (1) The perpetrator shall be punished for the criminal offence committed through  negligence only if the law so determines.     (2) None of the penal law provisions may be applied in the manner, in which the  perpetrator, who commits a criminal offence through negligence, would not be punished  with a less severe sentence than for the committing of an equal criminal offence with  intent.     (3) The court may remit a sentence to the perpetrator, who committed a criminal  offence through negligence, if the consequences of the act concern the perpetrator to  the extent that the imposition of a sentence in such a case obviously would not be  justifiable.       Liability for Graver Consequences  Article 28      If a graver consequence has resulted from the committing of a criminal offence,  for which there is a heavier sentence provided under the statute, such a sentence may  be imposed on the perpetrator on condition that he has acted negligently.       Responsibility  Article 29      (1) Any person who was not found responsible at the time of committing a  criminal offence shall not be guilty.     (2) The perpetrator, who at the time of committing a criminal offence was not  capable to understand the meaning of his act or to control his because of mental  disorder or mental underdevelopment, shall not be held responsible for his actions.     (3) A reduced sentence may be applied to the perpetrator, whose ability to  understand the meaning of his act or to control his conduct were substantially     diminished due to any of the states of mind under the preceding paragraph, or due to  any other permanent or severe mental disturbance.     (4) The perpetrator, whose insanity was self-induced through indulgence in  alcohol, drugs, or in any other ways, shall be deemed to be criminally liable if his guilt,  which constitutes a statutory element of the offence in question, is established.       Mistake of Fact  Article 30      (1) The perpetrator who, at the time of the committing of a criminal offence, was  not aware of a statutory element of such an offence, shall not be held liable under  criminal law.     (1) A criminal offence shall be deemed to be committed as a mistake of fact if  the perpetrator at the time of committing of a criminal offence was not aware of a  statutory element of the circumstances, or he erroneously believed that the  circumstances were present which, if they were true, would justify his conduct.     (3) For a criminal offence committed out of negligence, the guilt of the  perpetrator shall not be excluded if he was in error regarding the circumstances, which  he should and could have been aware of within the limits of required carefulness.       Mistake of Law  Article 31      (1) The perpetrator of a criminal offence shall not be held to be liable under  criminal law if, for reasons which can be justified, he did not know that such an offence  was unlawful.     (2) There are no justified reasons referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article if the  perpetrator was not aware of legal regulations, with which he could have familiarised  himself under the same conditions as other people in his broader environment, or he  should have known special legal regulations in relation to his work, role, or general  position.     (2) If the perpetrator committed a criminal offence deemed as a mistake of law,  which he could have avoided, the court may reduce the sentence.       Necessity  Article 32      (1) Any person who shall commit an act, which shall have elements of a criminal  offence to avert an immediate threat to his life, physical integrity, personal freedom or     property necessary for survival, which he has not caused himself, shall not be found  guilty if such threat could not have been averted in any other way, and the perpetrator  was not obliged to expose to it as well.     (2) Any person who shall commit a criminal offense out of necessity under the  conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in order to avert the threat to other  values recognised by law, shall not be punished provided that the evil thus incurred does  not exceed the evil which threatened him.     (3) A reduced sentence may be imposed on any perpetrator who in cases under  paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, by reason of negligence, has caused the danger  himself or whose conduct has exceeded the limits of necessity, and if the perpetrator  has acted beyond such limits under particularly mitigating circumstances, his sentence  may be withdrawn.       Limits of Punishability  Article 33      (1) If the statute determines that an act with elements of a criminal offence due  to special circumstances, relations, or characteristics of the perpetrator is not punishable  by law, the perpetrator shall not be prosecuted because of such criminal offence.     (2) If because of the exclusion of punishability under paragraph 1 of this Article  the perpetrator is not criminally liable, this shall not present an obstacle for another legal  liability to be imposed against him for the committed criminal offence.       3. Attempt of Criminal Offence     Attempt  Article 34      (1) Any person, who intentionally initiated a criminal offence but did not  complete it, shall be punished for the criminal attempt, provided that such an attempt  involved a criminal offence, for which the sentence of three years' imprisonment or a  heavier sentence may be imposed under the statute; attempts involving any other  criminal offences shall be punishable only when so expressly stipulated by the statute.     (2) Against the perpetrator, who attempted to commit a criminal offence, the  sentence shall be applied within the limits prescribed for such an offence or it may be  reduced.       Inappropriate Attempt  Article 35         If the perpetrator has attempted to commit a criminal offence by inappropriate  means or to harm an inappropriate object, his sentence may be withdrawn.       Voluntary Abandonment of Attempt  Article 36      (1) If the perpetrator has attempted to commit a criminal offence but voluntarily  desisted to go through with it, his sentence may be withdrawn.     (2) If the perpetrator voluntarily desists from committing a criminal offence, he  shall be punished for those acts, which present some other independent criminal  offence.       4. Participation in Criminal Offence     Criminal Solicitation  Article 37      (1) Any person who intentionally solicits another person to commit a criminal  offence shall be punished as if he himself had committed it.     2) Any person who intentionally solicits another person to commit a criminal  offence, for which the sentence of three years' imprisonment or a heavier sentence may  be imposed under the statute, shall be punished for the criminal attempt even if the  committing of such an offence had never been attempted.       Criminal Support  Article 38      (1) Any person who intentionally supports another person in the committing of a  criminal offence shall be punished as if he himself had committed it, or his sentence  shall be reduced, as the case may be.     (2) Support in the committing of a criminal offence shall be deemed to be  constituted, in the main, by the following: counselling or instructing the perpetrator, on  how to carry out the criminal offence; providing the perpetrator with instruments of  criminal offence or removing the obstacles for the committing of criminal offence; a priori  promises to conceal the perpetrator’s criminal offence or any traces thereof; instruments  of the criminal offence or objects gained through the committing of criminal offence.       Punishability of Those Soliciting or Supporting a Criminal Attempt  Article 39         If the perpetration of a criminal offence falls short of the intended consequence,  those soliciting (hereinafter, the instigator) or supporting (hereinafter, the aide) the  criminal attempt shall be punished according to the prescriptions that apply to the  criminal attempt.       Limits of Punishability of Accomplices  Article 40      (1) The perpetrator, the instigator and the aide shall be punished for criminal  offences within the limits of their intent.     (2) If the instigator or the aide voluntarily prevented the intended criminal  offence from being accomplished, his sentence may be withdrawn.     (3) Personal relations, attributes and circumstances, on the basis of which the  guilt or punishability are excluded by law or sentence remitted, reduced or extended,  shall be taken into consideration only with respect to the accomplice (hereinafter, the  accomplice), by whom such relations, attributes and circumstances were determined.       Liability of Members and Leaders of Criminal Organisation  Article 41      (1) A severer sentence may be prescribed for an intentional criminal offence  with a prescribed sentence of more than three years of imprisonment if the criminal  offence was committed within a criminal organisation.     (2) A member (hereinafter: the member) of a criminal organisation with at least  three persons shall be punished with a severer sentence under paragraph 1 of this  Article if he commits the criminal offence to implement the criminal organisation’s plan in  association with at least one member as an accessory or accomplice.     (3) In the case referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the leader of the  criminal organisation, who led the implementation of the criminal plan or had at his  disposal illegally gained property benefits at the time of committing the criminal offence  based on the criminal plan, notwithstanding whether he participated at its  implementation directly as the perpetrator or accessory pursuant to Articles 20 or 37 and  38 of this Penal Code, shall be punished the same as the perpetrator.       5. Punishability of Legal Persons     Liability of Legal Persons for Criminal Offences  Article 42         (1) Criminal liability shall be imposed on a legal person for criminal offences,  which the perpetrator commits in his name, on his behalf or in his favour, providing that  the statute, which regulates liability of legal persons for criminal offences, determines  that the legal person is liable for the criminal offence in question.     (2) Criminal liability of legal persons shall not exclude liability of natural persons  as perpetrators, instigators or aides in the same criminal offence.     (3) The law, which regulates liability of legal persons for criminal offences, shall  determine the conditions for criminal liability of legal persons, sentences, admonitory  sanctions or safety measures, and legal consequences of the conviction for legal  persons.

(3) In fixing the sentence of a perpetrator who committed a criminal offence  after he had already been convicted or had served his sentence, or after the  implementation of his sentence had been barred by time, or after his sentence has been  remitted (recidivism), the court shall pay particular attention to whether the earlier  offence is of the same type as the new one, whether both offences were committed for  the same motive and to the time, which has lapsed since the former conviction or since  the serving, withdrawing, remitting or barring of the sentence.       Reduction of Sentence  Article 50      The court may fix the sentence of the perpetrator within the limits of statutory  terms or may apply a less severe type of sentence under the following conditions:  - if the possibility of a reduced sentence for the perpetrator is provided for by the   statute;  - if the court ascertains that special mitigating circumstances are present, which justify   the imposition of a reduced sentence.       Limits of the Reduction of Sentence  Article 51      When conditions for the reduction of a sentence, as outlined in the preceding  Article, are met, the sentence shall be reduced within the following limits:  1) if a prison sentence for a term of fifteen years is prescribed as the lowest limit for a   specific offence, such a limit may be lowered by up to ten years of imprisonment;  2) if a prison sentence for a term of three or more years is prescribed as the lowest limit   for a specific offence, such a limit may be lowered by up to one year of  imprisonment;   3) if a prison sentence for a term of one year is prescribed as the lowest limit for a  specific offence, such a limit may be lowered by up to three months of imprisonment;   4) if a prison sentence for a term of less than one year is prescribed as the lowest limit  for a specific offence, such a limit may be lowered by up to fifteen days of  imprisonment;   5) if a prison sentence is prescribed as the lowest limit without the statutory terms being  determined, a fine may be imposed in place of the prison sentence;   6) if a fine is imposed as the principal sentence, it may be reduced by up to fifteen daily  amounts.        Remission of Sentence  Article 52         (1) The court may remit a sentence when it is so expressly provided for by the  statute.     (2) In cases when the court is entitled to remit the sentence, it need not apply  the provisions prescribing the limits of the reduction of the sentence.       Concurrence of Criminal Offences  Article 53      (1) If the perpetrator is being tried for two or more criminal offences  simultaneously, the court shall first determine the sentence for each offence concerned  and thereafter shall impose a combined sentence for all criminal offences in  concurrence.     2) The combined sentence shall be imposed under the following conditions:  1) if the sentence of imprisonment for a term of thirty years has been determined for two   or more concurrent criminal offences under paragraph 2 of Article 46 of this Penal  Code, the combined sentence of life imprisonment shall be imposed;   2) if the sentence of imprisonment has been determined for all concurrent offences, the  combined sentence shall exceed each sentence determined for a particular offence  but may neither exceed the total sum of all sentences imposed for the concurrent  offences nor may it exceed twenty years of imprisonment;   3) if a prison sentence for a term not exceeding three years is prescribed by the law for  all concurrent criminal offences, the combined sentence shall not exceed a term of  eight years;   4) if a fine has been fixed for all concurrent criminal offences, the court shall increase  the maximum amount of the fine, whereby it may neither exceed the total sum of  fines fixed for each concurrent offence nor the total of three hundred and sixty daily  instalments or EUR 15.000,00; if any of the criminal offences have been committed  out of greed, the increased fine may not exceed the total of one thousand five  hundred daily instalments or EUR 50.000,00;   5) if a prison sentence has been determined for some concurrent criminal offences and  a fine for others, a single combined sentence of imprisonment and a single  compound fine shall be imposed under points 2, 3 and 4 of this paragraph;   6) if more than one accessory sentence has been fixed for more than one concurrent  criminal offence of the same type, a compound accessory sentence shall be imposed  with the proviso that it shall exceed neither the total sum of the aforementioned  sentences nor the maximum limit provided for the sentence in question.      (3) If a prison sentence for a term of over ten years has been determined for at  least three criminal offences, a combined prison sentence of thirty years may be  imposed.     (4) The accessory sentence shall be imposed on the perpetrator even if it is  prescribed for only one of the concurrent criminal offences; if more than one fine has     been fixed, a single compound fine shall be imposed under point 4 of paragraph 2 of the  this Article.       Continued Criminal Offence  Article 54      (1) Any person who commits or attempts to commit simultaneously or  successively two or more equal, or of the same type, criminal offences against property  out of greed or to cause damage, which with regard to the place, method and other  equal circumstances represent a uniform activity, shall commit a continued criminal  offence.     (2) The provisions on concurrence under the preceding Article of this Penal  Code shall not be applied for the continued criminal offence, but a combined sentence  within the limits of the sentence, prescribed for the gravest criminal offence, shall be  imposed for all criminal offences together, whereby in addition to the principal sentence  of imprisonment a mandatory accessory sentence in the form of a fine shall be imposed  as well.     (3) The perpetrator, who gains major property benefits or causes major or great  loss of property under paragraph 1 of this Article, because of which a severer sentence  is prescribed for the criminal offence, shall be imposed this severer sentence under  paragraph 2 of this Article, if he wanted to gain such property benefits or cause such  damage with simultaneously or successively committed criminal offences.       Sentencing of Convicted Person  Article 55      (1) In the event of a perpetrator being tried for a criminal offence committed  either prior to the commencement of or during the serving of an earlier sentence, a  combined sentence shall be imposed on him for all criminal offences pursuant to Article  53; the court shall take into account the fact that his former sentences have already  been fixed. The sentence or part of it, which the convicted person has already served,  shall be counted as part of the sentence imposed.     (2) For a criminal offence committed during the period of the serving of a  sentence in prison, the perpetrator shall be sentenced irrespective of earlier sentences if  the application of provisions under Article 53 would lead to an unreasonably short term  left to be served.     (3) A disciplinary sanction shall be imposed on a convicted person who during  the period of his serving a sentence in prison committed a criminal offence, for which a  fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year is prescribed by the statute.         Credit of Time Spent in Detention and of Imprisonment Served Under the Earlier  Sentence  Article 56      (1) Time spent on remand shall be counted as a part of the sentence of  imprisonment or shall be credited towards a fine.     (2) If criminal proceedings are initiated against the defendant (hereinafter, the  defendant) for committing more than one criminal offence, when he has not been  detained for any of these offences, the time spent on remand shall be counted as part of  the sentence of imprisonment and fine imposed for the criminal offence .     (3) A term of imprisonment, a fine, or any other criminal sanction, which the  convicted person has served for committing a petty offence as well as any prison term or  term of detention applied for the violation of military discipline, shall be counted as part  of the sentence, provided that the elements of criminal conduct also constitute a petty  offence or a violation of military discipline.     (4) One day of remand, one day of confinement, one day of imprisonment shall  have the same credit as part of the sentence as two daily instalments of the fine.       Chapter Five     ADMONITORY SANCTIONS     1. Suspended Sentence     General Provisions on Suspended Sentences  Article 57      (1) Under conditions set forth by this Penal Code, a suspended sentence may  be applied by the court against the perpetrator of a criminal offence instead of a  sentence.     (2) In applying a suspended sentence, the court shall pass a sentence which  will not be carried out unless the offender, within a term determined by the court and of  not less than one and not more than five years (the term of suspension), commits a  further criminal offence.     (3) The court may condition the suspension of the sentence upon the restitution  by the offender of property gained through committing of the criminal offence, the  indemnification for damages caused by the criminal offence, or the performance of other  obligations prescribed under Criminal Law. The time limit to fulfil such obligations shall  be determined by the court within the limits of the term of suspension.        (4) Safety measures applied in addition to the suspended sentence shall be  enforced.       Suspension of Sentence  Article 58      (1) The court may suspend the sentence when the perpetrator has been  punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or by a fine.     (2) Sentence may not be suspended for criminal offences, for which a prison  sentence for a term of more than three years is prescribed by the statute.     (3) The court shall suspend a sentence if, in considering the personality of the  perpetrator, his past behaviour, his conduct after committing the offence, his degree of  criminal liability, and other circumstances, under which the offence was committed, it  comes to the conclusion that it is reasonable to expect that the perpetrator will not  commit any further criminal offences.     (4) If the suspended sentence includes any accessory sentences, the court may  decide that such sentences are to be carried out.       Revoking of Suspended Sentence due to Further Criminal Offence  Article 59      (1) A suspended sentence shall be revoked if, during the term of suspension,  the offender commits one or more criminal offences, for which the court has imposed a  prison sentence of not less than two years.     (2) In the event of the offender committing one or more criminal offences during  the term of suspension, for which a prison sentence of less than two years or a fine have  been imposed, the court shall decide whether to revoke the suspension after considering  all the circumstances referring to the criminal offences committed and to the perpetrator,  and in particular the similarity of the crimes committed, their significance and the  motives, for which they were committed. In so acting, the court shall be bound by the  proviso that no sentence shall be suspended if, for criminal offences decided in the  judgement involving a suspended sentence and for criminal offences committed anew,  the perpetrator is punished by more than two years of imprisonment (paragraph 1 of the  preceding Article).     (3) In cases involving the revoking of a suspended sentence, the court shall  impose a combined sentence, which takes into account the criminal offences committed  earlier as well as the new offences, in accordance with Article 53 of the Penal Code,  whereby it shall presume the sentence contained in the revoked suspended sentence to  be already fixed.        (4) In the event of the court not revoking a suspended sentence, a suspended  sentence or a sentence may be imposed for the new criminal offence. If a suspended  sentence is decided for the new criminal offence, the court, applying Article 53 of the  Penal Code, shall determine a combined sentence for the earlier and the new offence,  as well as a new term of suspension of not less than one and not more than five years,  running from the day of the final judgement. If the offender is sentenced to imprisonment  for committing a new criminal offence, the period of time spent in serving such a  sentence shall not be credited towards the term of suspension determined by the  suspended sentence for the previous criminal offence.       Revoking of Suspended Sentence due to Preceding Criminal Offence  Article 60      (1) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence when, after pronouncing it, it  finds that the offender had committed a criminal offence prior to being given a  suspended sentence and when it considers that there would not have been sufficient  reasons for the imposition of such a sentence had the existence of the prior offence  been known. In such a case the court shall apply the provisions contained in paragraph  3 of the preceding Article.     (2) If the court does not revoke the suspended sentence, it shall act according  to the provisions contained in paragraph 4 of the preceding Article.       Revoking of Suspended Sentence due to Non-performance of Obligations Imposed  Article 61      If the performance of some obligation contained in paragraph 3 of Article 57 of  this Penal Code has been imposed on the offender under the terms of the suspended  sentence and if he fails to fulfil such an obligation within the period of time determined by  the judgement, the court may either prolong the time for the discharge of such an  obligation or revoke the suspended sentence. If the court finds that the offender is not  able to perform the obligation imposed under the terms of the sentence for justified  reasons, the requirement of the performance of such an obligation may be withdrawn or  substituted by another obligation as specified by the statute.       Time Limit for the Revoking of Suspended Sentence  Article 62      (1) A suspended sentence may be revoked during the term of suspension. If the  offender commits a criminal offence entailing the revoking of the suspended sentence  during this term and the committing of the criminal offence is established by a judgement  passed after the expiry of the term of suspension, the suspended sentence may be  revoked within a period of one year beginning from the day the term of suspension  expired.        (2) If the offender fails to discharge the obligation imposed under paragraph 3 of  Article 57 of the Penal Code within the prescribed time, the court may, within a period of  one year beginning from the expiry of the term of suspension, revoke the suspended  sentence.       2. Suspended Sentence with Custodial Supervision     Custodial Supervision  Article 63      (1) Under the conditions determined by the this Penal Code, the court may  decide that the perpetrator, who is given a suspended sentence, has to undergo  custodial supervision for a certain period of time during the term of suspension.     (2) Custodial supervision shall involve assistance, supervision, or custody  specified by the statute.       Conditions for Application of Custodial Supervision  Article 64      (1) Custodial supervision shall be applied by the court when it reaches the  opinion that during the term of suspension the implementation of such a measure is  appropriate (paragraph 2 of the preceding Article). This measure shall be applied by the  court for definite period of time within the limits of the suspension term, specified by the  suspended sentence.     (2) When the court assesses that custodial supervision is no longer required, it  may order such a measure to be discontinued even before the expiry of the term of  suspension.       Selection of Instructions  Article 65      (1) In applying custodial supervision, the court may also issue one or more  instructions, according to which the offender has to behave.     (2) In selecting these instructions, the court shall in particular consider the age  of the perpetrator, his psychological characteristics, the motives for which he committed  the crime, his personal circumstances, his past behaviour, the circumstances under  which the crime was committed, as well as his conduct after committing the criminal  offence. The choice of instructions must not in any way affect the human dignity of the  perpetrator and must not cause him unreasonable hardship.        (3) The court's instructions may include the following tasks:  1) to submit himself to a course of medical treatment at an appropriate institution, also   treatment of alcohol or drug addiction with his consent;  2) to attend sessions of vocational, psychological, or other consultation;  3) to qualify for a job or to take up employment suitable to his health, skills, and   inclinations;  4) to spend income according to the duties relating to family support;  5) prohibition of association with certain persons;  6) restraining order to keep the perpetrator away from the victim or some other person;  7) ban on access to certain places.     (4) Upon a proposal made by a consultant (hereinafter, the consultant) or by the  offender, the court may modify or repeal the instructions ex officio .       Activity of Consultant  Article 66      (1) Custodial supervision shall be exercised by a consultant appointed by the  court.     (2) The consultant shall provide assistance to the offender and supervise his  compliance with the court's instructions. In so acting, the consultant shall be under  obligation:  1) to provide aid and supervision as well as to give directions and practical advice to the   offender, on how to comply with the court's instructions, with a view of preventing the  offender from committing further criminal offences;   2) to perform duties under the previous point and maintain relations with the offender in  a careful and convenient manner;   3) from time to time to report to the court on the exercising of custodial supervision and  to propose appropriate modifications or repealing of instructions or the  discontinuation of custodial supervision.        Consequences of Non-Compliance with Instructions  Article 67      If the offender does not comply with the instructions during the term of  suspension, or if he avoids relations with the appointed consultant, the court may either  admonish him, modify the instructions, prolong the custodial supervision within the limits  of the term of suspension, or revoke the suspended sentence.       3. Judicial Admonition     Conditions for Application of Judicial Admonition  Article 68        (1) A judicial admonition may be applied for a criminal offence, for which a fine  or a prison sentence not exceeding one year is prescribed, provided that such an  offence has been committed in particularly mitigating circumstances.     (2) Under conditions set forth by this Penal Code, a judicial admonition may be  applied for certain criminal offences even if punishable by imprisonment for a term not  exceeding three years.     (3) The court shall administer a judicial admonition for one or more criminal  offences committed in concurrence, provided that conditions under paragraphs 1 and 2  of this Article are met in each of them.     (4) In deciding whether to apply a judicial admonition, the court shall take into  account the personality of the perpetrator, his past behaviour, his conduct after  committing the criminal offence, the degree of his criminal liability, and other  circumstances, under which the offence was committed.       Chapter Six     SAFETY MEASURES     Types of Safety Measures  Article 69      The following safety measures may be ordered for perpetrators of criminal  offences:  - barring from performing the occupation;  - revoking of the driving licence;  - confiscation of objects.       Conditions for Application of Safety Measures  Article 70      (1) The court may apply one or more safety measures to the perpetrator of a  criminal offence, when the statutory conditions for their application are met.     (2) The revoking of a driving licence and the confiscation of objects may be  ordered for the perpetrator, when a prison sentence, a suspended sentence, or a judicial  admonition has been imposed on him, as well as in the case of the withdrawal of a  sentence.     (3) Barring to perform an occupation may be ordered if the perpetrator has been  sentenced to imprisonment or when such a sentence has been suspended.         Barring to Perform Occupation   Article 71     (1) The court may bar the perpetrator from performing a certain profession,  autonomous activity, or function if by abusing his occupation, position, activity, or  function, he committed a criminal offence and if the court has probable cause to believe  that his further performing of such an occupation would therefore be dangerous.     (2) The court shall determine the length of the measure outlined in the  preceding paragraph. This may not be ordered for less than one year and not more than  five years, running from the day the judgement became final, whereby the time spent in  prison or in a health institution for treatment and detention shall not be credited towards  the term of such a measure.     (3) When pronouncing a suspended sentence, the court may order that such a  sentence be revoked if the perpetrator violates the terms of the bar to perform his  occupation.     (4) The court may order that such safety measure be repealed, when a period  of two years has expired dating from the day the measure commenced. The court may  decide thereof on the request by the offender if it considers that reasons for the  imposition of such a measure have ceased to exist.       Revoking of Driving Licence  Article 72      (1) The court may revoke a licence for the operation of a motor vehicle of a  certain type or category and order that a new driving licence not be issued to the  perpetrator of a criminal offence against public traffic safety within a period of not less  than one and not more than five years. If the perpetrator holds no driving licence, the  court may order that a licence not be issued to him.     (2) The court shall administer such a measure if it ascertains that the  perpetrator's further presence in public traffic would endanger the public traffic due to his  behaviour, personal attributes, or incapability to safely operate motor vehicles.     (3) The driving licence shall cease to be valid from the time the final judgement  is passed. Time served in prison or spent in an institution for treatment and detention  shall not be counted as part of the duration of such a measure.     (4) After the expiry of the period determined by the court within the minimum  and maximum sentence for this measure, the perpetrator may obtain a new driving  licence under the general conditions applying to obtaining particular types of driving  licences.        (5) The court may order that such safety measure be repealed and the  perpetrator may be issued a new driving licence, when a period of two years has expired  dating from the day the measure commenced. The court may decide thereof on the  request by the offender if it considers that reasons for the imposition of such a measure  have ceased to exist.       Confiscation of Objects  Article 73      (1) Objects used or intended to be used, or gained through the committing of a  criminal offence may be confiscated if they belong to the perpetrator.     (2) Objects under the preceding paragraph may be confiscated even when they  do not belong to the perpetrator if that is required for reasons of general security or  morality and if the rights of other persons to claim damages from the perpetrator are not  thereby affected.     (3) Compulsory confiscation of objects may be provided for by the statute even  if the objects in question do not belong to the perpetrator.       Chapter Seven     CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY BENEFITS GAINED BY COMMITTING OF  CRIMINAL OFFENCE     Grounds for Confiscation of Property   Article 74     (1) Nobody shall retain the property gained through or owing to the committing  of a criminal offence.     (2) The property shall be confiscated according to the judgement passed on the  criminal offence under conditions laid down in this Penal Code.       Method of Confiscation of Property  Article 75      (1) Money, valuables and any other property benefit gained through or owing to  the committing of a criminal offence shall be confiscated from the perpetrator or recipient  (hereinafter, the recipient); if confiscation cannot be carried out, property equivalent to  the property benefit shall be confiscated from them.     (2) When the property benefit or property equivalent to the property benefit  cannot be confiscated from the perpetrator or other recipient, the perpetrator shall be     obliged to pay a sum of money equivalent to this property benefit. In justified instances,  the court may allow the sum of money equivalent to the property benefit to be paid by  instalments, whereby the period of payment may not exceed two years.     (3) Property benefit gained through or owing to the committing of a criminal  offence may also be confiscated from persons, to which it was transferred free of charge  or for a sum of money that does not correspond to its actual value, if such persons knew  or could have known that this property had been gained through or owing to the  committing of a criminal offence.     (4) When a property benefit gained through or owing to the committing of a  criminal offence has been transferred to close relatives of the perpetrator of the criminal  offence (relations from Article 224 of this Penal Code) or when, for reason of the  prevention of confiscation of property benefits under paragraph 1 of this Article, any  other property has been transferred to such persons, this property shall be confiscated  from them unless they can demonstrate that they paid its actual value.       Protection of the Injured Party  Article 76      (1) If the injured party has been awarded his claim for damages in a criminal  proceeding by the court, the latter shall order the confiscation of property only insofar as  such property exceeds the adjudicated claim of the injured party.     (2) The injured party, which has been committed in a criminal proceeding by the  court to bring its claim for the recovery of damages in a civil action, may satisfy its claim  from the value of the confiscated property, provided that it brings a civil claim within six  months from the final judgement, directing it to bring a civil action, and under the  condition that it claims settlement from the value of the confiscated property within three  months from the final judgement awarding its claim.     (3) Any injured party, which has not brought its claim for compensation in the  form of damages in the course of a criminal proceeding, may satisfy its claim from the  value of the confiscated property, provided that it brings a civil action for the adjudication  of its claim within three months from the day it became aware of the ruling confiscating  the property and at the latest within two years from the final judgement, and with the  further proviso that it claims settlement from the value of the confiscated property within  three months from the final judgement awarding its claim.       Confiscation of Property from Legal Person  Article 77      Any property gained by a legal person through or owing to the committing of a  criminal offence shall be confiscated. A property benefit or property equivalent to the  property benefit shall also be confiscated from legal persons, when the persons referred     to in the paragraph 1 of Article 75 of this Penal Code have transferred this property to  the legal person free of charge or for a sum of money, which does not correspond to its  actual value.       Chapter Eight     LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF CONVICTION     Origin of Legal Consequences of Conviction  Article 78      (1) Conviction for particular criminal offences or passing of particular sentences  may entail either the cessation or forfeiture of certain rights or a bar to the acquisition of  certain rights.

(2) Legal consequences that prevent the acquisition of certain rights shall  include:  1) debarment from the performance of certain public functions or official duties;  2) debarment from entering a certain profession or concluding an employment contract;  3) debarment from obtaining certain permits and endorsements granted by written order   of state bodies.       Beginning and Duration of Legal Consequences of Conviction  Article 80      (1) Legal consequences come into effect on the day the conviction takes effect.        (2) Legal consequences entailing the prevention of the acquisition of certain  rights may not remain in effect for more than five years from the day the sentence  expired, was remitted or barred by time, except insofar as the statute prescribes a  shorter or longer term of duration for particular legal consequences.     (3) Upon the expiry of two years from the day the sentence ended, was remitted  or barred by time, and upon a request filed by the offender, the court may order the legal  consequence of the conviction referring to the bar on the acquisition of certain rights to  be repealed.     (4) In considering whether to order the discontinuation of a legal consequence,  the court shall take into account the offender's conduct after the conviction, whether he  has recovered the damages caused by the criminal offence, and other circumstances,  which indicate whether it is reasonable to discontinue the legal consequence in  question.     (5) The termination of the legal consequences of the conviction shall not affect  any right of third persons connected thereto.     (6) The legal consequences of the conviction shall be discontinued with the  removal of the conviction from the criminal record.

In deciding whether to remove  the conviction, the court shall consider the offender's behaviour after he has served the  sentence, the nature of the offence he committed, and other circumstances relevant to  the removal of the conviction.       Release of Information from the Criminal Record  Article 84      (1) The information on judgements shall be kept in a criminal record. The extent  of information and release of information from the criminal record before the removal  shall be determined by the statute.

The court shall also revoke the parole if the parolee does not perform the tasks,  which were ordered by the body responsible for granting or denying the parole.

PART V —- AUTHORISATIONS   Authorisation to provide communications services   19, (1) The Authority shall be responsible for granting licences author-  izing the provision of communications services in a manner consistent with  this section.   (2) A person shall not provide any communications services in  Lesotho except under, and in accordance with, a licence granted by the  Authority.   (3) The Authority shall grant licences on -   (a) an individual basis, if the Authority concludes that  individual licensing is necessary to serve the public  interest; or   (b) a class basis, to the extent feasible.   (4) A licence shall entitle the licensee to the right to provide the  communications services specified in the licence, for a specified period of  time.   Prior restraint   20. (1) No licensee shall be prevented or impeded, either directly or  indirectly, from providing service, unless either -   (a) the Authority has suspended or revoked the licensee’s  licence; or   (b) the Minister issues an emergency suspension order.   (2) The Minister shall only issue an emergency suspension order if  the Minister has a reasonable basis to conclude that continued operation by 2    210   licensee poses a substantial, direct and imminent threat to national security or   public order and that there is no other way to forestall the threat other than to   act in the manner provided for in this subsection.   (3) Any emergency suspension order shall -   (a) be in writing;   (b) explain the basis for the suspension; and   (c) remain in effect for no more than 72 hours, unless   extended by a court of competent jurisdiction.   PART VI - COMPETITION MANAGEMENT   Classification of dominant licensees   21. qd) The Authority shall after conducting a market study and impact   assessment, classify a licensee as a dominant licensee if the Authority con-   cludes that the licensee -   (a) has the ability to exercise significant market power in   any communications market in Lesotho; or   (b) operates communications infrastructure that is suffi-   ciently costly or difficult to replicate such that requix-   ing new entrants to do so would create a significant   barrier to rapid and successful entry by an efficient   competitor.   (2) In assessing whether a licensee has significant market power,   in a relevant market the Authority shall give due consideration to whether the   licensee provides, or previously has provided, any reserved or restricted serv-   ice.   (3) A dominant licensee shall be subject to the statutory and regu-   latory provisions applicable to dominant licensees for all infrastructure that it   operates, and in all communications markets in which it participates within   Lesotho.    21)   (4) The Authority, after providing an opportunity for public com-  ment, may exempt the dominant licensee from the application of any such pro-  vision to -   (a) any service provided by the dominant licensee in a  market in which the dominant licensee does not have  significant market power; or   (b) any infrastructure operated by the dominant licensee  that is not sufficiently costly or difficult to replicate  such that requiring new entrants to do so would create  a significant barrier to rapid and successful entry by an  efficient competitor.   (5) The Authority may reclassify a dominant licensee as non-dom-  inant if the licensee no longer meets the criteria for classification as a dominant  licensee.   (6) The Authority may grant an exemption, or reclassify a licens-  ee, either -   (a) on its own motion; or   (b) at the request of the licensee.   (7) The Authority shall publish a notice in the Gazette in any case  in which the Authority -   (a) classifies a licensee as dominant;   (b) reclassifies a dominant licensee as non-dominant; or   (c) grants an exemption to a dominant licensee.   Competitive safeguards   22. qd) In addition to any requirements contained in this Act, the  Authority may adopt competitive safeguards designed to deter a dominant  licensee from using its significant market power in one market to impede the  development of competition in another market.    212   (2) Competitive safeguards may include rules that require a domi-  nant licensee to -   (a) offer services on an unbundled basis;   (b) separately account for costs and revenues related to   specific services;   (c) establish separate corporate affiliates to provide specif-  ic services;   (d) use separate facilities or personnel to provide specific  services;   (e) disclose information about specific infrastructure or   services to other licensees;   (f) not engage in cross-subsidisation; and   (g) not engage in discrimination in favour of an affiliate.   (3) The Authority may also adopt provisions designed to prevent a  licensee who is affiliated with an entity that has significant market power in   any market, whether or not within Lesotho, from using that affiliation in a   manner that enables the licensee to, or is likely to enable it to, unreasonably   restrict competition in any communications market in Lesotho.   Abuse of dominant position   23. QQ) A dominant licensee shall not use its significant market power   in a manner that unreasonably restricts, or is likely to unreasonably restrict,   competition in any communications market in Lesotho.   (2) A dominant licensee shall not engage in unilateral conduct that  has, or is likely to -   (a) significantly restrict output below the competitive   level, increase prices above cost, reduce quality below  the level that end users seek, reduce end users’ choice  or deter innovation; or    (3)   (4)   (5)   (b)   213   preserve or enhance its dominant position by engaging  in conduct that deters or precludes efficient companies  from participating in the market by means other than  competing based on service availability, price and  quality.   A dominant licensee abuses its dominant position if the  Authority concludes that the dominant licensee engaged, or is engaging, in -   (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)   ©)   predatory pricing;   price squeezing;   unreasonable discrimination;   exclusionary refusals to deal; or   tying.   A dominant licensee engages in predatory pricing if the evi-  dence demonstrates that -   (a)   (b)   ()   the dominant licensee is selling a communications  service at a price that is less than the average incremen-  tal cost of the service;   the dominant licensee’s sells at prices below average  incremental cost and have driven, or are likely to drive,  efficient rivals from the market or deter future efficient  rivals from entering the market; and   entry barriers are so significant that, after driving rivals  from the market or deterring entry, the dominant  licensee could impose an increase in prices sufficient  (in amount and duration) to enable the dominant licens-  ee to recoup the full amount of the loss that it incurred  during the period during which the predatory conduct  occurred,   A dominant licensee engages in a price squeeze if the evidence    214   demonstrates that -   (a) the dominant licensee provides a communications   service or facility that is necessary, as an input, for   another licensee to provide a communication service;   and   (b) the price that the dominant licensee charges for the   communications service or facility is so high that an   efficient competitor could not profitably sell its product   if it were required to recover the full purchase price of   the input through its charges to its end users.   (6) A dominant licensee engages in unreasonable discrimination if   the evidence demonstrates that the dominant licensee has provided an affiliate   with access to infrastructure, systems, services or information, necessary to   enable a non-affiliated licensee to provide a communications services, on   prices, terms or conditions that are more favourable than the prices, terms and   conditions on which the dominant licensee provides those infrastructure, sys-   tems, services or information to licensees that are not affiliates, without any   objective justification.   (7) A dominant licensee engages in an exclusionary refusal to deal   if the evidence demonstrates that the dominant licensee has refused to provide   a non-affiliated licensee with access to infrastructure, systems, services or   information necessary to enable the non-affiliated licensee to provide a com-   munications services, without any objective justification.

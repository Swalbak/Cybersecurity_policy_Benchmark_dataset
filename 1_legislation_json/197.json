From among the structuring measures for attaining this goal five are pointed out: the  drafting of a Law on Postal Services; the establishment of a Public Postal Company; the  drafting of a Law on the Telecommunications Sector; the concession of the public  telecommunications service to a private operator for a limited period of time, under the  BOT regime; and, in order to ensure adequate regulation and supervision of this sector, the  establishment of a Communications Regulatory Authority (ARCOM).     The present Decree-Law is precisely meant to realise the third of the aforementioned actions.     The telecommunications sector contributes, in a fundamental fashion, to the  promotion and growth of a country’s economy and to the development of its social fabric, by ensuring the citizens access to communications and information through a multiplicity  of means, correcting regional asymmetries and alleviating the geographic isolation of the  populations.    The legislation applicable to this sector should be adapted by promoting a  legislative reform in tandem with the present reality of Timor-Leste, whose main objective  is, on the one hand, to build and develop infrastructure in the country and, on the other, to  provide a range of telecommunications services to the population at large, with quality and  at affordable prices; and specific conditions shall be prescribed in order to allow for the  feasibility of this operation.     The communications sector shall be expanded to new technologically ever-more  advanced services, and it shall be incumbent upon the Government to promote the  conditions of access to an ever-increasing number of users and, concurrently, intervene in  the telecommunications sector at the co-ordination and supervision level, and to ensure respect for the principles proclaimed herein.    Thus, pursuant to section 116(d) of the Constitution, the Government enacts the  following:       CHAPTER I  General Provisions   Section 1 Purpose    The purpose of the present Decree-Law is to establish the general bases for establishing, managing and operating telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of  telecommunications services.  Section 2 General Principles     1. The present Decree-Law and the legal regime arising therefrom shall ensure the  satisfaction of the basic requirements for providing telecommunications services to the  populations and public and private entities from the various activity sectors, through the  creation of conditions conducive to the development and diversification of services of this  nature.    2. The objective defined in subsection 2.1 shall conform to the following basic principles:     (a) Ensure the existence and availability of a universal service, consisting of a  minimum range of telecommunications services provided within the national territory, on a permanent basis, with adequate quality conditions and at prices that  can be afforded by all users;   (b) Ensure the financial and economic feasibility of the universal service through the  granting of exclusivity in the provision of certain telecommunications services and  the establishment of a compensation fund;   (c) Ensure that providers of competitive services are granted equal access to the market,  while observing the rules for protecting competition;   (d) Ensure that users, under similar circumstances, are given equal treatment in the  access to and use of telecommunications services.     Section 3  Classification    1- Telecommunications means the transmission, reception or emission of a signal,  representing symbols, writing, images, sounds or information of any nature by way of  wires, optical systems, by electronic means or by other electromagnetic systems.   2- Depending on the nature of a user, telecommunications are classified as public or  private.    3. Public telecommunications are deemed to be those which aim to meet the generic  collective need to transmit and receive messages and information.       4.

Section 4 Telecommunications supervision     1.

Section 5 Public electromagnetic domain     The space through which electromagnetic waves can propagate constitutes the public  electromagnetic domain, the management, administration and monitoring of which are the  competency of the State, in compliance with the provisions of the applicable law, and  international treaties and agreements.   Section 6 Telecommunications co-ordination in emergency situations     It shall be incumbent upon the State to ensure, under the terms as established by law,  adequate co-ordination of telecommunications networks and services in emergency, crisis  or war situations.   Section 7 Consultative committee    Law may provide for the establishment of a consultative committee comprised of  representatives from the State, operators and users with the task of monitoring and advising  the regulatory entity on specific matters.     Section 8 Public use of telecommunications    1. Everyone has the right to use public telecommunications services through payment of the  corresponding tariffs and fees, insofar as the applicable regulations are complied with.    2. Law may define the priority use of services and establish preferences to the benefit of entities pursuing public interests worthy of special protection.   3.

CHAPTER II  On public telecommunications   Section 10  Universal service    1- It is incumbent upon the State to ensure the existence and availability of the universal  telecommunications service that will satisfy the communication needs of the population and  of economic and social activities within the country as a whole, and to ensure international  connections in terms of equality and continuity and through conditions of adequate  remuneration, taking into account the requirements for harmonic and balanced socio- economic development.   2- The universal service shall be operated under an exclusivity regime by the State, by a  public corporate person or by a private corporate person, through a concession contract,  hereinafter referred to as the universal service operator, which shall be obligated to  establish, manage and operate infrastructure that comprise the basic telecommunications  network and to provide fixed telephone service.     Section 11  Basic network     1. The basic telecommunications network is comprised of the fixed subscriber access  system, the transmission network and by the concentration, commutation or processing  knots that are essentially used to provide the fixed telephone service referred to in the  previous section.    2. For the purposes of the provisions of the preceding subsection:    (a) Fixed subscriber access system is deemed to be the set of transmission means  located between a fixed point, at the level of the physical connection to the terminal     equipment of a subscriber and another point, situated at the level of the physical  connection in the first concentration, commutation or processing knot;   (b) Transmission network is deemed to be the set of physical or electromagnetic means  establishing connections for the transport of information between concentration,  commutation or processing knots;   (c) Concentration, commutation or processing knots are deemed to be every device or  system that either directs or processes information originating from or heading  toward the subscriber’s system.     3. The basic telecommunications network is exclusive to the universal service operator and  shall function as an open network, serving as a support for the transmission of  telecommunications services, and the use thereof shall be ensured by the respective providers under equal conditions.    4. The basic telecommunications network is an asset belonging to the state public domain,  and is assigned, under the terms established by law, to the universal service operator.   5.

The universal service operator shall make available, under the terms as established by  law and in fully equal conditions, hired circuits, namely circuits required for providing  radio and television broadcasting services, where the provision of those services involves  the use of the basic network or of public telecommunications infrastructure, as well as circuits meant to establish private telecommunications.    4. The expropriation of immovable property, as well as the establishment of administrative  servitudes indispensable to the establishment, protection and preservation of public  telecommunications infrastructure, shall be permitted, under the terms established by law.    5.

(1) In this Chapter any reference to a law is construed to refer to a law applicable  in Namibia whether it has been enacted before or after the commencement of this Act and  also to this Act.  (2) Subsection (1) is not construed in such a manner that it –  (a) invalidates any transaction or act performed before the commencement of this  Act;  (b) that it will create criminal or civil liability for any act performed before the  commencement of this Act.  (3) Except for section 18 and 25 –  (a) no provision of this Chapter relates to any matter regulated in the excluded  laws; and  (b) no reference in this Chapter to “law” relates to any provision of the excluded  laws.  Legal recognition of data messages  17.

(2) Despite subsection (1), persons may by agreement regulate the effect, use and  requirements for data messages as it relates to dealings among themselves.  (3) Subject to this Act, any other law or any agreement, no public body may compel  any person to interact with it by means of a data message.  Interpretation of power to make regulations  17    18. (1) Any provision in any law, whether enacted before or after the commencement  of this Act, that confers a power to prescribe or determine –  (a) any form to be used for any purpose;  (b) the manner or procedure of making an application or providing any informa-  tion to an institution or body,  is, unless a contrary intention appears, construed to authorise the functionary concerned to –  (i) prescribe or determine a procedure involving the use of a data message or the  interaction with an automatic data entry system;  (ii) require the provision of data in any prescribed or determined computer read-  able format;  (iii) prescribe or determine compliance with any specified protocol or procedure;  (iv) prescribe or determine any technical or other requirement that may be neces-  sary in order to allow or facilitate the use of information systems;  (v) prescribe or determine that a specified type of electronic signature is required;  (vi) prescribe or determine the manner and format in which such electronic sig-  nature must be attached to, incorporated in or otherwise associated with the  data message;  (vii) prescribe or determine that a specific class of accredited security product,  service, provider of a security product or renderer of a security service must  be used;  (viii) subject to any law regulating electronic payments in Namibia, prescribe or  18    determine the appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure adequate  integrity, security and confidentiality of data messages or payments; and  (ix) prescribe or determine any other matter that is necessary or expedient to  prescribe or determine with relation to the use of data messages or information  systems.  (2) A provision in any law requiring or permitting any functionary to prescribe or  determine that any information must be posted, displayed, sent or transmitted in a manner  prescribed or determined by that functionary is construed to include the power to prescribe  or determine a method involving the transmission of a data message or the making available  of that information by means of any information system.  (3) A power to prescribe or determine a duty to store or retain information in a manner  so prescribed or determined is construed to include the power to prescribe or determine a  manner of storage or retention that includes the storage or retention of the information in  an electronic form.  (4) The powers referred to in subsection (1), (2) and (3) include the power to specify  any requirement or matter with reference to any standard published by a standards body  in Namibia or of another country, or or by any international organisation or industry body:  Provided that the regulations in question must specify a place where such standard document  may be inspected during such hours and at such places as may be prescribed.  Writing  19. A reference to writing in any law is construed to include a reference to a data  message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent  reference, unless –  (a) a different intention appears from the law in question;  (b) the law in question provides for a process that is incompatible with the use of  19    a data message or cannot be applied to a data message; or  (c) the purpose for requiring writing is in order to protect consumers.  Electronic signature  20. (1) A reference in any law, contract or any other legal instrument to a signature or  the signing of a document is construed to include a reference to a secure electronic signature,  unless –  (a) a contrary intention appears from the law or document concerned;  (b) the law in question provides for a process that is incompatible with the use of  a secure electronic signature;  (c) the requirement that the document must be in writing, is not construed to  include a data message as contemplated in section 19.  (2) Nothing in this section is construed as limiting the use of an electronic signature  that is not a secure electronic signature if parties agree to such use or if a law provides for  such use.  (3) The Minister may make regulations –  (a) prescribing the requirements for secure electronic signatures;  (b) prescribing a process for verifying that a secure electronic signature has been  applied by a specific person;  (c) prescribing any requirement or process for applying a secure electronic sig-  nature to any data message and prescribing a procedure or requirement for  determining whether a secure electronic signature has been applied to a spe-  20    cific data message and whether the data message has been altered since the  secure electronic signature has been applied;  (d) prescribing the role and the duties of accredited service providers;  (e) prescribing any presumptions that will apply when a prescribed security pro-  cedure has been followed;  (f) prescribing anything that is necessary or expedient to prescribe with relation  to a secure electronic signature.  (4) If any presumptions have been prescribed in terms of subsection (3)(e), those  presumptions will be prima facie proof of the matter presumed in criminal proceedings and  will be presumed unless the contrary is proved in civil proceedings.  Original information  21. (1) Unless a contrary intention appears, where a law requires information to be  presented or retained in its original form, that requirement is met by a data message if –  (a) there exists a reliable assurance that the information has remained complete  and unaltered from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as a  data message or otherwise; and  (b) where it is required that information must be presented, that information is  capable of being displayed in the form of a data message to the person to  whom it must be presented.  (2) Subsection (1) applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obliga-  tion or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being presented  or retained in its original form.  (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a) –  21    (a) information is deemed to have remained complete and unaltered if it has re-  mained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement  or any change which arises in the normal course of communication, storage or  display; and  (b) the level of reliability must be assessed in the light of the purpose for which the  information was generated and in the light of all the relevant circumstances.  Production of document or information  22. (1) Unless a contrary intention appears, where a law requires a person to produce  a document or information, that requirement is met if the person produces, by means of a  data message, an electronic form of that document or information, and if –  (a) considering all the relevant circumstances at the time that the data message  was sent or generated, the method of generating the electronic form of that  document provided a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the in-  tegrity of the information contained in that data message; and  (b) at the time the data message was sent or generated, it was reasonable to expect  that the information contained therein would be readily accessible so as to be  usable for subsequent reference.  (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the integrity of the information contained in a  document is deemed to have been maintained if the information has remained complete and  unaltered except for –  (a) the addition of any endorsement; or  (b) any immaterial change, which arises in the normal course of communication,  storage or display.  Other requirements  22    23. (1) A requirement in a law for multiple copies of a document to be submitted to  a single addressee at the same time is satisfied by the submission of a single data message  that is capable of being reproduced by that addressee.  (2) Unless a contrary intention appears, where any law requires or permits a person  to send a document or information by post or similar service, that requirement is met if an  electronic form of that document or information is sent to the electronic address or designated  information system provided by the addressee: Provided that this provision does not apply  where the law requires that a document must be sent by registered post or must be delivered  by hand or handed to a specific person.  Retention of electronic records  24. (1) Where the law requires that certain documents, records or information be  retained, that requirement is met by electronic record retention, if –  (a) the electronic record contained therein is a data message;  (b) the electronic record is retained in the format in which it was generated, sent  or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately  the information generated, sent or received;  (c) such electronic record is retained in a form that enables the identification of  the origin and destination of an electronic record or data message and the date  and time when it was first generated, sent or received and the date and time  it was first retained; and  (d) it complies with any other requirement that may be prescribed.  (2) An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with  subsection (1) does not extend to any information of which the sole purpose is to enable the  message to be sent or received.  23    (3) A person may use the services of another person in order to comply with subsection  (1): Provided that the former person will be liable for the contravention of the provision in  question if the latter person has failed to retain the information.  Admissibility and evidential weight of data messages and computer evidence  25. (1) In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence  may be applied in such a manner that it would have the effect that computer evidence is  inadmissible –  (a) on the sole ground that it is computer evidence; or,  (b) if it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be  expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form.  (2) When evidence is admitted in terms of this section, the court must assess the  weight to be given to that evidence.  (3) In assessing the evidential weight of computer evidence, the court must have  regard to –  (a) the reliability of the manner in which the computer evidence was generated,  stored or communicated;  (b) the integrity of the information system in which the computer evidence was  recorded, stored and maintained;  (c) the manner in which the originator of the computer evidence was identified;  and  (d) any other relevant factor.  (4) A data message made by or on behalf of a person in the ordinary course of  24    business, or a copy or printout of or an extract from such data message certified to be  correct, is admissible in any civil, criminal, administrative or disciplinary proceedings under  any law, the rules of a self regulatory organisation or any other law or the common law, as  evidence of the facts contained in such record, copy, printout or extract against any person,  if –  (a) the affidavit has been made by the person who was in control of the information  system at the time when the data message has been created;  (b) the facts stated in the affidavit justify a finding on the reliability of the manner  in which the data message has been generated, stored or communicated;  (c) the facts stated in the affidavit justify a conclusion on the reliability of the  manner in which the integrity of the data message was maintained; and  (d) the facts stated in the affidavit justify a conclusion on the manner in which  the originator of the data message has been identified if the identity of the  originator is relevant to a matter in dispute.  (5) In legal proceedings all rules of evidence must be applied in such a manner that a  data message tendered as contemplated in this section is admissible if documentary evidence  that is similar in all material respects would have been admissible.  (6) Any document containing data evidence and purporting to be a printout of data  or information stored or created by a computer system is admissible in legal proceedings if  it has been authenticated by means of admissible evidence.  (7) Evidence referred to in subsection (6) is not admissible to the extent that the  evidence in the document in question is hearsay evidence, except where any rule of evidence  would have rendered similar evidence admissible if the evidence in question were contained  in a document.  (8) If in its opinion it is in the interest of the administration of justice, a court may  25    allow a person to perform a demonstration on a computer system instead of a printout if such  demonstration has been performed by a person who has authenticated such demonstration  by means of admissible evidence.  (9) Evidence authenticating a printout or a demonstration must be evidence of –  (a) the steps that have been taken to create the printout;  (b) the software that has been used to create the printout or demonstration;  (c) if the steps referred to in paragraph (a), require any special expertise, the  nature of the qualifications or experience of the person who performed those  steps;  (d) particulars of any alterations made in order to create such printout or demon-  stration and if no such alteration has been made, a statement to that effect;  and  (e) any other fact that is relevant in order to demonstrate that the evidence is  reliable and is what it purports to be.  (10) If any matter referred to in subsection (9) is not admitted by all parties in the  proceedings in question, the party or person tendering the evidence in question, bears the  burden of proof of all the facts referred to in that subsection.  (11) It is presumed, unless admissible evidence to the contrary is provided, that  software operates correctly.  (12) No expert evidence is required to prove the operation or functionality of soft-  ware that is commonly used on personal computers or other computational devices that are  commonly used by persons that are not experts in the field of computer science or a related  field.  26    (13) Information evidence is admissible in legal proceedings if such evidence is con-  tained in an affidavit that –  (a) states the experience and qualifications of the person making that affidavit;  (b) explains the nature of the processes performed to obtain the information in  question and the reason why such process is relevant for the information con-  tained in the evidence in question; and  (c) states all the relevant conclusions embodied in that information.  (14) Information admitted in terms of subsection (13) is prima facie evidence of all  the relevant information contained in the affidavit in question if in the opinion of the court  the person making the declarations has sufficient expertise to perform the process in question  and draw the conclusions in question and there is no other reason why the conclusions should  not have been drawn.  (15) Information evidence may also be given by means of oral evidence or by means  of a demonstration, if admissible evidence of the facts referred to in subsection (13) has also  been given.  (16) No provision of this section is construed in such a manner that it would render  evidence inadmissible that would have been admissible if this section has not been enacted.  Formation and validity of contracts  26. (1)Where data messages are used in the formation of a contract, that contract  is not without legal effect, validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message  has been used to make an offer or to accept an offer for that purpose.  (2) A proposal to conclude a contract made through one or more data messages,  which is not addressed to one or more specific person but is generally accessible to the  public or a specific portion of the public (including proposals that make use of interactive  27    applications for the placement of orders through such information systems) is presumed to  be an invitation to make offers, unless it clearly indicates the intention of the person making  the proposal to be bound in case of acceptance.  (3) This section does not confer any validity to transactions referred to in the excluded  laws.  Incorporation by reference  27. (1) Subject to subsection (2), information may not be denied legal effect, validity  or enforceability solely on the ground that it is not contained in the data message purporting  to give rise to such legal effect, validity or enforceability, if such information is referred to  in that data message in a manner that indicates that that information is regarded to have  been incorporated in that data message.  (2) The onus to prove that information referred to as contemplated in subsection (1)  is on the party who originated that data message and such onus is only discharged if –  (a) it is proved that the data message clearly referred to the incorporated infor-  mation as contemplated in subsection (1);  (b) it was possible for a person who read the referring data message to easily read  the incorporated information;  (c) the information claimed to be incorporated was actually the information re-  ferred to by the incorporating message at the time when the referring message  was accessed.  Variation by agreement  28. The provisions of this Chapter apply, unless the parties involved in generating,  sending, receiving, storing or otherwise processing data messages, have agreed otherwise.  28    Time of dispatch and receipt of data messages  29. (1) Subject to subsection (2), for all purposes in law it is deemed that a data  message has been dispatched at the time when it enters an information system outside  the control of the originator or of the person that sent the data message on behalf of the  originator.  (2) If the originator and the addressee are in the same information system, it is  deemed for all purposes in law that the data message has been dispatched at the time when  it is capable of being retrieved by the addressee.  (3) For all purposes in law, a data message sent to an electronic address designated  by the addressee is deemed to have been received at the time when it becomes capable of  being retrieved by the addressee at that electronic address.  (4) For all purposes in law, a data message sent to an electronic address different  from the electronic address referred to in subsection (3) is deemed to have been received at  that address at the time when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at that  address and the addressee has become aware that the electronic communication has been  sent to that address.  Place of dispatch and receipt of data messages  30. (1) For all purposes in law it is deemed that a data message have been dispatched  at the place of business of the originator, and is deemed to have been received at the place  of business of the addressee.  (2) For the purposes of this section a place of business is any place where a person  maintains a non-transitory establishment to pursue an economic activity other than the  temporary provision of goods or services out of a specific location.  (3) If a person has more than one place of business, the place of business contemplated  in subsection (2) is –  29    (a) the place of business which has the closest relationship to the underlying trans-  action having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the  parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract; or  (b) where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business.  (4) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, it is deemed  for the purposes of this section that that person has a place of business at that persons  habitual residence.  Time and place of contract formation  31. (1) If parties conclude a contract by means of data messages such contract is  formed at the time when and the place where the acceptance of the offer becomes effective  as provided by subsection (3).  (2) An offer in the form of a data message becomes effective –  (a) at the time when it is deemed to have been received by the offeree as provided  by section 29(3) or 29(4) as the case may be; and  (b) at the place where it is deemed to have been received by the offeree as provided  by section 30.  (3) The acceptance of an offer in the form of a data message becomes effective –  (a) at the time when it is deemed to have been received by the offerer as provided  by section 29(3) or (4), as the case may be; and  (b) at the place where it is deemed to have been received by the offerer as provided  by section 30.  Attribution of data messages  30    32. For all purposes in law, it is deemed that a person has sent a data message, if –  (a) that person has sent the message personally;  (b) the message has been sent by a person who had authority to act on behalf of  the originator in respect of that data message; or  (c) the message has been sent by an information system programmed by or on  behalf of the originator to operate automatically unless the originator proves  that the information system did not properly execute such programming.  Automated message systems  33. (1) A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and  a person, or by the interaction of automated message systems, are not without legal effect,  validity or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural person reviewed any of the  individual actions carried out by the systems or the resulting contract.  (2) Where a natural person makes an input error in a data message exchanged with  the automated message system of another party and the automated message system does  not provide the person with an opportunity to correct the error, that person, or the party on  whose behalf that person was acting, has the right to withdraw the data message in which  the input error was made if –  (a) the person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, notifies the  other party of the error as soon as possible after having learned of the error  and indicates that he or she made an error in the data message and wishes to  cancel the contract or correct the input error;  (b) the person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, takes reason-  able steps, including steps that conform to the instructions given by the other  party, to return the goods or services received, if any, as a result of the error  or, if instructed to do so, to destroy the goods or services, or to correct the  31    input error; and  (c) the person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has not used  or received any material benefit or value from the goods or services, or the  input error, if any, from the other party.  (3) If a person who has made an input error as contemplated in subsection (2), has  paid for any goods or services prior to exercising a right referred to in that subsection, such  person is entitled to a full refund of such payment, which refund must be made within 30  days of the date of cancellation.  (4) Nothing in this section affects the application of any rule of law that may govern  the consequences of any errors made during the formation or performance of the type of  contract in question other than an input error that occurs in the circumstances referred to  in subsection (1).

Mere conduit  50. (1) A service provider is not subject to any civil or criminal liability in respect  of third-party material in the form of data to which he or she merely provides access to  information system services for the transmitting, routing or storage of data via an information  system under his or her control, as long as the service provider –  (a) does not initiate the transmission;  (b) does not select the addressee;  (c) performs the functions in an automatic, technical manner without selection of  45    the data; and  (d) does not modify the data contained in the transmission.

Caching  51. (1) A service provider is not subject to any civil or criminal liability in respect  of third-party material in the form of data for the automatic, intermediate and temporary  storage of that data, where the purpose of storing such data is to make the onward trans-  mission of the data more efficient to other recipients of the service upon their request, as  long as the service provider –  (a) does not modify the data;  (b) complies with conditions on access to the data;  (c) complies with rules regarding the updating of the data, specified in a manner  widely recognised and used by industry;  (d) does not interfere with the lawful use of rights management information, widely  recognised and used by industry, to obtain information on the use of the data;  and  46    (e) removes or disables access to the data it has stored upon receiving a take down  notice referred to in section 54.

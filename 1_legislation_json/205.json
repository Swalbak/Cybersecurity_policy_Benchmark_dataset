In adding up punishments, the final cumulative punishment shall be within the limits  prescribed by that sanction of an article in the Special Part of this Code, which provides for a  heavier punishment. Where at least one of the criminal offences is an intentional grave or  special grave offense, the court may impose a final cumulative punishment within the  maximum term provided for this kind of punishment in the General Part of this Code. Where  life imprisonment is imposed for at least one of the criminal offenses committed, the final  cumulative punishment shall be determined by way of merging milder punishments into life  imprisonment.   3. A primary cumulative punishment may be supplemented by additional punishments  imposed by a court for criminal offenses of which a person was convicted.   4. A punishment shall be imposed under the rules set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article  where, after a sentence in the case was passed, it is established that the sentenced person is  guilty of yet another criminal offense committed before such previous sentence was passed.

Where a convicted person commits two or more criminal offenses after the sentence was  passed but before the full term has been served, a court shall impose punishments for these  new offenses under rules set out in Article 70 of this Code, and then fully or partially add the  unexpired term of the previous sentence to the final punishment determined by way of  cumulation of sentences within the limits prescribed in paragraph 2 of this Article.   Article 72. Rules of adding up punishments and merging previous terms   1.

(4) one day of restraint of liberty of arrest equals to eight hours of community service.   2. In imposing a punishment through cumulation of offenses or sentences, where the  punishment is to be correctional labor or service restrictions for military servants, only the  terms of these punishments shall be added up. Any deductions from salaries of a convicted  person shall not be added up and shall be calculated for each sentence separately.   3. Primary punishments of a fine, or deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or  engage in certain activities, when imposed as aggregate sentences for an aggregate of crimes,  do not merge and shall be served separately.   4. Additional punishments of various types shall always be served separately.   5. A court shall merge the pretrial detention into the term of punishment, in case of sentencing  to imprisonment, on a day for day bases or pursuant to the rules set out in paragraph 1 of this  Article.

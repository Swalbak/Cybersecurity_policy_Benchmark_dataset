	"document(english)": "1         Australia’s submission on international law to be annexed to the report of the   2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Cyber   Australia welcomes the opportunity to submit its national contribution on the subject of how international   law applies to the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) by States as an annex to the   report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts, as requested by the UN General Assembly in Resolution   73/266 (2019).   The international community recognises that existing international law – and in particular the UN Charter in   its entirety – is applicable to State conduct in cyberspace and is essential to maintaining peace and stability   and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment. This is reflected in the 2013 and   2015 reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Cyber (UN GGE) and the 2021 report of the UN   Open Ended Working Group on Cyber (UN OEWG). The 2021 OEWG Report called upon States to avoid and   refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of   the United Nations, and concluded that further common understandings need to be developed on how   international law applies to State use of ICTs.   A key part of the mandate of the GGE – including through these annexed national contributions – is to   continue to study how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. This question is a subject of   ongoing consideration by States individually and collectively through the UN and other multilateral forums.   Deepening our understanding of how international law applies is an iterative process, involving States   forming national views and exchanging positions. Through internal consideration and international   exchanges, States are building a deeper, clearer and more practical understanding of how international law   applies to State behaviour in cyberspace. Even where views differ, developing understandings of respective   States’ positions may increase predictability and reduce the risk of miscalculation, which can lead to   escalation in State conduct. The contributions of States represented through experts as part of this GGE are   an important part of this process and will be a valuable resource for the international community on key   questions of how international law applies in cyberspace.   In 2020, Australia also submitted a non-paper to the UN OEWG on Cyber containing a series of case studies   on the application of international law in cyberspace.   The case studies seek to demonstrate that existing treaties and customary international law provide a   comprehensive and robust framework to address the threats posed by state-generated or sponsored   malicious cyber activity. In particular, international law provides victim States with a ‘tool kit’ to identify   breaches of international legal obligations, attribute those acts to the responsible State, seek peaceful   resolution of disputes and, where the victim State deems appropriate, take lawful measures in response. In   this way, the application of existing international law to cyberspace can enhance international peace and   security by increasing the predictability of State behaviour, reducing the possibility of conflict, minimising   escalation and preventing misattribution. The case studies are annexed to this submission and should be   read in conjunction with it.   It is important to recognise that international law is most effective when States implement and adhere to   their international legal obligations and, where necessary, cooperate to uphold international law and   ensure accountability for violations.           2      In the cyber context, international law is one element in the ‘framework for responsible State behaviour in   cyberspace’. The other elements are: voluntary, non-binding norms (‘norms’); confidence building measures;   and capacity building. The 2015 GGE elaborated 11 norms, which were endorsed by consensus in UN General   Assembly Resolution 70/237 (2015), as well as in the report of the 2021 OEWG which was itself endorsed by   consensus in UN General Assembly Decision 75/816. The norms reflect the expectations and standards of the   international community regarding responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, but they do not replace or   alter States’ binding obligations or rights under international law. Accordingly, the norms provide specific   guidance, additional to international law, on what constitutes responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs.   This understanding of the relationship between international law and norms was affirmed by the OEWG in   its 2021 report.     1. The United Nations Charter, the law on the use of force ( jus ad bellum) and the principle of   non-intervention   The United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and associated rules of customary international law apply to  activities conducted in cyberspace. Article 2(3) of the UN Charter requires States to seek the peaceful  settlement of disputes and Article 2(4) prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial  integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the  UN. These obligations—and the UN Charter in its entirety—apply in cyberspace as they do in the physical  realm.    The obligation to seek peaceful settlement of disputes does not impinge upon a State's inherent right to act  in individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack. This right applies equally in the cyber  domain as it does in the physical realm.    The UN Charter (Article 33) applies to international disputes involving cyber activities, the continuance of  which are likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. States are required to  seek the settlement of such disputes by peaceful means such as negotiation, enquiry, mediation,  conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, and resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other  peaceful means of their own choice.    Resolution of a cyber dispute consistent with Chapter VI of the UN Charter (Pacific Settlement of Disputes)   could include the parties referring the matter to the International Court of Justice. This would require that   the necessary preconditions be met, including that the matter is admissible and that the Court has jurisdiction   to hear it.   The UN Security Council may exercise its powers and responsibilities under Chapter VI and Chapter VII  (Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression) of the UN  Charter with respect to cyber activities endangering international peace and security.    In determining whether a cyber activity constitutes a use of force, States should consider whether the  activity's scale and effects are comparable to traditional kinetic operations that rise to the level of use of  force under international law. This involves a consideration of the intended or reasonably expected direct  and indirect consequences of the cyber activity, including for example whether the activity could  reasonably be expected to cause serious or extensive ('scale') damage or destruction ('effects') in the form  of injury or death to persons, or damage or destruction (including to their functioning) to objects or critical  infrastructure.           3        Harmful conduct in cyberspace that does not constitute a use of force may constitute a breach of the duty  not to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another State. This obligation is encapsulated in Article  2(7) of the Charter and in customary international law.    A prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means, either directly or indirectly, in matters  that a State is permitted by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. Such matters include a  State’s economic, political, social and cultural systems and foreign policy. Coercive means are those that  effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern  matters of an inherently sovereign nature.    The use by a State of cyber activities to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the  electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervene in the fundamental operation  of Parliament, or significantly disrupt the functioning of a States’ financial systems would constitute a  violation of the principle of non-intervention.    A use of force will be lawful when the territorial State consents, when it is authorised by the Security  Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, or when it is taken pursuant to a State’s inherent right of  individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack, as recognised in Article 51 of the  Charter.    Australia considers that the thresholds and limitations governing the exercise of self-defence under Article  51 apply in respect of cyber activities that constitute an armed attack and in respect of acts of self-defence  that are carried out by cyber means. Thus, if a cyber activity—alone or in combination with a physical  operation—results in, or presents an imminent threat of, damage equivalent to a traditional armed attack,  then the inherent right to self-defence is engaged. Any use of force in self-defence must be necessary for  the State to defend itself against the actual or imminent armed attack, and be a proportionate response in  scope, scale and duration. Any reliance on Article 51 must be reported directly to the UN Security Council.    The rapidity of cyber activities, as well as their potentially concealed and/or indiscriminate character, raises  new challenges for the application of established principles. These challenges have been noted by Australia  in explaining its position on imminence and the right of self-defence in the context of national security  threats that have evolved as a result of technological advances. For example, in a speech to the University  of Queensland in 2017, then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. George Brandis QC, explained that:     ‘[A] state may act in anticipatory self-defence against an armed attack when the attacker is clearly  committed to launching an armed attack, in circumstances where the victim will lose its last  opportunity to effectively defend itself unless it acts. This standard reflects the nature of  contemporary threats, as well as the means of attack that hostile parties might deploy. Consider,  for example, a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation, …which could  cause large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure. Such an attack might be  launched in a split-second. Is it seriously to be suggested that a state has no right to take action  before that split-second?’   2. International humanitarian law (jus in bello) and international human rights law   International humanitarian law (IHL) (including the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and  distinction) applies to cyber activities within an armed conflict.           4        Australia considers that a cyber activity may constitute an ‘attack’ against an adversary under IHL if it rises   to the same threshold as that of a kinetic ‘attack’ (or act of violence). The rules governing such attacks   during armed conflict will apply to those kinds of cyber activities. Accordingly, it will be necessary to assess   whether the cyber activity is sufficiently connected to hostilities and results in the reasonably foreseeable   death or injury to individuals or damage and destruction to objects. IHL also provides rules that apply to   cyber activities in an armed conflict that do not constitute or rise to the level of an ‘attack’, including the   general protections afforded to the civilian population and individual civilians against dangers arising from   military operations.   In accordance with the IHL principle of military necessity, a combatant is justified in using measures, not  forbidden by international law, which are indispensable for securing complete submission of an enemy at  the soonest moment. The principle cannot be used to justify actions prohibited by law, as the means to  achieve victory are not unlimited.    The IHL principle of distinction seeks to ensure that only legitimate military objectives are attacked.  Distinction has two components. The first, relating to personnel, seeks to maintain the distinction between  combatants (who may be attacked), and civilians or non-combatants (including protected persons). The  second component distinguishes between objects which are targetable as legitimate military objectives,  and civilian and protected objects.    The IHL principle of proportionality prohibits the launching of an attack which may be expected to cause  incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which  would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.    Australia, and other States parties to Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are required  under Article 36 to determine whether the employment of new weapons, or means or method of warfare,  would, in some or all circumstances be prohibited by Additional Protocol I or any other rule of international  law applicable to that State. A cyber capability could, in certain circumstances, constitute a ‘weapon, or a  means or method of warfare’ within the meaning of Article 36 and require a review in accordance with  Article 36 obligations.    In armed conflict, Australian military capabilities are employed within a well-established system of  command and control, within applicable legal frameworks, and subject to orders, directives and  procedures. This includes approved targeting procedures. Cyber activities are no different. Where cyber  actions or activities amount to an attack under IHL, as for conventional activities, Australian targeting  procedures comply with the requirements of IHL. Trained legal officers are available to support  Commanders with advice to ensure that Australia satisfies its obligations under international law and  operates in accordance with its domestic legal requirements.    International human rights law (IHRL) also applies to State conduct in cyberspace. Under IHRL, States have  obligations to protect relevant human rights of individuals under their jurisdiction, including the right to  privacy, where those rights are exercised or realised through or in cyberspace. Subject to lawful  derogations and limitations, States must ensure without distinction individuals’ rights to privacy, freedom  of expression and freedom of association online.               5      3. General principles of international law, including the law on State responsibility   The customary international law on State responsibility, much of which is reflected in the International Law  Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), applies to  State behaviour in cyberspace. Under the law on State responsibility, there will be an internationally  wrongful act of a State when its conduct in cyberspace—whether by act or omission—is attributable to it  and constitutes a breach of one of its international obligations.    To the extent that a State enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its  territory, it necessarily shoulders corresponding responsibilities to ensure those objects and activities are  not used to harm other States. In this context, we note it may not be reasonable to expect (or even possible  for) a State to prevent all malicious use of ICT infrastructure located within its territory. However, in  Australia's view, if a State is aware of an internationally wrongful act originating from or routed through its  territory, and it has the ability to put an end to the harmful activity, that State should take reasonable steps  to do so consistent with international law.    States are entitled, in their sole discretion, and based on their own judgement, to attribute unlawful cyber  activities to another State. States should act reasonably when drawing conclusions based on the facts  before them.    A cyber activity will be attributable to a State under international law where, for example, the activity was  conducted by an organ of the State; by persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority;  or by non-State actors operating under the direction or control of the State.    Australia recognises the need to distinguish between different attribution assessments, including factual   attribution (which includes an assessment of technical and other contextual information) and legal   attribution (that there has been a breach of international law), as well as the political decision to convey –   publicly or privately – those attribution assessments.   If a State is a victim of malicious cyber activity, which is attributable to a perpetrator State, the victim-State  may be able to take countermeasures under certain circumstances. Countermeasures are measures, which  would otherwise be unlawful, taken to secure cessation of, or reparation for, the other State’s unlawful  conduct. Countermeasures may be cyber in nature or taken through alternative means, such as temporarily  not performing certain bilateral treaty obligations owed to a State.    Countermeasures in cyberspace cannot amount to a use of force and must be proportionate.    States are able to respond to other States’ malicious activity with acts of retorsion, which are unfriendly  acts that are not inconsistent with any of the State’s international obligations.    If a State is the victim of harmful conduct in cyberspace, that State could be entitled to remedies in the  form of restitution, compensation or satisfaction. In the cyber context, this may mean that the victim-State  could, for example, seek replacement of damaged hardware or compensation for the foreseeable physical  and financial losses resulting from the damage to servers, as well as assurances or guarantees of non- repetition.    28 May 2021  [Annex: cyber case studies]           i             Annex     Australia Non Paper   Case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace       The international community recognises that existing international law – and in particular the UN Charter in  its entirety – is applicable to state conduct in cyberspace and is essential to maintaining peace and stability  and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment. This is reflected in the 2013 and  2015 reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on the use of Information Communications  Technologies in the Context of International Security (UNGGE),1 as adopted by the UN General Assembly.2  Australia’s position on how international law governs state conduct in cyberspace is presented in the  International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2017), Annex A,3 as supplemented by the 2019 International Law  Supplement.4    These case studies apply international law to standalone hypothetical scenarios, demonstrating that  existing treaties and customary international law provide a comprehensive and robust framework to  address the threats posed by state-generated or sponsored malicious cyber activity. In particular,  international law provides victim states with a “tool kit” to identify breaches of international legal  obligations, attribute those acts to the responsible state, seek peaceful resolution of disputes and, where  the victim state deems appropriate, take lawful measures in response. The case studies illustrate that the  application of existing international law to cyberspace can enhance international peace and security by  increasing predictability of state behaviour, reducing the possibility of conflict, minimising escalation and  preventing misattribution.    The case studies represent fictional scenarios and are not based on actual actors or events. They are  intended to illustrate potential options rather than recommend a course of action. They do not purport to  represent how Australia could or would respond to any malicious cyber activity directed against it, or  purport to provide a comprehensive view on potential response options or the international law issues  raised in any specific scenario.     1 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications  in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98 para 19; Report of the Group of Governmental  Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security  (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para. 24.  2 UNGA Resolution 68/243 (9 January 2014) UN Doc A/RES/68/243; UNGA Resolution 70/237 (30 December 2015) UN  Doc A/RES/70/237.  3 Available at  and also enclosed at Attachment 1  4 Available at  affairs/aices/chapters/2019_international_law_supplement.html and also enclosed at Attachment 2                 ii      Scenario 1 – Cyber operations by State B on government systems and websites of  State A    State A undertakes major reforms to its domestic company law and tax code that are consistent with its  international obligations. In order to implement the new laws – including to allow State A’s tax office and  corporate regulator to monitor and enforce new requirements on companies – State A requires all  registered companies to disclose certain information via a government website. State B opposes the  reforms because it considers they unfairly impact on the interests of companies from State B operating in  State A. In an attempt to prevent State A from implementing the reforms, State B, through its Department  of Defence, conducts a series of cyber operations that prevent use of the website and disable government  systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator. As a result, State A is incapable of regulating  companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely  postpone implementation of the new tax reforms. State A also loses significant tax revenue.    International law may assist State A in the following ways:     First, it provides rules of legal attribution – contained in the customary international law on state  responsibility, much of which is reflected in the International Law Commission's Articles on the  Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – meaning that acts of the Department of  Defence, as an organ of State B, would be attributable to State B.    Second, it defines states’ rights and obligations, including the international law duty not to  intervene in the internal affairs of another state (prohibited intervention). State B’s conduct could  constitute a prohibited intervention on the basis that it was a coercive interference in matters  which State A is entitled as a matter of state sovereignty to decide freely, including its economic  system. However, establishing the aforementioned elements of prohibited intervention would  depend on the circumstances, including the extent of economic damage and the loss of  government control over economic policy.    Third, if State B’s conduct violated international law, it would entitle State A to invoke the  international legal responsibility of State B, and State A could demand that State B cease the  unlawful act/s (if they were continuing) and make full reparation for State A’s injuries. Reparation  could include restoring full access to relevant websites and providing compensation for any  financially assessable damage. As international law governs the dispute, State A may seek to pursue  resolution through legal as well as political avenues including, for example, by seeking a resolution  consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement of  Disputes),5 which could include referring the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)  where the necessary preconditions had been met (including admissibility and jurisdiction).    Fourth, if State B’s conduct violated international law, it would entitle State A to take  countermeasures – acts which would ordinarily be unlawful – in response to State B’s wrongdoing.  Countermeasures could be cyber in nature or taken through alternative means – such as     5 For example: Article 33(1) of the UN Charter provides that “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is  likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by  negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or  arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.” In Security Our Common Future: An Agenda for  Disarmament (Office for Disarmament Affairs, 2018) the UN Secretary-General commits to “make available his good  offices to contribute to the prevention and peaceful settlement of conflict stemming from malicious activity in  cyberspace”.           iii      temporarily not performing certain bilateral treaty obligations owed to State  B. However, State A would need to ensure that such countermeasures:   • were directed against State B   • did not constitute a threat or use of force, violate fundamental human rights,  humanitarian obligations prohibiting reprisals, or peremptory international legal norms   • were reversible (as far as possible)   • were proportionate to the injury suffered by State A, and   • were intended to induce State B to comply with its international legal obligations.     International law would not preclude State A from taking acts of retorsion, which are unfriendly acts that  are not inconsistent with the international obligations of State A, including, for example, declaring  diplomats from State B in State A persona non grata.      Scenario 2 – State A’s territory/infrastructure used by State B to conduct malicious cyber  activities against State C    State B’s Department of Defence conducts malicious cyber activities against State C that are routed through  servers located on State A’s territory, without its knowledge. The malicious cyber activities conducted by  State B are contrary to the rights of State C (although they do not constitute an unlawful use of force). State  A’s relationship with State C could be damaged.    International law may assist State A in the following ways:     First, it provides rules of legal attribution, under which the unlawful acts of State B could not be  attributed to State A. The rules of attribution (as outlined in Scenario 1) provide a clear legal  framework for connecting the conduct of an individual or an entity to a state; this connection  would not be established in the present case between State B’s Department of Defence and State  A. Rather, the acts of the Department of Defence would be attributable to State B as an organ of  that state exercising executive functions. Attribution would also be made out against State B if it  used a proxy acting on its instructions, or under its direction or control, to carry out the relevant  acts. Additionally, State A would not be considered responsible for aiding and assisting State B  because its lack of knowledge of the wrongful acts and its lack of intent to aid or assist the wrongful  acts would mean that it could not have been complicit in the commission of those acts. Therefore,  State C could not make a legal attribution of the wrongful conduct to State A.     Second, as a result, State A could not be considered directly responsible for any unlawful act  committed by State B against State C. Accordingly, State C could not pursue dispute resolution  through legal avenues (including the ICJ, as outlined in Scenario 1) against State A in relation to  State B’s wrongdoing; although it could do so against State B. Additionally, assuming State A could  not have been aware of the activity taking place from its territory, it did not act contrary to the  norm of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace to not knowingly allow its territory to be used  for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs,6 or in violation of any applicable international  obligations.        6 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications  in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para. 13(c) (see, also, para. 13(h)).           iv      Third, as State A is not directly responsible for any unlawful act committed by State  B against State C, State C could not take any countermeasures – acts that would  ordinarily be unlawful – against State A in response to State B’s conduct. Were it to do so, State A  would itself be entitled to respond through countermeasures and seek remedies.     Note: this scenario details how international law would assist State A (whose territory/infrastructure was  used without its knowledge by State B to conduct malicious activity against State C). Separately, and  provided all requirements were met (see Scenario 1), State C could invoke the international legal  responsibility of State B and pursue a legal and/or political resolution and take countermeasures and/or  acts of retorsion against it.       Scenario 3 – State B conducts a major offensive cyber operation that constitutes a serious threat  to State A’s national security    Amid growing tensions between State A and State B,7 the armed forces of State B conduct a major  offensive cyber operation against State A, destroying servers located in State A used by State A’s military  headquarters. This renders State A unable to communicate with naval vessels operating in international  waters off the coast of State B. It will take several months to replace the destroyed servers, at substantial  cost.    International law may assist State A in the following ways:     First, it provides rules of legal attribution, meaning that under the customary international law on  state responsibility (as outlined in Scenario 1), the acts of the armed forces, as an organ of State B,  would be attributable to State B.     Second, it defines states’ rights and obligations, meaning that State B’s cyber operation may  constitute an unlawful use of force contrary to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter against State A (unless  such actions were taken in self-defence or authorised under a Chapter VII resolution of the UN  Security Council). This would turn on whether the operation caused damage to State A’s  infrastructure and objects (its military servers) and subsequent impact on the functioning of its  military communications systems that was akin in scale and effects to a traditional kinetic  operation that would rise to the level of a use of force.    Third, assuming State B’s conduct violated international law, it would entitle State A to invoke the  international legal responsibility of State B and demand that State B cease unlawful act/s (if they  were continuing) and make full reparation for State A’s injuries. Reparation could entail  compensation for financially assessable damage, as well as assurances or guarantees of non- repetition. As international law governs the dispute, State A may seek to pursue resolution through  legal as well as political avenues including, for example, by seeking a resolution consistent with the  Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement of Disputes) 8 (which could  include the International Court of Justice, as outlined in Scenario 1) and/or Chapter VII (Action with  Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression)9.     7 For the purposes of this scenario, there is not a state of armed conflict between State A and State B immediately  prior to State B’s offensive cyber operation.  8 See note 5 above.  9 For example: Article 39 of the UN Charter provides that “The [UN] Security Council shall determine the existence of  any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what           v        Fourth, if State B’s conduct violated international law, it would entitle State A to  take countermeasures – acts which would ordinarily be unlawful – in response to State B’s  wrongdoing. Countermeasures could be cyber in nature or taken through alternative means – such  as implementing otherwise unlawful tariffs on trade in important goods/services from State  B. However, State A would need to ensure that such countermeasures:   • were directed against State B   • did not constitute a threat or use of force, violate fundamental human rights,  humanitarian obligations prohibiting reprisals, or peremptory international legal norms   • were reversible (as far as possible)   • were proportionate to the injury suffered by State A, and   • were intended to induce State B to comply with its international legal obligations.    Fifth, if the cyber operation constituted an “armed attack”, as recognised under Article 51 of the  UN Charter, State A would be entitled to use force pursuant to its inherent right of self-defence  against State B. The use of force in self-defence may be cyber in nature or conducted through  kinetic means. However, the right to self-defence would require that State A only use force where  it is necessary to repel the actual or imminent armed attack and that such force be a proportionate  response in scope, scale and duration. The measures taken by State A would need to be  immediately reported to the UN Security Council.     International law would not preclude State A from taking acts of retorsion, which are unfriendly acts that  are not inconsistent with the international obligations of State A, including, for example, declaring  diplomats from State B in State A persona non grata.     measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42 to maintain or restore international peace and  security.”           vi         ATTACHMENT 1     2017 - AUSTRALIA’S POSITION ON THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW TO  STATE CONDUCT IN CYBERSPACE  Existing international law provides the framework for state behaviour in cyberspace. This includes, where  applicable, the law regarding the use of force, international humanitarian law (IHL), international human rights  law, and international law regarding state responsibility.    In this respect, Australia notes that the centrality of international law and its application to states' use of  cyberspace was affirmed in 2013 in the consensus report of the third United Nations Group of Governmental  Experts (UNGGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of  International Security, which was chaired by Australia, and reaffirmed in the 2015 report of the UNGGE.    However, Australia recognises that activities conducted in cyberspace raise new challenges for the application  of international law, including issues of sovereignty, attribution and jurisdiction, given that different actors  engage in a range of cyber activities which may cross multiple national borders. This annex sets out Australia's  views on these issues.    1. The United Nations Charter and the law on the use of force (jus ad bellum) apply to activities conducted in  cyberspace.  The Charter of the United Nations requires states to seek peaceful settlements of disputes. This obligation  extends to cyberspace and requires states to resolve cyber incidents peacefully without escalation or resort to  the threat or use of force. This requirement does not impinge upon a state's inherent right to act in individual  or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack, which applies equally in the cyber domain as it does  in the physical realm.    In determining whether a cyber attack, or any other cyber activity, constitutes a use of force, states should  consider whether the activity's scale and effects are comparable to traditional kinetic operations that rise to  the level of use of force under international law. This involves a consideration of the intended or reasonably  expected direct and indirect consequences of the cyber attack, including for example whether the cyber  activity could reasonably be expected to cause serious or extensive ('scale') damage or destruction ('effects')  to life, or injury or death to persons, or result in damage to the victim state's objects, critical infrastructure  and/or functioning.    2. For cyber operations constituting or occurring within the context of an international or non-international  armed conflict, the relevant international humanitarian law (jus in bello) will apply to the conduct of these  cyber activities.  International humanitarian law (IHL) (including the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and  distinction) applies to cyber operations within an armed conflict.  The IHL principle of proportionality prohibits the launching of an attack which may be expected to cause  incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which  would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.      The IHL principle of military necessity states that a combatant is justified in using those measures, not  forbidden by international law, which are indispensable for securing complete submission of an enemy at the           vii      soonest moment. The principle cannot be used to justify actions prohibited by law, as the  means to achieve victory are not unlimited.    The IHL principle of distinction seeks to ensure that only legitimate military objects are attacked. Distinction  has two components. The first, relating to personnel, seeks to maintain the distinction between combatants  and non-combatants or military and civilian personnel. The second component distinguishes between  legitimate military targets and civilian objects.    All Australian military capabilities are employed in line with approved targeting procedures. Cyber operations  are no different. Australian targeting procedures comply with the requirements of IHL and trained legal  officers provide decision-makers with advice to ensure that Australia satisfies its obligations under  international law and its domestic legal requirements.    For example, Australia considers that, if a cyber operation rises to the same threshold as that of a kinetic  'attack under IHL', the rules governing such attacks during armed conflict will apply to those kinds of cyber  operations.    3. For cyber activities taking place outside of armed conflict, general principles of international law,  including the law on state responsibility, apply.  It is a longstanding rule of international law that, if a state acts in violation of an international obligation, and  that violation is attributable to the state, that state will be responsible for the violation.    The customary international law on state responsibility, much of which is reflected in the International Law  Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, apply to state behaviour  in cyberspace.    To the extent that a state enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its  territory, it necessarily shoulders corresponding responsibilities to ensure those objects and activities are not  used to harm other states. In this context, we note it may not be reasonable to expect (or even possible for) a  state to prevent all malicious use of ICT infrastructure located within its territory. However, in Australia's view,  if a state is aware of an internationally wrongful act originating from or routed through its territory, and it has  the ability to put an end to the harmful activity, that state should take reasonable steps to do so consistent  with international law.    If a state is a victim of malicious cyber activity which is attributable to a perpetrator state, the victim state may  be able to take countermeasures against the perpetrator state, under certain circumstances. However,  countermeasures that amount to a use of force are not permissible. Any use of countermeasures involving  cyberspace must be proportionate. It is acknowledged that this raises challenges in identifying and assessing  direct and indirect effects of malicious cyber activity, in order to gauge a proportionate response. The purpose  of countermeasures is to compel the other party to desist in the ongoing unlawful conduct.             viii         ATTACHMENT 2   2019 - SUPPLEMENT TO AUSTRALIA’S POSITION ON THE APPLICATION OF  INTERNATIONAL LAW TO STATE CONDUCT IN CYBERSPACE    In the International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2017) (Strategy), Australia committed to periodically publish  its position on the application of relevant international law to state conduct in cyberspace. The first such  publication appeared in Annex A to the Strategy. This document is the second publication and is aimed at  further elaborating Australia’s position on applicable international law as expressed in the Strategy. As such, it  should be read as a supplement to that document.   Application and development of international law  The Strategy recognised the well-established position that existing international law - including the UN Charter  in its entirety - provides the framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. The international  community, including the permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council recognised this in  the 2013 and 2015 reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on the use of Information  Communications Technologies in the Context of International Security (UNGGE), as adopted by the UN General  Assembly. Australia also acknowledged that activities conducted in cyberspace raise new challenges for how  international law applies. To deepen understandings and set clear expectations, Australia encourages states to  be transparent in how they interpret existing international law as it applies to state conduct in cyberspace. The  Strategy, and this supplement, form part of Australia’s ongoing effort to make its views on the applicability of  international law public.   The law on the use of force (jus ad bellum) and the principle of non-intervention  The United Nations Charter (Charter) and associated rules of customary international law apply to activities  conducted in cyberspace. Article 2(3) of the Charter requires states to seek the peaceful settlement of disputes  and Article 2(4) prohibits the threat or use of force by a state against the territorial integrity or political  independence of another state, or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. In the Strategy,  Australia made clear that these obligations – and the UN Charter in its entirety, including those obligations,  apply in cyberspace as they do in the physical realm.    A use of force will be lawful when the territorial state consents, it is authorised by the Security Council under  Chapter VII of the UN Charter or when it is taken pursuant to a state’s inherent right of individual or collective  self-defence in response to an armed attack, as recognised in Article 51 of the Charter. Australia considers that  the thresholds and limitations governing the exercise of self-defence under Article 51 apply in respect of cyber  operations that constitute an armed attack and in respect of acts of self- defence that are carried out by cyber  means. Thus if a cyber operation – alone or in combination with a physical operation – results in, or presents  an imminent threat of, damage equivalent to a traditional armed attack, then the inherent right to self- defence is engaged. The rapidity of cyber attacks, as well as their potentially concealed and/or indiscriminate  character, raises new challenges for the application of established principles. These challenges have been  raised by Australia in explaining its position on the concept of imminence and the right of self-defence in the  context of national security threats that have evolved as a result of technological advances (see Figure 1).                  ix         FIGURE 1 – IMMINENCE AND CYBER OPERATIONS   “[A] state may act in anticipatory self-defence against an armed attack when the  attacker is clearly committed to launching an armed attack, in circumstances where the  victim will lose its last opportunity to effectively defend itself unless it acts.   This standard reflects the nature of contemporary threats, as well as the means of attack  that hostile parties might deploy.   Consider, for example, a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber  operation (and, of course, when I say ‘armed attack’, I mean that term in the strict sense  of Article 51 of the Charter). The cyber operation could cause large-scale loss of human  life and damage to critical infrastructure. Such an attack might be launched in a split- second. Is it seriously to be suggested that a state has no right to take action before that  split-second?”   Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. George Brandis QC,  University of Queensland, 11 April 2017     Harmful conduct in cyberspace that does not constitute a use of force may still constitute a breach of the duty  not to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state. This obligation is encapsulated in Article  2(7) of the Charter and in customary international law. A prohibited intervention is one that interferes by  coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon  or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature), either directly or indirectly, in matters that a state is  permitted by the principle of state sovereignty to decide freely. Such matters include a state’s economic,  political, and social systems, and foreign policy. Accordingly, as former UK Attorney-General Jeremy Wright  outlined in 2018, the use by a hostile State of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the  results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the  stability of States’ financial systems would constitute a violation of the principle of non-intervention.   International humanitarian law (jus in bello) and international human rights law  The Strategy and the 2015 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of  Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (A/70/174), discussed the  applicability of international humanitarian law (IHL) to cyber operations in armed conflict, including the  principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. Australia considers that, if a cyber  operation rises to the same threshold as that of a kinetic ‘attack’ (or act of violence) under IHL, the rules  governing such attacks during armed conflict will apply to those kinds of cyber operations. Applicable IHL rules  will also apply to cyber operations in an armed conflict that do not constitute or rise to the level of an ‘attack’,  including the principle of military necessity and the general protections afforded to the civilian population and  individual civilians with respect to military operations.                x        International human rights law (IHRL) also applies to the use of cyberspace (see e.g. Figure 2).  States have obligations to protect relevant human rights of individuals under their jurisdiction, including the  right to privacy, where those rights are exercised or realised through or in cyberspace. Subject to lawful  derogations and limitations, states must ensure without distinction individuals’ rights to privacy, freedom of  expression and freedom of association online.   FIGURE 2 – COMMONWEALTH CYBER DECLARATION   “Recognising the potential for a free, open, inclusive and secure cyberspace to promote  economic growth for all communities and to act as an enabler for realisation of the  Sustainable Development Goals across the Commonwealth, we:    5. Affirm that the same rights that citizens have offline must also be protected online.”   Commonwealth Heads of Government Declaration  20 April 2018   General principles of international law, including the law on state responsibility  In the Strategy, Australia recognised that the law on state responsibility, much of which is reflected in the  International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility of states for Internationally Wrongful Acts,  applies to state behaviour in cyberspace. Under the law on state responsibility, there will be an internationally  wrongful act of a state when its conduct in cyberspace – whether by act or omission – is attributable to it and  constitutes a breach of one of its international obligations.    Australia will, in its sole discretion, and based on its own judgement, attribute unlawful cyber operations to  another state. In making such decisions, Australia relies on the assessments of its law enforcement and  intelligence agencies, and consultations with its international partners (see e.g. Figure 3). A cyber operation  will be attributable to a state under international law where, for example, the operation was conducted by an  organ of the state; by persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority; or by non-state  actors operating under the direction or control of the state.    As outlined in the Strategy, if a state is a victim of malicious cyber activity which is attributable to a perpetrator  state, the victim state may be able to take countermeasures (whether in cyberspace or through another  means) against the perpetrator state, under certain circumstances. Countermeasures are measures, which  would otherwise be unlawful, taken to secure cessation of, or reparation for, the other state’s unlawful  conduct. Countermeasures in cyberspace cannot amount to a use of force and must be proportionate. States  are able to respond to other States’ malicious activity with acts of retorsion, which are unfriendly acts that are  not inconsistent with any of the State’s international obligations.    If a state is the victim of harmful conduct in cyberspace, that state could be entitled to remedies in the form of  restitution, compensation or satisfaction. In the cyber context, this may mean that the victim-state could for  example seek replacement of damaged hardware or compensation for the foreseeable physical and financial  losses resulting from the damage to servers, as well as assurances or guarantees of non-repetition.",

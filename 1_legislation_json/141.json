Chapter Three   Requirements of Electronic Transactions   Article (4)   In the context of contract formation or conducting transactions, an offer or acceptance of   an offer may be expressed, in whole or in part, by means of electronic communications.   A contract or transaction shall not be denied validity or enforceability solely on the   grounds that one or more electronic communications were used in its formation.      Article (5)   A data message is from and attributed to the originator if it was sent by the originator   itself. A data message shall also be deemed to be that of the originator in the following   cases:   1- if the data message was sent by a person who had the authority to act on   behalf of the originator in respect of that data message or sent by an   information system or automated message system programmed to operate   by, or on behalf of, the originator.   2- if the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the   originator for that purpose in order to ascertain whether the data message   was that of the originator.   3- if the data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions   of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of   the originator enabled that person to lawfully gain access to a method   used by the originator to identify the data message as its own.   Article (6)   A data message shall not be deemed from the originator in the following two cases:   1- from the time when the addressee has received notice from the originator that the   data message is not from the originator and had reasonable time to act   accordingly.     7      2- the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or   used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not from the originator.      Article (7)   As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee may rely on the data message   where the data message is from the originator and to act upon it. The addressee is not   entitled to such reliance when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable   care or used any agreed procedure, that data message as received was subject to error   resulting from the process of telecommunication.       Article (8)   The addressee is entitled to treat each data message received as a separate data message,   and to act on that treatment, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message   and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used   any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate.    Article (9)   Where the originator has requested or agreed with the addressee, on or before sending the   data message that the receipt of the data message be acknowledged, the data message will   be deemed as received by the addressee once the above-mentioned acknowledgement is   received by the originator. This does not imply that the content of the data message as   sent corresponds to the content as received.    Article (10)   Where the originator has not identified or agreed with the addressee that the   acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an   acknowledgement may be given by any communication by the addressee, automated or   otherwise, or any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the   data message has been received.    Article (11)   Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the   acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it was not sent, until the   acknowledgement is received.   Where the originator has not previously stated that the data message is conditional on   receipt of an acknowledgement, and where an acknowledgement has not been received     8      by the originator, the originator may give notice to the addressee stating that the earlier   data message requires acknowledgement and specifying a reasonable time by which the   acknowledgement must be received, and if the acknowledgement is not received within   the time specified, the originator may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data   message as though it was not sent, or exercise any other rights it may have.      Article (12)   Where the received acknowledgement states that the data message met technical   requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that   those requirements have been met.   Article (13)   Except in so far as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, Articles (9),   (10), (11), (12) of this Law are not intended to determine the legal consequences that may   flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt.   Article (14)   Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee of the data message,   the dispatch of the data message occurs as follows:   1- when the data message enters an information system outside the control of the   originator.   2- if the data message enters successively two (2) or more information systems   outside the control of the originator, then, the dispatch of the data message   occurs when it enters the first of those information systems.   Article (15)   Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee of the data message,   the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows:   1- if the addressee of the data message has designated an electronic address for the   purpose of receiving data messages, then, the time of receipt is when the data   message is accessible by the addressee at that electronic address.   2- if the data message has been sent to the address of the addressee not designated by   the addressee, then, the time of receipt is the time when the data message is   accessible by the addressee or when retrieved by him/her, whichever is earlier.        9      Article (16)   Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee:   1- the data message is taken to have been dispatched at the place where the   originator has its place of business. The data message is taken to have been   received at the place where the addressee has its place of business.   2- if the originator or addressee has more than one place of business, the place of   business that has a closer relationship to the underlying transaction shall be the   applicable place of dispatch or receipt.   3- if the originator or addressee has more than one place of business and the   provisions of the preceding paragraphs do not apply, the originator’s or   addressee’s principal place of business shall be the applicable place of dispatch or   receipt.   4- if the originator or addressee does not have a place of business, the applicable   place of dispatch or receipt shall be the place where the originator or addressee   ordinarily resides.       Article (17)   A location is not a place of business merely because that is where equipment or any other   part of an information system used by a party in connection with a transaction is located   or where an information system used by a party in connection with a transaction may be   accessed by other parties.   Article (18)   The sole fact that a party makes use of a domain name or electronic mail address   connected to a specific country does not create a presumption that its place of business is   located in that country.   Article (19)   Where a natural person makes an unintentional entry or any error in entering information   in a data message exchanged with the automated message system of another party and the   automated message system does not provide the person with an opportunity to correct the   error, that person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has the right to   withdraw the portion of the data message in which the input error was made provided that   the person or the party on whose behalf that person was acting:   1- notifies the other party of the error as soon as possible after having   learned of the error.     10      2- has not used or received any material benefit or value from the goods or   services received from the other party that are the subject of the input   error.    Chapter Four   The Effect and Evidential Weight of Electronic Transactions   Article (20)   Information in the data message shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability   solely on the grounds that they are in the form of a data message.   Information in the data message shall also not be denied legal effect, validity or   enforceability solely on the grounds that it is merely referred to in that data message   without details, provided that the data message clearly identifies how to have access to   the details of this information, the information is accessible so as to be used for   subsequent reference by every person that has a right to access and use the information   and the method for accessing the information is clearly identified in the data message and   does not place an unreasonable burden on any person that has a right to access the   information.       Article (21)   Where any law requires information or a document to be in writing or identified   consequences for the information or document not being in writing, that requirement is   satisfied where the information or document is in the form of a data message, provided   that the information or document is accessible so as to be used for subsequent reference   by every person that has a right to access the information or document.

Article (24)   Where any law requires information or a document to be retained or stored and identified   consequences for the information or document not being retained, that requirement is   satisfied by retaining such information or document in the form of a data message,   provided that the following conditions are met:   1- the information or document contained in the data message is   accessible for subsequent reference by every person that has a right   to access and use the information or document.   2- the data message is retained in the format in which it was originally   produced, sent or received, or in a format that can be demonstrated   to accurately represent the information contained in the data message   as it was originally produced, sent or received.   3- such information, if any exists, is retained as enables the   identification of the origin and destination of the data message and   the date and time when it was originally sent or received.      Article (25)   Nothing shall apply so as to prevent the admissibility of information or a document as   evidence on the grounds that it is in the form of data message, or on the grounds that it is   not in its original form if it is the only evidence that the person adducing it could be   expected to obtain.           12               Article (26)   In assessing the evidential weight of information or document in the form of a data   message, regard shall be had to the following:   1. the processes and circumstances under which the data message was   generated, stored or communicated.   2. the processes and circumstances under which the integrity of the   information or document contained in the data message was maintained.   3. the processes and circumstances under which the originator of the data   message was identified.   4. any other relevant process or circumstances.   Article (27)   A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and a natural   person, or by the interaction of automated message systems, shall not be denied validity   or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural person reviewed or intervened in each   of the individual actions carried out by the automated message systems or the resulting   contract.

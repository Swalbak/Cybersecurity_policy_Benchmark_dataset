Part I addresses quest ions concerning  international law in general including human rights. Part II places particular emphasis on  questions relating to international humanitarian law (IHL).   Switzerland is committed to building and maintaining a free, open, secure and peaceful  cyberspace, and to advancing the recognition, observance and enforcement of international  law in this space.2 All states have a common interest in ensuring that cyberspace is governed  by the rule of law and used for peaceful purposes only. Switzerland considers international law   to be applicable to cyberspace. It therefore welcomes the consensus of previous UN GGEs  that international law, and in particular the UN Charter in its entirety, are applicable to  cyberspace3 – which was also approved unanimously by the UN General Assembly.4 It also  welcomes the OEWG 2019/2021 report of 18 March 2021, which confirms this consensus. 5   Switzerland views national positions of states as an important contribution to fleshing out the  application of international law in cyberspace. This paper therefore gives an overview of  Switzerland's position, but is neither exhaustive nor conclusive.

A/75/816.       Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      2/11         exchange at multilateral level remains key in order to continue to clarify how international law   is applicable to cyberspace in concrete terms. A definitive assessment of a cyber incident in  terms of international law is only possible when the concrete circumstances are known. This  means interpreting and applying the rules set out below in each individual case.   Of particular importance to the context of cybersecurity are namely the rules of international   law described below.   I. General international law   1. Peaceful settlement of disputes   In accordance with Art. 2 para. 3 and Art. 33 of the UN Charter, disputes which may endanger  the maintenance of international peace and security should be settled by peaceful means.  This includes diplomatic proceedings, arbitration or recourse to the International Court of   Justice (ICJ). As a neutral country with long-standing experience and engagement in the  provision of good offices, Switzerland is committed to upholding this principle in cyberspace,  emphasising the overriding aim of ensuring that cyberspace is used for peaceful purposes  only. Switzerland therefore welcomes the UN GGE's 2015 report and the OEWG 2019/2021   report confirming the peaceful settlement of disputes as one of the UN Charter's central  principles, which is also applicable to cyberspace. Consequently, disputes in cyberspace  should also be settled by peaceful means, not with unilateral measures.   2. Sovereignty   Sovereignty is a foundational principle of international law. It refers to a state's jurisdiction to  define, apply and enforce its own legal order, which in principle is limited to its territory. At   interstate level however, sovereignty implies an independent and equal co-existence among  states. Respect for and protection from interference with territorial integrity is a product of state  sovereignty.6 Accordingly, each state is obliged to respect the sovereignty of other states.7  Sovereignty is a binding primary rule of international law. Violations of sovereignty are   therefore considered internationally wrongful acts which, if attributable to the state itself, give  rise to state responsibility.   State sovereignty is also applicable to cyberspace.8 Owing to the special characteristics of  cyberspace, which has no clear territorial boundaries, putting the principle of sovereignty into   practice is a particular challenge. One major issue is who has jurisdiction over or access to  digital data. In the cyber context, the key question is which states have legitimate control over  digital data and are authorised to access that data – which may, depending on the  circumstances, be stored on a different territory or may not be localised geographically.   Conversely, in terms of interstate relations at cybersecurity level, the principle of sovereignty  provides wide scope for protection against cyber operations. For example, state sovereignty  protects information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure on a state's territory  against unauthorised intrusion or material damage. This includes the computer networks,      6 Arbitration aw ard in the Island of Palmas case, 1928, p. 838; the Sw iss Federal Constitution recognises   state sovereignty under international law on the basis of independence, granting the state exclusive   jurisdiction to make and enforce law w ithin its territory (Art. 2 para. 1).  7 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 292.  8 UN GGE 2013 Report, para. 20; UN GGE 2015 Report, paras. 27 and 28 b).     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      3/11         systems and software supported by the ICT infrastructure, regardless of whether the   infrastructure is private or public.   Switzerland recognises that defining what constitutes a violation of the principle of sovereignty  in cyberspace is particularly challenging and has yet to be clarified conclusively. It supports  considering the following two criteria in such assessments: first, does the incident violate the   state's territorial integrity and second, does it constitute interference with or usurpation of an  inherently governmental function. A precise definition of these criteria is a question of  interpretation and subject to debate. The current debate includes among other aspects i)  incidents whereby the functionality of infrastructure or related equipment has been damaged   or limited, ii) cases where data has been altered or deleted, interfering with the fulfilment of  inherently governmental functions such as providing social services, conducting elections and  referendums, or collecting taxes, and iii) situations in which a state has sought to influence,  disrupt or delay democratic decision-making processes in another state through the   coordinated use of legal and illegal methods in cyberspace e.g. propaganda, disinformation  and covert actions by intelligence services. The assessment of an individual case depends on  the nature of the cyber incident and its repercussions.   3. Prohibition of intervention   The principle of non-intervention is the corollary of the sovereign equality of all states (Art. 2   para. 1 UN Charter) and is considered customary international law.9 In this context,  intervention is understood to be the direct or indirect interference by one sovereign state in  the internal or external affairs of another using coercive measures. It covers those areas where  the state has exclusive jurisdiction (known as domaine réservé). The non-intervention principle   protects a state's ability to shape its own internal affairs (political, economic, social and cultural  systems) as well as its foreign policy. An infringement of sovereignty and a prohibited  intervention are not the same. The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention  a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. 10   This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly  higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.   The prohibition of intervention is also applicable to cyberspace. This means that in  cyberspace, an unlawful act of interference by one state in the political or economic affairs of   another may, in addition to constituting a violation of sovereignty, also breach the non- intervention principle under international law if the respective requirements are fulfilled.11 The  distinction between exerting influence, which is permissible, and coercion, which is not, must  be determined on a case-by-case basis. This is particularly true of economic coercion, which   could be the case if a company that is systemically relevant was paralysed through a cyber  operation. An assessment of whether the operation can be deemed coercive in nature, and  thereby be in breach of the non-intervention principle, can only be made on a case-by-case  basis.      9 Friendly Relations Declaration, A/RES/2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Military and Paramilitary Activities in   and against Nicaragua, ICJ reports 1986, para. 202.  10 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.  11 Explanatory notes to the Ordinance on Military Cyber Defence, SR 510.921.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      4/11         4. Prohibition on the use of force and the right of   self-defence   One of the key founding principles of the UN Charter is the prohibition on the use of force (Art.  2 para. 4). There are only two exceptions: if the use of force is authorised by the UN Security   Council (Art. 42) or if the strict conditions under which the right of self-defence may be  exercised are fulfilled (Art. 51).   The prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defence are also applicable to  cyberspace. The right of self-defence may only be exercised if an armed attack occurs first. In   accordance with ICJ case law, not every violation of the prohibition on the use of force  constitutes an armed attack, but only its gravest form. In order to qualify, the scale and effect  of the attack must reach a certain threshold of gravity.12 The ICJ has also determined that an  armed attack does not necessarily have to involve kinetic military action or the use of weapons   because the means by which an attack is perpetrated is not the decisive factor. 13 A state is  permitted to exercise its right of self-defence in response to a cyber incident if the incident  amounts in scale and effect to that of a kinetic operation in terms of inflicting death or serious  injury to persons, or extensive material damage to objects. There are no binding quant itative   or qualitative guidelines as to when the threshold of an armed attack in terms of scale and  effect has been reached. Current discussions on how to define an armed attack in cyberspace  are focusing on attacks on critical infrastructure (e.g. nuclear power plants, power grids) which  reach the required threshold in terms of scale and effect i.e. serious injury to persons and/or   extensive damage to objects.   The purpose of the UN Charter must guide the interpretation of the prohibition on the use of  force and the right to exercise self-defence in the face of an armed attack. The Charter's  objective is to maintain and, where necessary, restore international peace and security.   Consequently, even if an armed attack occurs, a state is only permitted to under take  countermeasures that are necessary and proportionate in order to repel the attack. The right  of self-defence only applies if the UN Security Council has not taken the necessary measures  to maintain international peace and security (Art. 51 UN Charter) . If the actions taken in self-  defence exceed this framework, the state itself is in breach of the prohibition on the use of  force. If the threshold for an armed attack has not been reached, states can have recourse to  immediate and proportionate non-violent countermeasures (see section 6.2).   5. Neutrality   As a matter of principle, Switzerland considers the rights and obligations of neutral countries   in international armed conflicts to be applicable to cyberspace as well.14 If such an international  armed conflict arises, a neutral country has a duty to prevent any infringements of its neutrality,  such as the use of its territory by one of the conflicting parties. Parties to the conflict are obliged      12 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 195.  13 Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39.  14 \"The Court f inds that as in the case of the principles of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict,   international law leaves no doubt that the principle of neutrality, w hatever its content, w hich is of a   fundamental character similar to that of the humanitarian principles and rules, is applicable (subject to the   relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter), to an international armed conflict, w hatever type of   w eapons might be used.\" Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ   Reports 1996, para 89.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      5/11         in turn to respect the territorial integrity of the neutral country. Therefore they may not conduct   related cyber operations from installations that are either on the territory or under the exclusive  control of the neutral country.15 Parties to the conflict are also prohibited from taking control of  a neutral country's computer systems in order to carry out such operations.16   Because of the global cross border nature of cyberspace, there are also limits to the rights   and duties of a neutral country in terms of territoriality – airspace can be closed for certain  flying objects, for example, but the same targeted approach cannot be used for data traffic on  the internet. Another issue is that data are not only transmitted via terrestrial and cable  channels but also via satellites located in outer space, which puts them outside the scope of   application of the law of neutrality. Such factors must be taken into consideration when it  comes to applying the rights and duties of neutral countries in cyberspace.   In principle, belligerent states are not permitted to damage the data networks of neutral  countries when undertaking combat operations via their own computer networks. Neutral   countries may not support conflicting parties with either troops or their own weapons. In terms  of military cyber operations in connection with an international armed conflict, this means that  a neutral country must prevent parties to the conflict from using its military-controlled systems  or networks. In general, military networks are shielded and not publicly accessible.   6. State responsibility   The customary international rules on state responsibility are largely reflected in the draft  articles issued by International Law Commission.17 They are also applicable to cyber incidents.  They provide that any state action in violation of international law shall entail the international  responsibility of that state, upon which a claim for full reparation may be made. This only   applies if the action can be legally attributed to the state and is deemed to constitute an  internationally wrongful act, i.e. in violation of international law.   6.1. Attribution   Attribution of a cybersecurity incident refers to the identification of the perpetrator and  describes a holistic, interdisciplinary process. This includes analysing the technical and legal  aspects of the incident, factoring in the geopolitical context, and using the entire intelligence   spectrum for the purpose of gathering information. Using this approach, a state can attribute a  cyber incident to another state or a private actor, either publicly or not, and it can decide to  take further political measures.   The process described above includes legal attribution, which ascertains whether a cyber   incident can be legally attributed to a state and if that state can be held responsible under  international law in accordance with the rules on state responsibility; it also concerns how the  injured state may respond (known as countermeasures, see section 6.2). The conduct of any  state organ or person exercising an inherently governmental function is always legally      15 Art. 2 and Art. 3 Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Pow ers and Persons in Case of   War on Land (Hague V), 18 October 1907, SR 0.515.21; Art. 2 and Art. 5 Convention Concerning the Rights   and Duties of Neutral Pow ers in Naval War (Hague XIII), 18 October 1907, SR 0.515.22.  16 Art. 1 Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Pow ers and Persons in Case of War on   Land (Hague V), 18 October 1907, SR 0.515.21.  17 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      6/11         attributable to the state concerned.18 If a cyber incident is carried out by a non-state actor, it   can only be attributed to a state under certain conditions. In such cases, state responsibility  only arises if the non-state actor acts on the instructions of a state, or under the direction or  control of state organs.19 If this requirement is met, the conduct constitutes an act by the state  and is attributable to that state. The injured state is also permitted to take countermeasures   (see section 6.2). If the required interstate dimension is lacking however, international law does  not in principle permit countermeasures against another state.   The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured state and there is no  obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.   Allegations of the organisation or implementation of an unlawful act against another state  should however be substantiated.20   6.2. Countermeasures   A state may respond in different ways to unwelcome cyber activities carried out by another  state.   Retorsion allows states to respond to such activities regardless of whether international law   has been violated or not. It refers to unfriendly but lawful measures in response to unwelcome  acts by another state. Typical examples of retorsion include refraining from signing a trade  agreement that would benefit both parties, recalling an ambassador, or breaking off diplomatic  relations as a last resort.   In cases where an act violates international law and can be legally attributed to a state, the  injured state(s) may also take countermeasures in the form of reprisals, provided that the  applicable rules governing state responsibility are observed.21 Although reprisals are contrary  to international law, they are justified in response to a prior breach of international law.   However, such a countermeasure must not violate certain fundamental substantive obligations  such as the prohibition on the use of force, fundamental human rights, most norms of  international humanitarian law, peremptory norms (jus cogens) and the obligation to respect  diplomatic and consular inviolability.22 Military force, i.e. measures leading to loss of life and   limb, are therefore prohibited.   Countermeasures must impose a (legal) disadvantage aimed at prompting the state concerned  to cease its conduct that is in breach of international law and/or to make reparations. In  principle, the responsible state can only impose countermeasures if it has first called for the   violation(s) to cease and has announced what measures it is planning to take. Exceptions may  be made for cyber operations requiring an immediate response in order for the injured state to  enforce its rights and prevent further damage. Countermeasures must always be proportional,  whatever the circumstances.   A countermeasure in response to a cyber incident does not necessarily have to take place in  the cyber domain. In accordance with the rules governing state responsibility, other measures  that aim to enforce the responsible state's compliance with its international obligations are also      18 Art. 4 and Art. 5 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August   2001.  19 Art. 8 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001.  20 UN GGE 2015 Report, para. 28 f.  21 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001. Unless   prohibited by international law , countermeasures are subject to strict conditions.  22 Art. 50 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      7/11         permissible. Cyber countermeasures do not have to directly target the computer system   originally used to commit the incident in question; injured states are permitted to take other  measures as long as they are aimed at the responsible state ceasing its conduct that is in  breach of international law. This means that depending on the specific circumstances, it may  be permissible under international law to use cyber countermeasures to block the computer   system abroad originally used to commit the incident. Likewise, in some cases it may be  permissible to compromise computer systems abroad even if they were not the original source  of the incident.   In addition to countermeasures, the rules governing state responsibility also provide for special   circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of conduct that would otherwise not be in  conformity with the international obligations of the state concerned. For example, a state may  be exempted from complying with such an obligation if it is the only way for it to safeguard its  essential interests from grave and imminent peril. Therefore the narrowly defined exceptions   provided for by the rules governing state responsibility may also apply in the context of cyber  operations.23   6.3. Due diligence   The principle of due diligence has evolved over a long period of time. Switzerland views due  diligence as part of customary international law and applicable to cyberspace. The ICJ  describes the concept of due diligence as a standard of conduct mean ing \"every State's   obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other  States.\"24 The doctrine of due diligence reflects fundamental principles of international law  (including state sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and non-interference).   The principle of due diligence is also applicable to cyberspace. Consequently, a state that is   or should be aware of cyber incidents that violate the rights of another state is obliged to take  all reasonable measures that are appropriate to stop or minimise the risks of such incidents.  Due diligence is a variable standard and depends on the capacities and capabilities of a state  as well as the particular circumstances of each case. Territorial states are obliged to use all   reasonable means to prevent serious harm being caused to another state by activities taking  place within their territory or in an area under their effective control. This makes due diligence  an obligation of conduct, not of result. If the aforementioned conditions exist, the state in  question is obliged under international law to close any loopholes immediately and assist in   intercepting and tracing the incident.   Due diligence applies in particular to actions by private individuals that violate the rights of  other states (e.g. hackers) and cannot be (clearly) attributed to the state in accordance with  the rules of attribution (see section 6.1). If the aforementioned conditions exist and the state   in question fails to fulfil due diligence requirements, the injured state may take  countermeasures in accordance with the rules governing state responsibility in order to induce  the responsible state to meet its obligations. Possible countermeasures outlined above may  be taken both outside and inside the cyber domain. The responsible state may also be   required to make reparations.25      23 Chapter V, ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001.  24 Corfu Channel case, ICJ Reports 1949, para. 44. Due diligence is both a general principle of international   law , w idely recognised as part of customary international law , and a prominent legal element in various   international agreements w here it has been enshrined, defined and further developed (e.g. environmental  law , human rights law , IHL, global health law ).   25 Art. 31, ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, August 2001.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      8/11         7. Human rights   Human rights are a cornerstone of international law. They are enshrined in a number of   treaties including the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European  Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Fundamental human rights are also part of customary  international law and can in part be categorised as jus cogens. Today, state obligations in  respect of human rights have several dimensions. States must refrain from interfering with   human rights (obligation to respect), protect individuals and groups against any such  interference by third parties (obligation to protect) and take positive action to facilitate the  enjoyment of basic human rights (obligation to fulfil).   Human rights also apply in the digital space and are a key pillar in the internat ional regulatory   framework for digitalisation. Individuals therefore have the same rights in the digital space as  they do in physical space. This also applies to state security activities in cyberspace i.e. part  of the digital space. Human rights obligations are equally binding upon states operating in  cyberspace as in physical space. This also applies when the cyber operation in question is   being carried out extraterritorially, to the extent that the States exercise their sovereign  authority in doing so. If a cyber-related activity results in a violation of human rights, the victim  will in principle have recourse to the enforcement mechanisms of the applicable domestic and  international treaties in the same way as if the violation had been committed in physical space.   Human rights monitoring bodies and tribunals can expand the scope and applicability of  human rights in their practice.   A number of specific human rights may be particularly affected by cyber-related activities. An  individual's right of access to information, right to privacy, or freedom of expression for   example, could be restricted because of cyber operations or other cyber-related measures.   A state must be able to justify restricting these or other human rights in cyberspace based on  the same rules that apply in physical space. In principle, any act of state interference requires  an adequate legal basis. The state must also be able to demonstrate that in the balance of   interests its actions are appropriate, necessary and reasonable in order to meet a legitimate  objective.   Switzerland considers the applicability of human rights to cyberspace to be an unequivocal  principle. However, new questions may arise when considering how this applies in individual   cases. For example, if cyber-related activities are used to block access to social media, the  question of freedom of expression may need to be clarified – at what point can this legally  protected right be interfered with? Can the individual continue to exercise this right through  alternative communication channels? To what extent are private actors also bound by human   rights obligations? Human rights bodies need to develop their work in this field in order to  ensure the application of human rights in cyberspace.   II. International humanitarian law   Switzerland considers international law to be applicable to cyberspace, which includes the  application of IHL in the context of armed conflicts. Switzerland's foreign policy priorities   include ensuring respect as well as strengthening and promoting IHL. Switzer land is well  known for its neutrality, humanitarian tradition and role as depositary of the Geneva  Convention. This position paper therefore addresses IHL issues in greater depth.     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      9/11         1. Applicability of IHL   IHL is applicable once an international or non-international armed conflict de facto exists. It is   applicable in any armed conflict and to all parties to a conflict. IHL addresses the realities of  war without considering the reasons for or the legality of the use of force. It does not deal with  the legality of war, nor does it legitimise the use of force between states. 26 The purpose of IHL  is to regulate the conduct of hostilities and to protect victims of armed conflict, in particular by   restricting the use of certain means and methods of warfare. The ICJ clearly stated that the  established principles and rules of IHL apply to “all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons,  those of the past, those of the present and those of the future”.27   This is applicable to cyberspace in the same way as for traditional and new operational spaces   (outer space, airspace, land, maritime space, electromagnetic space, information space). IHL  is therefore the main body of international law governing cyber operations that have a  connection with an armed conflict. Implementing IHL effectively contributes to ensuring  international security. Existing IHL, particularly its fundamental principles, places important   limits on the execution of cyber operations in armed conflicts.   2. Fundamental IHL provisions regulating the   conduct of hostilities   2.1. Principle concerning the means and methods of warfare   IHL prohibits or restricts means (weapons) and methods of warfare through general principles   – regulating conduct or prohibiting certain effects – and specific rules addressing particular  means and methods of warfare. As regards weapons, IHL distinguishes between the legality  of a particular type of weapon (weapons law) and the legality of how it is used (law of targeting).  The inherent characteristics of certain weapon categories entail that their use – in some or all   circumstances – is unlawful per se. The admissibility of all other weapons depends on whether  their use is in conformity with IHL.   This is also applicable to cyberspace. In fact, developing or using new means and methods of  warfare must be in compliance with existing international law, particularly IHL. This is true even   if a weapon is not covered by a specific norm and the treaty provisions governing the conduct  of hostilities do not explicitly refer to new technologies. The customary rules of IHL apply  equally to all means and methods of warfare, including in cyberspace. Indeed, it is a long  standing principle that the right of parties to an armed conflict to choose methods or means of   warfare is not unlimited.   2.2. Legality of a particular type of weapon   IHL stipulates that any means or method of warfare possessing one or more of the following  characteristics is inherently unlawful if:   (1) it is of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering;      26 Any use of force betw een states is governed by the UN Charter and relevant customary international law   (see above, section 1.4).  27 Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 86; \"all   forms of w arfare and to all kinds of w eapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future.\"     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      10/11         (2) it is indiscriminate by nature, because it cannot be directed against a specific military   objective or its effects cannot be limited as required by IHL;  (3) it is intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term or severe damage   to the natural environment; or  (4) it is specifically prohibited by treaty or customary international law.   This is applicable to cyberspace and, therefore, to cyber means and methods of warfare.   2.3. Legality of the manner in which the weapon is employed   With regard to the lawful use of cyber means and methods of warfare, the rules and principles  governing the conduct of hostilities must be respected. Belligerents must in particular comply   with the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution by:   (1) distinguishing between military objectives on the one hand, and civilians or civilian   objects on the other hand and, in case of doubt, presume civilian status;  (2) evaluating whether the incidental harm expected to be inflicted on the civilian   population or civilian objects would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct  military advantage anticipated from that particular attack;;   (3) taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects.   This is also applicable in cyberspace, when using cyber means and methods of warfare. The  aforementioned principles are applicable in particular to cyber operations that amount to an  attack within the meaning of IHL i.e. acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence   or defence. What exactly constitutes a 'cyber attack' in an armed conflict has yet to be clarified.  It encompasses at the very least cyber operations that are reasonably expected to cause,  directly or indirectly, injury or death to persons, or physical damage or destruction to objects.  The question, how exactly data is protected in the absence of such physical damage, remains   a challenge. In practice, a responsible actor should generally be able to assess the potential  impact of their actions and any resulting damage. As this estimation depends, amongst other  things, largely on the information available at the time when decisions about an operation are  taken, the obligation to take all precautionary measures practically possible to spare civilians   and civilian objects plays a particularly important role in the use of cyber means and methods  of warfare.   3. Other IHL provisions   Full compliance with IHL is not limited to the rules and principles governing the conduct of  hostilities. There are other specific rules of IHL that must be respected, including when   conducting military operations that do not qualify as an 'attack'. For example, certain categories  of persons and objects are subject to special protection, such as medical, religious or  humanitarian personnel and objects, which must be respected and protected in all  circumstances.   This is also applicable to cyberspace. For cyber operations that are linked to any of these  specially protected persons or objects, or to other activities governed by IHL, all of the relevant,  specific rules must be observed.   4. Ensuring respect for IHL   States and parties to a conflict have an overarching obligation to “respect and ensure respect”  for IHL “in all circumstances”. It is uncontested that preparatory measures must be taken to     Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace      11/11         implement IHL and that its implementation needs to be supervised. This requires states and   parties to a conflict, inter alia, to take measures to ensure that the development and use of  means and methods of warfare fully comply with IHL, and to prevent outcomes that would be  unlawful.   This is also applicable to cyberspace and the cyber means and methods of warfare. As with   any other weapon, means or method of warfare, States have the positive obligation to  determine, in their study, development, acquisition or adoption, whether their employment  would, in some or all circumstances, violate existing international law In this regard, the  obligation to assess the legality of a new weapon as set out in Art. 36 of Additional Protocol I   to the Geneva Conventions28 is an important element to prevent or restrict the development  and employment of new cyber weapons that would fail to meet in particular the obligations set  out above.         28 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims   of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1), SR 0.518.521.",

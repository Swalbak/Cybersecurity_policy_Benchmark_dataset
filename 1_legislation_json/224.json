Penal liability shall be incurred only by a person who commits an act prohibited   under penalty, by a law in force at the time of its commission.       § 2. A prohibited act whose social consequences is insignificant shall not constitute an offence.       § 3. The perpetrator of an prohibited act does not commit an offence if guilt cannot be attributed   to him at the time of the commission of the act.       Article 2. Penal liability for an offence with criminal consequences committed by omission shall   be incurred only by a person who had borne a legal, special duty to prevent such a consequence.       Article 3. Penalties and other measures provided for in this Code shall be applied with a view to   humanitarian principles, particularly with the respect for human dignity.      2       Article 4. § 1. If at the time of adjudication the law in force is other than that in force at the time of   the commission of the offence, the new law shall be applied. However, the former law should be applied if   it is more lenient to the perpetrator.    § 2. If, according to the new law, the act to which the sentence pertained is subject to a penalty   whose upper limit is lower than the penalty imposed, this penalty shall be lowered to the upper limit of the   statutory penalty provided for such an act in the new law.    § 3. If, according to the new law, the act to which the sentence pertained, is no longer subject to   penalty of imprisonment, such an enforceable penalty is commuted to a fine or to a restriction of liberty,   assuming that one month deprivation of liberty is equivalent to 60 times the daily fine or two months   restriction of liberty.    § 4. If according to the new law the act to which the sentence pertained is no longer prohibited   under penalty, the sentence shall be expunged by virtue of the law.       Article 5. The Polish penal law shall be applied to the perpetrator who committed a prohibited act   within the territory of the Republic of Poland, or on a Polish vessel or aircraft, unless an international   agreement to which the Republic of Poland is a party stipulates otherwise.       Article 6 § 1. A prohibited act shall be deemed to have been committed at the time when the   perpetrator has acted or omitted to take an action which he was under obligation to perform.       § 2. A prohibited act shall be deemed to have been committed at the place where the perpetrator   has acted or has omitted an action which he was under obligation to perform, or where the criminal   consequence has ensued or has been intended by the perpetrator to ensue.       Article 7. § 1. The offence is either a crime or a misdemeanour.      3       § 2. The crime is a prohibited act subject to penalty of imprisonment of not less than 3 years or   to a more severe penalty.       § 3. A misdemeanour is a prohibited act subject to penalty of a fine higher than 30 times the daily   fine, penalty of restriction of liberty or penalty of deprivation of liberty not exceeding one month.       Article 8. A crime may be committed only with intent; the misdemeanour may also be   committed without intent, if the law so stipulates.       Article 9. § 1. A prohibited act is committed with intent when the perpetrator has the will to   commit it, that is when he is willing to commit or foreseeing the possibility of perpetrating it, he accepts   it.       § 2. A prohibited act is committed without intent when the perpetrator not having the intent to   commit it, nevertheless does so because he is not careful in the manner required under the   circumstances, although he should or could have foreseen the possibility of committing the prohibited act.       § 3. The perpetrator shall be liable to a more severe liability which the law makes contingent on a   certain consequence of a prohibited act, if he has and could have foreseen such a consequence.       Article 10. § 1. Whoever commits a prohibited act after having attained the age of 17 years shall   be liable under the provisions of this Code.       § 2. A juvenile, who after attaining the age of 15 years shall commit the prohibited act specified in   the following: Article 134, Article 148. § 1, 2 or 3, Article 156 § 1 or 3, Article 163 § 1 or 3, Article 166,      4   Article 173 § 1 or 3, Article 197 § 3, Article 252 § 1 or 2 and in Article 280, may be liable under the   provisions specified in this Code, if the circumstances of the case and the mental state of development of   the perpetrator, his characteristics and personal situation warrant it, and especially when previously   applied educational or corrective measures have proved ineffective.       § 3. In the case specified in § 2, the penalty imposed may not exceed two-thirds of the statutory   maximum penalty for the offence imputed to the perpetrator; the court may also apply an extraordinary   mitigation of punishment.       § 4. With regard to the perpetrator who commits a prohibited act after having attained 17 years of   age but before having reached the age of 18 years, the court shall, instead of a penalty, adopt   educational, therapeutic, or corrective measures prescribed for juveniles, if the circumstances of the case   and the mental state of development of the perpetrator, his characteristics and personal situation warrant   it.       Article 11. § 1. The same act may constitute only one offence.       § 2. If an act has features specified in two or more provisions of penal law, the court shall   sentence the perpetrator for one offence on the basis of all concurrent provisions.       § 3. In the case specified in § 2 the court shall impose the penalty on the basis of the provision   providing for the most severe penalty, which shall not prevent the court from imposing other measures   provided for in law on the basis of all concurrent provisions.       Article 12. Two or more prohibited acts of conduct undertaken at short intervals with   premeditated intent shall be regarded as one prohibited act; if the subject of the assault is a personal      5   interest, the condition for regarding many acts as a single prohibited act, is the specific identity of the   injured.      Chapter II      Forms of Commission of an Offence       Article 13 § 1. Whoever with the intent to commit a prohibited act, directly attempts its   commission through his conduct which, subsequently however does not take place, shall be held liable   for an attempt.       § 2. An attempt also occurs when the perpetrator is not himself aware of the fact that committing   it is impossible because of the lack of a suitable object on which to perpetrate the prohibited act or   because of the use of means not suitable for perpetrating this prohibited act.       Article 14 § 1. The court shall impose a penalty for an attempt within the limits of the penalty   provided for the given offence.       § 2. In the case specified in Article 13 § 2 the court may apply extraordinary mitigation of   punishment or even renounce its imposition.       Article 15 § 1. Whoever has voluntarily abandoned the prohibited act or prevented the   consequence shall not be subject to penalty for the attempt.       § 2. The court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of punishment to a perpetrator who has   voluntarily attempted to prevent the consequence which constituted a feature of the prohibited act.      6       Article 16. § 1.

Preparation is subject to a penalty only when the law so provides.       Article 17. § 1. Whoever voluntarily abandoned preparation, and particularly, when he destroyed   the prepared means or prevented them from being utilised in the future shall not be subject to penalty. In   the case of entering an arrangement with another person in order to commit a prohibited act, whoever   undertook an essential endeavour aimed at preventing the commission of the prohibited act, shall not be   subject to penalty.       § 2. The person to whom Article 15 § 1 applies shall not be liable to penalty for preparation.       Article 18. § 1. Not only the person who has committed a prohibited act himself or together and   under arrangement with another person, but also a person who has directed the commission of a   prohibited act by another person, or taken advantage of the subordination of another person to him, orders   such a person to commit such a prohibited act, shall be liable for perpetration.       § 2. Whoever, willing that another person should commit a prohibited act, induces the person to   do so, shall be liable for instigating.       § 3. Whoever, with an intent that another person should commit a prohibited act, facilitates by his   behaviour the commission of the act, particularly by providing the instrument, means of transport, or giving      7   counsel or information, shall be liable for aiding and abetting. Furthermore, whoever, acting against a   particular legal duty of preventing the prohibited act, facilitates its commission by another person through   his omission, shall also be liable for aiding and abetting.       Article 19. § 1. The court shall impose the penalty for instigating, and aiding and abetting within   the limits of the sanction provided in law for perpetrating.       § 2. In imposing the penalty for aiding and abetting, the court may apply extraordinary mitigation   of punishment.       Article 20. Each persons co-operating in the perpetration of a prohibited act shall be liable within   the limits of his intent or a lack of it, irrespective of the liability of others co-operating in the perpetration.       Article 21. § 1. Circumstances pertaining to an individual, excluding or mitigating, or aggravating   his criminal liability shall be taken into account only with regard to the person they pertain to.       § 2. If an individual circumstance regarding the perpetrator, even if it is conducive only to   aggravation of penalty, constitutes a feature of a prohibited act, the person co-operating shall be held   liable under criminal law, for this prohibited act, when he knew about this circumstance, even though it did   not pertain to himself.       § 3. With regard to a person co-operating to whom the circumstance referred to under § 2 does   not apply, the court may apply extraordinary mitigation of punishment.       Article 22. § 1.

When the commission of a prohibited act was not attempted, the court may apply   extraordinary mitigation of punishment or even renounce the imposition of the penalty.       Article 23. § 1. A person co-operating in the perpetration of an prohibited act, who voluntarily   prevented its perpetration shall not be liable for penalty.       § 2. The court may apply extraordinary mitigation of punishment with regard to a person co-  operating in perpetration, who voluntarily tried to prevent the perpetration thereof.       Article 24.

Chapter III. Exclusion of penal liability       Article 25. § 1. Whoever in necessary defence repels a direct illegal attack on any interest   protected by law, shall not be deemed to have committed an offence.    § 2. In the event that the limits of necessary defence have been exceeded, in particular when the   perpetrator has used a means of defence disproportionate to the danger of the attack, the court may   apply extraordinary mitigation of the penalty and even renounce its imposition.    § 3. The court shall renounce the imposition of the punishment if exceeding the limits of   necessary defence resulted from fright or emotional distress, as justified by the circumstances of the   attack.         9    Article 26. § 1. Whoever acts with the purpose of averting an immediate danger threatening any   interest protected by law, if the danger cannot otherwise be avoided but the interest sacrificed has a lower   value than that of the interest rescued, he shall be deemed to have not committed an offence.    § 2. Whoever rescues any interest protected by law under the circumstances defined in § 1, or   sacrifices an interest which does not represent a value manifestly greater than the interest being rescued,   he shall also be deemed to have not committed an offence.    § 3. In the event that the limits of necessary defence have been exceeded, the court may apply   an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty or even renounce its imposition.    § 4. The provisions of § 2 shall not be applied when the perpetrator sacrifices an interest which   he has a special duty to protect even by exposing himself to personal danger.    § 5. The provisions of § 1 through 3 shall be applied accordingly when only one of the obligations   borne by the perpetrator can be fulfilled.       Article 27. § 1. Whoever acts with the purpose of conducting a cognitive, medical, technical or   economic experiment, shall not commit an offence when the expected benefit is of an essential cognitive,   medical or economic importance, and the expectation of these benefits, their purposefulness and the way   of conducting the experiment are justified according to the present state of knowledge.    § 2. An experiment is inadmissible without the consent of a participant subject thereto, duly   informed of the expected benefits and the danger of adverse effects and of the probability of their   occurrence, as well as of the possibility of withdrawing one's participation in the experiments at any stage   thereof.    § 3. The principles and conditions for admitting experiments shall be provided for in law.       Article 28. § 1. Whoever commits an act while being in error as to a circumstance constituting a   feature of an prohibited act, shall not intentionally commit an offence.    § 2. Whoever commits an offence in the justified but mistaken conviction that a circumstance has      10   occurred, which constitutes a feature of a prohibited act carrying a less severe penalty, shall be subject to   criminal liability under the provision regarding the circumstance warranting this lesser liability.       Article 29. Whoever commits a prohibited act in the justified but mistaken conviction that a   circumstance has occurred which excludes unlawfulness or guilt, shall not commit an offence; if the   mistake of the perpetrator is not justifiable, the court may apply extraordinary mitigation of the penalty.       Article 30. Whoever commits a prohibited act while being justifiably unaware of its unlawfulness,   shall not commit an offence; if the mistake of the perpetrator is not justifiable, the court may apply an   extraordinary mitigation of the penalty.       Article 31. § 1. Whoever, at the time of the commission of a prohibited act, was incapable of   recognising its significance or controlling his conduct because of a mental disease, mental deficiency or   other mental disturbance, shall not commit an offence.    § 2. If at the time of the commission of an offence the ability to recognise the significance of the   act or to control one's conduct was diminished to a significant extent, the court may apply an   extraordinary mitigation of the penalty.    § 3. The provisions of § 1 and 2 shall not be applied when the perpetrator has brought himself to a   state of insobriety or intoxication, causing the exclusion or reduction of accountability which he has or   could have foreseen.

Chapter VI. Principles of the imposition of penalty and penal means       Article 53. § 1. The court shall impose the penalty according to its own discretion, within the   limits prescribed by law bearing in mind that its harshness should not exceed the degree of guilt,   considering the level of social consequences of the act committed, and taking into account the preventive   and educational objectives which the penalty has to attain with regard to the sentenced person, as well as   the need to develop a legal conscience among the public.    § 2. In imposing the penalty, the court shall above all take into account the motivation and the   manner of conduct of the perpetrator, committing the offence together with a minor, the type and degree of   transgression against obligations imposed on the perpetrator, the type and dimension of any adverse   consequences of the offence, the characteristics and personal conditions of perpetrator, his way of life   prior to the commission of the offence and his conduct thereafter, and particularly his efforts to redress   the damage or to compensate the public perception of justice in another form. The court shall also   consider the behaviour of the injured person.      18    § 3. In imposing the penalty, the court shall also take into consideration the positive results of the   mediation between the injured person and the perpetrator, or the settlement reached by them in the   proceedings before the state prosecutor or the court.       Article 54. § 1. In imposing a penalty on a minor or a juvenile, the court shall first and foremost   aim to educate the perpetrator.    § 2. The penalty of the deprivation of liberty for life shall not be imposed on the perpetrator who   was under 18 at the time of the commission of the offence.       Article 55. Circumstances affecting the imposition of the penalty shall be taken into consideration   only with regard to the person to whom they pertain.       Article 56. The provisions of Article 53, Article 54 § 1 and Article 55 shall be applied accordingly,   to the imposition of other means provided for in this code.       Article 57. § 1. In the event of the concurrence of several independent grounds for the   extraordinary mitigation or enhancement of a penalty, the court may mitigate or enhance the penalty only   once, considering jointly the concurrent grounds for mitigation or enhancement.    § 2. In the event of the concurrence of the grounds for extraordinary mitigation and enhancement,   the court may adopt an extraordinary mitigation or enhancement of the penalty.       Article 58. § 1. If the law provides for an option of the type of penalty, the court shall impose the   penalty of deprivation of liberty without suspending execution thereof, only when no other penalty or penal   measure would not serve the purpose thereof.    § 2. No fine shall be imposed when the income of the perpetrator, his situation or potential to   earn provide reasonable grounds for the supposition that the perpetrator would not honour the fine and that      19   enforcing the same by execution would not be possible.    § 3. If the offence is subject to a penalty of a deprivation of liberty not exceeding 5 years, the   court, instead of imposing this penalty may impose a fine or a penalty of restriction of liberty, particularly   when it imposes a penal measure at the same time.    § 4. The provision of § 3 does not apply to the perpetrator of an intentional misdemeanour who   has previously been sentenced to a deprivation of liberty for a period of not less than 6 months without   conditional suspension of its execution.       Article 59. If the offence is subject only to a penalty of a deprivation of liberty not exceeding 3   years or, alternatively, to the penalties specified in Article 32, sections 1 through 3, and the social   consequences of the act are not great, the court may renounce the imposition of the penalty if it decides   to impose a penal measure at the same time, and the purpose of such a penalty is thus served by the   measure.       Article 60. §1. The court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty in the cases   specified by law, as well as with respect to a juvenile if this is justified by objectives described in Article   54 § 1.       § 2. The court may also apply an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty in particularly justified   cases when even the lowest penalty stipulated for the offence in question would be incommensurate, and   particularly:    1) if the injured person and the perpetrator have been reconciled, the damage incurred has   been repaired, or the injured person and the perpetrator have agreed as to the manner of   reparation for the damage,    2) taking into consideration the attitude of the perpetrator, particularly if he attempted to   repair the damage or prevent the damage from occurring,      20    3) if a perpetrator of an unintentional offence or someone close to him has suffered a major   detriment in connection with the offence committed.       § 3. The court shall be applied an extraordinary mitigation of the penalty or may even   conditionally suspend the execution of the penalty, with respect to a perpetrator who, co-operating with   others in the commission of an offence, reveals information pertaining to the persons involved therein or   essential circumstances thereof, to the agency responsible for its prosecution.       § 4. Upon a motion from the state prosecutor, the court may apply an extraordinary mitigation of   the penalty or even conditionally suspend the execution of the penalty with respect to a perpetrator, who,   irrespective of any explanation provided in his case, revealed and presented to the agency responsible for   prosecution, essential circumstances, not previously known to that agency, of an offence subject to a   penalty exceeding 5 years deprivation of liberty.    § 5. In the cases referred to in § 3 and 4, the court, in imposing the penalty of deprivation of   liberty for up to 5 years, may conditionally suspend the execution of the penalty for a probation period of   up to 10 years, if it recognises that, in spite of not serving the penalty, the perpetrator would not commit   the offence again; the provisions of Articles 71 through 76 shall be applied accordingly.       § 6. The extraordinary mitigation of a penalty shall consist in the imposition of a penalty below   the lower statutory level, or the imposition of a penalty of lesser severity, in accordance with the following   principles:    1) if the act in question constitutes a crime, the court shall impose a penalty of not less   than one-third of the lower statutory level;    2) if the act in question constitutes a misdemeanour, and the lower statutory level of the   penalty is not less than one year's deprivation of liberty, the court shall impose either a   fine, the penalty of restriction of liberty or deprivation of liberty;      21    3) if the act in question constitutes a misdemeanour, and the lower statutory level of penalty   is less than one year's deprivation of liberty, the court shall impose either a fine or the   penalty of restriction of liberty.    § 7. If the act in question is subject, alternatively, to the penalties specified in Article 32 sections   1 through 3, the extraordinary mitigation of a penalty shall consist in renouncing the imposition of the   penalty, and the imposition of a penal measure as specified in Article 39 sections 2 through 8; the   provision of Article 61 § 2 shall not be applied.       Article 61. § 1. The court may renounce the imposition of a penalty in the cases specified by law   or in the case provided for in Article 60 § 3, particularly if the role of the perpetrator in the commission of   the act was of secondary importance, and the information transmitted has helped to prevent the   commission of another offence.       § 2. Renouncing from the imposition of penalty, the court may refrain from adjudging a penal   measure, even if adjudging it were mandatory.       Article 62. Upon deciding to impose a penalty of deprivation of liberty, the court may determine   the kind and type of penal institution where the sentenced person is to serve the term and to stipulate the   therapeutic methods for serving the term of deprivation of liberty.       Article 63. §1. The period of an actual deprivation of liberty in a given case, rounded to a full   number of days, shall be credited to the penalty of deprivation of liberty, with one day of actual deprivation   of liberty equalling one day of the penalty of deprivation of liberty, or two days of the penalty of restriction   of liberty, or two daily rates of a fine.    § 2. The actual period of preventive measures of the corresponding kinds, as specified in Article   276 of the Code of criminal procedure, shall be credited against the imposed measures specified in Article      22   39 sections 2 and 3 of this Code.          CHAPTER VIII       Relapse into crime          Article 64. §1. If a perpetrator sentenced to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for an offence   committed with intent, during the 5 year period after having served at least 6 months of the penalty,   commits an intentional offence similar to the offence for which he had been sentenced, the court may   impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty, prescribed for the offence committed, within the statutory   limits, up to the highest statutory penalty further increased by a half.    §2. If a perpetrator previously sentenced in under the conditions specified in §1, who has served   the total of at least one year's deprivation of liberty and in the period of 5 years after the serving of the last   penalty in full or in part, again commits an intentional offence against life or health, or rape, robbery,   housebreaking or burglary, or other offence against property, committed with the use of violence or the   threat of violence, the court shall impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty, prescribed for the offence   committed, exceeding the lower statutory limit, or may impose a penalty up to the highest statutory   penalty further increased by a half.       § 3. The raising of the highest statutory penalty under § 1 or 2 shall not be applied to crimes.       Article 65. The provisions regarding the level of the penalty, penal measures and the measures   connected with the placing the perpetrator under probation envisaged with respect to the perpetrator   referred to in Article 64 § 2, shall be also applied to the perpetrator who made commission of offences his      23   permanent source of income, or who commits offences acting in an organised group or in a an   association whose purpose is to commit offences.          Chapter VIII. Measures connected with the placing the    perpetrator under probation          Article 66. § 1. The court may conditionally discontinue the criminal proceedings if the guilt and   social consequences of the act are not significant, the circumstances of its commission do not raise   doubts, and the attitude of the perpetrator not previously penalised for an intentional offence, his personal   characteristics and his way of life to date provide reasonable grounds for the assumption that even in the   event of the discontinuance of the proceedings, he will observe the legal order and particularly that he will   not commit an offence.       § 2. Conditional discontinuance shall not be applied to the perpetrator of an offence for which the   statutory penalty exceeds 3 years deprivation of liberty.       § 3. In the event that the injured party has been reconciled with the perpetrator, the perpetrator   has redressed the damage or the injured party and the perpetrator have agreed on the method of   redressing the damage, the conditional discontinuance may be applied to a perpetrator of an offence for   which the statutory penalty does not exceed 5 years deprivation of liberty.       Article 67. § 1. The conditional discontinuance shall be made for the term of probation which is   between one and two years, which shall run from the date the judgement becomes valid and final.    § 2. In discontinuing conditionally the criminal proceedings, the court may, in the probation      24   period, place the perpetrator under the supervision of a probation officer or a person of public trust,   association, or community organisation whose activities include educational care, preventing the   demoralisation of or providing assistance to sentenced persons.    § 3. In discontinuing conditionally the criminal proceedings, the court shall require the perpetrator   to redress in whole or in part the damage, and may impose on him the obligation specified in Article 72 §   1 sections 1-3 or 5, and also adjudicate a pecuniary consideration as specified in Article 39 section 7,   and an interdiction on driving a vehicle as specified in Article 39 section 3, for a period of up to 2 years.    § 4. The provision of Article 74 shall be applied accordingly.       Article 68. § 1. The court shall resume the criminal proceedings, if the perpetrator has during the   probation period committed an intentional offence, for which he has been validly and finally sentenced.       § 2. The court may resume the criminal proceedings if the perpetrator during the probation period   flagrantly breaches the legal order, and in particular if he committed an offence other than that specified in   § 1, evades supervision, does not perform the obligations or penal measure imposed or if he does not fulfil   the settlement concluded with the injured person.       § 3. The court may resume the criminal proceedings if, after the decision on the conditional   discontinuance was rendered but before it became valid and final, the perpetrator flagrantly breached the   legal order, and in particular if he committed an offence within that time.       § 4. The criminal proceedings conditionally discontinued may not be resumed any later than 6   months after the expiration of the probation period.       Article 69. § 1. The court may conditionally suspend the execution of a penalty of deprivation of   liberty of up to 2 years or execution of a fine adjudicated as a one-off penalty, if it is regarded as sufficient      25   to attain the objectives of the penalty with respect to the perpetrator, and particularly to prevent him from   relapsing into crime.       § 2. In suspending the execution of a penalty, the court shall primarily take into consideration   the attitude of the perpetrator, his personal characteristics and conditions, his way of life to-date and his   conduct after the commission of the offence.       § 3. Suspension of the execution of the penalty shall not be applied to the perpetrator as   specified in Article 64 § 2, unless there is an exceptional case justified by extraordinary circumstances;   suspension of the execution of the penalty specified in Article 60 § 3 through 5 shall not be applied to the   perpetrator as specified in Article 64 § 2.       Article 70. § 1. Suspension of the execution of a penalty shall be granted for a probation period,   which runs from the time the sentence becomes valid and final and is for:    1) from 2 to 5 years - in the case of a conditional suspension of the execution of a penalty   of deprivation of liberty,    2) from one year to 3 years - in the case of a conditional suspension of the execution of a   fine or a penalty of restriction of liberty.       § 2. In the case of the conditional suspension of the execution of a penalty with respect to a   perpetrator who is a young offender or the one specified in Article 64 § 2, the probation period is from 3 to   5 years.       Article 71. § 1. In suspending the execution of a penalty, the court may impose a fine of up to   180 times the daily rate, if its imposition is not provided for on another basis. In suspending the execution   of a penalty of restriction of liberty, the court may impose a fine of up to 90 times the daily rate.      26       § 2. In the event of ordering the execution of the penalty of the deprivation or restriction of liberty,   the fine adjudicated under § 1 shall not be subject to execution; the penalty of deprivation or restriction of   liberty shall be reduced by the number of days equal to the number of daily fines paid, rounded up to the   nearest full day.       Article 72. § 1. In suspending the execution of a penalty, the court may obligate the sentenced   person :    1) to inform the court of the probation officer about the progress of the probation period,    2) to apologise to the injured person,    3) to carry out a duty incumbent upon him in order to provide support for another person,    4) to perform remunerated work, to pursue an educational activity or train himself for an   occupation,    5) to refrain from abusing alcohol or using narcotics,    6) to submit to medical treatment, particularly drug withdrawal or rehabilitation programmes,    7) to refrain from frequenting specified community circles or places,    8) to engage in other appropriate conduct in the probation period, if it may prevent the   commission of a further offence.    § 2. The court may obligate the perpetrator to redress the damage in whole or in part, unless it   has adjudicated a penal measure as specified in Article 39 section 5, or a payment of consideration as   specified in Article 39 section 7.       Article 73. § 1. In suspending the execution of a penalty, the court may, in the probation period,   place the perpetrator under the supervision of a probation officer or a person of public trust, association, or   community organisation whose activities include educational care, preventing the demoralisation of or   providing assistance to sentenced persons.      27    § 2. The placing under supervision is mandatory with respect to a young perpetrator of an   intentional offence, and with respect to the perpetrator specified in Article 64 § 2.       Article 74. § 1. The time and manner of execution of the imposed obligations, specified in Article   72 shall be determined by the court after hearing from the sentenced person; the imposition of the   obligation specified in Article 72 § 1 section 6 shall require the additional consent from the sentenced   person.    §2. If educational or general care considerations warrant this, the court may, during the probation   period, institute, extend or modify the obligations imposed on a person sentenced to a deprivation of   liberty with a conditional suspension of its execution, as mentioned in Article 72 § 1 sections 3 through 8,   or release him from these obligations (except the obligation specified in Article 72 § 2), and likewise either   place the sentenced person under supervision or release him from the aforesaid.       Article 75. § 1. The court shall order the execution of the penalty, if the sentenced person during   the probation period, committed an intentional offence similar to the previous one, for which he has been   validly and finally sentenced for a penalty of deprivation of liberty.    §2. The court may order the execution of the penalty, if the sentenced person in the probation   period flagrantly breached the legal order, and, in particular, if he committed an offence other than that   specified in §1, has not paid the fine, has evaded supervision, or failed to fulfil the obligations or penal   measures imposed.    § 3. The court may order the execution of the penalty if, after the sentencing decision was   rendered but before it became valid and final, the perpetrator flagrantly breached the legal order, and in   particular if he committed an offence within that time.    § 4. The order to execute the penalty may not be issued any later than 6 months after the end of   the probation period.         28    Article 76. § 1. The sentence shall be expunged by virtue of law 6 months from the termination of   the probation period.    § 2. If a fine or a penal measure were imposed upon the sentenced person, the expunction of the   sentence may not occur before the execution, remission or prescription thereof; this shall not be applied   to the penal measure specified in Article 39 section 5.       Article 77. § 1. The court may conditionally release a person sentenced to the penalty of   deprivation of liberty from serving the balance of the penalty, only when his attitude, personal   characteristics and situation, his way of life prior to the commission of the offence, the circumstances   thereof, as well as his conduct after the commission of the offence, and while serving the penalty, justify   the assumption that the perpetrator will after release respect the legal order, and in particular that he will   not re-offend.    § 2. In particularly justified cases the court, in imposing the penalty of deprivation of liberty, may   determine more rigorous restrictions to prevent the possibility of him benefiting from the conditional   release other than those specified in Article 78.       Article 78. § 1. The sentenced person may be conditionally released after serving at least half of   the sentence, albeit with a minimum of 6 months.    § 2. The sentenced person specified in Article 64 § 1 may be conditionally released after serving   two-thirds of the sentence, and the sentenced person specified in Article 64 § 2, after serving three-  quarters of the sentence; the conditional release may not occur before the lapse of one year.    § 3. The person sentenced to 25 years of deprivation of liberty may be conditionally released after   serving 15 years of the sentence, and the person sentenced to deprivation of liberty for life, after serving   25 years of the sentence.       Article 79. § 1. The provisions of Article 78 § 1 and 2 shall be applied accordingly to a sum of two      29   or more penalties not amenable to an aggregate penalty, which the sentenced person has to serve as   subsequent terms; the provision of Article 78 § 2 shall be applied if even one of the offences has been   committed in the conditions specified in Article 64.    § 2. Notwithstanding the conditions specified in Article 78 § 1 or 2, the sentenced person may be   conditionally released after serving 15 years deprivation of liberty.       Article 80. § 1. In case of conditional release, the portion of the penalty which remains to be   served constitutes a probation period, which may not, however, be less than 2 or longer than 5 years.       § 2. If the sentenced person is the person specified in Article 64 § 2, the probation period may   not be shorter than 3 years.       § 3. In a case of the conditional release of a person sentenced to deprivation of liberty for life, the   probation period shall be 10 years.       Article 81. In case of revocation of the conditional release, the sentenced person may not again   be conditionally released before the lapse of one year from the date of committing him to the penal   institution, and in case of the penalty of deprivation of liberty for life, before the lapse of 5 years.       Article 82. If in the probation period and in the course of the following 6 months, the conditional   release has not been revoked, the sentence shall be considered to have been served at the time of the   conditional release.       Article 83. A person sentenced to a penalty of limitation of liberty who has completed at least half   of the adjudged penalty, respected the legal order, performed diligently the work ordered by the court,   and fulfilled the obligations imposed upon him, may be relieved by the court from the rest of the penalty,      30   considering it as executed.       Article 84. § 1. The court may, after half of the period for which the penal measures specified in   Article 39 sections 1 through 3 were imposed, consider them executed, if the sentenced person has   respected the legal order and he has been subjected to the penal measure for at least one year.       § 2. The provision of § 1 shall not be applied if the penal measure specified in Article 39 section 3   has been adjudicated under Article 42 § 2.       CHAPTER IX       Concurrence of offences and aggregation of penalties    and penal measures       Article 85. If the perpetrator committed two or more offences, before the first, even not yet valid   judgement was rendered with regard to any of these offences, and for which basic penalties of the same   kind were imposed, the court shall impose an aggregate penalty taking as a basis the separate penalties   imposed for the offences which are so aggregated.       Article 86. § 1. The court shall impose an aggregate penalty within the highest limit of the   penalties imposed for individual offences, but which do not exceed 540 times the daily fine, 18 months   restriction of liberty or 15 years of deprivation of liberty; the aggregated penalty of fine specified in Article   71 § 1 may not exceed 180 times the daily fine if it is connected with a suspension of the execution of a   penalty of deprivation of liberty, and may not exceed 90 times the daily fine if it is associated with a   suspension of the execution of a penalty of restriction of liberty.         31    § 2. In imposing an aggregate fine, the court shall determine de novo the value of the daily fine,   based on the recommendations specified in Article 33 § 3; the level of daily fines may not, however,   exceed the previously determined amount thereof.       § 3. In imposing an aggregate penalty of restriction of liberty, the court shall determine de novo   the amount of supervised unremunerated work for community purposes, or the amount of deductions,   when applying Article 35; the obligations specified in Article 36 § 2 shall be applied even if it was   adjudicated for only one of the concurrent offences.       Article 87. In the case of sentencing for the concurrent offences to the penalties of deprivation of   liberty and restriction of liberty, the court shall impose an aggregate penalty, assuming that one month's   restriction of liberty is equal to 15 days deprivation of liberty.       Article 88. If the most severe penalty imposed for one of the concurrent offences is the penalty of   25 years of deprivation of liberty or deprivation of liberty for life, this penalty is imposed as the aggregate   penalty; in the case of the aggregation of two or more penalties of 25 years of deprivation of liberty, the   court may impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty for life as the aggregate penalty.       Article 89. § 1. In the case of sentencing for concurrent offences to the penalties of deprivation of   liberty, restriction of liberty or fine with or without a conditional suspension of execution, the court may   conditionally suspend the execution of the aggregate penalty if the conditions specified in Article 69 are   met.       § 2. In imposing an aggregate penalty of deprivation of liberty or restriction of liberty with a   conditional suspension of their execution, the court may impose a fine as specified in Article 71 § 1, even   if it has not been imposed for the concurrent offences.      32       § 3. In the case of the concurrence of judgements on probation periods, the court imposes this   period and associated obligations de novo.       Article 90. §1. The penal measures and preventive measures including well as supervision are   applicable even if they were imposed with regard to only one of the concurrent offences.       §2. In the case of sentencing for the concurrent offences to the deprivation of civil rights or   imposing interdictions of a particular kind, the court shall be applied accordingly, the provisions   concerning aggregate penalties.       Article 91. § 1. If the perpetrator had committed, in a similar manner, two or more offences before   the first sentence was rendered even though not yet valid final, regarding to any of these offences, the   court shall impose one penalty on the basis of the provision whose attributes each of these offences   meet, up to the upper statutory limit increased by a half.       § 2. If the perpetrator, in the conditions specified in Article 85, commits two or more of a series of   offences specified in § 1, or a series of offences plus yet another offence, the court shall impose an   aggregate penalty, applying the relevant provisions of this Chapter.       § 3. If the perpetrator has been sentenced to two or more sentences for the offences belonging to   a series of offences as specified in § 1, the penalty imposed in an aggregate sentence may not exceed   the higher limit of the statutory penalty further increased by half as stipulated in the provisions, whose   attributes each of these offences meet.       Article 92. That the separate penalties imposed for the offences in a series or concurrent offences      33   have already been satisfied, in whole or part, is no impediment to the imposition of an aggregate penalty,   the provision of Article 72 § .2 shall be applied accordingly.          Chapter X. Preventive Measures       Article 93. The court may impose a preventive measure provided for in this Chapter, which   involves committing to a closed medical institution only when necessary to prevent repeated offending, by   the perpetrator, of a prohibited act connected with mental disease, mental impairment or addiction to   alcohol or other narcotic drugs. Before imposing such a measure the court shall hear from psychiatrists   and a psychologist.       Article 94. § 1. If the perpetrator has committed a prohibited act of significant harm to the   community, in a state of irresponsibility as specified in Article 31 §1, and that there is a high probability   that he will commit such an act again, the court shall commit him to a suitable psychiatric institution.    § 2. The duration of the stay in the institution shall not be fixed in advance; the court shall decide   on the release of the perpetrator from the institution if his stay there is no longer deemed necessary.    § 3. The court may again decide on committing a perpetrator as specified in § 1 to a suitable   psychiatric institution if it is advisable in the light of the circumstances specified in § 1 or Article 93; the   order may not be issued later than 5 years after the release from the institution.       Article 95. §1. In sentencing a perpetrator to a penalty of deprivation of liberty without a   conditional suspension of its execution, for an offence committed in a state of diminished accountability   as specified in Article 31 §2, the court may order his commitment to a penal institution where special   medical treatment or rehabilitation measures ca be applied.         34    § 2. If it is advisable in the light of the effects of medical treatment or rehabilitation, the court may   conditionally release the perpetrator as specified in § 1, sentenced to the penalty of a deprivation of liberty   not exceeding 3 years, under conditions specified in Articles 77 through 82, without restriction resulting   from Article 78 § 1 or 2; the supervision shall be then mandatory.       Article 96. § 1. In imposing a penalty of deprivation of liberty without a conditional suspension of   its execution, for an offence connected with an addiction to alcohol or a narcotic drug, the court may   decide to commit the perpetrator to a closed medical institution for withdrawal treatment, if there is a high   probability of him committing another offence connected with his addiction.       § 2. The measure specified in § 1 shall not be imposed if the perpetrator was sentenced to the   penalty of deprivation of liberty exceeding 2 years.       § 3. The duration of the stay in the closed withdrawal treatment institution shall not be fixed in   advance, it may, however, not be for less than 3 months or for more than 2 years. The court shall decide   on the release from the institution on the basis of the results of the treatment, having heard the opinion   from the person conducting the treatment.       § 4. The duration of stay of the perpetrator in the institution as specified in § 1 shall be credited to   the penalty.       Article 97. § 1. Depending on the progress in the treatment of the perpetrator specified in Article   96 § 1, the court may send him, for a probation period lasting from 6 months to 2 years, for outpatient   treatment or to a rehabilitation programme in a rehabilitation/treatment facility. At the same time the court   may place him under the supervision of a probation officer or a person of public trust, public institution or   community organisation whose responsibilities include educational care, preventing the demoralisation of      35   or providing to the sentenced persons.       § 2. The court may again order placing the perpetrator in the closed withdrawal treatment   institution or in a penal institution, if the perpetrator under probation, evaded treatment or rehabilitation,   committed an offence or flagrantly breached the legal order or breached the by-rules of the   treatment/rehabilitation facility.       § 3. If in the probation period and in the course of the following 6 months, no order on the   placement of the sentenced person again in a closed withdrawal treatment institution or a penal institution   has been issued, the penalty shall be considered to have been served at the lapse of the probation period.       Article 98. If it is advisable in the light of the effects of the treatment specified in Article 96 § 3,   the court shall conditionally release the sentenced person from the serving of the balance of the sentence,   under the conditions specified in Articles 77 through 82, without restriction resulting from Article 78 § 1 or   2; the supervision shall be then mandatory.       Article 99. §1. If the perpetrator has committed the prohibited act in a state of irresponsibility as   specified in Article 31 §1, the court may apply, as preventive measures, the interdictions specified in   Article 39, sections 2 or 3, if it is deemed necessary for the protection of public order, and the forfeiture   provided for in Article 39 section 4.       §2. The interdictions specified in § 1 shall be adjudged without specifying the period of time; the   court shall decide on the lifting on the interdiction, if the reasons for the imposition thereof are no longer   applicable.       Article 100. If the social consequences of the act are insignificant, and also, in case of the      36   conditional discontinuance of the proceedings, or upon ascertaining that a circumstance exists excluding   a penalty for the perpetrator of the prohibited act, the court may apply the forfeiture provided for in Article   39 section 4.          Chapter XI. Statutes of limitation          Article 101. §1. The amenability to a penalty for an offence ceases, if from the time of the   commission thereof the following number of years have elapsed:    1) 30 - when the act constitutes a crime of homicide;    2) 20 - when the act constitutes other crime    3) 10 - when the act constitutes a misdemeanour subject to the penalty of deprivation of   liberty exceeding 3 years;    4) 5 - when the act is subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty which not exceeding 3   years;    5) 3 - when the act is subject to the penalty of restriction of liberty or a fine.       § 2. The amenability to a penalty for an offence prosecuted by way of a private charge ceases   after the expiration of one year, from the date on which the injured person learnt of the identity of the   perpetrator of the offence and not later, however, than after the expiration of 3 years from the time of its   commission.       § 3. If in the cases provided for in § 1 or 2, the commission depends on the occurrence of a   consequence specified in the law, the time of limitation shall run from the date when this consequence   has ensued.      37       Article 102.

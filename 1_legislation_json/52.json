In the cases referred to in the previous paragraphs,  all appropriate and specific measures shall be taken to  safeguard the interests of the data subject. Taking into  account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and   the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as  well as the risks of varying severity for rights and freedoms  of natural persons posed by the processing, such measures  may include in particular:  (a) technical and organisational measures to ensure that  the processing complies with the GDPR;   (b) measures to ensure that ex post verification and  determination of whether and by whom personal data have  been entered, amended or removed is possible;  (c) measures to raise awareness among staff involved  in the processing;   (d) access rights restrictions to controllers and  processors;  (e) pseudonymisation of personal data; (f) encryption of personal data; (g) measures to ensure the ability, confidentiality,   integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems  and services relating to the processing of personal data,  including the ability to rapidly restore the availability and  access in the event of a physical or technical incident;  (h) procedures for regularly testing, assessing and  evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational  measures for ensuring the security of the processing;  (i) specific rules to ensure compliance with this Law  and the GDPR in case of transfer or processing for other  purposes;   (j) designation of a DPO.

Article 27 Processing of personal data in the context of  employment  1. Employees’ personal data may be processed for  the purposes of the contract of employment where the  processing is strictly necessary for deciding whether to  enter into a contract of employment, or for the performance  of a contract of employment once it has been concluded.  2. Where an employee’s consent is, by way of exception,  used as the legal basis for the processing of the employee’s  personal data, the following should be taken into account  in deciding whether consent was freely given, and in  particular:  (a) the employee’s dependence, as set out in the contract  of employment and  (b) the circumstances under which consent was given.  Consent can be given either in writing or in electronic form  and must be clearly distinguishable from the contract of  employment.

Paragraph 2 shall also apply  to consent given for the processing of special categories of  personal data. Consent should explicitly refer to such data.  Article 22(3)(b) shall apply accordingly.  4. The processing of personal data, including special  categories of the employees’ personal data, shall be  permitted for the purposes of the contract of employment on  the basis of collective labour agreements. The negotiating  parties shall comply with Article 88(2) of the GDPR.  5.

For the purposes of this Law, employees mean workers  recruited under any type of employment relationship, or a  work contract, or a service contract in the public and private     3387GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  sector, regardless of the validity of the contract, as well as  job applicants and former workers.  Article 28 Processing and freedom of expression and  information  1. To the extent necessary to reconcile the right to  the protection of personal data with the right to freedom  of expression and information, including processing for  journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic, artistic  or literary expression, the processing of personal data is  allowed where:   (a) the data subject has given his or her explicit consent,  (b) it relates to personal data which are manifestly made  public by the data subject, (c) the right to freedom of  expression and the right to information override the right  to the protection of the data subject’s personal data, in  particular on matters of general interest or where it relates  to personal data of public figures, and (d) where it is limited  to what is necessary to ensure freedom of expression  and the right to information, in particular with regard to  special categories of personal data, criminal proceedings,  convictions and related security measures, taking into  account the right of the data subject to his or her private  and family life.  2. To the extent necessary to reconcile the right to  the protection of personal data with the right to freedom  of expression and information, including processing for  journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic,  artistic or literary expression, the following shall not apply:  (a) Chapter II of the GDPR (principles), except for Article 5,  (b) Chapter III of the GDPR (rights of the data subject), c)  Chapter IV of the GDPR (controller and processor), except  for Articles 28, 29 and 32, (d) Chapter V of the GDPR  (transfer of personal data to third countries or international  organisations), (e) Chapter VII of the GDPR (cooperation  and consistency) and f) Chapter IX of the GDPR (specific  data processing situations)”.  Article 29 Processing of personal data for archiving purposes  in the public interest  1. By way of derogation from Article 9(1) of the GDPR,  the processing of special categories of personal data within  the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR shall be allowed  where it is necessary for archiving purposes in the public  interest. The controller shall have the obligation to take  suitable and specific measures to protect the data subject's  legitimate interests. Such measures may include, as far as  possible, in particular:  (a) access rights restrictions to controllers and  processors;  (b) pseudonymisation of personal data; (c) encryption of personal data; (d) designation of a DPO. 2. By way of derogation from Article 15 of the GDPR, the   data subject’s right of access to data relating to him or her  may be restricted where the exercise of that right is likely  to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of  the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, and the exercise   of the right would entail a disproportionate effort. 3. By way of derogation from Article 16 of the GDPR, the   data subject shall not have the right to have the personal  data relating to him or her rectified where the exercise of  that right is likely to render impossible or seriously impair  the achievement of the objectives referred to in paragraph  1 or the exercise of the rights of others.  4. By way of derogation from subparagraphs (a), (b) and  (d) of Article 18(1), and from Articles 20 and 21 of the GDPR,  the rights of the data subject shall be restricted where their  exercise is likely to render impossible or seriously impair  the achievement of the objectives referred to in paragraph  1 and where such limitations are deemed to be necessary  for the achievement of such objectives.  Article 30 Processing of personal data for scientific or  historical research purposes or for the collection  and maintenance of statistical information  1. By way of derogation from Article 9(1) of the GDPR,  the processing of special categories of personal data,  within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR, shall be  allowed without the consent of the data subject where the  processing is necessary for scientific or historical research  purposes, or for the collection and maintenance of statistical  information, and the interest of the controller is overriding  the interest of the data subject in not having his or her  personal data processed. The controller shall have the  obligation to take suitable and specific measures to protect  the data subject's legitimate interests. Such measures may  include, in particular:   (a) access rights restrictions to controllers and  processors;  (b) pseudonymisation of personal data; (c) encryption of personal data; (d) designation of a DPO. 2. By way of derogation form the provisions of Articles   15, 16, 18 and 21 of the GDPR, the rights of the data  subject shall be limited where their exercise is likely to  render impossible or seriously impair the achievement  of the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 and where  such limitations are deemed to be necessary for their  achievement. For the same reason, the data subject’s  right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR shall  not apply where personal data are necessary for scientific  purposes and the provision of information would entail a  disproportionate effort.  3. In addition to what is referred to in paragraph 1,  special categories of personal data, where processed for  the purposes of paragraph 1 shall, unless it is contrary to  the legitimate interest of the data subject, be anonymised  as soon as the scientific or statistical purposes allow. Until  then, the characteristics that can be used to match individual  details associated with personal or real situations of an  identified or identifiable person must be stored separately.  These characteristics can only be combined with individual  details if required for research or statistical purposes.  4. The controller may publish personal data processed  in the context of research, if the data subjects have given  their consent in writing or the publication is necessary for     3388 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  the presentation of the results of the research. In the latter  case, the results shall undergo pseudonymisation before  being published.  Article 31 Information to be provided where personal data  are collected from the data subject  1. The obligation to inform the data subject pursuant to  Article 13(3) of the GDPR shall not apply, with the exception  of the exemption referred to in Article 13(4) of the GDPR  where the information to be provided on further processing:  (a) concerns further processing of data stored in a written  form in which the controller directly addresses the data  subject, the purpose is compatible with the original purpose  of collection in accordance with the GDPR, communication  with the data subject is not in digital form and the interest  of the data subject in being informed according to the  circumstances of the case, in particular as regards the  context in which the data have been collected, is not  deemed to be high;   (b) in the case of a public body, would compromise the  proper performance of the controller’s tasks within the  meaning of points (a) to (e) of Article 23(1) of the GDPR,  and the interest of the controller in not providing information  overrides the data subject’s interest;  (c) would compromise national or public security, and  the interest of the controller in not providing information  overrides the data subject’s interest;  (d) would prevent the establishment, exercise or defence  of legal claims, and the interest of the controller in not  providing information overrides the interest of the data  subject;   (e) would compromise the confidentiality of the data  transfer to public bodies.  2. Where no information is given to the data subject  in accordance with paragraph 1, the controller shall  take appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s  legitimate interests, including the provision to the public  of the information referred to in Article 13(1) and (2) of the  GDPR in an accurate, transparent, intelligible and easily  accessible form, in clear and plain language. The controller  shall state in writing the reasons for forgoing the provision  of information. The above subparagraphs shall not apply to  indents (d) and (e) of the previous paragraph.  3. Where no notification is given in the cases referred to  in paragraph 1 due to a temporary obstacle, the controller,  taking into account the specific conditions of the processing,  should comply with the obligation to provide information  within a reasonable period of time after the obstacle has  been removed, but not later than a period of two (2) weeks.  4. If, at the start of a mandate or in the course of a  mandate, the customer disclosed data of third parties to  an entity bound by an obligation of professional secrecy,  the transmitting entity shall not be required to provide  information to the data subject in accordance with Article  13(3) of the GDPR, unless the interest of the data subject  in obtaining the information is overriding.  Article 32 Information to be provided where the personal   data have not been obtained from the data subject 1. The obligation to inform the data subject in accordance   with Article 14(1), (2) and (4) of the GDPR shall not apply  where the provision of information:  (a) in the case of public bodies:  (aa) would compromise the proper performance of the   controller’s tasks within the meaning of points (a) to (e) of  Article 23(1) of the GDPR, or  (bb) would compromise national or public security; and, therefore, the data subject’s interest in obtaining the   information recedes, (b) in the case of private bodies: (aa) would prejudice the establishment, exercise   or defence of legal claims, or the processing includes  personal data resulting from contracts established under  private law and is aimed at preventing damages caused by  criminal offences, unless the data subject has an overriding  legitimate interest in obtaining the information; or   (bb) the competent public authority has specified to the  controller that the publication of the data would compromise  national defence, national security and public security,  while in the case of data processing for law enforcement  purposes, specification pursuant to the first subparagraph  is not required.  2. Where no information is provided to the data subject  in accordance with paragraph 1, the controller shall  take appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s  legitimate interests, including the provision to the public  of the information referred to in Article 14(1) and (2) of the  GDPR in an accurate, transparent, intelligible and easily  accessible form, in clear and plain language. The controller  shall state in writing the reasons for which he or she has  refrained from providing information.  3. The obligation to provide information to the data  subject in accordance with Article 14(1) to (4) of the GDPR,  with the exception of exemptions referred to in Article 14(5)  of the GDPR, shall not apply insofar as, by fulfilling this  obligation, information would be disclosed which by its  nature, in particular due to overriding legitimate interests of  third parties, should remain confidential.  Article 33 Right of access by the data subject/Communication  of a personal data breach to the data subject  1. In addition to the exemptions laid down in Article 29(2)  and Article 30(2), the right of access by the data subject  in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR shall not apply,  where:  (a) the data subject is not informed in accordance with  point (bb) of indents (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of the  previous Article; or   (b) the data (aa) were recorded only because they cannot be erased   due to retention requirements provided for in legal or  regulatory provisions, or   (bb) only serve purposes of protection or control of data,  and the provision of information would require a   disproportionate effort, and the necessary technical  and organisational measures render impossible their  processing for other purposes.    3389GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  2. The grounds for refusing to provide information to the  data subject should be documented. Refusal to provide  information should be justified to the data subject unless  the disclosure of the factual or legal reasons on which the  refusal is based would compromise the purpose pursued  by the refusal to provide information. Data stored for the  purpose of providing information to the data subject and  for the preparation of such provision may be processed  solely for that purpose and for purposes of data protection;  the processing for other purposes shall be limited in  accordance with Article 18 of the GDPR.  3. The right of access by the data subject to personal  data that are neither subject to automated nor to non- automated processing by a public authority, and stored in  a filing system, shall only apply if the data subject provides  information allowing the retrieval of data and the effort  required to provide the information is not disproportionate  to the interest of the data subject in being informed.  4. The data subject's right to be informed under Article 15  of the GDPR shall not apply to the extent that the provision  of information would entail the disclosure of information  which, according to the law or by reason of its nature, in  particular due to overriding legitimate interests of third  parties, should remain confidential.  5. The obligation to notify under Article 34 of the GDPR,  with the exception of the exemption referred to in Article  34(3) of the GDPR, shall not apply to the extent that the  obligation to notify would entail the disclosure of information  which, according to the law or by reason of its nature, in  particular due to overriding legitimate interests of third  parties, should remain confidential. By way of derogation  from the previous subparagraph, the data subject must  be informed, in accordance with Article 34 of the GDPR,  where his or her interests, in particular taking into account  imminent damage, override the interest relating to  maintaining confidentiality.  Article 34 Right to erasure  1. If, in the case of non-automated processing, erasure  is not possible due to the particular nature of storage or is  only possible with disproportionate effort, and the interest  of the data subject in erasure is not considered significant,  the data subject’s right and the controller’s obligation  to erase personal data in accordance with Article 17(1)  of the GDPR, shall not apply, with the exception of the  exemptions referred to in Article 17(3) of the GDPR. In this  case, erasure shall be replaced by restriction of processing  in accordance with Article 18 of the GDPR. The above  subparagraphs shall not apply if the personal data have  been unlawfully processed.  2. In addition to points (b) and (c) of Article 18(1) of the  GDPR, the first and second subparagraphs of the previous  paragraph shall apply accordingly in the case of points (a)  and (d) of Article 17(1) of the GDPR, to the extent that the  controller has reason to believe that the erasure would be  prejudicial to the legitimate interests of the data subject.  The controller shall inform the data subject of the restriction  of processing where such information is not impossible or  does not involve a disproportionate effort.  3. In addition to point (b) of Article 17(3) of the GDPR,  paragraph 1 shall apply accordingly in the case of point (a)  of Article 17(1) of the GDPR, if erasure would be in conflict  with statutory or contractual retention periods.  Article 35 Right to object  The right to object under Article 21(1) of the GDPR shall  not be applicable where a public body is concerned, if there  is a compelling public interest in the processing which  overrides the interests of the data subject or if processing  is mandatory by law.  Article 36 Ensuring the processing of personal data for  national security purposes  The processing of personal data of the National  Intelligence Service (NIS) staff conducted by public and  private bodies in the context of their tasks or responsibilities  shall be performed by specifically authorised officers,  whose names shall be communicated to the NIS.  Any further transmission of the above personal data shall  only be conducted upon approval of the NIS.  Article 37 Accreditation of certification bodies and  certification  1. The accreditation of bodies which issue certifications  under Article 42 of the GDPR shall be carried out by the  National Accreditation System (ESYD) in accordance  with EN-ISO/IEC17065:2012 and additional requirements  established by the Authority.  2. The ESYD shall revoke an accreditation if notified by  the Authority that the requirements for accreditation are no  longer met or the certification body infringes the GDPR and  the provisions hereof.  Article 38  Criminal penalties  1. Anyone who, without legal grounds: (a) interferes  in any way with a data filing system and in so doing is  made aware of such data; (b) copies, removes, alters,  harms, collects, registers, organises, structures, stores,  adapts, modifies, recovers, seeks information, correlates,  combines, restricts, erases, destroys, shall be punished  with imprisonment of up to one (1) year, unless the act  is punishable with a more severe penalty under another  provision.  2. Anyone who uses, transmits, disseminates, discloses  by transmission, makes available, announces or makes  accessible to unauthorised persons personal data acquired  pursuant to indent (a) of paragraph 1, or allows unauthorised  persons to become aware of such data, shall be punished  with imprisonment, unless the act is punishable with a more  severe penalty under another provision.  3. If the act referred to in paragraph 2 relates to special  categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1) of the  GDPR or data relating to criminal convictions and offences  or relevant security measures referred to in Article 10 of the     3390 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  GDPR, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment  of at least one (1) year and a fine of up to one hundred  thousand euros (EUR 100,000), unless the act is punishable  with a more severe penalty under another provision.  4. The person who has committed the acts referred  to in the previous paragraphs shall be punished with  incarceration of up to ten (10) years, if he or she intended  to secure for himself or herself or others an unjust profit, or  cause financial loss to another person, or cause damage to  another person, and the total profit or total loss exceeds the  amount of one hundred and twenty thousand euros (EUR  120,000).  5. If the acts referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 have resulted  in a risk to the free functioning of democracy or national  security, they shall be punishable with imprisonment and a  fine of up to three hundred thousand euros (EUR 300,000).  6. The felonies provided for in this Article shall fall within  the jurisdiction of the three-member court of appeal for  felonies.  Article 39 Administrative sanctions  1. Without prejudice to the Authority’s corrective powers  in accordance with Article 58(2) of the GDPR, the Authority  may, in a specific reasoned decision and following a  previous notice summoning the interested parties to provide  explanations, impose to bodies of the public sector, as this  is defined in indent (a) of Article 14(1) of Law 4270/2014  (Government Gazette A’ 143), with the exception of public  undertakings and bodies referred to in Chapter A of Law  3429/2005 (Government Gazette A’ 314), in their capacity  as data controllers, for infringements relating to:  (a) indent (a) of Article 83(4) of the GDPR, with the  exception of Articles 8, 27, 29, 42, 43 of the GDPR, (b)  Article 83(5) and (6) of the GDPR, with the exception of  Articles 17, 20, 47, 90 and 91 of the GDPR, (c) Articles  5, 6, 7, 22, 24, 26, 27 (with the exception of paragraph 7  thereof), Articles 28 to 31, and indent (a) of Article 32(1),  Articles 33 to 35 of this Law, an administrative fine of up to  ten million euros (EUR 10,000,000).  2. When deciding whether to impose an administrative  fine and determining its amount, in each individual case  due regard shall be given to the following:  (a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement  taking into account the scope or purpose of the processing  concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected  and the level of damage suffered by them,  (b) any action taken by the body of the public sector to  mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects,  (c) any relevant previous infringements by the body of  the public sector,  (d) the categories of personal data affected by the  infringement,  (e) the manner in which the infringement became  known to the Authority, in particular whether, and if so  to what extent, the body of the public sector notified the  infringement and  (f) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) of the  GDPR have previously been ordered against the body of  the public sector, with regard to the same infringement, the   degree of compliance with those measures. 3. If a body of the public sector, for the same or linked   processing operations, infringes several provisions of the  GDPR or of this Law, the total amount of the administrative  fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest  infringement.  Article 40 Judicial remedy against a controller or processor  1. Actions brought by a data subject against a controller  or processor for breach of data protection provisions within  the scope of the GDPR or the rights of the data subject  referred to therein shall be brought before the civil courts  in whose district the controller or processor has his or  her establishment. The actions referred to in the previous  subparagraph may also be brought before the civil courts  in whose district the data subject has his or her habitual  residence.  2. The previous paragraph shall not apply to actions  brought against public authorities, where such authorities  exercise sovereign power conferred on them.  3. Where the controller or processor has designated  a representative in accordance with Article 27(1) of the  GDPR, the representative in question shall be considered  to be a procedural representative for the serving of all  documents carried out in the framework of civil proceedings  pursuant to paragraph 1.  Article 41 Representation of a data subject  1. Where the data subject considers that the processing  of personal data relating to him or her infringes the  provisions of the GDPR or Chapter III of this Law, he or  she shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body,  organisation, association or a not-for-profit group of  persons without legal personality which has been properly  constituted and is legally established in the Greek territory,  has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and  is active in the area of protection of data subjects' rights  and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal  data, to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with the  Authority in accordance with Article 77 of the GDPR, and to  exercise on his or her behalf the rights referred to in Article  78 of the GDPR and Article 20 of this Law.  2. The representation mandate referred to in paragraph  1 shall be made by means of a specific written authorisation  validated for the signature authenticity of the contracting  party in accordance with Article 11(1)(a) of the Code of  Administrative Procedure (Law 2690/1999, Government  Gazette A’ 45).

The application of the provisions of Article 5 of the  Code of Administrative Procedure relating to the provision  of documents by bodies of the public sector falling within  the scope of Article 1 of the above Code and of other  provisions relating to the issuing of documents by the body     3391GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  or authority or agency concerned shall remain unaffected,  where those documents are personal data.  2. The application of the provisions of Article 22 of the  Code of court organisation and status of judicial officials  (Law 1756/1988, Government Gazette A’ 35) shall remain  unaffected.  CHAPTER D TRANSPOSITION OF DIRECTIVE (2016/680)   SECTION I SCOPE — GENERAL PRINCIPLES  Article 43 Scope (Articles 1 and 2 of the Directive)  The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the  processing of personal data by public authorities which are  competent for the prevention, investigation, detection or  prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal  penalties, including the safeguarding against and the  prevention of threats to public security. In the above cases,  the public authorities are always considered as controllers.  Where, in this Chapter, provisions for processors are  included, its provisions shall also apply to them.  Article 44 Definitions (Article 3 of the Directive)  1. For the purposes of this Chapter: (a) ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an   identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an  identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,  directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier  such as a name, an identification number, location data,  an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the  physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural  or social identity of that natural person;  (b) ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations  which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal  data, whether or not by automated means, such as  collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,  adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,  disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise  making available, alignment or combination, restriction,  erasure or destruction;  (c) ‘restriction of processing’ means the marking of stored  personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the  future;  (d) ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing  of personal data consisting in the use of personal data  to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural  person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects  concerning that natural person's performance at work,  economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,  reliability, behaviour, location or movements;   (e) ‘pseudonymisation’ means the processing of  personal data in such a manner that the personal data can  no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the   use of additional information, provided that such additional  information is kept separately and is subject to technical  and organisational measures to ensure that the personal  data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural  person;   (f) ‘filing system’ means any structured set of personal  data which are accessible according to specific criteria,  whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a  functional or geographical basis;   (g) ‘controller’ means the public authority which, alone or  jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of  the processing of personal data;  (h) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public  authority, agency or other body which processes personal  data on behalf of the controller;   (i) ‘recipient’ means a natural or legal person, public  authority, agency or another body, to which the personal  data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However,  public authorities which may receive personal data in the  framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union  law or any other law shall not be regarded as recipients; the  processing of those data by those public authorities shall  be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules  according to the purposes of the processing;   (j) ‘personal data breach’ means a breach of security  leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,  alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,  personal data processed;   (k) ‘genetic data’ means personal data relating to the  inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural  person which give unique information about the physiology  or the health of that natural person and which result, in  particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the  natural person in question;   (l) ‘biometric data’ means personal data resulting from  specific technical processing relating to the physical,  physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural  person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of  that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic  data;   (m) ‘data concerning health’ means personal data  related to the physical or mental health of a natural person,  including the provision of health care services, which reveal  information about his or her health status;   (n) ‘special categories of personal data’ means  personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political  opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union  membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric  data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural  person, data concerning health or data concerning a  natural person's sex life or sexual orientation;   (o) ‘supervisory authority’ means an independent public  authority which is established by a Member State pursuant  to Article 41 of Directive (EU) 2016/680;   (p) ‘international organisation’ means an organisation  and its subordinate bodies governed by public international  law, or any other body which is set up by, or on the basis of,  an agreement between two or more countries;  (q) ‘consent’ means any freely given, specific for  the purposes of the case, unambiguous and informed  indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she,     3392 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies  agreement to the processing of personal data relating to  him or her.  Article 45  General Principles  (Article 4 of the Directive)  1. Personal data must be:  (a) processed lawfully and fairly;  (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes   and not processed in a manner that is incompatible with  those purposes;   (c) adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to  the purposes for which they are processed;  (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date;  every reasonable step provided for by provisions in force  must be taken to ensure that personal data that are  inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they  are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data  subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes  for which they are processed;  (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate  security of the personal data, including protection against  unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental  loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or  organisational measures.  2. The controller must be able to demonstrate  compliance with his or her obligations pursuant to the  previous paragraph.  SECTION II LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING  Article 46 Processing of special categories of personal data  (Article 10 of the Directive)  1. Processing of special categories of personal data  shall only be allowed where strictly necessary for the  performance of the tasks of the controller.  2. Where special categories of personal data are  processed, appropriate safeguards for the data subject’s  protected legitimate interests shall apply. Appropriate  safeguards may include in particular:  (a) specific requirements for data security or for  monitoring data protection;   (b) specific time limits within which data should be  reviewed for erasure;   (c) measures to raise awareness of staff involved in  processing operations;  (d) restrictions on access to personal data within the  controller (the competent body);   (e) processing of such data using spatial and  organisational separation;   (f) pseudonymisation of personal data; (g) encryption of personal data; or (h) specific codes of conduct to ensure lawful processing   in case of transfer or processing for other purposes.  Article 47 Processing for other purposes  (Article 4 of the Directive)  The processing of personal data for a purpose other than  that for which they have been collected shall be permitted  where that other purpose is one of the purposes referred to  in Article 43, the controller is authorised to process data for  that purpose and the processing carried out is necessary  and proportionate to that other purpose. The processing of  personal data for another purpose, which is not referred to  in Article 43, shall be permitted where expressly provided  for by law.  Article 48 Processing for archiving purposes in the public  interest, scientific or historical research purposes  or statistical purposes  (Article 4 of the Directive)  Personal data may be processed in the context of the  purposes referred to in Article 43 for archiving purposes  in the public interest, or for scientific or historical research  purposes or statistical purposes, if this is in the public  interest and appropriate safeguards are applied in relation  to the data subject’s protected legitimate rights. Such  safeguards may consist in anonymising personal data as  soon as possible, taking measures to prevent unauthorised  third-party access or their processing using spatial and  organisational separation from other specific tasks.  Article 49  Consent  1. To the extent that the processing of personal data is  based on consent by law, the controller must be able to  demonstrate that the data subject has given his or her  consent.  2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context  of a written declaration which also concerns other matters,  the request for consent should be presented in a manner  which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in  an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and  plain language.  3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his  or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall  not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent  given before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data  subject shall be informed of this right.  4. Consent produces its legal effects only when it is  based on the data subject’s free will. In assessing whether  consent was freely given, account should be taken of  the circumstances in which consent was given. The data  subject shall be informed of the intended purpose of  processing. If necessary, according to the circumstances  of the case in question or upon request, the data subject  shall also be informed of the consequences of the refusal  of consent.  5. In case of special categories of personal data, consent  must be explicitly referred to those data.    3393GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  Article 50 Processing under the authority of the controller (Article 23 of the Directive)  Any person acting under the authority of the controller  or the processor, who has access to personal data, shall  process such data on instructions from the controller,  unless provided otherwise by law.  Article 51  Confidentiality  All persons employed in the processing of personal  data shall process such data upon authorisation and  shall be obliged, when taking up their duties, to maintain  confidentiality. The obligation of confidentiality continues  even after the termination of their employment.  Article 52 Automated individual decision-making  (Article 11 of the Directive)  1. A decision based solely on automated processing,  which produces an adverse legal effect concerning the data  subject or significantly affects him or her shall be permitted  only if provided for by law.  2. Decisions referred to in the previous paragraph shall  not apply to special categories of personal data, unless  appropriate measures to safeguard the data subject’s  legitimate interests are in place.  3. Profiling that results in discrimination against natural  persons on the basis of special categories of personal data  shall be prohibited.  SECTION III RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT  Article 53 General information on data processing  (Articles 12 and 13 of the Directive)  The controller shall provide general and easily accessible  information to the public in plain and intelligible language  through the website of the public authority with regard to:   (a) the purposes of processing,  (b) the right of the data subject to request from the   controller access to, rectification, erasure or restriction of  processing,  (c) the identity and the contact details of the controller  and the DPO,  (d) the right to lodge a complaint with the Authority, and  (e) the contact details of the Authority.  Article 54 The data subject’s right to be informed  (Article 13 of the Directive)  1. In specific cases, and in particular where the personal  data of the data subject have been collected in secrecy and  in order to enable the exercise of his or her rights, the data  subject should, in addition to the information referred to in  the previous Article, be informed, at least, of:  (a) the legal basis for the processing;   (b) the period for which the personal data will be stored,  or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine  that period;   (c) where applicable, the recipients of the personal data; (d) where necessary, further information, in particular   where the personal data are collected without the  knowledge of the data subject.  2. In the cases referred to in the previous paragraph,  the controller may delay, restrict or omit the provision of  information to the data subject, if necessary, in order to:  (a) enable the competent authorities to perform their  duties, as described in Article 43,  (b) ensure national security or public security, or  (c) protect the legitimate interests of third parties, which   would otherwise be threatened, if the interest in avoiding  these threats overrides the interest of the data subject in  being informed.  3. The provisions of paragraph 7 of the following Article  shall also apply to the restrictions of the previous paragraph.  Article 55 Right of access  (Articles 14 and 15 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall, at the data subject’s request,  inform the data subject of the processing of personal  data relating to him or her. The data subject shall also be  informed of:  (a) the personal data to be processed and the categories  to which they belong;  (b) any available information on the data origin; (c) the purposes and legal basis for the processing; (d) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the   data have been disclosed, in particular recipients in third  countries or international organisations;   (e) the period for which the personal data will be stored,  or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine  that period;   (f) the possibility of exercising the right to rectification or  erasure or restriction of the processing of personal data;  (g) the right to lodge a complaint with the Authority,  pursuant to Article 58; and  (h) the contact details of the Authority. 2. The previous paragraph shall not apply to personal   data which are processed only because they cannot be  erased due to legal requirements for retention or for the sole  purpose of data security or data protection audits, where the  provision of information involves a disproportionate effort  and the processing for other purposes through appropriate  technical and organisational measures is excluded.  3. No information shall be provided if the data subject  does not provide any information enabling his or her  personal data to be found and, therefore, the effort involved  is disproportionate to the interest of the data subject in  being informed.  4. In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of the previous  Article, the controller may refuse to provide information in  accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 or  to restrict, in whole or in part, the provision of information in  accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.  5. The data subject shall not be notified of the identity of     3394 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  the natural persons from whom the personal data originate,  where such information is likely to endanger his or her life  or physical integrity and fundamental freedoms, as well as  in the case of protected witnesses or informants.  6. The controller shall inform the data subject in writing,  without delay, of his or her decision to refuse or restrict  access. The above notification obligation of the controller  shall not apply where the provision of such information  gives rise to a risk in accordance with paragraph 2 of the  previous Article. The above notification shall include the  factual or legal reasons on which the refusal or restriction  is based, unless such justification would compromise the  intended purpose of the refusal or restriction of access.  7. In case of refusal or restriction of access, the data  subject, pursuant to the previous paragraph, shall be  informed of the possibility of exercising the right of access  through the Authority, and, in particular, the possibility of  lodging a complaint with the Authority under Article 58, and  of bringing an action for annulment against the Authority’s  negative decision before the Council of State. The decision  of the controller shall be transmitted to the Authority, unless  the controller invokes national security concerns. In the  case of a complaint lodged with the Authority, the latter  shall investigate whether the conditions necessary for the  restriction of the right are met and shall inform the subject  at least that all necessary verifications or reviews have  been carried out by the Authority, as well as whether the  provisions on the protection of personal data have been  infringed.  8. The controller shall document the factual or legal  reasons on which the decision is based.  Article 56 Right to rectification or erasure of personal data  and restriction of processing  (Article 16 of the Directive)  1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from  the controller without delay the rectification of inaccurate  personal data relating to him or her. In particular, in the  case of statements or decisions, the question of accuracy  is irrelevant to the content of the statement or decision.  If the accuracy or inaccuracy of personal data cannot be  ascertained, the controller shall restrict the processing  instead of deleting the data. In such a case, the controller  shall inform the data subject before resuming the restriction.  The data subject may also request to have incomplete  personal data completed, where this is reasonable, taking  into account the purposes of the processing.  2. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from  the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him  or her without delay, where the processing of such data  infringes the provisions of this Chapter, the knowledge of  those data is no longer necessary for the performance of  tasks or those data must be erased, so as to allow the  controller to fulfil a legal obligation.  3. Instead of erasing personal data, the controller shall  restrict the processing, where:  (a) there is reason to assume that the erasure would  compromise the legitimate interests of the data subject,  (b) the personal data are to be kept, provided they serve   as evidence for the purposes of Article 43, or (c) erasure would be impossible or would involve a   disproportionate effort due to the special storage mode. Personal data subject to restricted processing, in   accordance with the above, may be processed only for the  purpose preventing their erasure.  4. In automated filing systems, technical measures  should ensure that the restriction of processing is easily  visible and that processing for other purposes is not  possible without further examination.  5. Where the controller has rectified inaccurate  personal data, he or she shall notify the rectification to  the body from which the controller obtained the data. In  case of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing  in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3, the controller shall  inform the recipients to whom the personal data have been  transmitted of those measures. The recipient shall rectify or  erase the personal data or restrict their processing.  6. The controller shall inform the data subject in writing  of any refusal of rectification or erasure of personal data or  restriction of their processing. This shall not apply where  the provision of such information gives rise to a risk in  accordance with Article 54(2). The information referred to  in the previous subparagraph shall include the reasons  for such refusal, unless such reasons compromise the  intended purpose of the refusal.  7. In other respects, paragraphs 7 and 8 of the previous  Article shall apply accordingly.  Article 57 Modalities for exercising the rights of the data  subject  (Article 12 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall communicate with the data subject  in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form, using  clear and plain language, in particular when addressing  minors. The information shall be provided without prejudice  to specific provisions by any appropriate means, including  by electronic means. The controller should provide the  information in the same form as the request.  2. Without prejudice to Article 55(5) and Article 56(6), the  controller shall without delay inform the data subject of the  status of his or her request.  3. The information provided in accordance with  Article 53, any communication made in accordance with  Articles 54 and 64, as well as the requests processed in  accordance with Articles 55 and 56, shall not be subject to a  fee. Where a request in accordance with Articles 55 and 56  is manifestly unfounded or is being abused, the controller  may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative  costs or may refuse to act on the request. In this case,  the controller must be able to demonstrate the manifestly  unfounded or excessive character of the request.  4. Where the controller has reasonable doubts  concerning the identity of the data subject making the  request referred to in Articles 55 and 56, the controller may  request the provision of additional information necessary to  confirm the identity of the data subject.    3395GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  Article 58 Right to lodge a complaint with the Authority  (Article 17 of the Directive)  1. The data subject shall have the right to lodge a  complaint with the Authority, if the data subject considers  that the processing of personal data relating to him or  her by public authorities for the purposes referred to in  Article 43 infringes his or her rights. This shall not apply  to the processing of personal data by the judicial and  prosecutorial authorities when processing such data acting  in their judicial capacity. The Authority shall inform the data  subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint  and of the possibility of bringing an action for annulment  before the Council of State against the decision on his or  her complaint, in accordance with Article 20.  2. Where a complaint relating to processing is lodged with  the Authority instead of the competent supervisory authority  of another Member State of the European Union, the  Authority should transmit without delay to the supervisory  authority of the other Member State of the European  Union the complaint falling within its competence. In such  a case, the Authority shall inform the data subject of the  transmission of his or her complaint and provide him or her  with any assistance upon his or her request.  Article 59 Rights of the data subject in criminal investigations  and proceedings  (Article 18 of the Directive)  In the context of criminal investigations and proceedings,  the right to be informed of the processing, to access,  rectification or erasure and restriction of personal data, in  accordance with the provisions of Articles 54 to 56, shall be  exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, specific procedural provisions and the  Code of court organisation and status of judicial officials, as  applicable each time.  SECTION IV OBLIGATIONS OF PROCESSORS AND  CONTROLLERS  Article 60 Processor  (Articles 22 and 23 of the Directive)  1. Where processing is carried out on behalf of a  controller, the controller shall ensure compliance with the  obligations arising from this Law and other provisions  relating to the protection of personal data. The right of the  data subject to be informed, to rectification, erasure and  restriction of the processing of personal data, as well as the  right to compensation in this case shall be exercised vis-à- vis the controller.  2. The controller shall be allowed to assign the processing  of personal data only to processors who ensure that, by  implementing appropriate technical and organisational  measures, processing is carried out in accordance with the  law and that the protection of the rights of the data subject  is guaranteed.  3. The carrying out of processing by a processor should  be governed by a contract or other legal act binding the  processor to the controller and that sets out the subject  matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing, the  categories of data subjects and the rights and obligations of  the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate,  in particular, that the processor:  (a) acts only on instructions from the controller; where the  processor is of the opinion that an instruction is unlawful,  the processor should inform the controller without delay;  (b) guarantees that persons authorised to process the  personal data have pledged themselves to confidentiality to  the extent that they are not under a valid statutory obligation  of confidentiality;  (c) assists the controller by any appropriate means to  safeguard the data subject's rights;  (d) at the controller’s discretion, returns or deletes all  the personal data after the end of the provision of data  processing services, and deletes existing copies, unless  there is a legal obligation to store the data;  (e) provides to the controller all information necessary  to demonstrate compliance with his or her obligations, in  particular logs created in accordance with Article 74;  (f) allows audits to be carried out by the controller or the  auditor authorised by the controller, and contributes to such  audits;  (g) takes all necessary measures in accordance with  Article 62;  (h) taking into account the nature of the processing and  the information available, assists the controller to ensure  compliance with the obligations laid down in Articles 62 to  65 and 67.  4. In the event that the processor engages another  processor, the processor should impose the same  obligations laid down in the contract with the controller, in  accordance with paragraph 3, which also applies to the  processor, unless these obligations are already binding on  the other processor under other provisions.  5. The processor may engage another processor  only with prior written authorisation from the controller.  Where the controller has given general authorisation to  the processor for the participation of another processor,  the processor shall inform the controller of any intended  changes concerning the addition or replacement of other  processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to  object to such changes.  6. The contract referred to in paragraph 3 shall be in  writing or in electronic form.  7. A processor who determines, in infringement of this  Article, the purposes and means of processing shall be  considered to be a controller.  Article 61 Joint controllers  (Article 21 of the Directive)  1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine the  purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint  controllers. The duties and responsibilities of each joint  controller shall be determined in a transparent manner,  by means of a written arrangement, to the extent that their     3396 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  duties and responsibilities are not determined by law. In  particular, the arrangement shall designate the person who  will be responsible for meeting the information obligations  and before which authority the data subjects may exercise  their rights.  2. The terms of the arrangement referred to in the  previous paragraph shall not prevent the data subject  from exercising his or her rights against each of the joint  controllers.  Article 62 Security of processing  (Articles 19 and 29 of the Directive)  1. The controller and processor, taking into account the  state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature,  scope, context and purposes of the processing as well  as the likelihood and severity of the risks involved by the  processing for the data subjects, shall take the necessary  technical and organisational measures to ensure a level  of security appropriate to the risk during the processing of  personal data, in particular as regards the processing of  special categories of personal data.  2. The measures referred to in the previous paragraph  may include, inter alia, the pseudonymisation and  encryption of personal data, where such measures are  possible for the purposes of the processing. The measures  in accordance with paragraph 1 should ensure:  (a) the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience  of processing systems and services; and  (b) the ability to restore the availability and access to  personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical  or technical incident.  3. In respect of automated processing, the controller  and processor, following an evaluation of the risks, shall  implement measures designed to:  (a) deny unauthorised persons access to processing  equipment used for processing (‘equipment access  control’);  (b) prevent the unauthorised reading, copying,  modification or removal of data media (‘data media control’);   (c) prevent the unauthorised input of personal data and  the unauthorised inspection, modification or deletion of  stored personal data (‘storage control’);  (d) prevent the use of automated processing systems  by unauthorised persons using data communication  equipment (‘user control’);   (e) ensure that persons authorised to use an automated  processing system have access only to the personal  data covered by their access authorisation (‘data access  control’);   (f) ensure that it is possible to verify and establish the  bodies to which personal data have been or may be  transmitted or made available using data communication  equipment (‘communication control’);   (g) ensure that it is subsequently possible to verify  and establish which personal data have been input into  automated processing systems, and when and by whom  the personal data were input (‘input control’);   (h) prevent the unauthorised reading, copying,  modification or deletion of personal data during transfers   of personal data or during transportation of data media  (‘transport control’);   (i) ensure that installed systems may, in the case of  interruption, be restored (‘recovery’);   (j) ensure that the functions of the system perform,  that the appearance of faults in the functions is reported  (‘reliability’) and that stored personal data cannot be  corrupted by means of a malfunctioning of the system  (‘integrity’);   (k) ensure that the personal data to be processed on  behalf of the controller can only be processed according to  the instructions of the controller (‘processing control’);  (l) ensure that the personal data are protected from loss  and destruction (availability control);   (m) ensure that the personal data collected for different  purposes can be processed using organisational or spatial  separation (possibility of separation).  The purpose of the first subparagraph in indents (b) to  (e) may be achieved, in particular, by means of encryption  technology.  Article 63 Notification of a personal data breach to the  Authority  (Article 30 of the Directive)  1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller  shall notify without delay and, where feasible, not later than  seventy two (72) hours after having become aware of it,  the personal data breach to the Authority, unless he or she  reasonably considers on the basis of justifiable reasons  that the breach is not likely to compromise the protected  legal interests of a natural person. The notification of the  breach to the Authority after the expiry of seventy two (72)  hours shall be specifically justified as regards the reasons  for the delay.   2. The processor shall notify the controller without delay  after becoming aware of a personal data breach.  3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain  at least the following information:  (a) the nature of the personal data breach including,  where possible, the categories and number of data subjects  concerned, and the categories and number of personal  data records concerned;  (b) the name and contact details of the data protection  officer or other contact point where more information can  be obtained;  (c) a description of the likely consequences of the  personal data breach; and  (d) a description of the measures taken or proposed to  be taken by the controller to address the personal data  breach and to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  4. Where it is not possible to provide the information  referred to in the previous paragraph at the same time with  the notification of the breach, the controller may provide the  information in phases once it is available without further  delay.  5. The controller shall document any personal data  breach comprising of the facts relating to the personal data  breach, its effects and the remedial action taken.  6. Where the personal data breach involves personal     3397GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  data that have been transmitted by or to the controller  of another Member State, the information referred to in  paragraph 3 shall be communicated to the controller of that  Member State without delay.  7. Further obligations of the controller regarding the  notification of personal data breaches shall remain  unaffected.  Article 64 Communication of a personal data breach to the  data subject  (Article 31 of the Directive)  1. Where the personal data breach is likely to result in  a significant risk to the protected legitimate interests of  a natural person, the controller shall communicate the  personal data breach to the data subject without delay.  2. When notifying the data subject in accordance with  paragraph 1, the nature of the personal data breach shall  be described in clear and plain language and the content of  points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 3 of the previous Article  shall be at least indicated.  3. A communication to the data subject shall not be  required if any of the following conditions are met:  (a) the controller has taken appropriate technical and  organisational security measures and has implemented  those measures to the personal data affected by the  personal data breach. This applies in particular to  measures, such as encryption, that render the personal  data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to  access it;  (b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which  ensure protection against personal data breach; or  (c) disproportionate efforts are required. In such a case,  there shall instead be a public communication or similar  measures whereby the data subjects are informed in an  equally effective manner.  4. If the controller has not informed the data subject  of the personal data breach, the Authority may formally  declare that it considers that the conditions of paragraph  3 are not met. In doing so, it should consider the likelihood  that the damage will result in a significant risk within the  meaning of paragraph 1.  5. The communication to the data subject pursuant to  paragraph 1 may be delayed, restricted or omitted subject  to the conditions laid down in Article 54(2), except where  the interests of the data subject override the significant risk  of the breach within the meaning of paragraph 1.  Article 65 Assessment of the impact of processing on the  protection of personal data  (Article 27 of the Directive)  1. If a form of processing, in particular where using new  technologies, is likely to result in a significant risk to the  protected legitimate interests of the data subjects due to the  nature, scope, conditions and purposes of the processing,  the controller shall first carry out an assessment of the  impact of the envisaged processing for the data subjects.  2. To investigate such processing operations with similar  potential for significant risk, a data protection impact   assessment may be carried out jointly. 3. The impact assessment shall take into account   the rights of the data subject which are affected by the  processing and must contain at least the following:  (a) a systematic description of the envisaged operations  and purposes of the processing;   (b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality  of the processing operations in relation to the intended  purposes;  (c) an assessment of the risks to the protected legitimate  interests of the data subject; and   d) the measures to be taken to address the existing risks,  including safeguards, security measures and procedures to  ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate  compliance with legal requirements.  4. Where necessary, the controller shall check whether  the processing complies with the requirements of the  impact assessment.  Article 66 Cooperation with the Authority  (Article 26 of the Directive)  The controller and processor shall cooperate with the  Authority in the performance of its tasks.  Article 67 Prior consultation of the Authority  (Article 28 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall consult the Authority prior to  processing personal data which will form part of a new filing  system to be created, where:  (a) a data protection impact assessment as provided  for in Article 65 indicates that the processing would result  in a significant risk to the protected legitimate interests of  the data subject in the absence of measures taken by the  controller to mitigate the risk; or   (b) the type of processing, in particular due to the use of  new technologies, mechanisms or procedures, involves a  significant risk to the protected legitimate interests of the  data subject.  2. During the preparation of draft laws or regulations  relating to the processing of personal data by competent  authorities for the purposes of Article 43 or linked to the  processing, the Authority shall be consulted in a timely  manner.  3. The Authority may establish a list of the processing  operations which are subject to prior consultation pursuant  to paragraph 1. The Authority shall communicate this list to  the controller.  4. During prior consultation, the Authority shall be  provided with:  (a) a data protection impact assessment carried out in  accordance with Article 65;   (b) where applicable, information about the responsibilities  of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved;  (c) information about the purposes and means of the  intended processing;   (d) information about the measures and safeguards  provided to protect the legitimate interests of the data  subjects; and     3398 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  (e) the name and contact details of the DPO. The Authority shall receive upon request any other   information necessary to assess the lawfulness of the  processing and, in particular, the existing risks for the  protection of personal data of the data subjects and of the  related safeguards.  5. Where the Authority is of the opinion that the intended  processing would infringe the law, in particular where the  controller has insufficiently identified the risk or has not  taken sufficient measures to mitigate the risk, the Authority  may provide, within a period of up to six (6) weeks of receipt  of the request for consultation, written recommendations to  the controller and, where applicable, the processor with  regard to additional measures to be taken. The Authority  may extend that period by one (1) month if the intended  processing is highly complex. In this case, the Authority shall  inform the controller or processor of any such extension.  6. Where the envisaged processing is necessary  for the performance of the tasks of the controller, and is  therefore particularly urgent, the controller may initiate such  processing after the start of the consultation, but before the  expiry of the period referred to in the first subparagraph of  the previous paragraph. In this case, the recommendations  must be taken into account ex post and the method of  processing shall be adjusted accordingly.  Article 68 Records of processing activities  (Article 24 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall maintain a record of all categories  of processing activities under his or her responsibility. That  record shall contain the following information:  (a) the name or business name and the contact details  of the controller and, where applicable, any joint controller  and the DPO;   (b) the purposes of the processing;  (c) the categories of recipients to whom the personal   data have been or will be disclosed, including recipients in  third countries or international organisations;   (d) a description of the categories of data subjects and of  the categories of personal data;  (e) where applicable, the use of profiling; (f) where applicable, the categories of transfers of   personal data to a third country or an international  organisation;   (g) an indication of the legal basis for the processing; (h) the prescribed time limits for erasure of the different   categories of personal data or for review of the need for  their erasure; and  (i) a general description of the technical and organisational  security measures referred to in Article 62.  2. The processor should maintain a record of all  categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a  controller, containing:  (a) the name or business name and the contact details  of each processor, each controller on behalf of whom the  processor is acting and, where applicable, of the DPO;  (b) the categories of processing carried out on behalf of  each controller;  (c) where applicable, transfers of personal data to an   identified third country or an international organisation  where the processor has explicitly been instructed to do so  by the controller; and  (d) where possible, a general description of the technical  and organisational security measures referred to in Article  62.  3. The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall  be in writing.  4. The controller and processor shall make those records  available to the Authority on request.  Article 69 Data protection by design and by default (Article 20 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall, both at the time of the determination  of the means for processing and at the time of the  processing itself, take appropriate measures to implement  data protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an  effective manner, in order to ensure compliance with the  legal requirements and the protection of the rights of data  subjects. The controller shall take into account the state of  the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope,  context and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of  varying likelihood and severity for the protected legitimate  interests of the data subject. In particular, personal data  shall be processed and the processing systems shall be  selected and designed in accordance with the principle of  minimisation. As far as possible, personal data shall be  anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible in  accordance with the purpose of the processing.  2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical  and organisational measures to ensure that, by default,  only personal data necessary for each specific purpose of  the processing are processed. This applies to the amount of  personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the  period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular,  such measures shall ensure that by default personal  data are not made accessible by automated means to an  indefinite number of persons.  Article 70 Distinction between different categories of data  subject  (Αrticle 6 of the Directive)  1. Where processing personal data, the controller shall,  as far as possible, make a clear distinction between different  categories of data subjects. This applies in particular to the  following categories:  (a) persons with regard to whom there are serious  grounds for believing that they have committed a criminal  offence;   (b) persons with regard to whom there are serious  grounds for believing that they are about to commit a  criminal offence;   (c) persons convicted of a criminal offence; (d) victims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to   whom certain facts give rise to reasons for believing that he  or she could be the victim of a criminal offence; and  (e) other persons, such as witnesses, informants or  contacts or associates of the persons referred to in indents     3399GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  (a) to (d).  Article 71 Distinction between personal data and verification  of their identity  (Αrticle 7 of the Directive)  During processing, the controller shall distinguish, as far  as possible, personal data based on facts from personal  data based on personal assessments. To this end, the  controller shall specify the evaluations based on personal  assessments as such, insofar as it is feasible, in the context  of such processing. It should also be possible to determine  which public authority maintains the records on which the  evaluation upon personal assessment is based.  Article 72 Transmission procedure  (Articles 7 and 9 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to  ensure that personal data which are inaccurate or no longer  up to date are not transmitted or otherwise made available.  To that end, the controller shall, as far as possible, verify the  quality of personal data before they are transmitted or made  available, making a reasonable effort. The controller should  also, as far as possible and reasonable, in all transmissions  of personal data include necessary information enabling the  recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness  and reliability of personal data, and the extent to which they  are up to date.  2. Where the processing of personal data is subject  to specific conditions as to the transmission of data, the  transmitting authority shall inform the recipient of those  conditions and the requirement to comply with them. The  obligation to provide information may be fulfilled by marking  the data accordingly.  3. The transmitting competent authority shall not  apply the conditions set out in the previous paragraph to  recipients in other Member States or to agencies, offices  and bodies established pursuant to Chapters 4 and 5 of  Title V of the TFEU other than those applicable to similar  transmissions of data within the within the Greek territory.  Article 73 Rectification and erasure of personal data and  restriction of processing  (Article 5 of the Directive)  1. The controller shall rectify inaccurate personal data. 2. The controller shall erase personal data without delay,   if the processing is unlawful, and the data must be erased  to comply with a legal obligation or it is no longer necessary  for the controller to be aware of such data to perform his or  her tasks.  3. Paragraphs 3 to 5 of Article 56 shall apply accordingly.  The recipient shall also be informed whether or not  inaccurate personal data have been transmitted or whether  personal data have been transmitted unlawfully.  4. Without prejudice to the maximum time limits for  storage or erasure laid down in legal provisions, the  controller shall provide for the erasure of personal data or   for a periodic review of the need for storing personal data  and shall ensure compliance with those time limits based  on set procedural regulations.  Article 74 Logging (Article 25 of the Directive)  1. The controller and the processor shall keep logs in  automated processing systems for at least the following  processing operations:  (a) collection, (b) alteration, (c) consultation, (d) disclosure including transfers; (e) combination and (f) erasure. 2. The logs of consultation and disclosure shall make it   possible to establish the justification, date and time of such  operations and, as far as possible, the identification of the  person who consulted or disclosed personal data, and the  identity of the recipients of such personal data.  3. The logs shall be used solely for verification of the  lawfulness of data processing by the Authority and the  data subject, as well as for self-monitoring, ensuring the  integrity and security of the personal data, and for criminal  proceedings.  4. The logs shall be deleted at the end of the year  following the year in which they were created.  5. The controller and processor shall make the logs  available to the Authority on request.  SECTION V TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA TO  THIRD COUNTRIES OR INTERNATIONAL  ORGANISATIONS   Article 75 General principles for transfers of personal data  (Article 35 of the Directive)  1. Where all the other conditions for transfers of personal  data laid down in this Chapter are met, the transfer of  personal data to the authorities of third countries or  international organisations may take place, where:  (a) the authority or international organisation is competent  for the purposes referred to in Article 43, and  (b) the Commission has adopted a decision ensuring an  adequate level of protection in the third country, a territory  or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or  the international organisation in question, or, in the absence  of such a decision, appropriate safeguards have been  provided or exist pursuant to the following Article or, in the  absence of the above, derogations for specific situations  apply pursuant to Article 77.  2. The transfer of personal data may not take place,  in spite of an adequacy decision in accordance with the  previous paragraph and although this is required by the  public interest, if, in such case, the protection of the data  subject’s fundamental rights and legitimate interests  cannot be ensured when their data are processed by their  recipient. The controller shall assess the level of protection     3400 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE A’ 137/29.08.2019  of such rights and legitimate interests of the data subject  on the basis of whether the recipient of the personal data  in the third country ensures in this case their appropriate  protection.  3. Where personal data transferred or made available  from another Member State of the European Union must be  transferred in accordance with paragraph 1, the competent  authority of the other Member State must have first given  its authorisation to such transfer. Transfers without prior  authorisation shall be permitted only where the transfer is  necessary for the prevention of an immediate and serious  risk to public security of a State or to essential interests  of a Member State and the prior authorisation cannot be  obtained in a timely manner. In the case of paragraph 2,  the authority or body of the other Member State responsible  for giving authorisation shall be informed of the transfer  immediately.  4. The controller transferring personal data pursuant to  paragraph 1 shall take appropriate measures to ensure  that the recipient transmits only the data transmitted to  other third countries or international organisations, where  the controller has given prior authorisation to such transfer.  Where the controller decides to give authorisation, the  controller shall take due account of all relevant factors, in  particular the seriousness of the offence, the purpose for  which the data were originally transferred, and the level of  personal data protection in the third country or international  organisation to which personal data are to be transferred.  An authorisation may be given only if it is permitted to  transfer personal data directly to another third country or  international organisation.  Article 76 Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards  (Article 37 of the Directive)  1. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to  subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of the previous Article, a  transfer of personal data to a third country or an international  organisation may take place where:  (a) appropriate safeguards with regard to the protection  of personal data are provided for in a legally binding  instrument, or  (b) the controller has assessed all the circumstances  surrounding the transfer of personal data and concludes  that appropriate safeguards exist with regard to the  protection of personal data.  2. The controller shall record the transfers under  indent (b) of paragraph 1. The recording shall include the  date and time of the transfer, the identity of the recipient,  the justification for the transfer and the personal data  transferred. The above recording shall be made available  to the Authority upon request.  Article 77 Derogations for specific situations (Article 38 of the Directive)  1. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to  Article 75(1)(b), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to  paragraph 1 of the previous Article, transfers meeting the  other conditions of Article 75 may take place only on the   condition that this is necessary in order to: (a) protect the vital interests of the data subject or   another person,  (b) safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject, (c) prevent an immediate and serious threat to public   security of a country,  (d) in individual cases for the purposes set out in Article   43, or  (e) in individual cases for the establishment, exercise or   defence of legal claims relating to the purposes set out in  Article 43.  2. The transfer of personal data pursuant to the previous  paragraph shall not be permitted, where the transferring  competent authority determines that the data subject’s  fundamental rights and legitimate interests override the  public interest in the transfer.  3. Paragraph 2 of the previous Article shall apply  accordingly to the transfers referred to in paragraph 1.  Article 78 Transfers of personal data to recipients established  in third countries  (Article 39 of the Directive)  1. In specific individual cases, and if all other requirements  for data transfers to third countries are fulfilled, controllers  may transfer personal data directly to recipients established  in third countries not referred to in indent (a) of Article 75(1),  if the transfer is strictly necessary for the performance of  their tasks, and  (a) in this case, no fundamental right of the data subject  overrides the public interest necessitating the transfer,   (b) the transfer to the authorities referred to in in Article  75(1)(a) is ineffective or inappropriate, in particular because  the transfer cannot be achieved in a timely manner, and   (c) the controller informs the recipient of the purposes of  the processing and gives clear instructions to the recipient  that the transmitted data may be processed only to the  extent necessary for such purposes.  2. In the case of paragraph 1, the controller shall inform  without delay the authorities referred to in indent (a) of  Article 75(1), unless that is ineffective or inappropriate.  3. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 75 shall apply accordingly  to transfers in accordance with paragraph 1.  4. In the case of transfers referred to in paragraph 1, the  controller shall oblige the recipient to process the personal  data transferred without the consent of the controller only  for the purpose for which the data were transmitted.  5. Agreements in the field of judicial cooperation in  criminal matters and police cooperation shall remain  unaffected.  SECTION VI COOPERATION BETWEEN SUPERVISORY  AUTHORITIES  Article 79 Mutual assistance  (Article 50 of the Directive)  1. The Authority shall provide the supervisory authorities  of other Member States with information and mutual     3401GOVERNMENT GAZETTEA’ 137/29.08.2019  assistance insofar as necessary in order to implement  this Chapter. Mutual assistance shall cover, in particular,  information requests and supervisory measures, such  as requests to carry out consultations, inspections and  investigations.  2. The Authority shall take all appropriate measures  required to reply to a request of another supervisory  authority for mutual assistance without delay and no later  than one month after receiving the request.  3. The Authority may refuse to comply with the request: (a) if it is not competent for the subject matter of the   request or for the measures it is requested to execute, or (b) compliance with the request infringes the law. 4. The Authority shall inform the requesting supervisory   authority of the other Member State of the results or, as  the case may be, of the progress or the measures taken in  order to respond to the request. In the case of the previous  paragraph, it shall justify its refusal to comply with the  request.  5. The Authority shall, as a rule, supply the information  requested by the supervisory authority of the other Member  State by electronic means and in a standardised format.  6. The Authority shall not charge a fee for actions taken  pursuant to a request for mutual assistance, unless it has  agreed with the supervisory authority of the other State  to indemnify each other for specific expenditure arising  from the provision of mutual assistance in exceptional  circumstances.  7. Requests to the Authority for assistance shall contain  all the necessary information, including the purpose of and  reasons for the request. Information exchanged shall be  used only for the purpose for which it was requested.  SECTION VII LIABILITY AND PENALTIES  Article 80 Liability of the controller  (Articles 54 and 56 of the Directive)  A public authority, in its capacity as a controller, having  unlawfully caused damage to the data subject, in breach  of the provisions of Articles 6 to 8 or the provisions of  this Chapter, shall be required, in accordance with the  provisions of Articles 105 and 106 of the Introductory Law  to the Greek Civil Code, to pay compensation or damages  for non-material damage to the data subject.  Article 81 Criminal penalties (Articles 54 and 57 of the Directive)  Article 38 shall also apply to the processing of personal  data by competent authorities for the purposes of Article 43.  Article 82 Administrative penalties  (Articles 54 and 57 of the Directive)  1. Without prejudice to the supervisory powers of the  Authority pursuant to Article 15 of this Law, the Authority,  in a specific reasoned decision and following a previous   notice summoning the interested parties to provide  explanations, may impose the following administrative  fines on competent authorities for infringements of their  obligations as data controllers:  (a) for infringements of Articles 6 to 8 and Articles 60 to  78, an administrative fine of up to one million euros (EUR  1,000,000),  (b) for infringements of Articles 45 to 57, an administrative  fine up to two million euros (EUR 2,000,000) and   (c) for failure to comply with an order of the Authority  under Article 15(4), an administrative fine of up to two  million euros (EUR 2,000,000).  2. When deciding whether to impose an administrative  fine and determining its amount, in each individual case  due regard shall be given to the following:  (a) the nature, gravity, duration of the infringement, scope  or purpose of the processing concerned and the number of  data subjects affected by the breach and the extent of the  damage suffered,  (b) any actions taken by the competent authority to  mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects,  (c) any relevant previous infringements by the competent  authority,  (d) the categories of personal data affected by the  infringement,  (e) the manner in which the infringement became known  to the Authority, in particular whether, and if so to what  extent, the competent authority notified the infringement  and   (f) in case the measures referred to in Article 15(4) have  already been ordered against the competent authority with  regard to the same infringement, the degree of compliance  with those measures.  CHAPTER E FINAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS  Article 83 Transitional provisions  1. Reference to Law 2472/1997 made in provisions of  the legislation in force shall be construed as reference to  the relevant provisions of the GDPR and of this Law.  2.

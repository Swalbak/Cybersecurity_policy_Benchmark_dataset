The framework consists of the following:    (a) the keeping of a register of information in relation to   critical infrastructure assets (the register will not be   made public);    (b) requiring certain entities relating to a critical   infrastructure asset to provide information in relation to   the asset, and to notify if certain events occur in relation   to the asset;    (c) allowing the Minister to require certain entities relating   to a critical infrastructure asset to do, or refrain from   doing, an act or thing if the Minister is satisfied that   there is a risk of an act or omission that would be   prejudicial to security;    (d) allowing the Secretary to require certain entities relating   to a critical infrastructure asset to provide certain   information or documents;    (e) allowing the Secretary to undertake an assessment of a   critical infrastructure asset to determine if there is a risk   to national security relating to the asset.   Certain information obtained under, or relating to the operation of,   this Act is protected information.

The Regulatory Powers Act is applied for these purposes. Certain   other provisions of this Act may be enforced by imposing a   criminal penalty.   The Minister may privately declare a particular asset to be a critical   infrastructure asset so that this Act applies to it.

The Secretary must give the Minister reports, for presentation to   the Parliament, on the operation of this Act.

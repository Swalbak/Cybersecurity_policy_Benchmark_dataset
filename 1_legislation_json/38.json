STATEMENT OF OBJECTS      The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan guarantees privacy of home alongside   dignity of every man and woman as their fundamental right under its Article 14. Digitization of     31      businesses and various public services employing modern computing technologies involves   processing of personal data. The growth of technological advancements have not only made it   easier to collect personal data but also enabled processing of personal data in so many ways that   were not possible in the past. In today’s digital age, personal data has become an extremely   valuable commodity and for many businesses the sole source of their income is the personal data   of users they generate. The personal data is often being collected, processed and even sold without   knowledge a person. In some cases, such personal information is used for relatively less   troublesome commercial purposes e.g. targeted advertising etc. However, the data so captured or   generated can be misused in many ways e.g. blackmail, behavior modification, phishing scams   etc.     In order to realize the goal of full scale adoption of e-government and delivery of services to the   people on their doorsteps, and increase users’ confidence in the confidentiality and integrity of   government databases, it is essential that the users’ data is fully protected from any unauthorized   access or usage and remedies are provided to them against any misuse of their personal data.   Additionally, accelerated increase in the use of broadband with the advent of 3G/4G in Pakistan   led to an increasingly enhanced reliance on technology calling for protection of people’s data   against any misuse, thus maintaining their confidence in the use of new technologies without any   fear.     Whereas sectoral arrangements/frameworks exist in Pakistan that provide for data protection and   Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Act No.XL of 2016) deals with the crimes relating to   unauthorized access to data, there is a need for putting in place a comprehensive legal framework   in line with our Constitution and international best practices for personal data protection.   Protecting personal data is also necessary to provide legal certainty to the businesses and public   functionaries with regard to processing of personal data in their activities. The desired legal   framework would clearly spell out the responsibilities of the data collectors and processors as   well as rights and privileges of the data subjects along with institutional provisions for regulation   of activities relating to the collections, storing, processing and usage of personal data.",

The Commission may make transitional rules in order to deal with procedural and other matters  that arise in connection with the transition from theTelecommunications Act 2004 to this Act.   52    The Communications Bill 2012   . . Explanatory Memorandum   This Communications Bill 2012 implements the Government of Kiribati’s policy for the reform of the  ICT sector adopted in April 2011. The central objective of that policy is to achieve open and  competitive communications markets in Kiribati. International experience suggests that competition  will deliver significant social and economic benefits, through improved services, lower prices, and  broader coverage.   The Bill sets up a new framework for regulation of communications. ‘The framework is intended to  provide modern, independent, non-discriminatory and proportionate regulation of communications in  Kiribati. The Bill has been developed having regard to intemational best practice aad the particular  needs of Kiribati.   ’ Part I— Preliminary Provisions   Part I sets out the objectives of the Bill, which have been aligned with the Government's policy. The  objectives centre on ensuring regulation is:   * technologically and competitively neutral;  * transparent and non-discriminatory; and   * promotes reliance on market forces, to the extent reasonable,  It is intended that the Commission will have regard to these principles when administering and   exercising its powers under the Act,   Part Tt Institutional Framework   Part Il sets out the institutional framework of the regulatory regime. a   The regulator of the sector will be the Communications Commission of Kiribati. The Commission i is .   . the same body, Sorporate as the  : ss'and re      “The Comimigsion will not be subject to direction by the Minister or Government nit W! be Tequire to  give effect to general Government policies, ,    This Part also sets out rules about how the Commission may exercise its powers. Many powers of the  Commission may only be exercised after conducting a specific consultation process. Certain decisions  also require the Commission to publish and seek comment on a draft of any proposed instrument  before the final instrument can be made. The Commission is obliged to publish all regulations, rules,  licences and other significant documents issued under the Bill, subject to confidentiality obligations  designed to protect licensees’ sensitive information.      Part OI - Reconsideration and Rehearings   Part IZ sets out the process which a person affected by a decision of the Commission may seek a  review of the decision: improving the quality of regulatory decisions, confidence in regulatory  outcomes, and enhancing transparency and accountability. This Part sets out three avenues for review.   The first is that a person directly affected by a decision of the Commission may apply to the  Commission to reconsider the decision. Following an application the Commission must consider the  application and notify the applicant as to whether the decision will be reconsidered. The Commission  must then comply with any consultation requirements that applied when the decision was initially -  made. Reconsideration is intended to be a simple and efficient method for addressing errors. (   An affected person may also apply to an appeals panel to have a decision of the Commission reheard.  The membership of the appeals panel must be drawn from a register of experts to be maintained by the   * Commission, The appeals panel has the power to affirm, vary or set aside decisions of the -  Commission. Because a rehearing may be expensive and create uncertainty while the matter is being   decided, this avenue is limited to considering decisions that may require specialist international  expertise.   A person may also seek judicial review of an administrative decision, However, it is intended that this  option would not be available where other review avenues have not been exhausted ¢ or where the  appeals panel may review v the decision.                 Licences are not required to own or operate exempted networks or to provide exempt services.   Radiocommunications licences   Part IV also deals with radiocommunications licences authorising the use of radio frequency  transmitting devices. There are three types of radiocommunications licence. Spectrum licences  authorise the use of designated parts of the radio spectrum in designated geographic areas. Apparatus  licences authorise the use of designated devices within designated frequencies and geographic areas.   Spectrum is a finite resource and spectrum licences and, accordingly, apparatus licences may be  limited. General permits authorise any person to engage in designated conduct subject to the terms of  the permit. Licences are not required for exempt devices.   Other provisions   The Cormmission is empowered to make rules that will govern the licensing process (which will  include competitive tenders where there are a limited number of licences), set out licence conditions  and determine licence fees. To enhance certainty for potential market entrants, the Commission is  required to promptly consider licence applications and must provide reasons for any refusal to issue an  individual licence to an applicant. The Commission is required to maintain and publish a register of  licensees and licences.   The Commission is required to determine fees for licences in a transparent manner that minimises the  annual fees payable by licensees. The Commission must ensure that its projected licence fee revenne  payable by all licensees in a year will not exceed the Commission’s proposed annual budget and  forecasts.   There are very limited circumstances where the Commission is entitled to revoke or suspend licences.  The Commission may revoke or suspend a radiocommunications licence where it is necessary to  implement a Variation to the spectrum plan or ‘any frequency allocation plans and it is consistent with»  international spectrum planning or the ‘ntemation obligations of the Republic of Kiribati.         _ Part Vv. ~. Interconnection and Access              soot oY) persons proposing {6 in’ st ing  os jiivestors ea can ‘obtain regulatory Certainty.          The Bill requires licensees who propose to construct a new tower, mast, tunnel, hole, pit, pole or  similar passive communications facility to consult with other potential users of the facility to allow  and encourage facility sharing.      Part VI— Competition   Part VI prohibits licensees engaging in conduct which has the purpose, effect, or is likely to have the   effect, of reducing competition in a communications market: This Part includes examples of such   conduct to assist licensees to assess whether their conduct may breach the prohibition.   Conduct can be exempted from the prohibition if the Commission is satisfied that the conduct will  promote efficiency. | .   To minimise the need for expensive and difficult proceedings to eriforce the prohibition, the  Commission will be entitled to serve a notice of contravention on a licensee specifying the anti-  competitive conduct and requiring the licensee to cease that conduct and pay the specified penalty.  The Commission may not take enforcement action against a licensee that complies with the terms of a  notice of contravention. : . C ,   Part VI also provides protections against industry consolidation. Licensees may not acquire an interest   in another licensee without the Commission’s consent, which may be withheld if the Commission  considers that the acquisition would have the effect or likely effect of reducing competition ina  communications market. .   Part VI- Consumer Protection and Price Regulation   Part VII imposes transparency requirements, minimum standards and price regulation to promote  .access to and confidence in communications services.      A jicenses: must file details of their wholesale and retail prices with the. Commission and publish on its   ; website the prices and conditions for its. communications s services. Licenses must not discriminate woe   :, between consumers rs except where commercially stified. .            * Part VII empowers the Commission to make rules specifying technic oT   ” and for customer equipment to be attached to licensees’ communications networks    Part EX- National resources management   Part IX deals with the management and allocation of radiocommunications spectrum and numbering  for communications services,   The Commission is granted the exclusive power to plan, manage, allocate and control the use of all  _radio spectrum frequencies in the Republic of Kiribati. The Commission is required to prepare  spectrum plans, frequency allocation plans and radiocommunications rules which will govern  spectrum management and radiocommunications licensing, monitoring of the use of radio spectrum,  and certification of certain users of radio frequency transmitting devices.   The Commission i required to make numbering rules specifying a numbering plan for  communications services, the assignment of numbers for emergency services, and requirements for the  allocation of priority and quality of capacity for calls to emergency services. The Commission may  make also numbering rules providing for number portability if it considers-the benefits of portability  outweigh the costs.   Licensees providing voice communications services to subscribers must provide access to emergency  services numbers free of charge.   Part X— Universal Access   Part X reflects the Government’s commitment to introduce a universal service regime to ensure  communications services are available, to the greatest extent feasible, to all of the people of Kiribati.   This Part establishes a Universal Access Advisory Committee to undertake public consultation on and  advise the Commission in developing Universal Access Plans. The Commission must consider the  recommendations of the Committee and publish Universal Access Plans to promote the availability of  communications services in Kiribati.- The Commission. imay then develop project Jans to address tt the  Universal Access Plans.       u appoint ns pestors £ for the} purpose of verifying’ compliance ‘with the Act and delivering instruments of  the Corumission, Tnspectors have the power to enter and inspect premises and networks i in a furtherance      ”   of their inspection duties. In circumstances where an Inspector is refused access to a-premises the Bill   provides that a magistrate may issue an Inspector a warrant granting access. —      The Commission also has a general power to require a person to submit information to the   Comission which the Commission considers it necessary for the fulfilment of its duties. The   Commission may also require the attendance and examination of witnesses.   Licensees operating a communications network may be obliged to intercept or disclose a a   communication or customer information in connection with the investigation of serious criminal   offences, Licensees must ensure their networks are capable of providing such interception.  *   Part XIM— Offences and Penalties   Part XII sets out general offences and penalties under the Bill.   it is an offence under the Bill to:  a) own or operate a communications network or provide a communications service without a licence; -   b) breach the interconnection, access and competition provisions of the Bill; (   c) breach the conditions of a licence issued under the Bill;   d) makes fraudulent or improper use of a communications network or service;   e) except as provided for under the Bill, intercept, modify or disclose a message sent by means ofa   communications network or service;  f) makes a false or fraudulent distress signal or unlawfully use or interfere with   radiocommunications, or use or modify equipment for this purpose; .   g) obstruct the delivery of a message or tamper with communications equipment belonging toa   licensee; and  h) contravene or fail to comply with any provision of the Bill or an instrumént made under the Bill.   Where an offence i is committed bya ‘corporation, a a director, officer, employes or agent of the   corporation who directed, authorised, or acquiesced in the commission of the offence shall be a party   foa and guilty of the offence. , ,                       The Commission is granted a general power to make rules necessary to give full effect to the  provisions of the Communications Act 2012 in addition to the matters for which the making of rules is  specifically prescribed. ,   This Part repeals the Telecommunications Act 1983 and the Telecommunications Act 2004 and  confirms that the Bill does not to apply to broadcasting services (except for the purposes of  radiocommunications regulation).

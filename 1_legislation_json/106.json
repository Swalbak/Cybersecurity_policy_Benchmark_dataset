The notification duty referred to in subsection 1 does not apply to public   telecommunications that is temporary in nature or otherwise of minor significance.                5   Further provisions on the type of telecommunications considered to be temporary or of  minor significance may be given by Ministry of Transport and Communications decree.   All identification and contact information of an enterprise, organisation or association  necessary for the purposes of supervision, as well as a description of the operations, shall be  entered in a telecommunications notification referred to in subsection 1. Ficora may issue  further regulations on the information to be submitted as well as the form and delivery of the  notification.   Ficora shall be notified of any changes affecting the information entered in a  telecommunications notification or if the operator discontinues operations.   If, for unforeseen reasons, a telecommunications operator or pay-television service provider  can no longer offer the communications service or other service agreed to with the subscriber  and does not follow the procedure for cancelling the agreement, the operator shall promptly  but no later than two weeks prior to termination of services notify the subscriber and Ficora of  the termination of services. At the same time, the telecommunications operator shall notify the  subscriber of the means available to save the subscriber’s messages.   If termination of a communications service referred to in subsection 6 is caused by  disconnection of a network service, the network operator under whose network the service  provider operates shall notify the telecommunications operator providing the service and  Ficora no later than four weeks before disconnection of the network service.     Section 5   Notification register   Ficora shall keep a public register of notifications referred to in Section 4.  Ficora shall provide confirmation of the receipt of a telecommunications notification within   a week of receipt. The confirmation notice shall indicate the rights and obligations related to  the concerned operations in Finland under this Act.       Chapter 3   Network Licence     Section 6   Telecommunications subject to a licence   A licence is required to provide a network service that uses radio frequencies in a digital  terrestrial mass communications network or in a mobile network practising public  telecommunications.   The above provisions shall also apply to a mobile network functioning as a public authority  network and operating in more than one municipality.   By derogation from subsection 1 above, a licence is not required to provide a network  service in a digital terrestrial mass communications network if:   1) the operations last no more than a month and the used television transmitter’s radiation  power does not exceed 50 watt; or   2) the television transmitter’s radiation power is so low, considering the location where it  will be used, that its operation will only extend to a limited area.                  6   Section 7   Announcing that a licence is available for application   The Government shall announce that a licence is available for application when frequencies  that are technically appropriate and appropriate for efficient frequency use become available  for the purposes of telecommunications subject to a licence in accordance with a frequency  allocation plan approved in a decree laid down pursuant to Section 95(3)(1).   A licence granted by Ficora, however, is not announced to be available for application.     Section 8   Licencing procedure   The Government grants licences for telecommunications operations in the meaning of  section 6(1) and for public authority network operations in the meaning of section 6(2) free of  charge as laid down in section 10.   If new frequencies that are technically appropriate and appropriate for efficient frequency  use are added to public telecommunications in a mobile network, the Government may decide  on granting a licence by auction as laid down in Section 11.     Section 9   Granting a telecommunications licence for temporary operation   A licence to provide a network service in a digital terrestrial mass communications network  is granted by Ficora, if the operations last no more than three months and if the radiation  power of the transmitter does not exceed two kilowatt.   Ficora shall grant the licence for operations referred to in subsection 1 if radio frequencies  can be allocated for the operations and there is no justified reason to suspect the applicant of  violating the provisions of this Act.   Ficora may grant a new licence for operations referred to in subsection 1 to the same  operator for areas with overlap of coverage, even partial overlap, at the earliest two months  from expiry of the previous licence.     Section 10   Issuing licences by comparative procedure   A licence shall be granted if:  1) the applicant has sufficient economic resources to meet the network operator obligations;   and  2) the licencing authority has no justifiable reason to suspect that the applicant will violate   the provisions of this Act; and  3) the licencing authority does not have weighty reasons to suspect that granting a licence to   the applicant would apparently risk national security.  A licence for providing network service in a public authority network shall be granted if the   applicant, in addition to fulfilling the requirements referred to in subsection 1, has the ability  and professional skills needed in regard to the special nature of the operation.                7   If a licence referred to in subsection 1 cannot be granted to all applicants due to the scarcity  of radio frequencies, it shall be granted to applicants whose operation best promotes the  purposes laid down in section 1 of this Act.   All information required by the licencing authority that is necessary to assess compliance  with the licence requirements referred to in section 1 shall be given in a licence application.   A decision on a licence granted by the Government shall be made within six weeks of the  close of the application period. In special cases the Government may extend the six-week  deadline by eight months at most if this is necessary to ensure that the application procedure is  fair, reasonable, clear and transparent or to supplement the information in the applications or  for other special reasons. Any extension to the deadline shall be announced publicly.     Section 11   Issuing licences through an auction process   The Government shall grant a licence referred to in section 8(2) to an enterprise,  organisation or association that has made the highest valid bid for the frequency band or  frequency pair in the auction, unless the licencing authority has especially weighty reasons to  suspect that granting the licence to the applicant in question would apparently risk national  security.   Practical arrangements related to the auction are the responsibility of Ficora. The auction  shall be unbiased, clear, open, non-discriminatory and technology and service neutral.   Provisions regarding the number of frequency bands and frequency pairs to be granted, the  maximum number of frequencies to be allocated to an enterprise and organisation, the auction  model to be used and the starting bids for the frequencies to be auctioned shall be given by  Government Decree.   The auction may be conducted using an electronic auction system. The auction may include  one or more rounds with ascending bids. All bids submitted in the auction are binding until the  end of the auction.   Ficora announces the auction concluded after a bidding round during which no new bids  have been placed for any frequency pair or frequency band.   The highest valid bid placed for each frequency pair or frequency band at the conclusion of  the auction wins the auction.     Section 12   Further regulations on the auction process   Ficora may issue further regulations on the process and procedures applied in the auction.  The regulations may relate to:   1) registration for auction and deadlines;  2) placing of bids;  3) raising of bids;  4) switching of bids between frequency pairs and frequency bands in a way that will not   lower the value of placed bids due to the switching;  5) definitions of eligibility in each bidding round;  6) definitions of the highest standing bid;  7) discontinuance or cancellation of the auction due to force majeure or other technical   reason;  8) other similar rules and technical arrangements of the auction.                   8   Section 13   Participation in the auction   An enterprise, organisation or association wishing to participate in the auction shall inform  Ficora in advance of its participation and pay a participation fee laid down in section 286.   Only one enterprise of a corporate group referred to in Chapter 1(6) of the Accounting Act  (1336/1997) is allowed to participate in the auction.   No cooperation concerning the auction is allowed between parties participating in the  auction. Prohibited collusion is considered to include:   1) agreements concerning the contents of the bids;  2) exchange of information concerning the contents of the bids during the auction process;   and  3) any other contact between the applicants with the aim to affect the process and result of   the auction.     Section 14   Openness of information in the auction process   The name and other information of the enterprise, organisation or association provided in  the auction registration are not public before the conclusion of the auction process.   The winning bids are disclosed after the auction process has been concluded. Other bids  made by an enterprise, organisation or association are confidential. During the auction Ficora  may issue the total amount in EUR of the bids placed on each round. The bidders are also  provided with the information on the number of bids made for the frequencies and the amount  of the highest bid in EUR.   Other provisions on the openness of information are issued in the Act on the Openness of  Government Activities (621/1999).   Notwithstanding secrecy provisions, Ficora shall, at request, disclose information referred to  in subsections 1 and 2 necessary for supervision and control to the Ministry of Transport and  Communications it has obtained while carrying out duties under this Chapter.     Section 15   Rejection of auction bids   If the effective control in the enterprise, organisation or association changes before the  licence is granted so that the enterprise, organisation or association no longer meets the  requirements for entering the auction laid down in section 13, Ficora shall reject the bid made  by the enterprise, organisation or association.   Ficora may decide to reject a bid made by an enterprise, organisation or association, if the  enterprise, organisation or association has provided fundamentally incorrect information of  matters significant to the auction or if it otherwise violates the provisions of Chapter 3 or  Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority regulations and, despite being requested to do  so, fails to immediately rectify its actions.   The Government may decide to reject a bid made by an enterprise, organisation or  association, if it has especially weighty reasons to suspect that granting a licence to the  applicant would apparently risk national security.     Section 16                9   Network licence terms   Licences are granted by the Government for a fixed period of up to 20 years.  The geographical operating area of the telecommunications operator and the network   coverage area may be defined in the licence.  The following terms may be incorporated into a licence:  1) requirements promoting the aims in section 1;  2) terms supplementing the requirements in section 243 or technical regulations of Ficora   specified in section 244 concerning the technical characteristics of communications networks  or the efficient use of frequencies;   3) terms that concern the amount of capacity reserved for a programming licence holder or  cooperation between programming licence holders in matters relating to capacity distribution  or electronic programme guides;   4) terms on the broadcasting technology or encryption of broadcasts;  5) terms regarding the obligation of a licence holder to eliminate any interference caused by   its operations to other radio communications complying with the regulations and to  compensate the affected parties for the costs they incur in the process of eliminating such  interference.   A network licence for providing network service in a terrestrial mass communications  network may be granted on the condition that the licence holder ensures that the Finnish  Broadcasting Company Ltd and a programming licence holder referred to in section 22 and in  section 3(1) of the Provincial Act on Radio and Television Broadcasting Operations (Ålands  författningssamling (2011:95), Åland Island Statute Book) obtain the necessary capacity for  operating the activity.   By means of the licence terms referred to above, the Government shall ensure that the radio  and television operators referred to in subsection 4 have access to the capacity necessary for  the operations in all circumstances.     Section 17   Amendment to the operating licence   A licence may be altered during its validity period with the consent of the licence holder or  otherwise if it is necessary for special reasons due to technical development, international  treaty obligations, or an essential change in the operating conditions of an activity subject to a  licence, change in market conditions or due to other essential changes.   The terms of an operating licence granted by the Government may be amended upon  application by the licence holder. The Government shall, before issuing a decision, inform the  licence holder of how re-examination conducted by the Government would influence the  operating licence, and allow the licence holder a reasonable time limit to withdraw the  application.     Section 18   Transfer of a licence   A licence may only be transferred within a group of undertakings in the meaning of Chapter  1, section 6 of the Accounting Act. Such a transfer shall be notified immediately to the  Government licencing authority.   If the control in the meaning of section 1(5) of the Accounting Act or the effective control in  respect of the licence holder changes, such a change shall be notified immediately to the                10   licencing authority. The Government shall decide on whether to cancel the licence within two  months of the notification.   The Government may decide not to cancel the licence if it is apparent that:  1) the requirements for granting a licence pursuant to section 10 have been met; and  2) operations continue according to the licence terms.  The licence holder may request the Government to inform in advance of the effect the   change in the effective control will have on the licence. The Government shall issue a decision  within two months of the application.   If a change in the effective control concerns an undertaking acquisition that in accordance  with the Act on Competition Restrictions (948/2011) has to be reported to the Finnish  Competition Authority, or in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on  the control of concentrations between undertakings (the “EC Merger Regulation”) has to be  reported to the European Commission, hereinafter the “Commission”, the decision has to be  issued by the Government no later than two months after the definitive decision concerning  the undertaking acquisition was made.   At the request of a licence holder the Government may transfer a licence granted by the  auctioning process referred to in section 11, provided that it has no especially weighty reasons  to suspect that the transfer might prevent competition or endanger interference-free radio  communications or apparently risk national security. The Government shall make a decision  within two months of the reception of a transfer application.   A network licence transfer referred to in subsection 6 may also apply to only a part of the  frequencies included in the licence. The licence holder shall explain in the transfer application  as to who would be responsible for paying the licence fee provided in section 287 after the  transfer.   All rights and responsibilities of the licence holder shall transfer to the new licence holder.  Along with the licence transfer the related frequency reservation referred to in section 44 or  radio licence referred to in section 39 shall also transfer in part or in full. The transferor of the  licence shall immediately notify of the transfer to Ficora.     Section 19   Cancellation of a network licence   The Government may cancel a network licence in part or in full, if:  1) the licence holder has repeatedly and seriously violated the provisions of this Act or the   licence terms referred to in section 16;  2) the licence holder with a licence referred to in section 6(1) no longer has sufficient   economic resources to meet its obligations in view of the nature and extent of the operation;  3) the network for which the licence was granted is not used for operations for which the   radio frequencies were intended; or  4) the licence holder has not started operations in practice referred to in the licence within   two years of the start of the licence period, unless the Government, following the licence  holder’s application, orders otherwise due to technological development or reasons of overall  economic conditions.   A further requirement for cancellation is that the network licence holder, despite being  requested to do so, fails, within a reasonable period of at least one month, to rectify its  conduct, replenish its economic resources to a sufficient level or prove it has started  operations.   The Government may cancel a licence if the effective control in respect of the licence holder  changes, except for a transfer within the same group of undertakings as referred to in  Section 18(1–2).                11     Section 20   Leasing of the right to use frequencies   A licence holder with a licence granted by auction referred to in section 8(2) may lease out  the right to use the frequencies referred to in the licence to another enterprise, organisation or  association. However, the licence holder continues to be responsible for the obligations  referred to in section 39 regarding a radio licence and the frequency reservation referred to in  section 44.   Leasing out the right to use the frequencies is subject to Government approval. Upon the  licence holder’s application, the Government may approve the leasing of access rights,  provided that it has no especially weighty reasons to suspect that the leasing would apparently  risk national security. The Government shall make a decision on the approval within two  months of the arrival of the application.     Section 21   Relinquishing the licence   A licence holder may relinquish a licence by informing the licencing authority about it before  the end of the licence period.   No licence fee referred to in section 287 for the remaining licence period shall be collected  from a licence holder that has fully relinquished its licence. The licence fee of a licence holder  that has partially relinquished its licence shall be reduced accordingly for the remaining  licence period. Licence fees paid prior to relinquishing a licence will not be reimbursed.       Chapter 4   Programming Licence for Digital Television or Radio Broadcasting Operations     Section 22   Digital television and radio broadcasting subject to a licence   A programming licence is required for television and radio broadcasting in a digital  terrestrial mass communications network excluding operations in which:   1) audiovisual content services or radio broadcasts can only be received in an educational  institution, hospital, hotel or similar institution, or   2) considering the number of programmes or the recurrence of broadcasts the provision of  audiovisual contents is not regular and not the main purpose of the service.   Pursuant to section 7 of the Act on the Yleisradio Oy (Finnish Broadcasting Company)  (1380/1993), the Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd has the right to carry out digital public  service television and radio broadcasting without a licence.     Section 23   Programming licence application procedure                12   A programming licence for digital television or radio broadcasting shall be applied for with  Ficora.

Ficora shall publish the information and notify the applicant that the matter has  been transferred to a competent authority. Within two weeks of the transfer, an applicant for a  licence may submit an application augmented by the planned programme content to the  Government.   If the licence matter was transferred to the Government for decision, the Government shall  resolve the matter within two months of the transfer. In special cases the Government may                13   extend the two-month deadline by eight months at most if this is necessary to ensure that the  application procedure is fair, reasonable, clear and transparent or to supplement the  information in the applications or for other special reasons. Any extension to the deadline  shall be announced publicly.   The Government shall, taking into consideration the television broadcasting of the area in  question as a whole, aim at promoting freedom of speech as well as safeguarding the diversity  of the provision of programmes and the needs of special groups of the public in a way that  best promotes the aims provided in section 1.     Section 26   Granting a licence for public interest television operations   The capacity needed for public interest television operations is prescribed by Government  Decree issued on the basis of section 95(1) to safeguard freedom of speech, the diversity of  communications and the multitude of programmes.   Ficora shall follow the procedure in sections 23 and 25(1) in granting a programming  licence for public interest multiplexes referred to in subsection 1.

Ficora shall publish the information and notify the applicant that the matter has  been transferred to a competent authority. Within two weeks of the transfer, an applicant for a  licence may submit an application augmented by the planned programme content to the  Government.   The Government shall grant a licence to the applicant who best meets the requirements laid  down in subsection 3 and section 25(1) and (5). The Government shall decide on the matter  within the time period referred to in section 25(4).   A public interest programming licence may only be granted to one undertaking of a group  referred to in Chapter 1(6) of the Accounting Act.   It is the licencing authority’s duty to oversee that the public interest programming licence  holder will have adequate terrestrial television capacity necessary for the broadcasting.     Section 27   Programming licence terms   A programming licence may be granted for a maximum period of ten (10) years.                14   A programming licence holder who has been granted a programming licence in a multiplex  for public interest television broadcasting shall meet the requirements regarding the diversity  of television programming referred to in section 26(3) throughout the validity period of the  licence.   The Government may incorporate terms into a programming licence that concern:  1) geographical coverage of audiovisual programmes;  2) daily broadcasting time; or  3) transmission technology and capacity.  The Government shall have the right to attach terms to the licence that relate to the   programme service and are necessary to safeguard the diversity of programmes and the needs  of special groups of the public.     Section 28   Temporary programming licence   Ficora shall grant a programming licence for short-term television or radio broadcasting  operations in a digital terrestrial mass communications network without following the  procedure referred to in sections 23 and 25, where there is no justifiable reason to suspect that  the applicant will violate the provisions of this Act and:   1) the operations do not last more than three months; or  2) weekly operations do not last more than eight hours.  An operator holding a licence referred to in subsection 1(1) may not be granted a licence for   successive three-month periods.  Ficora may grant a licence referred to in subsection 1(2) for a maximum period of one year.     Section 29   Amendments to a programming licence   The licencing authority may alter a programming licence during its validity period upon  request by or with the consent of the licence holder or otherwise if it is necessary for special  reasons due to technical development, international treaty obligations, an essential change in  the operating conditions of an activity subject to a licence, changes in market conditions or  other essential changes.     Section 30   Transfer of a programming licence   A programming licence may only be transferred within a group of undertakings in the  meaning of Chapter 1(6) of the Accounting Act. Such a transfer shall be notified immediately  to Ficora.   If the control in the meaning of Section 1(5) of the Accounting Act or the effective control  in respect of the licence holder changes, such a change shall be notified immediately to the  licencing authority, which shall decide within two months from the notification whether to  cancel the licence due to the change in the effective control.   The licencing authority may decide not to cancel the licence if it is apparent that:  1) the requirements for granting a licence pursuant to Sections 25 and 26 have been met; and  2) operations continue according to the licence terms.                15   The programming licence holder may request from the licencing authority to be informed in  advance of the effect the change in the effective control will have on the licence. The  licencing authority shall issue a decision within two months of the application’s arrival.   If a change in the effective control concerns an undertaking acquisition that in accordance  with the Act on Competition Restrictions has to be reported to the Finnish Competition  Authority, or in accordance with the EC Merger Regulation has to be reported to the  Commission, the decision has to be issued by the licencing authority no later than two months  after the definitive decision concerning the undertaking acquisition was made.     Section 31   Lapse of a programming licence   A programming licence granted for television or radio broadcasting ceases to be valid if no  regular activity in accordance with the licence has been started within six months from the  first date of the licence period or if regular broadcasting has been interrupted for a period  exceeding 30 days. Broadcasting can be considered to meet the licence requirements only if  operations are carried out in all the frequencies or regions to which the licence entitles. Ficora  shall notify the licence holder of the lapse. If amendments are made to a frequency block or  frequency band in the programming licence and no operations have been started within six  months from the entry into force of the amendment regarding the band that was amended, the  programming licence ceases to be valid in terms of the amendments.   If there is a particularly weighty reason related to the operating requirements, the licencing  authority may grant a permission to deviate from the provisions laid down in subsection 1.  The licence holder shall apply for an exceptional permit from the licencing authority before  the licence lapses.     Section 32   Cancelling of a programming licence   The licencing authority may cancel the licence in part or in full, if:  1) the programming licence holder has repeatedly and seriously violated the provisions of   this Act or the licence terms referred to in sections 27 or 37;  2) the licence holder no longer has sufficient economic resources to meet its obligations in   view of the nature and extent of the operation.  A further requirement for cancellation is that the licence holder, despite being requested to   do so, fails to rectify its conduct or replenish its economic resources to a sufficient level  within a reasonable period of at least one month.   The licencing authority may cancel a programming licence if the effective control in respect  of the licence holder changes, except for a transfer within the same group of undertakings as  referred to in section 30(1)–(2).   The licencing authority may cancel the licence in part or in full, if this is necessary due to a  change in the frequency allocation plan of frequencies allocated to operations subject to a  licence.   If the programming licence holder is declared bankrupt, the licence shall become invalid  immediately.     Section 33   Relinquishing the programming licence                16   A programming licence holder may relinquish the licence by notifying the granting  licencing authority before the end of the licence period.       Chapter 5   Programming Licence for Analogue Radio Broadcasting Operations     Section 34   Analogue radio broadcasting subject to a licence   A programming licence is required for radio broadcasting operations in an analogue  terrestrial mass communications network. The programming licence shall be applied for with  Ficora.   Analogue radio broadcasting operations that last a maximum of three months do not require  a programming licence. In addition, minor radio broadcasting operations in a limited area may  be carried out without a programming licence.   Pursuant to section 7 of the Act on the Yleisradio Oy (Finnish Broadcasting Company), the  Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd has the right to carry out analogue public service radio  broadcasting without a licence.     Section 35   Application procedure for a programming licence for analogue radio broadcasting   Ficora shall publish a notice declaring programming licences for analogue radio  broadcasting open for application, if there are open frequencies intended for radio  broadcasting subject to a licence pursuant to a Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority  regulation issued by virtue of section 96. At the same time, Ficora shall announce the time  period during which applicants must submit their application to Ficora.   The application shall include:  1) name, contact information and domicile of the applicant;  2) statement on the planned duration of the operation;  3) statement regarding applicant’s solvency and ability to carry out regular radio   broadcasting;  4) frequency or frequency unit applied for; and  5) statement regarding the planned coverage area.     Section 36   Granting a licence for analogue radio broadcasting operations   Ficora shall grant a programming licence referred to in section 34 to an applicant:  1) who has paid the application fee set out in section 285;  2) who is solvent and has the apparent ability to broadcast regularly according to the   programming licence;  3) for whom there is no justified reason to suspect the applicant of violating the provisions   of this Act.                17   If needed, Ficora shall consult with the Ministry of Transport and Communications and act  in cooperation with it.   If there are not adequate frequencies for all applicants that meet the requirements of  subsection 1 or if granting a programme licence could have a significant effect on the general  development of the communications market, the licence is granted by the Government. Ficora  shall publish the information and at the same time notify the applicant that the matter has been  transferred to a competent authority. Within two weeks of the transfer, an applicant for a  licence may submit an application augmented by the planned programme content to the  Government.  The Government shall decide on the matter within the time period referred to in section 25(4).   When declaring licences open for application and granting them, the Government licencing  authority shall, taking into consideration the radio broadcasting of the area in question as a  whole, aim at promoting freedom of speech as well as safeguarding the diversity of the  provision of programmes as well as the needs of special groups of the public as set forth in  section 1.     Section 37   Terms for a programming licence for analogue radio broadcasting   The licencing authority shall grant the programming licences for a limited time, for a  maximum period of ten (10) years.   The programming licence specifies the frequency block the licence holder may use to carry  out operations subject to a licence.   The Government may incorporate terms into a programming licence that concern audio  coverage area and daily broadcasting time.   The Government has the right to attach to the licences terms relating to the programme  service that are necessary to safeguard the diversity of programmes and the needs of special  groups of the public.   In addition, the provisions of section 29 on amending, section 30 on transferring, section 31  on lapsing, section 32 on cancelling and section 33 on relinquishing a programming licence  shall also apply.     Section 38   Right of the Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd to analogue radio network frequencies   It is the licencing authority’s responsibility to ensure that the Finnish Broadcasting  Company Ltd obtains for its public service operation the necessary radio network frequencies  granted to it by Government Decree pursuant to section 95(1) and that the company is able to  use them appropriately.       Chapter 6   Radio Licence     Section 39   Radio licence                18   A radio licence from Ficora is required for the possession and use of radio transmitters,  unless otherwise laid down in this section.   A radio licence for radio frequencies allocated to be used by electronic communications  services shall be granted within six weeks after Ficora has received all documents necessary to  resolve the matter. When granting a radio licence pursuant to so section 40, Ficora may extend  the six-week deadline by eight months at most if this is necessary to ensure that the  application procedure is fair, reasonable, clear and transparent or to supplement the  information in the applications or for other special reasons. Any extension to the deadline  shall be announced publicly.   No radio licence is required for the possession and use of a radio transmitter if the radio  transmitter functions only on the collective frequency designated for it by Ficora and if its  conformity has been confirmed in the manner laid down in this Act. Ficora may issue  regulations restricting the use of such radio transmitters if this is necessary to ensure the  efficient and appropriate use of frequencies and for the prevention or removal of interference.   Ficora may regulate that a written register notification that is valid no longer than five years  for the possession and use of a radio transmitter referred to in subsection 3 must be submitted.   No radio licence is required for the possession of a radio transmitter if the radio transmitter  has been permanently rendered technically inoperable for radio communication or if it is  otherwise evident that the possession is not for the purpose of radio communication.   Ficora issues regulations on the procedure by which approval as a licence referred to in  subsection 1 can be given to licences, other authorisations, or markings indicating the right to  use a radio transmitter, which have been issued by the competent authority of another country.   The Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard do not require a radio licence for  the possession and use of a radio transmitter for the sole purpose of military defence.   Police officers of a foreign State do not need a radio licence for the possession and use of a  radio transmitter to be used in pursuit referred to in Article 41, or in cross-border surveillance  referred to in Article 40, of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of  14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders signed at Schengen by  the Benelux countries, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic (Finnish  Treaty Series 23/2001).   Representatives of foreign States do not need a radio licence for the possession and use of a  radio transmitter to be used during a state or working visit if Ficora has been notified of the  possession and use of the radio transmitter and has been given the information requested by it  on the configuration of the radio transmitter.   Personnel of a foreign State as referred to in the Tampere Convention on the Provision of  Telecommunication Resources for Disaster Mitigation and Relief Operations (Finnish Treaty  Series 15/2005) do not need a radio licence for the possession and use of a radio transmitter to  be used in relief operations and disaster mitigation as referred to in the Convention if Ficora  has been notified of the possession and use of the radio transmitter and has been given the  information requested by it on the configuration of the radio transmitter and the intended use.     Section 40   Granting a radio licence   Ficora grants radio licences. The application shall include the information necessary for  processing the application as requested by Ficora.   If granting an individual radio licence could have an effect on the general development of  the communications market, Ficora shall consult with the Ministry of Transport and  Communications and act in cooperation with it. If granting a radio licence could have a                19   significant effect on the general development of the communications market, the licence is  granted by the Government.   Radio licences are granted for a maximum of ten (10) years at a time. However, a radio  licence for a radio transmitter to be used in providing telecommunications that require a  licence as referred to in section 6, a licence for a radio transmitter to be used for digital  television and radio broadcasting as referred to in section 22 or a radio transmitter to be used  for analogue radio broadcasting referred to in section 34 are granted for up to 20 years at a  time.   Ficora shall grant a radio licence to an operator that was granted a licence by auction  referred to in section 11 or a transferee of such a licence after the licence holder has paid the  first instalment of the licence fee referred to in section 287.   A new radio licence may be granted to an operator who has received a radio licence for  operations referred to in section 34(2) lasting no longer than three months for areas with  overlap of coverage, even partial overlap, at the earliest two months from expiry of the  previous licence.   A radio licence for minor radio broadcasting in a limited area referred to in section 34(2)  shall be granted for a maximum of one year at a time.     Section 41   Terms for granting a radio licence or frequency reservation   Unless otherwise provided in subsections 2–4, a radio licence or a frequency reservation that  meets the requirements laid down in section 44 must be granted if:   1) the licence or frequency reservation applied for pertains to a frequency band which,  pursuant to a Government Decree issued by virtue of section 95(1) or to an regulation issued  by Ficora by virtue of section 96(1), has been allocated for the use referred to in the  application;   2) it is possible to allocate technically appropriate radio frequencies within the frequency  band for use or reservation by the applicant;   3) the radio transmitter’s conformity has been confirmed; and  4) Ficora has no justifiable cause to suspect that the applicant will violate the provisions or   regulations concerning radio communications or the radio licence terms.  If there is an unpaid sum concerning the applicant’s previous radio licence or frequency   reservation that pertains to the same type of equipment as the new licence or reservation being  applied for, and the overdue amount is not insignificant, the licence or reservation may be  denied.   If the applicant aims to provide telecommunications subject to a licence as referred to in  section 6, to pursue television broadcasting that requires a licence as referred to in section 22  or radio broadcasting referred to in section 34, no radio licence or frequency reservation can  be granted unless the applicant has the necessary network or programming licence.   If only a proportion of applicants can be granted a radio licence or frequency reservation due  to a scarcity of radio frequencies, the licence or reservation shall be granted to those applicants  whose operations best promote the purposes of this Act laid down in section 1.   Applicants for or holders of a radio licence, as well as other telecommunications operators if  necessary, are obliged to provide Ficora with the information requested by it that is necessary  in making the licence decision referred to in subsection 4.     Section 42   Licence terms                20   Ficora may incorporate terms into the radio licence if these are necessary to ensure the  efficient and appropriate use of frequencies, efficiency of the communications markets and for  the prevention or removal of interference. In the licence terms, Ficora may further regulate  that the radio licence be kept in the immediate vicinity of the radio transmitter.   The licence terms for radio transmitters presenting a considerable risk of causing  interference may include a requirement that such transmitters must not be taken into use until  this has been approved by Ficora on the basis of an inspection. Ficora will issue regulations on  the types of radio transmitter deemed to present a considerable risk of causing interference and  will issue further regulations on the inspection procedure and on the adjustment of transmitters  and other comparable requirements to be met before approval can be given for taking the  equipment into use.     Section 43   Consulting obligation   The parties representing users of communications services and telecommunications  operators shall be reserved an opportunity to present their views on granting a radio licence  for general telecommunications, on a regulation issued by Ficora pursuant to section 39(3), on  a Government Decree issued pursuant to section 95(1) and on a Finnish Communications  Regulatory Authority regulation issued pursuant to section 96(1) prior to their issuance. The  parties representing users of communications services and telecommunications operators shall  be reserved an opportunity within one month to present their views on any amendment to a  rule, decision or regulation. Exceptions to the one-month time limit can be made in  exceptional circumstances. The consulting obligation does not apply if the proposed  amendments are minor and they are agreed upon with the radio licence holder.     Section 44   Radio frequency reservations   An application may be made to reserve the radio frequencies needed for use of a radio  transmitter before applying for a radio licence if this is justified for planning or  implementation of a radio system or if the acquisition of a radio transmitter necessitates  advance information on the radio frequencies available.   The frequency reservation is granted for a maximum of one year at a time. The frequency  reservation will expire if a radio licence is granted for the use of a radio transmitter referred to  in section 39.       Section 45   Granting a frequency reservation   Radio frequency reservations are granted by Ficora. The application shall include  information requested by Ficora and necessary for processing the application.   Ficora will grant a holder of a network licence referred to in section 6 or a programming  licence referred to in section 34 a frequency reservation without application upon validity of  the licence.                21   If the validity of a radio licence for operations in accordance with a network licence referred  to in section 6 and a programming licence referred to in section 34 expires while the licence is  still valid, the frequency reservation becomes valid again without an application.     Section 46   Renewal of a radio licence without application   Ficora may renew a radio licence without application by the licence holder for a maximum  of ten years at a time, if the licence holder has given written consent to the renewal.   Ficora may not renew a radio licence if the requirements of section 41 for granting a licence  are not met or the requirements of section 49 for cancelling a radio licence are met.     Section 47   Amending a radio licence   During the validity period of a radio licence, Ficora may amend the licence terms without  the consent of the licence holder if this is essential because of a change in the confirmed  allocation plan for a radio frequency, regulations on frequencies or international treaty  obligations, or if it is justified for the prevention or removal of interference in radio  communications or on the basis of the radio frequency band’s primary purpose of use.   For a network licence holder who has been granted a licence referred to in section 6(1),  radio licence terms can also be amended if this is necessary due to a change in the economic  or technical environment of the telecommunications operator or due to a new  telecommunications operator entering the market or other change in market conditions that  will necessitate a reorganisation of radio frequency use.   The terms of a radio licence may also be amended by application of a radio licence holder. If  a radio licence holder for an electronic communications service applies for an amendment to  radio licence terms, Ficora shall, before issuing a decision, inform the licence holder of how  re-examination would influence the radio licence, and allow the licence holder a reasonable  time limit to withdraw the application.   If the technology used in the provision of electronic communications services is not  specified in the licence, the licence holder shall notify Ficora of the technology to be used  prior to commencing operations. If the licence holder changes the technology used, it shall  notify Ficora prior to implementing any changes.     Section 48   Transfer and lease of a radio licence   A radio licence for other than network or programming operations subject to a licence may  be transferred. However, the transfer of a radio licence may be prohibited in the licence if the  use of the radio transmitter requires a proficiency certificate referred to in section 265 or if the  licence transfer would have a significant effect on the general development of the  communications market.   Such transfer shall be notified without delay to Ficora. Ficora may within a month of the  reception of the notice reject the transfer of a radio licence if it is obvious that the  requirements of section 41 for rejecting a radio licence are met.   Relinquishing a licence to someone to whom a licence holder leases out or otherwise  temporarily grants use of its radio transmitter is not considered transfer of a radio licence. In                22   such cases the licence holder remains responsible for ensuring that the radio transmitter is  used in accordance with the licence terms.   If the licence holder merges with another limited liability company as referred to in the  Companies Act (624/2006), the radio licence will be transferred to the receiving undertaking.  If the business activity performed by the licence holder and to which the radio licence pertains  is given up completely, the radio licence will be transferred to the receiving party. If the  holder of the radio licence is declared bankrupt and the administration of the bankrupt’s estate  notifies Ficora without delay that the estate is to continue the business activity of the licence  holder, the radio licence will be transferred to the bankrupt’s estate.     Section 49   Cancellation of radio licences and frequency reservations   Ficora may, in full or in part, cancel a radio licence or a frequency reservation, if:  1) the licence holder, despite the measures laid down in sections 330–332, seriously or   repeatedly violates this Act or the provisions, regulations or licence terms issued by virtue of it  in a way that is significant in terms of maintaining interference-free radio communications, or  significantly violates the obligation to pay for a radio licence or radio frequency reservation;   2) the licence holder, deliberately or through negligence, transmits a false distress signal  referred to in section 10 of Chapter 34 of the Criminal Code (39/1889), or disturbs or harms  safety radio communications in some other way;   3) the licence holder does not use the radio frequencies allocated in the licence and fails to  start using them within a reasonable time limit set by Ficora;   4) a radio transmitter uses radio frequencies in an inappropriate way on account of its  technical characteristics;   5) the requirements referred to in section 96(6) for the secondary use of a frequency band in  use of a licence holder are no longer being met;   6) a licence granted for television and radio broadcasting ceases to be valid;  7) a licence referred to in section 6 ceases to be valid; or  8) international treaties binding on Finland require such cancellation.  No separate appeal can be made against the decision setting a time limit referred to in   subsection 1(3) above.     Section 50   Decision on interference protection   Ficora may, upon application by a radio frequency user, decide on measures to protect a  fixed radio receiving station against interference if the decision can be made without causing  unreasonable economic or other damage to other users of radio frequencies in comparison  with the advantage to be obtained through the protection.   In the decision, which will remain in force for up to 10 years at a time, terms may be  imposed on the construction, location and use of the station being protected. The decision may  be cancelled or its terms amended if there is a significant change in the circumstances  prevailing when the decision was made.         PART III                23   IMPOSING OBLIGATIONS AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE     Chapter 7   Grounds for Obligations     Section 51   Market definition   Ficora shall define the relevant communications markets at regular intervals and carry out a  market analysis as laid down in section 52.     Section 52   Market analysis and a decision on significant market power   At regular intervals, Ficora shall carry out a market analysis of relevant wholesale and retail  markets in order to assess the competitive situation. A market analysis shall be conducted no  later than two years after the Commission’s Recommendation on relevant markets if the  market concerned has not been defined earlier, and at least at three-year intervals, if the  market concerned has been previously defined. The three-year time limit may be extended for  up to three additional years, if such request is submitted by Ficora to the Commission, and the  Commission does not object to the request within one month of receiving it.   In the case of transnational markets, Ficora shall, while conducting a market analysis, work  in cooperation with the regulatory authority of the State concerned belonging to the European  Economic Area, hereinafter “EEA State”.   By decision, Ficora shall declare an operator to be an operator with significant market power  if, on the basis of market analysis, it is seen in a particular market to exert economic influence,  alone or with others, that allows it to operate, to a considerable extent, independently of  competitors, consumers or other users. If an operator has significant market power in a  particular market, it may also be considered to have the same position in related markets if it is  able to extend its market power from the first markets to related markets and thereby  strengthen its market power in those markets.   Ficora shall amend a decision on significant market power if a market analysis shows that  significant changes have occurred in the competitive situation in the market. By decision,  Ficora shall remove an operators’ status in certain markets if a market analysis reveals that the  operator is no longer considered to be an operator with significant market power in the  meaning of subsection 3.     Section 53   Obligations imposed on an operator with significant market power in the wholesale markets   By issuing a decision accordingly, Ficora shall impose on an operator with significant  market power obligations referred to in sections 56, 61, 65 and Chapter 10 if they are needed  to eliminate barriers to competition or to promote competition in the relevant markets in  question.                24   The obligations referred to in subsection 1 shall be in correct proportion to the aim being  addressed, and in imposing them, the following in particular shall be taken into account:   1) the appropriateness of access rights in technical and economic terms, taking into account  the degree of development of the markets and the type of access rights;   2) feasibility of the access rights, taking into account the capacity available;  3) the requirements concerning data protection and information security;  4) the investment made and risks taken by the operator with significant market power;  5) the need to safeguard competition in the long term;  6) relevant industrial property rights and copyrights;  7) the provision of services at European level.  In its decision regarding significant market power, Ficora shall assess the impact the   obligations imposed on the operator will have on the markets.  Ficora shall amend a decision referred to in subsection 1 if significant changes occur in the   matters referred to in subsections 1 or 2 or in the competitive situation in the markets.     Section 54   Obligations imposed on an operator with significant market power in a retail market   If Ficora, following a market analysis, finds that no competition exists in that defined retail  market and that the obligations imposed on an operator with significant market power in the  wholesale market do not sufficiently promote competition in the retail market, , Ficora shall  impose, in order to secure efficient competition, by decision and where necessary, additional  obligations referred to in subsection 2 on the retail market operator with significant market  power.   In order to achieve the aim referred to in subsection 1, Ficora may order that an operator  with significant market power operating in a retail market:   1) may not charge unreasonable prices;  2) may not prevent access to the market or restrict competition by unjustifiably low pricing;  3) may not favour certain users in an unwarranted manner;  4) may not tie a specific product or service to other products or services.  Any additional obligation imposed shall be in correct proportion to the aim being addressed.  Ficora shall amend a decision referred to in subsection 1 if there are significant changes in   the competitive situation in the market.     Section 55   Obligations imposed on an operator other than with significant market power   By a decision, Ficora may impose on a telecommunications operator or an undertaking  referred to in section 57(2) an obligation to relinquish access rights referred to in section 57 or  an interconnection obligation referred to in section 62, as well as other obligations related to  relinquishing of access rights and interconnection referred to in sections 67−69, 72 and 74.  The imposition on the obligations can be based on other reasons than significant market power  provided they meet the requirements laid down later in the Act.   The obligations imposed shall be unbiased, fair, proportionate and non-discriminatory.  Ficora shall amend a decision referred to in subsection 1 if significant changes occur in the   circumstances that required the obligation to be imposed.       Chapter 8                25   Obligations to Relinquish Access Rights     Section 56   Obligation to relinquish access rights based on significant market power   By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose an obligation on an operator with  significant market power to relinquish reasonable access rights to a communications network,  or to an associated operation or service related to communications networks or services. Such  an access right may include the following obligations:   1) relinquish access rights to communications networks and network elements;  2) relinquish access rights to communications network capacity;  3) provide co-location and other shared use of associated facilities, including relinquishing   access rights to cable ducts, equipment facilities or radio mast antenna sites;  4) relinquish access rights to such associated services that allow the provision of a   communications network or service or that support the provision of services in such a network  or through such a service;   5) provide facilities for roaming on mobile networks and other services needed to  interoperability of end-to-end services to users;   6) offer the user the possibility to access the services of a telephone service provider  available in the telecommunications area via both a selection code per call and pre-selection  that may be overridden with a selection code, if necessary;   7) relinquish other reasonable access rights comparable to those referred to in subsection 1.  Ficora may impose time limits related to the obligation to relinquish access rights referred to   in subsection 1.  The obligation referred to in subsection 1 does not apply, however, if relinquishing access   rights endangers data protection or national security or if it is technically inappropriate from  the viewpoint of the operator or is otherwise unreasonable.     Section 57   Obligation to relinquish access rights based on other than significant market power   By a decision under section 55, Ficora may impose an obligation on a telecommunications  operator to relinquish access rights on other grounds than significant market power:   1) to another telecommunications operator of a subscriber connection or part thereof, for  parallel use of a subscriber connection or transmission capacity as well as minor equipment  facility if the operator controls user connections to the communications network and if the  imposition of the obligation is necessary to ensure the benefit to users;   2) to a digital television or radio electronic programme guide if this is necessary to ensure  that information on digital television and radio broadcasts covered by the transmission  obligation referred to in section 227 are made available to the public in an electronic  programme guide.   3) to a programming interface for a digital television or radio system if it is necessary to  ensure that information on digital television and radio broadcasts covered by the transmission  obligation referred to in section 227 can be connected to the programming interface used.   4) to a cable duct or radio mast antenna site or associated equipment facility if the  construction of a parallel cable duct or radio mast is not appropriate for reasons of  environmental protection, nature conservation or land use planning or other comparable  reason.                26   Ficora may impose an obligation to lease out a radio mast antenna site and equipment  facility referred to in subsection 1(4) and on the grounds referred to in subsection 1(4) on  another than a telecommunications operator, if the operator leases out the antenna site and  associated equipment facility to another telecommunications operator.   The obligation referred to in subsection 1 does not apply, however, if relinquishing access  rights endangers national security or data protection or if it is technically inappropriate from  the viewpoint of the operator or is otherwise unreasonable.     Section 58   Co-location and sharing   Ficora may oblige the network operator to allow sharing and co-location of a property for  other telecommunications operators if a network operator:   1) has placed a telecommunications cable or radio mast, related equipment, minor structures  or poles referred to in section 233 in an area owned or controlled by another;   2) has placed a mobile network base station, related equipment or cable in a building owned  or controlled by another party as referred to in section 233; or   3) has affixed necessary equipment to buildings and structures in a manner referred to in  section 236;   Ficora may impose an obligation referred to in subsection 1, if the construction and location  cannot otherwise be organised satisfactorily and at a reasonable cost. A further requirement  for imposing the obligation is that it shall not prevent or unreasonably restrict the network  operator’s own use.   In the event that the parties concerned do not agree on costs related to sharing or co- location, Ficora may issue further regulations on apportioning the costs.     Section 59   Own use or reasonable future needs   Notwithstanding any obligation imposed under section 56 or 57, the obligation shall not  apply if the object of the access rights is used by the telecommunications operator itself or by  an undertaking referred to in section 57(2), or if it is necessary for the reasonable own future  needs of these undertakings.       Chapter 9   Interconnection     Section 60   Obligation to negotiate   Interconnection means the physical and functional connecting of different communications  networks to ensure that users can access communications networks and communications  services of other telecommunications operators.   A network operator has an obligation to negotiate in good faith on interconnection with  another network operator.                27     Section 61   Interconnection obligations of an operator with significant market power   By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose an obligation on an operator with  significant market power to connect a communications network to the communications  network of another telecommunications operator (interconnection obligation). An operator  shall thus negotiate on interconnection with the other network operator under terms and  conditions consistent with interconnection obligations imposed on it by virtue of said decision.   In addition to the interconnection obligation referred to in subsection 1, Ficora may impose  an obligation to to make their services interoperablewith services of another  telecommunications operator to the extent necessary.   A telecommunications operator on which Ficora has imposed an interconnection obligation  shall comply with the provisions of sections 63 and 64 unless an agreement can otherwise be  reached on the content of the interconnection obligation.     Section 62   Interconnection obligations of a telecommunications operator   By a decision under section 55, Ficora may impose on a telecommunications operator:  1) an interconnection obligation referred to in section 61, if the telecommunications operator   controls user connections to the communications network and if the imposition of the  obligation is necessary to ensure the interconnection of communications networks; and   2) in addition to the interconnection obligation referred to in subsection 1, an obligation to  make their services interoperable with services of another telecommunications operator to the  extent necessary.     Section 63   Establishing interconnection   Interconnection shall be established at the point specified by the network operator requesting  the interconnection unless this is technically inappropriate or unreasonable from the  perspective of the telecommunications operator with the obligation to establish the  interconnection.   Interconnection shall be established as quickly as is technically possible.  The charge for the use of the telephone network of the network operator requesting the   interconnection that is collected from the telecommunications operator with the obligation to  establish the interconnection shall not be unreasonable.     Section 64   Interconnection of international telephone networks   International calls shall be routed to an international telecommunications service via a long- distance telecommunications service selected by the telecommunications operator providing  the international service.   All providers of public international telephone services shall provide access to all local  telephone services.                28     Section 65   Charge for the use of a telephone network   A telecommunications operator with an interconnection obligation shall specify a separate  price for the charges collected from another telecommunications operator for use of the  telephone network to form a connection where this connection is between the telephone  network of the telecommunications operator and the telephone network of another  telecommunications operator (call origination) and the connection is established:   1) to a toll-free number; or  2) to a service number or national subscriber number.  By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose an obligation on an operator with   significant market power to charge separately for call origination other than referred to in  subsection 1.   A telecommunications operator with an interconnection obligation shall specify a separate  price for the charges collected from another telecommunications operator for the use of the  telephone network to form a connection, where this connection is from the telephone network  of another telecommunications operator to the telecommunications operator’s own telephone  network (call termination).     Section 66   Prohibition on bulk discounts   The charge collected for interconnection of telephone networks shall not be dependent on  the amount of telecommunications transmitted.       Chapter 10   Other obligations     Section 67   Technical obligations related to the obligation to relinquish access rights   In a decision concerning an obligation to relinquish access rights and interconnection, Ficora  may impose on a telecommunications operator and an operator referred to in section 57(2)  such technical obligations or conditions on the use of the obligation to relinquish access rights  that are necessary for the technical implementation of the obligation to relinquish access  rights.     Section 68   Non-discrimination obligation   In a decision under section 53 or 55, Ficora may impose on a telecommunications operator  and an undertaking referred to in section 57(2) a non-discrimination obligation regarding the  relinquishing of access rights or interconnection.                29   Non-discrimination means an obligation to apply the same price structure (non- discriminatory pricing) or terms (non-discriminatory terms), which treats telecommunications  operators in similar situations equally. If a telecommunications operator or an undertaking  referred to in section 57(2) uses a certain service itself or provides it to a subsidiary or other  similar party, it shall also offer an equivalent service on equivalent terms to any competing  telecommunications operator.     Section 69   Transparency obligation   By a decision under section 53 or 55, Ficora may impose an obligation on a  telecommunications operator or an undertaking referred to in section 57(2) to publish relevant  information with regard to relinquishing access rights or interconnection, such as information  on service delivery terms, technical specifications, tariff information and agreements made, to  the extent that it does not include business secrets or confidential information.   If a non-discrimination obligation referred to in section 68 has been imposed on a  telecommunications operator or an undertaking referred to in section 57(2), an obligation to  publish a reference offer related to access rights or interconnection may also be imposed. The  reference offer shall be sufficiently detailed so that requesters of access rights will not have to  pay for products that are not necessary for the service.   Notwithstanding the information in subsections 1 and 2, if an obligation to relinquish access  rights to its communications network or part thereof, Ficora shall impose on it an obligation to  publish a reference offer. Such reference offer shall contain at least the significant information  related to relinquishing access rights.     Section 70   Accounting separation obligation   By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose an obligation on an operator with  significant market power to separate in its accounts regulated operations from the other  service provision activities of the telecommunications operator, if it is necessary for the  monitoring of the compliance with non-discriminatory pricing.   In its decision, Ficora shall itemise the products and services that are the objects of  separation, the information to be clarified by means of the accounting separation procedures  and the main features of the procedures.   The telecommunications operator’s auditors shall inspect the accounting separation  calculations and give a separate opinion on them to the telecommunications operator.   The accounting separation calculations and the auditor’s opinion shall be submitted to  Ficora.     Section 71   Pricing and other terms for relinquishing access rights and for interconnection   By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose obligations related to access rights and  interconnection pricing on an operator with significant market power, where a market analysis  in the meaning of section 52 indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the  operator concerned may sustain prices at an excessively high level, or may apply a price  squeeze, to the detriment of end-users.                30   The obligation referred to in subsection 1 above may include pricing of a regulated product  or service and price setting. Ficora may impose on an operator with significant market power  with regard to relinquishing access rights and for interconnection an obligation regarding:   1) cost-oriented pricing;  2) pricing based on a reduction of the retail price (retail minus); or  3) fair and reasonable pricing.  A cost-oriented price means a price that is reasonable taking into account the costs of an   efficient operation in producing regulated products or services. The prices available in  comparable competitive markets may be taken into account in defining the cost-oriented price.   If a cost-oriented pricing obligation referred to in subsection 2(1) has been imposed on a  telecommunications operator with significant market power, Ficora may also impose on the  operator of significant market power an obligation regarding the pricing of a regulated product  or service not to charge more than the maximum price set in advance by Ficora. A maximum  price may be set in cases where pricing against the pricing obligation would be detrimental to  said markets and the obligation referred to in subsection 2(1) would not be sufficient to  remove barriers to competition or promote competition in these markets. The maximum price  shall be set for a maximum period of three years.   The pricing obligations referred to in subsections 1–4 shall:  1) promote efficiency and sustainable competition in the communications markets;  2) create benefits for users of communications services:  3) be proportionate in relation to their aims;  4) support enterprises’ investments in the future; and  5) allow a reasonable return on capital tied to regulated operations.     Section 72   Pricing obligation not based on significant market power   In a decision under section 55, Ficora may impose on a telecommunications operator and an  undertaking referred to in section 57(2) pricing obligations referred to in section 71(2)–(5)  when relinquishing access rights or interconnection, if it is necessary to ensure the  relinquishing of access rights or interconnection.     Section 73   Pricing clarification obligation and cost accounting   If, under this Act or in a decision of Ficora, a cost-orientation or non-discriminatory pricing  obligation has been imposed on a telecommunications operator or an undertaking referred to  in section 57(2) or section 196, the operator has an obligation to prove that the price charged  for its product or service is cost-oriented and non-discriminatory when a pricing matter is  being handled by Ficora.   Ficora does not assess the compliance with pricing regulations retroactively.  In assessing the compliance with the pricing obligation, Ficora is not bound to the cost   calculation principles used by the telecommunications operator.  In assessing the pricing obligation, Ficora may, in an individual case, decide on the   maximum price to be charged.     Section 74   Cost-accounting procedures                31   By a decision under section 53 or 55, Ficora may impose an obligation on a  telecommunications operator or an undertaking referred to in section 57(2) to use cost- accounting procedures if this is necessary in order to supervise the operator’s pricing  obligation.   An operator may itself select the cost-accounting procedures it uses. The operator shall draw  up for Ficora a description of the cost-accounting procedures that show at least the main cost  categories and the rules by which the costs are allocated.   Ficora may issue further regulations on data gathered by means of the cost-accounting  procedures or on the description of the procedure. The regulations may relate to:   1) the information necessary to demonstrate a link between the cost-accounting procedure  and pricing;   2) the content and form of the description of the cost-accounting procedure;  3) the submission of the description of the cost-accounting procedure to Ficora.     Section 75   Supervision of cost-accounting procedures   An operator shall decide on an approved and independent auditor referred to in the Auditing  Act (459/2007) to inspect the cost-accounting procedures of the operator in conjunction with  the operator’s auditing process. The auditor must prepare a report on the inspection. The  operator shall submit the report to Ficora by the end of August following the end of the  operator’s financial period.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the type of data and material that needs to be  included in the auditor’s report. The regulations may relate to:   1) general information about the operator to be audited, and the auditing method;  2) material that shall be audited;  3) criteria for determining whether the operator meets the obligations imposed on its   activities;  4) attachments to the auditor’s report;  Ficora shall publish an annual report on how operators have complied with the cost-  accounting procedures.     Section 76   Obligation for functional separation   By a decision under section 53, Ficora may impose an obligation on an operator with  significant market power to separate an operational entity from other business activities of the  telecommunications operator if important and persisting market failures have been identified  in the market of the network service concerned and if the obligations referred to in section 53  have not had an impact on the competitive situation in the market.   The new operational entity created as a result of separation shall supply its services both to  its parent undertaking and to competing telecommunications operators under the same non- discriminatory conditions.   Ficora shall, prior to imposing an obligation for functional separation, submit a fully  reasoned draft proposal to the Commission that shall include at least the following:   1) evidence on important and persisting market failures in the market concerned;  2) evidence demonstrating that the obligations referred to in section 53 have not had an   impact on the competitive situation in the market;                32   3) a reasoned assessment that there is no or little prospect of change in the competitive  situation in the market within a reasonable time-frame;   4) an analysis of the impact of the obligation on the communications market and on the  telecommunications operator subject to it;   5) a clarification on the exact content of the separation obligation;  6) a list of products and services subject to the separation obligation;  7) a clarification on matters related to the independency of the personnel of the new   operational entity and the supervision of the telecommunications operator.     Section 77   Obligation to notify a change in ownership   An operator with significant market power shall inform Ficora in advance and in a timely  manner of any intention to transfer its local access network or a substantial part thereof to a  separate business entity it has established or to a separate legal entity under different  ownership.   Ficora shall, after having received a notification, perform a new market analysis in the  meaning of section 52 in the market related to the communications network concerned if the  transaction has a significant impact on the market concerned.     Section 78   Deposit and security   A telecommunications operator may demand a reasonable deposit or security from another  telecommunications operator for relinquishing access rights or for charges paid for  interconnection.     Section 79   Collection of telecommunications fees   A telecommunications operator that has entered into a subscriber connection agreement, and  on which an interconnection obligation referred to in section 61 or 62 has been imposed, has  an obligation to collect the payments of the telecommunications operator providing the  communications service at a cost-oriented and non-discriminatory price or to supply to the  operator the information necessary for fee collection, as determined by the operator providing  the communications service. A reasonable transition period shall be reserved for the  telecommunications operator that has entered into a subscriber connection agreement before  the telecommunications operator providing the communications service begins collecting the  fees.   Information on the subscriber connection number of the party liable to pay shall be  transmitted during the period of telecommunication. If the transmission of the subscriber  number is not technically possible, the telecommunications operator that has entered into the  subscriber connection agreement has an obligation to supply the information necessary for  billing to another telecommunications operator or, if this is not possible, to collect the fees  without a charge.     Section 80                33   Confidentiality of information between telecommunications operators   A telecommunications operator may use information on another telecommunications  operator obtained in connection with the relinquishing of access rights under Chapter 7 and 8  or interconnection under Chapter 9 and section 79 of this Act only for the purpose for which it  was given. Information may only be handled by those persons in the service of the  telecommunications operator who necessarily need the information in the course of their  work. Information shall also otherwise be handled in such a way that the business secrets of  another telecommunications operator are not endangered.   A telecommunications operator that causes damage to another telecommunications operator  by acting contrary to subsection 1 has an obligation to compensate any damage caused by the  action.     Section 81   Liability for damages   A telecommunications operator that deliberately or through negligence violates the  obligations imposed under sections 53–55 is liable to compensate damage it has caused to  another telecommunications operator.   Compensation for damage consists of compensation for costs, the price difference and other  direct financial losses caused by the telecommunications operator’s activities referred to in  subsection 1.   The compensation can be adjusted if full liability for damages is considered an unreasonable  burden with regard to the nature of the offence, the extent of damage, the circumstances of the  parties and other factors.   The right to compensation expires if the action for damages is not brought within three years  of the date on which the telecommunications operator received or should have received the  information on the damages.   In handling the action for damages referred to in subsection 1, the court may request an  opinion on the matter from Ficora.       Chapter 11   Procedure     Section 82   Consultation on market definition, market analysis and significant market power   Ficora shall reserve an opportunity for the Commission and the Body of European  Regulators for Electronic Communications to present their statements within a period of one  month before any of the following measures affecting trade between EEA States are taken:   1) a market definition deviating from the Commission recommendation;  2) a market analysis;  3) a decision concerning significant market power;  4) a decision referred to in section 76.  Ficora shall postpone the decision referred to in subsection 1 for two months, if the   Commission has notified that it considers the proposed decision to contradict European Union                34   law. Ficora shall within six months of the Commission’s notification cancel the decision  referred to in subsection 1 or amend the decision if this is required by the Commission.   If Ficora amends the proposed decision referred to in subsection 1 at the Commission’s  request, Ficora shall reserve an opportunity for the parties involved whose right or benefit are  affected by the decision to present their statements on the proposed amended decision. When  issuing a final decision, Ficora shall also take due account of statements referred to in  subsection 1. Ficora shall submit the decision to the Commission for its information.     Section 83   Consulting related to obligation to be imposed on operators   Ficora shall reserve an opportunity for the Commission and the Body of European  Regulators for Electronic Communications to present their statements within a period of one  month before a decision affecting trade between EEA States is taken by which Ficora imposes  obligations referred to in Chapters 8–10 on an operator with significant market power,  excluding a decision referred to in section 57(1)(4) or section 58 or 76.   If the Commission considers that the proposed decision of Ficora referred to in subsection 1  would create a barrier to the common markets, or if the Commission has serious doubts that  the proposed decision does not accord with European Union law, Ficora shall postpone the  decision for a further three months from the Commission's notification. Ficora shall in such a  case continue preparing the decision in close cooperation with the Commission and the Body  of European Regulators for Electronic Communications.   Within the three-month period referred to in subsection 2, Ficora may either amend its  proposed decision or cancel it. If Ficora amends its proposed decision or decides to keep the  proposed decision valid as such, the Commission may issue a recommendation concerning the  proposed decision or cancel its notification referred to in subsection 2. Ficora shall within a  period of one month after having received the Commission's recommendation submit its final  decision to the Commission and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications for their information. The time limit may nevertheless be extended if this is  necessary in order to consult the parties concerned.   If Ficora decides not to amend or cancel the decision despite the Commission’s  recommendation, it shall give reasons for its decision.     Section 84   Procedure in an urgent case   Market definitions, market analyses and Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority  decisions on significant market power or on obligations to be imposed on telecommunications  operators may be made without consulting the Commission and the Body of European  Regulators for Electronic Communications if the measure is:   1) urgent;  2) necessary to safeguard competition and the interests of consumers;  3) temporary; and  4) in correct proportion to the aim being addressed.  Ficora shall without delay submit the market definition, market analysis or decision referred   to in subsection 1 to the Commission and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications for their information.                    35   Chapter 12   Universal service     Section 85   Designating a universal service provider   Universal service means provision of public telephone services and appropriate Internet  access in a fixed location and provision of directory inquiry services and telephone directory  services.   Ficora shall designate one or more telecommunications operators, operators providing a  directory inquiry service or operators providing a telephone directory service as a universal  service provider if this is necessary in order to ensure universal service provision in a certain  geographic area. The designation procedure shall be efficient, unbiased, open and non- discriminatory. An operator with the best possible prerequisites to provide universal service  that meets the requirements shall be assigned as the universal service provider.   Ficora shall amend a decision referred to in subsection 2 if there are significant changes in  matters on which the decision is based.     Section 86   Universal service obligation concerning the provision of public telephone services   A telecommunications operator that Ficora has designated as a universal service provider in  public telephone services as referred to in section 85 shall provide, at a reasonable price and  regardless of the geographical location, a subscriber connection to the public communications  network at the subscriber’s or user’s permanent place of residence or location. The  telecommunications operator shall provide a subscriber connection within a reasonable period  from the order.   The subscriber connection to be provided shall allow all users, including those with  disabilities, to use emergency services, make and receive national and international calls and  use other ordinary telephone services.   Further provisions on the special needs of persons with disabilities shall be issued by  Government Decree. Prior to this, Ficora shall produce a clarification on those needs.   Ficora may issue further regulations on how the connection is to be implemented technically  or on what technical features the connection shall have in order to allow use by persons with  disabilities.     Section 87   Universal service obligation concerning the provision of Internet access service   A telecommunications operator that Ficora has designated as a universal service provider in  Internet access services as referred to in section 85 shall provide, at a reasonable price from  the perspective of the average user and regardless of the geographical location, a subscriber  connection to the public communications network at the subscriber's or user’s permanent  place of residence or location. The telecommunications undertaking shall provide a connection  within a reasonable period from the order.                36   The connection provided shall also allow an appropriate Internet access for all subscribers  and users, taking into account prevailing connection speed available to the majority of  subscribers, technological feasibility and costs.   Provisions on the minimum speed of an appropriate Internet access are laid down by  Ministry of Transport and Communications Decree. Prior to the issuance of the Decree, Ficora  shall, where necessary, examine the data transfer service markets, prevailing connection  speeds available to the majority of subscribers and level of technological development, as well  as produce an estimate of the financial impacts of regulation on telecommunications operators.   Ficora may issue further regulations on how the connection is to be implemented technically  or on what technical features the connection shall have.     Section 88   Other obligations and rights related to providing a subscriber connection   A universal service provider may also provide the services referred to in sections 86 and 87  through several subscriber connections if this does not cause unreasonable additional costs to  the subscriber and user.   A universal service provider is obliged to offer a subscriber who is a natural person the  possibility to pay compensation for the construction of a subscriber connection referred to in  sections 86 and 87 in several instalments. A universal service provider is allowed to refuse the  obligation only if there are reasonable grounds for refusal arising from solvency of a  subscriber who is a natural person.   A universal service provider has the right to refuse to enter into an agreement for a  subscriber connection referred to in sections 86 and 87 with a subscriber that is being  prosecuted or has been sentenced in the past year for disrupting communications using a  telecommunications operator’s subscriber connection or has outstanding, matured indisputable  debts incurred from the use of another telecommunications operator’s subscriber connection.     Section 89   Universal service obligation concerning the provision of directory inquiry service   An operator that Ficora has assigned as a universal service provider for directory inquiry  services and telephone directory services as referred to in section 85 is obliged to provide  users and subscribers access to a publicly available, comprehensive and reasonably priced  directory inquiry services or telephone directory services   A telephone directory may be in printed or electronic form and shall be updated at least once  a year.   Ficora may issue further regulations on technical measures necessary to meet the obligation  referred to in subsection 1.     Section 90   Universal service obligation concerning network service   A network operator that Ficora has designated as a universal service provider as referred to  in section 85 is obliged, at a cost-based price, to provide the service operator designated as a  universal service provider with a network service needed for connecting to a communications  network.                  37   Section 91   Obligation of a universal service provider to inform of its universal service obligations and  offer universal service products and services   A universal service provider shall effectively inform of its universal service obligations and  offer universal products and services.   A universal service provider shall publish data and information on its universal service  products and services as to ensure that they are easily available to subscribers and users.     Section 92   Monitoring of universal service prices   Ficora shall monitor the pricing of universal service, compare it to the general price level of  communications services and assess the pricing of universal service in relation to the general  consumer price level and income level of the population.     Section 93   Net costs of universal service   Net costs of universal service shall refer to the costs due to the production of a service which  a universal service provider cannot cover with the returns brought in by the service.   If it is evident that the provision of universal service constitutes an unreasonable financial  encumbrance to the universal service provider and if the operator so requests, Ficora must  calculate the net costs of universal service.   In calculating the net costs of universal service, Ficora is not bound by the information given  by the universal service provider or by the cost calculation principles of the operator.     Section 94   Cost reimbursement to the universal service provider   The part of the net costs constituting an unreasonable financial encumbrance shall be  compensated to the universal service provider from state funds, if the provider so requests,  taking into consideration:   1) size of the provider;  2) quality of the operations;  3) turnover of the operator’s telecommunications, directory inquiry service, and telephone   directory service; and  4) other elements comparable to those referred in subsections 1–3.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications shall make a decision on compensation of   the costs, referred to above in subsection 1, on the basis of the net cost calculation by Ficora.  Compensation with retroactive effect shall be paid for a maximum period of one year from the  application date.         PART IV                38   SPECTRUM AND NUMBERING     Chapter 13   Spectrum Administration     Section 95   Government Decree on radio frequency usage and on the frequency plan   The general principles on the use of frequencies referred to in subsection 3 are confirmed by  Government Decree. Technology and service neutrality shall be complied with when issuing  provisions on the use of frequencies suitable for the provision of communications services.   The Government may, in the Decree referred to in subsection 1, derogate from:  1) technology neutrality of network and communications services if this is necessary to:  a) avoid harmful interference;  b) protect public health against electromagnetic fields;  c) ensure technical quality of the service, common use of radio frequencies or the fulfilment   of public interest objectives; and  2) service neutrality, if this is necessary to:  a) ensure the safety of human life;  b) promote social, regional or geographical cohesion;  c) avoid inefficient use of frequencies;  d) promote cultural and linguistic diversity as well as media pluralism.  The Government Decree referred to in subsection 1 shall confirm the frequency allocation   plan:  1) for frequency bands intended for telecommunications activities that require a network   licence as referred to in section 6;  2) for frequency bands intended for television and radio broadcasting that requires a licence   as referred to in sections 22 and 34;  3) for the frequency bands referred to in section 96(5);  4) for frequency bands intended for product development, testing and educational purposes;   and  5) for frequency bands intended for public service television and radio broadcasting as   referred to in section 7 of the Act on Yleisradio Oy.  Before the Government confirms a frequency Ficora plan, an opportunity shall be reserved   for telecommunications operators, the Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd and other parties  representing frequency band user groups to present their views on the plan. The Government  shall re-examine the frequency Ficora plan if it is possible to assign additional frequency  bands for public service or activities subject to a licence as referred to in subsection 3 or if a  party referred to in this subsection presents a justifiable request for re-examination.     Section 96   Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority regulations on frequency use   Ficora issues regulations on the use of radio frequencies for different purposes, with due  consideration to the international regulations and recommendations on radio frequency use as  well as the Government Decree issued pursuant to section 95(1). The regulations shall contain                39   information on the intended use of frequency bands and on the most important radio-technical  characteristics required of radio equipment using the frequency bands.   Ficora shall re-examine regulations issued pursuant to subsection 1, if it is possible to assign  additional frequencies for the activity subject to a licence referred to in section 95(3) or if a  telecommunications operator or other party representing frequency band user groups presents  a justifiable request for re-examination.   When issuing regulations on the use of frequencies suitable for the provision of electronic  communications services, Ficora shall comply with technology and service neutrality.   Ficora may, in the regulation referred to in subsection 1, derogate from:  1) technology neutrality of network and communications services if this is necessary to:  a) avoid harmful interference;  b) protect public health against electromagnetic fields;  c) ensure technical quality of the service, common use of radio frequencies or the fulfilment   of general interest objectives; and  2) service neutrality, if this is necessary to:  a) ensure the safety of human life;  b) promote social, regional or geographical cohesion;  c) avoid inefficient use of frequencies; and  d) promote cultural and linguistic diversity as well as media pluralism.  When preparing the regulations referred to in subsection 1, Ficora must work in cooperation   with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. If a regulation concerning use of an  individual frequency band could have a significant effect on the general development of the  communications market, the frequency Ficora plan for the frequency band in question will  require confirmation by a Government Decree issued pursuant to section 95(1).   In order to promote common use of radio frequencies, provided there is justifiable cause,  Ficora may also permit other radio communications than those which accord with the purpose  of use for a radio frequency band assigned by a Government Decree pursuant to section 95(1)  or by a regulation as referred to in subsection 1 if these other radio communications would not  restrict use of the frequency band for its primary purposes nor cause interference in the radio  communications appropriate to the primary purposes.     Section 97   Special regulations regarding spectrum administration   This Act applies to radio equipment on board Finnish vessels and aircraft and in any Finnish  equipment sent into space, even when this equipment is not within Finnish territory.   Ficora issues regulations on the radio frequencies that can be used by electrical appliances,  other than radio equipment, that are designed to generate radio waves and are used for  scientific, industrial, medical or other corresponding purposes, as well as the conditions that  must be observed in the use of such appliances.   Ficora issues regulations concerning the construction and use of amateur radio stations as  well as other regulations to be followed in the amateur service concerning the frequencies to  be used, transmission powers, spurious emissions, addressing of transmissions and  unidirectional transmissions.   A radio licence whose granting provisions are laid down in section 40, a radio frequency  reservation referred to in section 44, a proficiency certificate referred to in section 265, a  certificate endorsement referred to in section 266, and a decision concerning a call sign of a  radio station by virtue of section 304(1)(5) may be signed using a digital signature.                    40   Chapter 14   Numbering   Section 98   Telecommunications areas   The division of Finland into telecommunications areas is decided by Ficora.  The division into telecommunications areas shall be appropriate. In establishing   telecommunications areas, special attention shall be paid to the amount of telecommunications  in different localities and its orientation, the technical structure of communications networks  and the most efficient use of numbers.     Section 99   Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority numbering regulations   Numbers and identifiers shall be distributed taking into account:  1) clarity and efficiency of numbering; and  2) international obligations regarding numbers and identifiers.  Ficora may issue further regulations on numbering. Ficora may order the type of numbers   and identifiers that may be used in telecommunications and the purpose for which they are to  be used. A Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority regulation on numbering may also  specify the geographical area of use for the numbers and identifiers.   Separate provisions shall be issued on Internet domain names.     Section 100   Numbering decisions   The numbers and identifiers to be issued for the use of telecommunications operators and  other persons are decided by Ficora.   Numbers and identifiers shall be distributed in a manner that treats telecommunications  operators and other persons as fairly as possible taking into account the nature and extent of  operations.   Ficora shall decide on the issuing of a number or identifier (numbering decision) within  three weeks of receipt of an application. However, if a number or identifier is of exceptional  economic value, the numbering decision may be made within six weeks of receipt of the  application.   In a numbering decision, the holder of the right to use a number or identifier may be  required to start using the number within a reasonable time.   A numbering decision may remain in force until further notice or for a fixed period  appropriate to the service being provided. In a numbering decision, Ficora may order that the  number be used to offer a specified service and it may impose other conditions on the use of  the number necessary to ensure the clarity and efficiency of numbering or the benefits of  users.     Section 101   Revocation of right to use a number or identifier                41   By decision, Ficora may revoke the right to use a number or identifier if:  1) the holder of the right to use the number or identifier does not pay the fee for the   numbering decision;  2) the use of the number or identifier is against the numbering decision; or  3) the number or identifier is not taken into use within a reasonable time after the numbering   decision or its use has been discontinued, or the holder of the right to use the number or  identifier does not rectify his conduct within a one-month deadline in spite of being requested  to do so.   The right to use a number or an identifier may also be revoked for another similar, very  weighty reason relating to the clarity and efficiency of numbering or to the interests of the  users, if the holder of the right to use the number or identifier has been given a chance to  present his/her view on the matter within a one-month deadline. A consultation is not  necessary if the operator holding the access rights has discontinued its operations or the holder  of the access rights has ceased to exist due to some other reason.     Section 102   Obligations concerning telephone number portability   A telecommunications operator shall ensure without delay that a subscriber who has entered  into an agreement with the telecommunications operator may, if he or she so wishes, retain his  or her telephone number when changing the telecommunications operator providing the  service. The validity of a fixed-term communications service agreement concerning the  telephone number shall not release a telecommunications operator from the number portability  obligation. In a fixed telephone network, a subscriber number specific to a  telecommunications area may only be ported within the telecommunications area.   A telecommunications operator shall not charge a subscriber for the porting of a telephone  number to another telecommunications operator. A telecommunications operator may,  however, collect from the other telecommunications operator a one-off payment if the  technical process of porting the number generates one-off costs. The one-off payment shall  not, however, be so high as to deter the use of the service. In individual cases Ficora may  decide on a maximum amount of the one-off payment.   The telephone number portability obligation referred to in subsection 1 does not apply to the  telecommunications operator when the porting takes place between a fixed telephone network  and a mobile communications network.   A telecommunications operator in a telephone network shall, for its part, ensure that users  have access to a public, comprehensive and charge-free information service giving  information on ported telephone numbers.     Section 103   Technical regulations on telephone number portability   Ficora may issue technical regulations on telephone number portability.  Regulations issued by Ficora may relate to:  1) telephone numbers that for technical reasons are exempted from the portability   obligation;  2) technical implementation of portability;  3) routing calls to a ported number;  4) organisation of an information service on ported telephone numbers;                42   5) other similar technical requirements for number portability comparable to those referred  to in subsections 1–4.     Section 104   Telecommunications in the European Economic Area   A telecommunications operator in a telephone network shall, for its part, ensure that calls  can also be made from EEA States to any non-geographic number in use in Finland wherever  this is technically and economically possible.   The obligation referred to in subsection 1 does not apply to a telecommunications operator if  the receiver of a call has restricted incoming calls from certain geographical areas for  commercial reasons.   Ficora may issue further regulations on technical measures necessary to meet the obligation  referred to in subsection 1.     Section 105   General international prefix   A telecommunications operator in a telephone network shall, for its part, ensure that users  are able to make international calls using the general international prefix 00.   Ficora may issue further regulations on technical measures necessary to meet the obligation  referred to in subsection 1.         PART V   RIGHTS OF SUBSCRIBERS AND USERS IN CONNECTION WITH  COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES   Section 106   Scope and peremptory nature of provisions   The provisions in this Chapter may not be deviated from using agreements to the detriment  of a consumer.   The following sections 118–123, 125(2–4) as well as 126, 134(1) and 135 shall apply to  agreements other than with consumers only if not agreed otherwise.   The following sections 108, 112, 118, 119, 121, 122, 128 and 134 shall not apply to an  independent communications service provided at no charge.       Chapter 15   Communications service agreement     Section 107                43   Agreement terms and tariff information   A telecommunications operator has an obligation to draw up standard agreement terms for  consumer agreements on communications services and to use them when entering into  agreements with consumers. The agreements shall not include any terms or limitations unfair  to the consumer. The terms of the agreement shall be worded in clear and understandable  language.   A telecommunications operator shall publish standard agreement terms and tariff  information on communications services and ensure that they are easily available to users  without charge.     Section 108   Communications service agreement   A communications service agreement between a telecommunications operator and a  subscriber shall be made in writing.   The agreement shall specify the name and contact information of the telecommunications  operator. The agreement shall specify at least the following:   1) the validity date and duration of the agreement and a possible renewal procedure;  2) the nature and features of the services and the types of maintenance service provided; in   Internet access services also the data transfer rate variation;  3) the delivery time of a communications service;  4) the procedure for giving notice to terminate the agreement and the reasons for   termination;  5) the sanctions for any error or delay;  6) how the subscriber is informed of amendments to the agreement terms;  7) the subscriber’s and user’s rights if the agreement terms are amended;  8) pricing basis or applied tariffs;  9) the subscriber’s right to obtain information on the calculation of the bill;  10) the subscriber’s right to complain about a telecommunications bill;  11) the sanctions for neglect of payment;  12) the telecommunications operator’s right to terminate the provision of a service or to   restrict the use of a service.  13) the spending limit referred to above in section 112(1) and consumer instructions on how   to monitor the accumulation of costs on the bill;  14) whether the subscriber connection allows access to emergency services and whether   caller location information is provided in an emergency situation;  15) information on any procedures put in place by the telecommunications operator to   measure and shape telecommunications traffic so as to avoid network connection overload;  16) information on how the procedures referred to in subsection 15 could impact service   quality;  17) types of customer services provided;  18) any restrictions imposed on the use of the terminal equipment supplied;  19) the subscriber’s and user’s options to choose whether or not to include his or her contact   information in a telephone directory and the data the subscriber wishes to include;  20) payment methods offered and any differences in price due to payment method;  21) the type of action that might be taken by the telecommunications operator in reaction to   information security threats;  In addition, the agreement shall state the right of the consumer to refer a dispute on the   agreement for the decision of the Consumer Complaint Board.                44     Section 109   Duration of a communications service agreement   A communications service agreement shall be valid until further notice unless otherwise  agreed.   A telecommunications operator may enter into a time-limited agreement with the consumer  for a maximum period of 24 months. If the telecommunications operator offers an agreement  exceeding 12 months, the consumer shall also be offered the possibility to enter into a time- limited agreement of 12 months.   A telecommunications operator shall not extend a time-limited agreement by another time- limited agreement without concluding a new agreement in writing with the subscriber.     Section 110   Network neutrality   An Internet access service provider may not restrict a subscriber’s or user’s opportunity to  use an Internet access service, except:   1) in a way necessary for implementing the main features of Internet access service quality,  data transfer rate variation or other services that are clearly and extensively defined in the  communications service agreement;   2) on the basis of a decision issued by an authority or court;  3) for the purpose of information security or to remedy an interruption in a way provided in   sections 243, 272 and 273 or in some other similar way provided in law;  4) for the purpose of meeting quality requirements referred to in sections 243 and 244.  The restrictions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of subsection 1 above shall be   implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and they may not:  1) restrict the intended use of an Internet access service;  2) prevent or restrict a subscriber’s or user’s ability to use the applications and services they   wish;  3) unreasonably slow down the Internet access service.  An Internet access service provider must ensure in service marketing and by other means   that the subscriber and user have access to adequate information about the essential effects  that the restrictions referred to in subsection 1 above possibly have on the use of the service.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the assessment of restrictions and procedures and  their use in safeguarding the availability and quality of an Internet access service.   Ficora may issue a decision obliging the Internet access service provider to:  1) undertake measures necessary to prevent the interruption referred to in subsection 2; or  2) refrain from measures and restrictions that will cause an interruption referred to in   subsection 2.  When issuing regulations and decisions in accordance with subsections 4 and 5, Ficora shall   take into account the general quality, prices and properties of Internet access services available  to users.     Section 111   Right to use an internal communications network                45   A housing undertaking or a real estate undertaking or a similar entity that, within a real  estate or between real estates, owns or manages a fixed communications network connected to  a public communications network is obliged to relinquish on non-discriminatory terms to a  telecommunications operator, which was chosen by a subscriber, access rights to the available  capacity of an internal communications network of a real estate or a group of real estates in  order to transmit communications services to the user’s terminal equipment inside the real  estate.     Section 112   Deposit, security and spending limit   A telecommunications operator or consumer may set a reasonable spending limit in euros  for the subscriber connection.   A telecommunications operator may require from a consumer a deposit or security for a  telephone network subscriber connection agreement only when entering into the agreement  and only for special reasons such as foreseeable insolvency or some other comparable  circumstance. The deposit or security may not exceed the total amount of payments expected  to accrue for the services provided before the telecommunications operator can bar the use of  a subscriber connection due to neglected payments.     Section 113   Tie-in sales   If a telecommunications operator combines agreements concerning terminal equipment and  network services at the time of purchase in a way that influences the purchasing price of the  items (tie-in sales), the operator shall also provide the subscriber with a similar  communications service without the terminal equipment.   Marketing material shall provide the information referred to in Chapter 2(12) of the  Consumer Protection Act (38/1978) and the total amount of additional costs to be incurred to  the consumer for tie-in sales.   A telecommunications operator may bar the use of another operator’s subscriber connection  on a mobile phone included in tie-in sales. At the request of the consumer the barring shall be  removed without delay once the subscriber connection agreement ends. The consumer shall  not be charged for the removal of the barring.     Section 114   Amending an agreement   The telecommunications operator may amend the terms, including payments, in a  communications service agreement valid until further notice to the detriment of the consumer  only:   1) on grounds specified in the agreement terms, assuming that the content of the agreement  does not change essentially as a whole;   2) on the basis of a change in legislation or a decision by the authorities;  A telecommunications operator also has the right to make minor amendments to the   agreement terms of a communications service agreement valid until further notice, provided  they have no effect on the main content of the agreement.                46   The terms of a time-limited communications service agreement shall not be changed during  the agreement period to the detriment of the consumer. The terms can, however, be changed  because of legislative amendments or decisions of government authorities.   A telecommunications operator shall notify the subscriber of any changes in the agreement  terms no later than one month before the amended terms enter into force. A  telecommunications operator shall inform the subscriber at the same time of his or her right to  give notice of termination with immediate effect if the subscriber does not accept the amended  agreement terms.     Section 115   Closure of a communications service or restriction on its use   A telecommunications operator has the right to restrict the use of a communications service  or to close it if the subscriber has not paid a matured payment for that service.   The closure or restriction right does not apply, however, if:  1) the matured payment is less than EUR 50;  2) the matured payment is for receipt of a service other than a communications service;  3) The matured payment is paid within two weeks of the date on which the request for   payment is sent;  4) the consumer proves that the neglect to pay is due to illness, unemployment or other   comparable reason beyond his or her control, and the matured payment is paid within one  month from the date on which a request for payment is sent;   5) the subscriber submits a complaint about the bill before the due date and pays the  undisputed part of the bill by the due date.   A telecommunications operator also has the right to close a communications service or  restrict its use if:   1) the subscriber is declared bankrupt or a public authority has found him or her to be  otherwise insolvent and the subscriber does not set a reasonable security;   2) the subscriber does not comply with the other agreement terms, despite a request to do so;  or   3) the subscriber or user has been charged with a disruption of communications using a  subscriber connection.   A telecommunications operator also has the right to restrict the use of a communications  service if the user exceeds the spending limit referred to in section 112(1). The  telecommunications operator shall inform the user in advance of restricting the use and shall  instruct the user on how to prevent the restriction.   A telecommunications operator shall have the right not to connect calls or otherwise bar the  use of such a communications service if it is evident that the service seeks unlawful financial  benefit and if fees resulting from the service accumulate on the subscriber’s communications  service bill.   The provisions in this section regarding a telecommunications operator’s right to prevent the  use of a communications service does not limit the operator’s obligation to restrict such use by  competent authority or court decision.     Section 116   Terminating an agreement   The subscriber may terminate a communications service agreement orally or in writing. The  subscriber has the right to terminate a communications service agreement valid until further                47   notice at two weeks’ notice. The subscriber has the right to terminate a communications  service agreement with immediate effect, if a telecommunications operator gives notification  that it is amending the agreement terms to the detriment of the subscriber. The subscriber shall  not have a right to terminate a time-limited communications service agreement if the  amendments result from changes in tax laws.   The telecommunications operator shall send the subscriber a written confirmation of the  termination notice.   A telecommunications operator shall cancel a communications service agreement in writing.  In connection with a tie-in sale, a consumer has the right to terminate the agreement as of   two weeks from giving notice of the termination, if he or she pays the costs of the time  remaining under the agreement as well as other costs agreed upon for such an event.   A consumer has, despite being party to a time-limited agreement, the right to terminate the  agreement as of two weeks from giving notice of the termination, if he or she has financial  difficulties due to sickness, unemployment or some other similar reason which cannot be  attributed to him or her, or if keeping the agreement valid is unreasonable for the consumer for  some other special reason. The telecommunications operator shall not charge the consumer for  the fees pertaining to the remainder of the communications service agreement period. The  telecommunications operator shall nevertheless have the right to reclaim terminal equipment  supplied in connection with tie-in sales.     Section 117   Cancelling an agreement   The subscriber may cancel a communications service agreement due to a defect or delay by  the telecommunications operator, if the breach of agreement is considerable. The subscriber  may cancel a communications service agreement orally or in writing.   A telecommunications operator has the right to cancel a communications service agreement  if:   1) the subscriber connection has been closed under section 115 for at least one month and  the reasons for closure still apply; or   2) the subscriber or user has been sentenced for disrupting telecommunications using a  communications service.   A telecommunications operator shall cancel a communications service agreement in writing.     Section 118   A delay in the delivery of a communications service and the right to refrain from paying   Delivery of a communications service is deemed delayed, if the service has not been  delivered at the agreed time for reasons that are not attributable to the subscriber or user.   The subscriber is obliged to make payments based on the communications service  agreement only after the connection has been made available to the subscriber. After the  service connection is available, the subscriber has the right to refrain from paying amounts of  the payment that are necessary to ensure compensation for the delay.     Section 119   Standard compensation                48   In a case referred to in section 118, a subscriber has the right to a standard compensation.  The minimum amount of the compensation is EUR 20 for each full or partial week of delay  but not more than EUR 160.   The right to a standard compensation does not, however, apply, if the telecommunications  operator proves that the delay is due to an obstacle beyond its control which it cannot  reasonably be expected to have considered when entering into the agreement, and the  consequences of which could not have been reasonably avoided or overcome.   If the delay is due to a person who has been of help to the telecommunications operator in  fulfilling the agreement or part thereof, the telecommunications operator is discharged from  liability only if the person in question was also free of liability in accordance with  subsection 2.     Section 120   Defect in the delivery of a communications service   Delivery of a communications service is defective if the quality or mode of delivery of the  communications service does not correspond to what can be deemed to have been agreed.   The delivery of a communications service is defective, if:  1) the quality of the communications service does not meet the requirements of law or   Ficora regulation issued by virtue of law;  2) the delivery of the communications service has been continuously or repeatedly   interrupted for a reason other than that referred to in subsection 2 and the interruption cannot  be deemed insignificant considering the reason and circumstances; or   3) the communications service does not match the marketing information or differs from  what a subscriber can normally expect from a similar service.   A communications service is not deemed defective, if a telecommunications operator  temporarily, without the consent of the subscriber interrupts the communications service or  limits its use for a total of not more than 24 hours per calendar month, if the interruption is  necessary due to a construction or maintenance work or for reasons of information security.  Interference to the user caused by the interruption must be in terms of its manner and timing  as minor as possible. There must be sufficient information available about the interruption.     Section 121   Remedying a defect   The subscriber has the right to demand that the telecommunications operator remedy a  defect or redeliver a defective performance without any charge to the subscriber. The  telecommunications operator is not, however, obliged to remedy a defect if this would cause  unreasonable costs or detriment to the operator. When assessing whether the costs and  detriment are unreasonable, special attention shall be paid to the significance of the defect and  the value of the performance if it were in accordance with the agreement.   Even if the subscriber did not require that the defect or defective performance be rectified,  the telecommunications operator may, at its own expense, do this if it offers to do so  immediately after the subscriber has notified the operator of the defect. The subscriber may  refuse rectification of the defect if it would cause considerable inconvenience or involve a  threat of uncompensated costs to the subscriber, or for another special reason.   The telecommunications operator shall not invoke the fact that it did not have a chance to  rectify the defect if the subscriber rectified the defect and if, considering the circumstances, it                49   cannot reasonably be expected that the subscriber would have waited for the  telecommunications operator’s rectification.     Section 122   Price reduction and standard refund   If the defect cannot be rectified or correct delivery is not possible or if such a rectification  has not been made within reasonable time after the subscriber has notified of the defect, the  subscriber has the right to a price reduction proportionate to the defect.   If a defect is based on an interrupted delivery referred to in section 120, the subscriber has  the right to a standard refund. The minimum amount of the refund is EUR 20 for each full or  partial week of interruption but not more than EUR 160. If a standard refund is paid to the  subscriber, the subscriber has no right to a price reduction referred to in subsection 1 for the  same interruption.   The right to a standard refund does not, however, apply, if the telecommunications operator  proves that the interruption is due to an obstacle beyond its control which it cannot reasonably  be expected to have considered when entering into the agreement, and the consequences of  which could not have been reasonably avoided or overcome.     Section 123   Liability for damages   The subscriber has the right to a compensation for damages suffered from a delay,  interruption or other defect in the communications service. The subscriber is entitled to  compensation for damages referred to in section 119 if the damages exceed the amount of  standard compensation paid.   A telecommunications operator is liable for consequential damages suffered from a delay,  interruption or other defect in the communications service only if the damage was caused by  negligence on the part of the telecommunications operator. Consequential damages include:   1) loss of income for the subscriber caused by the interruption, delay or by measures  resulting from them;   2) damages caused by obligations under another agreement;  3) significant loss in the operating efficiency of a communications service that does not   cause direct financial loss, and a comparable substantial inconvenience.     Section 124   Obligation to notify a defect or delay   The subscriber shall not argue a delay, if he or she does not notify the telecommunications  operator of the delay within a reasonable time after the service has been delivered. The  subscriber shall not argue a defect if he or she does not notify the telecommunications  operator of the defect within a reasonable time after he or she has or should have discovered  the defect.   Notwithstanding subsection 1 the subscriber may argue a defect or delay if the  telecommunications operator has been grossly negligent or dishonourable and unworthy, or if  the communications service does not conform to the requirements of law or a Finnish  Communications Regulatory Authority regulation issued by virtue of law.                  50   Section 125   Unlawful use of a communications service   A telecommunications operator shall close a communications service or prevent its use  without delay if the subscriber, user, the police, an insurance company or another  telecommunications operator reports that a smart card used in managing communications  service has been lost, that it is in someone’s unlawful possession or has been unlawfully used  and requests that the communications service be closed or its use prevented.   The subscriber can be held responsible for unlawful use of a communications service only if  the disappearance, unlawful possession or unlawful use is due to the subscriber’s or user’s  more than slight negligence.   The subscriber shall not be held responsible for unlawful use of a communications service  insofar as the communications service has been used after the subscriber or user has notified  the telecommunications operator as referred to in subsection 1.   If a smart card used in managing the communications service has been used in performing  transactions in a manner referred to in section 1(2)(6) of the Payment Services Act  (290/2010), the provisions of the Payment Services Act shall apply to subscriber responsibility  in unlawful transactions.     Section 126   Reopening a closed communications service   On the request of the subscriber, the telecommunications operator shall reopen a  communications service closed under sections 115 or 125 or remove a restriction on use as  soon as the restriction on the use or closure of the service is no longer justified.   The telecommunications operator has the right to charge a reasonable fee for reopening a  communications service or for removing a restriction on its use. The operator shall not,  however, charge for removing a restriction on use referred to in section 115(4).     Section 127   Obligation of a telecommunications operator to restrict the use of a communications service   A telecommunications operator with a communications network or its elements used by  another telecommunications operator to provide a communications service or which collects  fees on behalf of another telecommunications operator shall bar the use of the other  telecommunications operator’s communications service, on request, if:   1) the requirements under section 115 are met; and  2) the telecommunications operator requesting the barring is not itself able to bar the use of   its communications service.     Section 128   Joint responsibility of the telecommunications operator, service provider and seller   A consumer who has the right to refrain from paying or receive a refund, compensation or  other payment from a business operator due to the operator’s breach of contract shall have the  same right in relation to the telecommunications operator that has charged the consumer for a                51   commodity. However, the telecommunications operator shall not be required to pay the  consumer more than what it has received in payments from the consumer.   If the agreement about the commodity is terminated, the user may argue termination in  relation to the telecommunications operator that charged the fee for the commodity.   A telecommunications operator that has paid a consumer pursuant to this section has the  right to collect the amount paid from a business operator or telecommunications operator that  has an agreement with the business operator.     Section 129   Providing information on miscellaneous changes   A telecommunications operator shall in an efficient manner and in good time provide  subscribers with information on:   1) changes in numbering affecting the telephone network;  2) any procedures to measure the performance capacity of a communications network put in   place by the telecommunications operator in order to measure and shape telecommunications  traffic and to avoid overburdening a network connection;   3) how the procedures referred to in subsection 2 impact service quality;  4) details of products and services designed for persons with disabilities;  5) any changes affecting access to emergency services or caller location information.      Section 130   Obligation to publish information on service quality   By decision, Ficora may impose an obligation on a telecommunications operator or a  directory inquiry service to publish comparable and up-to-date data on the quality of the  services it offers.   The decision by Ficora shall specify the data to be published and the publishing method.       Chapter 16   Special Provisions Applicable to Public Telephone Service     Section 131   Automatic call forwarding   If a subscriber so requests, a telecommunications operator shall, at no charge, remove any  automatic call forwarding to the user’s subscriber connection that has been placed by a third  party.     Section 132   Subscriber connection identification                52   A telecommunications operator shall offer a calling line identification service for  identification of incoming calls prior to answering. It must be possible to prevent displaying  the caller’s number on the receiving subscriber’s telephone.   A telecommunications operator offering a calling line identification service shall offer  subscribers an easy way of barring:   1) identification of his or her subscriber connection;  2) identification of the subscriber connections of incoming calls;  3) reception of calls whose subscriber connection identification is barred, if this is   technically possible without undue cost; and  4) identification of the subscriber connection to which incoming calls have been forwarded.  The services referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of subsection 2 must be free of charge to   the subscriber.  A telecommunications operator offering a calling line identification service shall offer the   user an easy way of barring subscriber connection identification separately for each outgoing  call, at no charge.   A telecommunications operator shall notify subscribers and users of the services referred to  in this section.

Section 135   User’s right to restrict the use of a subscriber connection for purposes other than the receipt  of a communications service   On the request of the subscriber, the telecommunications operator shall, without  compensation, bar the use of a subscriber connection for purposes other than a  communications service and call origination to a specific traffic type if the barring is  technically easy to implement. If the barring is later removed on the request of the subscriber,  the telecommunications operator may charge a fee for doing so.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the minimum call-barring categories for call  origination that shall be provided to the subscriber, as well as regulations on the technical  implementation of call-barring services and on the provision of call price information.   A telecommunications operator has the right to bar the use of a service other than a  communications service if:   1) the subscriber does not pay a matured bill for the other service within two weeks of the  date on which the request for payment was sent;   2) the subscriber exceeds the spending limit referred to in section 112;  3) this is necessary to prevent misuse and damages.  The telecommunications operator shall notify the subscriber without delay about the barring   of use referred in subsection 3.                54   A telecommunications operator shall have the right not to connect calls or otherwise bar the  use of a service other than communications service if it is evident that the service seeks  unlawful financial benefit and incurs charges for the subscriber.           PART VI   CONFIDENTIALITY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY     Chapter 17   Processing Electronic Messages and Traffic Data     Section 136   Confidentiality of messages and traffic data   Parties to communication are entitled to process their own electronic messages and the  traffic data associated with these messages unless otherwise provided by law.   Radio communication intended for public reception and its traffic data may be processed  unless otherwise provided by law. The following is considered such radio communication:   1) television and radio broadcasting;  2) emergency calls;  3) radio communications using a public calling channel;  4) amateur radio service;  5) shortwave radio communications in the 27 MHz frequency band;  6) radio communications other than that referred to in subsections 1–5 intended for general   reception.  Other electronic messages and traffic data may be processed with the consent of the party to   the communication or if so provided by law.  Whoever receives or obtains in any other way knowledge of an electronic message, radio   communication or traffic data not intended for him or her shall not disclose or make use of the  content or traffic data of such a message, or the knowledge of its existence, without the  consent of a party to the communication, unless otherwise provided by law.     Section 137   General processing principles of a communications provider   Processing electronic messages and traffic data are only allowed to the extent necessary for  the purpose of such processing, and it may not limit the confidentiality of messages or the  protection of privacy any more than is necessary.   Electronic messages and traffic data may only be disclosed to those parties entitled to  process them in the given situation.   After processing, electronic messages and traffic data must be destroyed or rendered such  that they cannot be associated with the subscriber or user involved, unless otherwise provided  by law.                55   Electronic messages and traffic data may only be processed by a natural person employed by  or acting on behalf of a communications provider or subscriber for the purpose of processing  electronic messages and traffic data to perform the functions referred to separately in this  Chapter.     Section 138   Processing data for the purposes of transmitting communications and implementing a service  and ensuring information security   Messages and traffic data may only be processed to the extent necessary for transmitting  communications, implementing the agreed service and for the purpose of ensuring information  security as provided in section 272.   Communications providers and added value service providers shall inform subscribers or  users about what traffic data are being processed for the service referred to in subsection 1 and  how long the processing will last.     Section 139   Processing for billing purposes   Communications service providers may process traffic data necessary for defining fees  between themselves and for billing purposes.   An information society service provider may process traffic data received from a  telecommunications operator which is necessary for the billing of image recordings, sound  recordings and other fee-based services offered over a communications network administered  by that telecommunications operator, and any other data necessary for billing. Information  society service providers are entitled to obtain this data from telecommunications operators.   Billing-related data must be stored for a minimum of three months from the due date of the  bill or the saving of the traffic data, whichever is later. Such data must not, however, be stored  beyond the time the debt becomes statute-barred under the Act on Statute-Barred Debt  (728/2003). However, in the case of a dispute over a bill, the data pertaining to that bill must  be stored until the matter has been settled or resolved and entered into legal force.   Communications providers shall inform subscribers or users about what traffic data are  being processed and how long the processing will last.     Section 140   Processing for marketing purposes   A communications provider may, for the purpose of marketing its services, process traffic  data to such an extent and for such a period of time as the marketing requires if the subscriber  or user to whom the data applies has given consent thereto.   The party giving such consent must have the opportunity to cancel his or her consent  regarding the processing of traffic data.     Section 141   Processing for the purposes of technical development                56   Communications providers may process traffic data for the purposes of technical  development of transmitting communications or communications services.   Prior to the start of the processing referred to in subsection 1, subscribers or users shall be  informed of what traffic data are to be processed and how long the processing will last. The  information can be given only once.     Section 142   Processing for the purposes of statistical analysis   For the purposes of statistical analysis, automatic data processing may be used by a  communications provider for processing traffic data if:   1) the analysis cannot be made by any other means without undue difficulty; and  2) no individual natural person can be identified in the analysis.  Provisions of subsection 1 shall also apply to a subscribing legal person’s right to process   the traffic data related to its subscription and terminal device.     Section 143   Right to process data in cases of misuse   A communications provider may process traffic data for detecting, preventing or  investigating any non-paying use of fee-based services or similar cases of misuse.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the technical implementation of the processing of  traffic data referred to in subsection 1.     Section 144   Processing for the purpose of detecting a technical fault or error   A communications provider may process traffic data if this is necessary for the purpose of  detecting, preventing or investigating a technical fault or error in the transmission of  communications.     Section 145   Saving information on data processing   A communications provider shall save further event log information on any processing of  traffic data relevant to confidentiality and privacy security, if this is technically feasible and  does not cause unreasonable additional costs. This event information must show the time and  duration of the processing and the person performing the processing. The event information  shall be stored for two years from the date on which it was saved.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the technical implementation of the saving and  storing referred to in subsection 1.       Chapter 18   Special Provisions for Corporate or Association Subscribers                57     Section 146   A corporate or association subscriber’s right to process data in cases of misuse   A corporate or association subscriber has the right to process traffic data to prevent or  investigate unauthorised use of information society services or communications network or  service, or to prevent and investigate the disclosure of business secrets referred to in  Chapter 30(11) of the Criminal Code as provided in sections 147–156 of this Act.   Unauthorised use of a communications network or service may include installation of a  device, software or service in the communications network of a corporate or association  subscriber, unlawfully providing a third party with access to the communications network or  service of a corporate or association subscriber, or any other comparable use of a  communications network or service if it contradicts the instructions provided in  section 147(3).   The right referred to above in subsection 1 does not apply to the traffic data of telephone  services in a fixed or mobile network.     Section 147   A corporate or association subscriber’s duty of care in cases of misuse   Before starting to process traffic data and in order to prevent unauthorised use of  information society services or communications network or services liable to charge, a  corporate or association subscriber shall:   1) restrict access to its communications network and service and to their use and take other  steps in order to protect the use of its communications network and service with the help of  appropriate information security measures;   2) define the type of electronic messages that may be transmitted and searched through its  communications network and how its communications network and service may be used and  the addresses to which no messages may be communicated.   In order to prevent business secrets from being disclosed, a corporate or association  subscriber shall, before starting to process traffic data:   1) restrict access to business secrets and take other steps in order to protect the use and data  of its communications network and service with the help of appropriate information security  measures;   2) define how business secrets may be transferred, delivered or otherwise handled in a  communications network and define the type of addresses to which messages may not be sent  by people entitled to handle business secrets.   A corporate or association subscriber shall provide the users of a communications network  or service with written instructions on preventing misuse referred to in subsections 1 and 2.     Section 148   A corporate or association subscriber’s duty of planning and cooperation in cases of misuse   A corporate or association subscriber shall, before starting to process traffic data referred to  in section 146(1), name the people whose duties involve traffic data processing or define the  duties involved. Traffic data may only be processed by people responsible for maintenance  and information security of a corporate or association subscriber’s communications network  or service and by people responsible for security.                58   If the corporate or association subscriber is an employer that falls within the scope of  cooperation legislation, it shall:   1) discuss the reasons and procedures to be followed in traffic data processing referred to in  sections 146–156 in a cooperation procedure referred to in Chapter 4 of the Act on  Cooperation within Undertakings (334/2007), in the Act on Cooperation within Government  Agencies (1233/2013), and in the Act on Cooperation between the Employer and Employees  in Municipalities (449/2007);   2) inform employees or their representatives about the decisions taken regarding traffic data  processing as provided in section 21(2) of the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working  Life (759/2004).   If the corporate or association subscriber is an employer that does not fall within the scope  of cooperation legislation, it shall consult the employees about issues referred to in  subsection 2(1) of this section and inform the employees about them as provided in  section 21(1) and (2) of the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life.   If the corporate or association subscriber is not the employer, it shall inform the users of the  procedures to be followed in traffic data processing referred to in sections 146–156.     Section 149   A corporate or association subscriber’s right to process data for investigating unauthorised  use of a fee-based information society service, communications network or communications   service   A corporate or association subscriber may process traffic data with the help of an automatic  search function that may be based on the size, aggregate size, type, number, connection mode  or target addresses of the messages.   A corporate or association subscriber may process traffic data manually, if there are  reasonable grounds to suspect that a communications network, communications service or an  information society service subject to a fee is used against the instructions referred to in  section 147(3) and if:   1) a deviation in communications has been detected by the automatic search;  2) the costs of using an information society service subject to a fee have risen to an   unusually high level;  3) a communications network is detected to use an unlawfully installed device, software or   service; or  4) in an individual case, some identifiable circumstance comparable to subsections 1–3 leads   to the conclusion that a communications network, communications service or an information  society service subject to a fee is used against the instructions referred to in section 147(3).   A requirement for the processing referred to in subsections 1 and 2 above is that the event or  act would probably cause significant hindrance or damage to the corporate or association  subscriber.   A further requirement for the processing referred to in subsection 2 above is that the data are  necessary for investigating the unauthorised use and the parties responsible for it and for  ending the unauthorised use.     Section 150   A corporate or association subscriber’s right to process data for investigating disclosures of  business secrets                59   A corporate or association subscriber may process traffic data with the help of an automatic  search function that may be based on the size, aggregate size, type, number, connection mode  or target addresses of the electronic messages.   A corporate or association subscriber may process traffic data manually, if there are  reasonable grounds to suspect that a business secret has been disclosed to a third party without  permission via a communications network or communications service:   1) a deviation in communications has been detected by the automatic search;  2) a business secret is published or used without permission; or  3) in an individual case, some identifiable circumstance comparable to subsections 1 or 2   leads to the conclusion that access to a business secret has been disclosed to a third party  without permission.   The requirement for the processing referred to in subsections 1 and 2 above is that the  business secrets suspected to have been disclosed are of major significance to the corporate or  association subscriber’s or its cooperation partner’s business or to the results of technological  or other development work likely to be important for establishing or practising a livelihood.   A further requirement for the processing referred to in subsection 2 above is that the data are  necessary for investigating the disclosure of the business secret and the parties responsible for  it.     Section 151   Special restrictions to the right to process data in cases of misuse   An automatic search shall not be targeted and traffic data shall not be searched or manually  processed for finding out data referred to in Chapter 17(24)(2) and (3) of the Code of Judicial  Procedure.   In order to investigate the disclosure of business secrets, a corporate or association  subscriber that is an employer may only process the traffic data of users to whom the  corporate or association subscriber has provided access to business secrets or of users who  through some other means accepted by the corporate or association subscriber have access to  business secrets.     Section 152   A corporate or association subscriber’s obligation to inform the user in cases of misuse   A corporate or association subscriber shall draw up a report of manual processing of traffic  data referred to in sections 149(2) and 150(2) indicating:   1) the grounds for the processing, and the time and duration of the processing;  2) the reason for using manual processing of traffic data;  3) names of the processors involved;  4) name of the individual who has made the processing decision.  Individuals involved in the processing shall sign the report. The report shall be kept for at   least two years from the end of the processing referred to in sections 149 or 150.  A report referred to in subsection 1 above shall be delivered to the user of the   communications network or service involved as soon as it is possible without endangering the  purpose of the processing itself. No report needs to be delivered, however, to users whose  traffic data have been processed as mass data so that the processor did not gain knowledge of  the traffic data. Notwithstanding confidentiality requirements, the user has the right to submit  the report and the related data for the purpose of managing matters related to the user’s  interests or rights.                60     Section 153   A corporate or association subscriber’s obligation to inform the employees’ representative in  cases of misuse   If the corporate or association subscriber is an employer, it shall draw up an annual report to  the employees’ representative of manual processing of traffic data referred to in  sections 149(2) and 150(2), showing the grounds for and the number of times of traffic data  processing during the year.   A report referred to in subsection 1 above shall be delivered to a local union representative  elected under a collective agreement or a collective agreement for civil servants, or, if no local  union representative has been elected, to elected representatives referred to in Chapter 13(3) of  the Employment Contracts Act (55/2001). If the employees of a personnel group have not  elected a representative or a local union representative, the report shall be delivered to a  cooperation representative referred to in section 8 of the Act on Cooperation within  Undertakings, or to a cooperation representative referred to in section 3 of the Act on  Cooperation between the Employer and Employees in Municipalities, or to a representative  referred to in section 6(2) of the Act on Cooperation within Government Agencies. If these  have not been elected either, the report shall be delivered to all employees of the personnel  group in question.   Employee representatives and employees referred to in subsection 2 shall treat any business  secret infringements and suspected business secret infringements brought to their attention as  confidential throughout their employment relationship. The provisions laid down in the Act on  the Openness of Government Activities and elsewhere in law shall apply to secrecy obligation  of public servants. Notwithstanding the provisions above, information may be disclosed to the  supervision authorities.     Section 154   Prior notification and annual report to the Data Protection Ombudsman in cases of misuse   A corporate or association subscriber shall inform the Data Protection Ombudsman in  advance of processing traffic data. A prior notification shall explain:   1) the grounds and procedures for the measures to be followed in processing traffic data  referred to in sections 149 and 150;   2) the duties referred to in section 148(1);  3) the way in which the corporate or association subscriber has met its obligation to provide   information before the processing referred to in section 148(2)(2) or (3).  A corporate or association subscriber shall inform the Data Protection Ombudsman annually   of manual processing of traffic data after the processing has taken place. The report shall  reveal the grounds for and the number of times of traffic data processing during the year.     Section 155   A corporate or association subscriber’s right to store traffic data in cases of misuse   Provisions of sections 146–154 do not provide a corporate or association subscriber the right  to store traffic data in its registers longer than laid down in law.     Section 156                61   A corporate or association subscriber’s right to forward data in cases of misuse   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 137, a corporate or association subscriber has the  right, in connection with a report of an offence or a request for an investigation it has filed as  an injured party, to forward to the police for investigation traffic data regarding the electronic  messages of a user of a corporate or association subscriber’s communications network or  service that has been received in accordance with sections 146–155.         Chapter 19   Information Related to Authorities     Section 157   Obligation to store data for the purposes of the authorities   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Part concerning the processing of traffic data, an  undertaking designated by a separate decision of the Ministry of the Interior that has submitted  a telecommunications notification (operator under the retention obligation) shall ensure,  under the conditions prescribed below, that data under the retention obligation as referred to in  subsections 2 and 3 are retained in accordance with retention times laid down in subsection 4.  Data to be retained may be used only for the purposes of solving and considering charges for  criminal acts referred to in Chapter 10(6)(2) of the Coercive Measures Act (806/2011).   The retention obligation applies to data related to:  1) a telephone service or SMS service provided by an operator under the retention obligation   including calls for which a connection has been established but the call remains unanswered or  is prevented from being connected due to network management measures;   2) Internet telephone service provided by an operator under the retention obligation,  meaning service provided by a service operator enabling calls that are based on Internet  protocol through to the end customer;   3) Internet access service provided by an operator under the retention obligation;  In services referred to in subsection 2(1 and 2) above the retention obligation applies to the   name and address of a registered user or a subscriber, subscription identifier and data that can  be used to identify a communications service user or communications, including call transfers,  according to the type, receiver, time and duration of communications. With regard to service  referred to in subsection 2(1) the retention obligation applies to data that can be used to  identify the device used and the location of the device and the subscriber connection it uses in  the beginning of communications. With regard to the service referred to in subsection 2(3)  above the retention obligation applies to the name and address of a subscriber and registered  user, subscription identifier, installation address, and data that can be used to identify the  communications service user, the device used in communications and the time and duration of  the service. The data to be retained must be limited to what is necessary for identifying the  facts referred to above in this section, with due consideration to the technical implementation  of the service   The data of the services referred to above in subsection 2(1) must be retained for 12 months,  the data of the services referred to in subsection 2(3) for 9 months and the data of the services  referred to in subsection 2(2) for 6 months. The data retention time starts with the time of the  communications.                62   The retention obligation does not apply to the contents of a message or traffic data generated  through the browsing of websites.   A requirement for the retention obligation is that the data are available and generated or  processed in connection with publicly available communications services provided on the  basis of this Act or the provisions of the Personal Data Act (523/1999).   Further provisions on a more specific definition of data under the retention obligation may  be issued by Government Decree.   Technical details of data under the retention obligation are defined in a Finnish  Communications Regulatory Authority regulation.     Section 158   Obligations and procedures for processing data retained for the purposes of the authorities   Before implementing the retention obligation, an operator under the retention obligation  shall discuss with the Ministry of the Interior the needs of the authorities concerning data  retention. The operator under retention obligation decides on the technical implementation of  the retention. The implementation shall follow the principles of cost-efficiency. In addition,  the business needs of the operator under the retention obligation, the technical features of the  systems, and the needs of the authority paying for the costs for the retention should be  considered. Data should be retained in such a way as to avoid the same data being retained by  several undertakings.   The Ministry of the Interior has the right to acquire from an external service provider a  system to which the data in this group can be transferred. An operator under the retention  obligation has the right to store information that has not yet been completely processed for its  own use.   Section 247 shall apply to the obligation of an operator under the retention obligation to  ensure information security. An operator under the retention obligation shall name the persons  entitled to process data to be retained or duties involving their processing. An operator under  the retention obligation shall ensure that information about data retention and its purposes is  available to the subscriber.   It must be ensured that the data retained can be transmitted to the authorities entitled to it  without undue delay. An operator under the retention obligation shall, together with a network  operator if necessary, ensure that the obligation is met in such a way that the available data  referred to in section 157 processed by the network operator in providing the service of the  operator under the retention obligation shall be retained.   Further provisions on meeting the retention obligation may be given by Government Decree.  Further provisions on information security and the technical details of data retention may be   given by Ficora.     Section 159   Statistics concerning the use of data to be retained for the purposes of the authorities   The Ministry of the Interior shall provide the Parliamentary Ombudsman on a yearly basis  with statistics on using data retained by virtue of this Act. The statistics shall include:   1) the cases in which retained data were provided to the authorities;  2) the cases where the authorities’ requests for retained data could not be met;  3) the time elapsed between the date on which the data were retained and the date on which   the authorities requested for the data.                63   The Ministry of the Interior shall also take the statistics referred to in subsection above into  account in its reports about telecommunications interception and monitoring to the  Parliamentary Ombudsman by virtue of the Police Act (872/2011), Coercive Measures Act or  any other Act.       Chapter 20   Location Data and Other Subscriber Connection or Terminal Device Location Data   Section 160   Processing and disclosure of location data   Location data that can be associated with a natural person may be processed for the purpose  of offering and using added value services, provided the subscriber or user to whom the data  pertain has given consent or unless such consent is unambiguously implied from the context  or otherwise provided by law.   The consent referred to in subsection 1 above shall not constitute derogation from other  provisions on a user’s or subscriber’s right to obtain location data.   Location data may only be processed in the extent required by the purpose of the processing  and it may not limit the protection of privacy any more than is necessary. After processing the  location data must be destroyed or rendered such that they cannot be association with the  subscriber or user involved, unless otherwise provided by law.   Persons employed by added value service providers and anyone acting on their behalf may  process location data subject to the provisions of this Chapter.   Whoever receives or obtains in any other way knowledge of location data not intended for  him or her shall not disclose or make use of the data, or the knowledge of its existence,  without the consent of the party to whom the data applies, unless otherwise provided by law.      Section 161   Obligation to provide information   The added value service provider shall ensure that the person to be located has easy and  continuous access to information on the precision of the location data processed, the precise  purpose and duration of the processing and whether location data can be disclosed to a third  party for the purpose of providing added value services. Before disclosing location data, an  added value service provider shall take appropriate steps to ensure that such information is  available to the person to be located prior to the consent referred to in section 160(1).     Section 162   Subscribers’ and users’ rights   The party to be located shall have the opportunity to easily and at no separate charge cancel  the consent referred to in section 160(1), unless otherwise provided by law. The person to be  located shall have the opportunity to easily and at no separate charge temporarily ban the  processing of location data, if this is technically feasible and does not cause unreasonable  additional costs.                64   A user is entitled to receive from an added value service provider or communications  provider the traffic data possessed by them showing the location data and traffic data  appearing at the subscriber connection or terminal device at a given moment.   The prohibiting of the processing of location data and the service-specific consent and right  to information is decided in the case of minors under the age of 15 by their guardian. In  addition, provisions on the representation of a minor are laid down in the Child Custody and  Right of Access Act. Legally incompetent persons other than minors shall be represented by  their guardian, unless this is impossible by virtue of the technical implementation of the  service. Provisions on representation of an incompetent person are laid down in the  Guardianship Services Act.       PART VII   SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ELECTRONIC SERVICES     Chapter 21   Domain Names     Section 163   Scope of application   This Chapter applies to Internet domain names that end with the national country code Top  Level Domain of Finland (country code fi) or with the region code Top Level Domain of  Åland (region code ax) as well as to domain name administration and provision of domain  names.   The provisions in this Chapter regarding the domain name register maintained by Ficora  shall also apply to the register of domain names ending with region codes ax.

Section 166   Form and content of a domain name   A domain name shall include at least two but no more than 63 characters.  At the time of registration, a domain name shall not be:  1) based on a protected name or trademark owned by another party, unless the domain name   holder can present a good, acceptable reason for registering the domain name; or  2) similar to a protected name or trademark owned by another party, if the clear intent of   registering the domain name is to benefit from it or to cause damage.  Ficora may issue further regulations on specifications, form, length and permissible   characters necessary for a functional domain name.     Section 167   Entering data in the domain name register and publishing information   A domain name shall be registered in the domain name holder’s name.

Ficora may issue further regulations on the technical implementation of registration and the  information to be submitted.     Section 168   Transfer of a domain name and switch of domain name registrars   A domain name may be transferred to another party during its validity period. A domain  name registrar shall transfer the domain name within reasonable time from receiving the  request. If the transfer is not made within a reasonable time, Ficora shall transfer the domain  name. An application for a transfer shall not be processed, if a decision on revocation or  termination of a domain name is pending with Ficora.                66   Ficora may return a domain name to its original holder if the domain name was transferred  without the holder’s consent and the holder requests a correction of the entry, and the recipient  of the transfer does not present an acceptable reason for the transfer within a set period.   A domain name holder may switch domain name registrars while a domain name is valid.  The domain name registrar shall take the measures required to make this switch within a  reasonable time from receiving the request. If the transfer to another domain name registrar is  not made within a reasonable time, Ficora shall transfer the domain name.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the technical implementation and time periods for  transfers and switching domain name registrars.     Section 169   Removal of a domain name entry   Ficora may remove a domain name from the domain name register and the root fi if the  information referred to in section 167(1) is in essential parts insufficient or defective, and the  domain name holder has not, regardless of a request, corrected or complemented the data.   Ficora will remove a domain name from the domain name register and root fi without  consulting the holder if the domain name validity period has expired.   If a holder of a right referred to in section 166(2) asks for revocation of a domain name,  Ficora may remove a domain name that was entered in violation of the provisions of this Act  from the domain name register and the root fi and register it in the name of the holder of the  right.   Ficora may remove a domain name for a maximum period of one year from the root fi  without consulting the holder, if the domain name holder has applied for several domain  names that are derivatives of a protected name or trademark and the holder of the protected  name or trademark requests the revocation of the domain name.   A terminated domain name will become available for registration after one month from  revocation.   Ficora may remove a domain name, if a court of law has issued a res judicata decision  forbidding its use.

Ficora may issue further regulations on the information to be provided to a domain name  holder, information security of operations, whether a violation referred to in subsection 1(7) is  significant and the content, form and delivery of a notification.     Section 171   Organising domain name administration   Ficora shall:  1) manage the country code fi;  2) maintain and develop the fi-code domain name system;  3) be responsible for data transfer connections between name servers of the root fi and for   interconnection traffic to the Internet;  4) supervise the operations of domain name registrars;  5) be responsible for the information security of the root fi;  6) at request provide certificates and extracts from the domain name register.

Any measures referred to in this section shall be implemented with care, and they shall be   commensurate with the seriousness of the information security violation being combated.  Such measures shall not limit freedom of speech, the confidentiality of a message or the  protection of privacy any more than is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the goals  referred to in subsection 1. Such measures shall be discontinued if the conditions for them  specified in this section no longer exist.       Chapter 22   Information society services                68     Section 173   Restrictions on the scope   The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to:  1) taxation;  2) issues included in the scope of application of Directive 95/46/EC of the European   Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free movement of such data and of Directive 2002/58/EC of the  European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the  protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector (Directive on Privacy and Electronic  Communications);   3) activities of notaries public and of corresponding professionals which include the use of  public authority;   4) activities of an attorney or a legal counsel in court;  5) lottery operations against payment.     The following sections 174 and 175 shall not apply to:   1) copyright, neighbouring rights, industrial property rights or the rights referred to in  Council Directive 87/54/EEC on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor  products and in Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the legal  protection of databases;   2) issuance of electronic money, if the Member State has adopted some of the optional  exemptions referred to in Article 9(1) of the Directive 2009/110/EC of the European  Parliament and of the Council on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the  business of electronic money institutions amending Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC  and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC;   3) advertising of units of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities  (UCITS) referred to in Article 44(2) of Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of  laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective  investment in transferable securities;   4) issues relating to freedom of establishment, free provision of insurance and to the law  applicable on contracts of insurance;   5) freedom of the parties to choose the law applicable to contract;  6) contractual obligations in consumer contracts;  7) mandatory provisions of the law in a State where the property is located regarding the   form of a contract when the right to the property is established or transferred by contract;  8) permissibility of unsolicited commercial email communication.     Section 174   Co-ordinated field and freedom to provide information society services   Co-ordinated field means the requirements laid down in Member States’ legal systems  which information society service providers must comply with when commencing and  continuing their operations, such as requirements concerning:   1) qualifications, authorisation, registration or notification to the authorities;  2) procedures, advertising and other marketing, the quality and content of the service,   contracts or the liability of the service provider.                69   No requirements, falling within the co-ordinated field, which restrict provision of  information society services in Finland, must be imposed on information society service  providers established in another State of the European Economic Area. However, a court or  some other competent authority may restrict provision of certain services in accordance with  its separately prescribed powers, if:   1) restrictions are necessary to maintain public order or security, to safeguard public health  or to protect consumers;   2) restrictions are directed at services which damage the objectives referred to in  paragraph 1 or may seriously endanger their attainment; and   3) restrictions are in proportion to the objective.  Restrictions must not be implemented before the Member State where the service provider is   established has been asked to take action in the matter, but the Member State of establishment  has not implemented the action or the action has not been sufficient. In addition, the  Commission of the European Union and the Member State where the service provider is  established must be notified of the restrictions before their implementation.   In urgent cases, restrictions may be implemented, the provisions in subsection 3  notwithstanding. The Commission of the European Union and the Member State where the  service provider is established shall be notified immediately of the restrictions and of the  reasons why the case is considered urgent.   The provisions in subsections 3 and 4 shall not apply to crime investigations or when  hearing the case in court.     Section 175   Observance of Finnish law   Competent authorities in Finland shall supervise that the information society service  providers established in Finland observe the Finnish law in the co-ordinated field also when  provision of services is solely or mainly directed at another Member State within the European  Economic Area.     Section 176   General obligation to provide information   In addition to the provisions elsewhere in the law on obligations to give information,  information society service providers must have at least the following information easily,  immediately and continuously available to the recipients of the services and to the authorities:   1) the service provider’s name, geographical address in the state of establishment, email  address and other contact information through which the service provider may be contacted  quickly, directly and effectively;   2) the trade register or any other corresponding public register where the service provider  has possibly been entered and the service provider’s company and corporate ID or any other  corresponding identification in said register;   3) the contact information for the appropriate supervising authority if pursuit of the  operations requires a licence or registration;   4) the VAT identification if the service provider is pursuing operations subject to VAT.  In addition to the provisions in paragraph 1, information society service providers which   practice a regulated profession in the meaning of Directive 2005/36/EC of the European  Parliament and of the Council on the recognition of professional qualifications must have  available the following information:                70   1) any professional body or a corresponding association to which the service provider  belongs;   2) the occupational title and the Member State where it was awarded;  3) a reference to the professional code of conduct applicable in the state of establishment   and as to where and how it is accessible.  If information on the prices of goods or services is supplied when providing information   society services, they shall be supplied clearly and unambiguously. The information must  indicate whether VAT and delivery charges are included in the price. There are separate  provisions on notifying about the price of a commodity.     Section 177   Obligation to give information when placing an order   In addition to the provisions elsewhere in the law on obligations to give information, the  information society service providers shall, before recipients of the service place an order,  have available to them clear and easy to understand information at least on the following  matters:   1) technical stages when concluding a contract;  2) whether the service provider is storing the concluded contract and whether it is accessible   to the other party;  3) technical means which may be used to identify and correct errors of entry before placing   an order;  4) languages which may be used to conclude a contract;  5) codes of conduct concerning the matter, observed by the service provider, and where and   how they are electronically accessible.  The provisions of subsection 1 shall not be applied to contracts concluded by solely using   email or a corresponding personal method of communication. A contract may deviate from the  provisions of paragraph 1 unless a consumer is a party to the contract.     Section 178   Supply of contractual terms   Information society service providers shall supply recipients of services with contractual  terms so that the recipients may save and reproduce them.     Section 179   Order and acknowledgement of receipt   If an order is placed using technical means, information society service providers shall  immediately electronically notify receipt of the order. There is no need to supply an  acknowledgement of receipt if the ordered commodity is delivered electronically without  delay.   Appropriate, effective and easy to use technical means must be made available by service  providers to recipients of services allowing them to identify and correct entry errors before  placing an order.   The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 shall not apply to contracts concluded by solely using  email or a corresponding personal method of communication. A contract may deviate from the  provisions of subsections 1 and 2 unless a consumer is a party to the contract.                71     Section 180   Time of receipt   The order and the acknowledgement of receipt, referred to in section 179 above, is regarded  as received when it is available to the party it was addressed to.     Section 181   Meeting the formal requirements on a contract electronically   If a contract must be concluded in writing according to the law, this requirement is also met  by an electronic contract with contents that cannot be unilaterally altered, and which remain  accessible to the parties. If a contract must be signed according to the law, the separate  provisions on electronic signatures shall be applied. The provisions of this subsection shall  correspondingly apply to notifications and other measures by the parties relating to the  contractual relation which according to the law must be in writing or signed.   If a notification relating to a contract must be supplied verifiably according to the law, this  requirement may also be met by such an electronic method with which it can be demonstrated  that the recipient has received the notification.   The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 shall not apply to a contract concerning a property  deal or any other transfer of a property or a contract relating to family or estate law.     Section 182   Exemption from liability in data transfer services and network services   When an information society service consists of the transmission in a communications  network of information provided by a recipient of the service, or the provision of access to a  communications network, the service provider is not liable for the content or transfer of the  information transferred if it does not:   1) initiate the transfer;  2) select the receiver of the transfer; and  3) select or modify the information contained in the transfer.  The acts of transfer and provision of access referred to in subsection 1 include the automatic,   intermediate and temporary storage of the information transferred in so far as storage takes  place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transfer in the communications network, and  provided that the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary  for the transfer.     Section 183   Exemption from liability when caching the information   When an information society service consists of the transfer in a communications network  of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider is not liable for the  automatic, intermediate and temporary storage of that information, performed for the sole  purpose of making more efficient the information’s onward transmission to other recipients of  the service upon their request, if the service provider:   1) does not modify the information;                72   2) complies with the conditions on access to the information;  3) complies with rules regarding the updating of the information, specified in a manner   widely recognised and used in the industry;  4) does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used in the   industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and  5) acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has stored upon   obtaining actual knowledge of the fact:  a) that the information at the initial source of the transmission has been removed from the   network;  b) access to it has been disabled; or  c) a court or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or disablement.     Section 184   Exemption from liability in hosting services   When an information society service consists of the storage of information provided by a  recipient (content provider) of the service upon his request, the service provider is not liable  for the content of the information stored or transmitted at the request of a recipient of the  service if it acts expeditiously to disable access to the information stored upon:   1) obtaining knowledge of a court order concerning it or if it concerns violation of copyright  or neighbouring right upon obtaining the notification referred to in section 191;   2) otherwise obtaining actual knowledge of the fact that the stored information is clearly  contrary to section 10 or 10(a) of Chapter 11 or section 18 or 18(a) of Chapter 17 of the  Criminal Code.   The provisions in subsection 1 shall not apply if the content provider is acting under the  authority or the control of the service provider.     Section 185   Order to disable access to information   Upon request from a public prosecutor or a person in charge of inquiries or on application  by a party whose right the matter concerns, a court may order the information society service  provider referred to in section 184 to disable access to the information stored by it if the  information is clearly such that keeping its content available to the public or its transmission is  prescribed punishable or as a basis for civil liability. The court shall urgently process the  application. The application cannot be approved without an opportunity for the service  provider and the content provider an opportunity to be consulted except if the consultation  cannot be arranged as quickly as the urgency of the matter so necessarily requires.   A court order must also be made known to the content provider. If the content provider is  not known, the court may order the information society service provider to take care of  notification.   An order ceases to be in effect unless charges are raised for an offence based on the content  or transmission of information referred to in the order or, when concerning a liability, action is  brought within three months of issuing the order. On request by a public prosecutor, by an  injured party or by an interested party within the time limit referred to above, the court may  extend this time limit by a maximum of three months.   The information society service provider and the content provider have the right to apply for  reversal of the order in the court where the order was issued. When dealing with a matter  concerning reversal of the order, the provisions of Chapter 8 of the Code of Judicial Procedure                73   shall be observed. However, the court takes care of the necessary procedures to hear a public  prosecutor. The reversal must be applied for within 14 days of the date when the applicant was  notified of the order. The information must not be made available again when the hearing of  the case concerning the reversal is pending unless otherwise ordered by the court dealing with  the case. A public prosecutor has also the right to appeal the decision that reversed the order.     Section 186   Competent court   The application referred to in section 185 above shall be heard by the court of the  information society service provider’s domicile. However, the application may also be heard  by the court in Helsinki. A chairman of the court alone may also constitute a quorum.     Section 187   Legal safeguards for the content provider   If the information society service provider has prevented access to information under  section 184(1)(2), it shall immediately notify the content provider of this in writing or  electronically so that the content of the notification cannot be unilaterally altered and it  remains accessible to the parties. The notification must state the reason for prevention as well  as information on the right of the content provider to bring the matter for a court hearing. The  notification must be made in the mother tongue of the content provider, in Finnish or in  Swedish. The notification may also be made in another language agreed with the content  provider.   The content provider has the right to bring the matter concerning prevention to be heard by  the court referred to in section 186 within 14 days from the receipt of the notification referred  to in subsection 1. The provisions of section 185(4) shall be observed during the hearing of the  case concerning prevention.       Section 188   Information society service provider’s obligation to take action to implement a decision by the  authorities   The provisions of sections 182–184 on the information society service provider’s exemption  from liability shall have no effect on the service provider’s obligation, under any other law, to  take necessary action to implement an order or a decision by a court or by any other  competent authority.     Section 189   Prevention of access to material infringing copyright or neighbouring right   A holder of a copyright or his/her representative may request the information society service  provider referred to in section 184 to prevent access to material infringing copyright as  prescribed in this section and in sections 191–193. The same applies to a holder of a  neighbouring right and his/her representative if it concerns material infringing this right.                74   A request must first be presented to the content provider whose material the request  concerns. If the content provider cannot be identified or if he/she does not remove the material  or prevent access to it expeditiously, the request may be submitted to the information society  service provider by notification prescribed in section 191.     Section 190   Information society service provider’s contact point   The information society service provider shall give a contact point where the notification  referred to in section 191 and the plea referred to in section 192 may be delivered. The contact  information of the contact point shall be easily and continuously accessible.     Section 191   Form and content of the notification   The notification referred to in section 189 shall be made in writing or electronically so that  the content of the notification cannot be unilaterally altered and it remains available to the  parties. The notification shall include:   1) the name and contact information of the notifying party;  2) an itemisation of the material, for which prevention of access is requested, and details of   the location of the material;  3) confirmation by the notifying party that the material which the request concerns is, in its   sincere opinion, illegally accessible in the communications network;  4) information concerning the fact that the notifying party has in vain submitted its request   to the content provider or that the content provider could not be identified;  5) confirmation by the notifying party that he/she is the holder of copyright or neighbouring   right or entitled to act on behalf of the holder of the right;  6) signature of the notifying party.  A notification that does not meet the requirements in subsection 1 is invalid. If the   shortcomings in the notification solely concern the information referred to in subsection 1(2),  the information society service provider shall, however, take reasonable steps to contact the  notifying party and to communicate the shortcomings discovered.     Section 192   Notification to the content provider and the plea   The information society service provider shall immediately notify the content provider of  prevention of access to the material supplied by him/her and to supply the content provider  with a copy of the notification on the basis of which prevention was made.   If the content provider considers that prevention is groundless, he/she may get the material  returned by delivering to the notifying party a plea in writing or electronically, as prescribed in  section 191, within 14 days of receiving the notification. A copy of the plea shall be delivered  to the service provider. The plea must include:   1) the name and contact information of the content provider;  2) the facts and other reasons under which prevention is considered groundless;  3) an itemisation of the material for which prevention is considered groundless;  4) signature by the content provider.                   75   Section 193   Returning the material   If the plea, meeting the requirements of section 192, is delivered within the time limit, the  information society service provider must not prevent the material specified in the plea from  being returned and kept available unless otherwise provided by an agreement between the  service provider and the content provider or by an order or decision by a court or by any other  authority.     Section 194   Liability to compensate   A person who gives false information in the notification referred to in section 191 or in the  plea referred to in section 192 shall be liable to compensate for the damage caused. However,  there is no liability to compensate or it may be adjusted if the notifying party had reasonable  grounds to assume that the information is correct or if the false information is only of minor  significance, when taking into account the entire content of the notification or the plea.       Chapter 23   Directory Inquiry Services     Section 195   Availability of directory inquiry services   A telecommunications operator in a telephone network shall, for its part, ensure that users  have access to a generally available, comprehensive and reasonably priced directory inquiry  service.   A telecommunications operator with which a subscriber has entered into an agreement on  the use of a telephone subscriber connection shall ensure that the contact information  concerning the user’s name, address and telephone number is collected and published in a  generally available, comprehensive and reasonably priced telephone directory.   Ficora may issue further regulations on technical measures necessary to meet the obligation  referred to in subsection 1.     Section 196   Releasing contact information   A telecommunications operator and directory inquiry service provider shall, on request,  provide the contact information referred to in section 195(2) above in usable form to another  undertaking for the purposes of providing a directory inquiry service. The contact information  shall be released:   1) in usable form;  2) at a cost-oriented price; and  3) on non-discriminatory terms.                76   A telecommunications operator and inquiry directory service provider shall publish  information on the price charged for releasing contact information.   An inquiry directory service provider shall not favour one telecommunications operator over  another or otherwise act in a discriminatory manner.     Section 197   Processing personal data   A directory inquiry service provider is entitled to process personal data for the purpose of  creating and providing directory inquiry services.     Section 198   Publishing prohibition   A telecommunications operator and directory service provider shall give any subscriber or  user who is a natural person the opportunity to prohibit, at no charge, the inclusion of any part  or all of his or her contact information in directory inquiry services. The telecommunications  operator and any undertaking providing a directory inquiry service shall, if any subscriber who  is a natural person so requests, remove and correct incorrect information at no charge.   A telecommunications operator or directory inquiry service provider shall allow  undertakings and other organisations entered in directory inquiry services the right to have  their contact information removed and incorrect contact information corrected.     Section 199   Obligation to notify about the purpose and use of a directory service   A telecommunications operator shall notify a subscriber who is a natural person about the  purpose and use of any directory inquiry service that is publicly available or usable through  any directory inquiry service. Such notification shall be given at no charge before the  subscriber’s information is entered in the service.   In addition, a telecommunications operator and directory inquiry service provider shall  ensure that sufficiently itemised information about the undertakings to whom the subscriber’s  contact information was released pursuant to section 196(1) is easily available to the  subscriber.       Chapter 24   Electronic Direct Marketing and Cookies     Section 200   Direct marketing to natural persons   Direct marketing by means of automated calling systems, facsimile machines, or email, text,  voice, sound or image messages may only be directed at natural persons who have given their  prior consent.                77   Direct marketing other than that referred to in subsection 1 to a natural person is allowed if  the person has not specifically prohibited it. A natural person must be able to easily and at no  charge prohibit direct marketing as referred to in this subsection.   Notwithstanding subsection 1, where a service provider or a product seller obtains from any  customer who is a natural person his/her contact information for email, text, voice, sound or  image messages in the context of the sale of a product or service, that service provider or  product seller may use this contact information for direct marketing of his or her own products  of the same product group and of other similar products or services. The service provider or  product seller shall allow any customer who is a natural person the opportunity to prohibit,  easily and at no charge, the use of contact information at the time when it is collected and in  connection with any email, text, voice, sound or image message. The service provider or  product seller shall notify the customer clearly of the possibility of such a prohibition.     Section 201   Marketing prohibition of telephone subscriber connections   Direct marketing of mobile telephone subscriber connections to a consumer by telephone is  only allowed upon explicit request by the consumer.   The provisions of subsection 1 shall not apply to a telecommunications operator’s marketing  to its own mobile telephone customers.     Section 202   Direct marketing to legal persons   Direct marketing to legal persons is allowed if the recipient has not specifically prohibited it.  Any legal person shall be allowed the opportunity to prohibit, easily and at no separate   charge, the use of its contact information in connection with any email, SMS, voice, sound or  image message sent in direct marketing. The party undertaking direct marketing shall give  clear notification of the possibility of such a prohibition.     Section 203   Identification of direct marketing   The recipient of an email, text, voice, sound or image message sent for the purpose of direct  marketing as referred to in sections 200 and 202 above shall be able to recognise such a  message as marketing clearly and unambiguously.   It is prohibited to send such an email, text, voice, sound or image message intended for  direct marketing that:   1) disguises or conceals the identity of the sender on whose behalf the communication is  made;   2) is without a valid address to which the recipient may send a request that such  communications be ended;   3) solicits recipients to visit websites that contravene Chapter 2 of the Consumer Protection  Act.

The right to commence referred to in section 233 applies to the decision by a municipal   building supervision authority referred to in subsection 2.     Section 236   A right related to action permit to undertake construction and maintenance work in an area or  building belonging to another   If it is necessary for the placement of a telecommunications cable or radio mast, a  telecommunications operator with a right based on a decision under section 233(1) may,  without the permission of the owner or holder, fell trees and remove other plants from the  placement plan area, affix necessary equipment to buildings and structures and undertake  other construction work in the area. For this purpose, anyone in the service of the  telecommunications operator or the operator’s subcontractor has the right to access a private  area and affix the necessary markings on the ground.                89   In non-urgent cases, the telecommunications operator shall reserve an opportunity for the  owner and holder of the area to carry out the measures referred to in subsection 1 himself or  herself.   An owner or holder of a building shall allow a telecommunications operator with a right  based on a decision referred to in section 233(1) to properly place a base station and related  equipment in the building and connect the equipment to the communications network and  power grid.

The telecommunications operator and added value service provider shall notify the user of  the estimated duration of the violation or threat. In addition, they shall inform the subscriber  or user of the measures available to them for combating the threat, of the probable costs of  such measures, and inform the sources of further information available to them. The  telecommunications operator and added value service provider shall retain the data regarding  the notifications.   The telecommunications operator shall publish an appropriate notification of the measures  taken in a situation referred to in subsection 1 and any effects they may have on the use of that  service.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the content and form of the notifications and  publication of information referred to in this section and on the retaining of notifications.     Section 275                104   Disturbance notifications to Ficora   The telecommunications operator shall notify Ficora without undue delay of significant  information security violations or threats to information security in the services and of  anything else that prevents or significantly interferes communication services. A  telecommunications operator shall also make a notification of the estimated duration and  consequences of information security violations and threats, corrective measures taken as well  as measures undertaken to prevent the reoccurrence of such violations. If notifying of  information security violation is in the public interest, Ficora may order the  telecommunications operator to provide information regarding the matter.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the significance of a violation referred to in  subsection 1 as well as the content, form, and delivery of the notification.   Ficora provides the European Commission and the European Network and Information  Security Agency with an annual summary report of notifications referred to in subsection 1.     Section 276   Interference cooperation working group   Ficora may designate an interference cooperation working group, consisting of  representatives from:   1) telecommunications operators;  2) network and distribution network holders referred to in the Act on Electronic Markets   (588/2013);  3) contractors working for operators referred to in subsections 1 and 2;  4) operators other than those referred to in subsections 1–3, whose participation is deemed   appropriate.  The group’s tasks are to:  1) plan and harmonise measures required to control the exceptional circumstances referred   to in the Emergency Powers Act and disruptive situations under normal circumstances;  2) acquire and submit information needed to control interference situations to support   decision-making of Ficora; and  3) communicate the information on interference situations collected and analysed by the   group to parties who have the capability to reduce the damaging effects of interference on  society.   In addition to the provisions in the Act on the Openness of Government Activities, Ficora  may, notwithstanding secrecy provisions, disclose information needed to control interference  situations to the cooperation work group members, if the information is necessary for the  group in performing its duties and does not contain confidential messages, traffic data or  location data.   The provisions on the obligation of secrecy and non-exploitation referred to in Chapter 6 of  the Act on the Openness of Government Activities and criminal liability of a civil servant  apply to the members of the cooperation working group in tasks complying with this section.  Provisions on liability for damages are laid down in the Tort Liability Act (412/1974).     Section 277   Removal of radio interference   If the operation of radio equipment causes interference in safety radio communications, the  use of the radio equipment shall be discontinued immediately.                105   If a radio transmitter causes interference in radio communications or to other radio  equipment, the holder or owner of the radio transmitter shall eliminate or restrict the  interference. If the interference is caused by the technical characteristics of a radio receiver, its  separate antenna or antenna system, the elimination of the interference is the responsibility of  the holder or owner of the radio receiver, unless otherwise provided in this Act or the licence  terms.   Ficora may decide other measures concerning the technical characteristics or the use of the  radio equipment that must be undertaken by the holder or owner of the radio equipment to  prevent or restrict the interference and its effects.   If both the radio equipment causing the interference and the equipment suffering from the  interference are in compliance with this Act and the provisions and regulations issued by  virtue of it, and the interference is not of a minor nature or is not caused by interference  immunity properties of a separate antenna or antenna system linked to a radio receiver, Ficora  will present a proposal to the parties concerned regarding measures for the elimination of the  interference or the restriction of its effects.   If the parties fail to agree on the measures necessary to eliminate the interference or on the  amount or allocation of the costs caused thereby, Ficora settles the matter by decision.   The procedures referred to in subsections 2–4 above also apply when radio equipment  causes interference to telecommunications networks, telecommunications terminal device or  electrical appliances whose interference immunity properties are in accordance with the  provisions and regulations issued under this Act and the Electrical Safety Act.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the technical features of a separate antenna or  antenna system referred to in subsection 4 to be connected to a radio receiver.

PART XI                108   AUTHORITY FEES AND COMPENSATION     Chapter 36   Authority Fees     Section 285   Application fee   An applicant for a licence under this Act is required to pay the licencing authority a fee with  the application, in the amount of:   1) EUR 5 000 for a network licence referred to in section 6(1) and a programming licence  for terrestrial television broadcasting referred to in section 22(1);   2) EUR 1 500 for a programming licence for radio broadcasting referred to in section 22(1)  and 34(1);   3) EUR 1 000 for a network licence referred to in section 9;  4) EUR 300 for a temporary programming licence referred to in section 28.  No application fee, however, is needed for a licence application concerning a public   authority network.  The application fee is non-refundable, even if the licence application is withdrawn or   rejected.     Section 286   Auction participation fee   An enterprise, organisation or association registered for an auction referred to in section 11  shall pay a participation fee to cover the administrative costs that will accrue to Ficora for  arranging the auction. Provisions on the amount of the participation fee will be given by  Government Decree.   The participation fee is non-refundable, even if the operator or association does not bid in  the auction.   Ficora will issue a decision for the payment of the fee.     Section 287   Licence fee   A telecommunications operator that has been granted a network licence under section 11  shall pay a licence fee to the licensing authority. The licence fee is the highest valid bid  provided in section 11(1).   The licence fee shall be paid annually in instalments during the licence period. Provisions on  the payment schedule will be given by Government Decree. Ficora will issue a decision for  the payment of the fee.     Section 288   Market-based spectrum fee                109   Ficora collects from a holder of a network licence for telecommunications and television  operations granted by the Government free of charge pursuant to section 6, as well as from the  Defence Forces, a market-based spectrum fee, payable to the Government. The fee shall be  collected for frequencies that have been allocated:   1) to a network licence holder of a radio licence pursuant to section 39;  2) to the network of a holder of a radio licence pursuant to section 39 that is used for   television operations other than for public interest television broadcasting;  3) for use by the Defence Forces by a Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority   regulation pursuant to section 96.  The market-based spectrum fee is calculated according to the following formula:    B•K1•Kasuk•Ktark •EUR 9 300     In the equation:  1) B means the frequency amount allocated to the licence holder’s network or use of the   Defence Forces given in megahertz (MHz).  2) K1 means the frequency band factor, which is determined on the basis of the technical   and financial utilisation of the frequency band allocated to use.  3) Kasuk is the population coverage factor, which is determined on the basis of the number   of inhabitants in the utilisation area in relation to Finland’s population. The value of the  population coverage factor is 1 for a utilisation area that covers all of Finland.   4) Ktark is the intended use factor, which is determined by the intended use of the  frequencies.   5) The calculatory economic value of the frequencies is EUR 9 300 per MHz.  The frequency band factors are as follows:   146–174 MHz 1.9  174.001–240 MHz 2.0  400–862 MHz 2.0  862.001–960 MHz 1.4  1 215–2 200 MHz 1.0  2 200.001–2 700 MHz 0.6  3 400–4 200 MHz 0.4  12 000–14 500 MHz 0.25  17 100–19 700 MHz 0.25  19 700.001–39 000 MHz 0.2     The intended use factors are as follows:  telecommunications operations 1.0  television operations 0.25  military defence 0.15       Section 289   Information society fee   A telecommunications operator subject to notification or licence shall pay an annual  information society fee to Ficora.   No information society fee is charged for the turnover from television or radio broadcasting  or from retransmission of television or radio broadcasts.                110   The information society fee is 0.12 per cent of a telecommunications operator’s turnover of  operations in Finland, based on the financial period preceding the determination of the fee but  no less than EUR 300. Further provisions on turnover as the basis for the information society  fee are laid down in section 290.   Provisions on determining the information society fee for the first year of operations are laid  down in section 292.   If a telecommunications operator discontinues its operations before the end of the payment  period, the information security fee will not be returned.     Section 290   Turnover as the basis for the determination of the information society fee   If a telecommunications operator is part of a corporate group as referred to in Chapter 1(6)  of the Accounting Act, the basis for the telecommunications operator’s fee is the operator’s  share of the total turnover from telecommunications operations in Finland by the group’s  liable operators deducted by their mutual turnover from these operations. When the parent  undertaking is not Finnish, the basis for the fee remains the same.   If there have been changes in the corporate structure between the end of the previous  financial period and the time of issuing the communications market fee decision, the fee is  determined on the basis of the operator’s share of the total turnover from telecommunications  operations in the previous closed financial period.   If telecommunications operations have been transferred to another undertaking between the  end of the financial period of the previous year and the time of issuing the payment decision,  the obligation to pay the fee falls on the undertaking that is involved in public  telecommunications at the time of issuing the payment decision. In determining the fee, the  confirmed turnover of the transferred telecommunications operations for the previous closed  financial period shall be taken into account.   If the financial period of the telecommunications operator does not coincide with the  calendar year, the turnover will be converted into a sum corresponding to a calendar year’s  turnover by multiplying it by 12 and then dividing it by the number of months in the financial  period concerned.   Further provisions on how to submit data necessary for determining the fee to Ficora may be  given by Ministry of Transport and Communications Decree.     Section 291   Determining the information security fee   The information security fee is collected annually in one instalment. The obligation to pay  an information society fee is ordered by a decision of Ficora. Further provisions on the  recovery of fees may be given by Ministry of Transport and Communications decree.     Section 292   Submittal of data to Ficora and payment obligation in certain exceptional circumstances   For the purpose of determining an information society fee, Ficora has the right to obtain  from telecommunications operators turnover data from the period preceding the determination  of the fee. Operators that are part of a group shall also give an account of the instalments from  the group’s mutual telecommunications operations that have been deducted from the                111   telecommunications turnover under section 290(1). A telecommunications operator shall  submit the information to Ficora within one month of the adoption of the financial statement.  A copy of the adopted financial statement and the group financial statement shall be submitted  as an attachment.   If no sufficiently reliable account of the turnover is available due to missing financial  statements or some other comparable, especially weighty reason, Ficora’s estimate of the  turnover may be used as the basis for the payment.   In the estimate due consideration must be given to:  1) telecommunications operator’s extent of operations;  2) telecommunications operator’s position in the market;  3) data about the telecommunications operator’s services, number of clients and invoicing;  4) reference data about other telecommunications operators providing similar services;  5) other elements similar to those referred to in subsections 1–4 affecting the   telecommunications operator’s turnover.  Before taking any measures to estimate the turnover, Ficora shall recommend that the   telecommunications operator submit the information needed for determining the information  security fee within a reasonable period. The recommendation must point out that Ficora will  estimate the turnover if no information is provided.     Section 293   Radio and television broadcasting supervision fee   The Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd and a television or radio broadcaster having a  licence referred to in this Act are obliged to pay the radio and television broadcasting  supervision fee.   The obligation to pay commences in the calendar year during which six (6) months have  passed from the time the licence was granted to a television or radio broadcaster. The  supervision fee for television and radio broadcasting will not be refunded even if the television  or radio broadcaster discontinues its operations during the course of a calendar year.     Section 294   Supervision fees for television and radio broadcasting   The annual supervision fees for television and radio broadcasting are as follows:  1) fee payable by the Finnish Broadcasting Company Ltd is EUR 165 000;  2) fee payable by a licence holder carrying out other than regional television broadcasting is   EUR 16 000 for each television programme set complying with the licence, excluding parallel  broadcasts;   3) fee payable by a licence holder carrying out regional television broadcasting is EUR 800  for each television programme set complying with the licence;   4) fee payable by a licence holder carrying out radio broadcasting on frequencies of national  or similar licensed use is EUR 8 000 for each radio programme set complying with the  licence;   5) fee payable by a licence holder carrying out radio broadcasting on frequencies of regional  or local licensed use is EUR 800 for each radio programme set complying with the licence;   6) fee payable by a licence holder carrying out radio broadcasting solely in the television  network is EUR 8 000 for each radio programme set complying with the licence.   The supervision fee for television and radio broadcasting is collected annually in two  instalments. An obligation to pay the fee is ordered by Ficora.                112     Section 295   Domain name fee   A registrar shall pay Ficora a domain name fee for entering a domain name into the domain  name register and for renewing the entry. An application for entry into the register shall  include an account of paying the fee.   Provisions on the amount of the fee are laid down in the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable  to the State.       Section 296   Numbering fee   A telecommunications operator and any other party obtaining a number or identifier shall  pay Ficora a fixed fee to cover the costs incurred for the use of the number or identifier,  numbering management and supervision. The amount of the fee is determined according to the  proportion of the available addressing range that is taken by the number in use.   Provisions on the amount of the fee are laid down in the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable  to the State.     Section 297   Collection of fees   If the fee referred to in this Chapter is not settled by the due date, annual penalty interest on  delayed payments shall be charged for the unpaid amount according to the interest rate  referred to in section 4 of the Interest Act. Instead of the penalty interest, the authority may  collect a default payment of five euros if the amount of the penalty interest would be less than  that.   Fees under this Chapter are distrainable. Provisions on their enforcement are laid down in  the Act on the Recovery of Taxes and Fees by Recovery Proceedings.       Chapter 37   Compensation from Authorities     Section 298   Costs of contingency preparations   A telecommunications operator and a television and radio broadcaster has the right to  receive compensation for costs incurred in contingency preparation referred to in Chapter 35  from the national emergency supply fund referred to in the Security of Supply Act  (1390/1992) if the costs are significant with regard to the nature and extent of the activities of  the telecommunications operator or television or radio broadcaster.                113   The compensation for costs is decided by the National Emergency Supply Agency that must  request a statement concerning the compensation application from the Ministry of Transport  and Communications.

Section 311   Publication duty of Ficora and the Government   Ficora shall publish decisions referred to in sections 51–79, the regulation on the division  into telecommunications areas, numbering decisions and decisions on disputes between  telecommunications operators in a way that ensures that they are available to  telecommunications operators and user groups.   The Government must publish licence application announcements and licence decisions in  the manner referred to in subsection 1.     Section 312   Electronic notification   With the consent of the concerned party, a notification of a matter falling within the  competence of Ficora may be processed and a decision submitted by email. The decision or  some other document relating to the matter is deemed to have been notified when the  concerned party has sent a confirmation email to Ficora that the message has been read. If a  document need not be supplied verifiably according to the law, the document is deemed to  have been received on the third day from sending the message, unless provided otherwise.   Documents or decisions related to domain names may in any case be issued by email to the  address provided to Ficora by the party concerned or by the registrar representing the party, in  which case the decision or other document is deemed to have been received on the third day  from sending the message, unless provided otherwise.   If a party to an administrative matter referred to in this Act or a registrar representing the  party has delivered Ficora contact data that are in essential parts insufficient or defective, or  has failed to give all essential contact data and these data have not been corrected or  complemented later, and, therefore, a document or a decision relating to the matter can only be                118   notified as a public notice referred to in section 62 of the Administrative Procedure Act,  Ficora may also notify the decision through a notification on its website.   A decision or another document is deemed to have been notified one month after publishing  the notification. The notification shall include the date of publishing and the date on which the  decision will be deemed to have been notified.     Section 313   Processing of supervision matters at Ficora   Ficora may take up matters for examination upon request by a party or on its own initiative.  Ficora may prioritise its supervision duties laid down in this Act. Ficora may choose not to   examine a matter, if:  1) it is likely that a matter is not related to actions contrary to the provisions of this Act or   provisions laid down by virtue of it;  2) despite a suspected defect or neglect, the matter is of minor significance with regard to   the functioning of the communication markets, reliability of communications services,  ensuring freedom from interference in electronic communications and interests of service  users; or   3) the measure request relating to the matter is obviously groundless.  A decision by Ficora not to examine a matter as referred to in subsection 2 shall be made as   soon as it is possible.     Section 314   Resolution of disputes between operators by Ficora   Ficora shall resolve a matter between a telecommunications operator and other undertaking  initiated by virtue of sections 53–80 or 304(2) no later than four months from the date on  which the matter becomes pending.

The obligations imposed on the parties in  connection with the decision shall accord with the provisions of this Act.   Ficora shall promote cooperation among telecommunications operators and aim at resolving  disputes between telecommunications operators primarily through mediation.   If mediation does not produce results within four months, Ficora shall at the request of a  party to the dispute make a decision on the matter within four months from the end of  mediation.   The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 also apply, where necessary, to the resolution of such  cross-border disputes in which the parties involved are located in several EEA States. When  resolving such cross-border disputes, Ficora shall work in cooperation with the regulatory  authority of the EEA State concerned.   Ficora may also consult the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications in  resolving a cross-border dispute.

Information  on other than radio communication intended for general reception may only be given to Ficora  if this is necessary for the purpose of identifying, locating, removing or restricting any  interference in safety radio communications or prosecution of a party causing the interference.   Ficora and the Data Protection Ombudsman shall destroy any information on messages,  traffic data and location data received under this section when this information is no longer  necessary for carrying out the duties provided for in this section or the processing of any  criminal case concerning the duties. Information on messages, traffic data and location data  shall be destroyed no later than two years, or 10 years in the case of information pertaining to  an investigation of a violation of information security, from the end of the calendar year  during which the information was received or a decision or sentence in a criminal case entered  into legal force.   The right of access to information provided in this section does not apply to the information  referred to in Chapter 15(14) of the Act on Credit Institutions (610/2014) or in  Chapter 17(24)(2–3) of the Code of Judicial Procedure.     Section 317   Identifying and locating a party causing interference in radio communications   Ficora may monitor and use traffic data of a radio transmission other than those intended for  general reception if this is necessary for the purpose of identifying and locating a party  causing the interference or a radio transmitter without a licence, removing or restricting any  interference, or prosecution of a party causing interference. Information on the contents of a  radio transmission not intended for general reception may be inspected and information  obtained thereby disclosed only if it is essential for the purpose of identifying, locating,  removing or restricting interference in safety radio communications or for prosecution of a  party causing interference.   The provisions of section 136(4),do not prevent information being given to Ficora about the  existence of a radio transmission and about its traffic data if this is necessary for the purpose  of identifying and locating any interference in radio communications, removing or restricting  any interference, or prosecution of a party causing interference. Information on the contents of  a radio transmission may be given only if it is essential for the purpose of identifying,  locating, removing or restricting interference in safety radio communications or for  prosecution of a party causing interference.   Ficora shall destroy information on confidential radio communications when it is no longer  needed for ensuring adequately interference-free radio communications or for processing  administrative matters or criminal cases in connection with interference.

Section 318   Supply of information of the authorities   Notwithstanding secrecy provisions or other restrictions on the disclosure of information,  the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ficora, the Data Protection Ombudsman and  the Finnish Competition Authority have the right to supply documents that they have received  or drawn up in the course of performing their legal duties or disclose confidential information  to each other, if this is necessary for performing their legal duties.   The Ministry of Transport and Communications and Ficora have a right to supply any  confidential documents or disclose confidential information necessary for communications  market supervision to the Commission or the regulatory authority of another EEA State.   The right to supply and disclose referred to in this section does not apply to information on  messages, traffic data, location data or the contents or existence of a confidential radio  transmission.   The Ministry of Transport and Communications or Ficora may use a confidential document  that has been obtained from a foreign public authority only for the purpose for which it was  given.     Section 319   Secrecy obligation and disclosure of information related to messages   Any information on messages, traffic data, location data and the content of confidential  radio transmissions received or acquired by Ficora and the Data Protection Ombudsman under  sections 316 and 317 shall be kept secret.   Notwithstanding the secrecy provision of subsection 1 or other restrictions on the disclosure  of information, Ficora is entitled to disclose traffic data and other information received in  connection with collecting information on and investigating violations of information security  to the following:   1) communications providers, added value service providers, corporates or associations,  subscribers and users who have been abused in a violation of information security, who have  or are likely to become the subject of a violation of information security, and if Ficora has  reason to believe that a crime referred to in section 316(2)(1–12) has been committed;   2) competent authorities or other bodies that operate in another state preventing or  investigating information security violations in communications networks and services.   Ficora is entitled to disclose data referred to in subsection 2 only to the extent necessary to  prevent and investigate violations of information security. The disclosure of data shall not  limit the confidentiality of messages or the protection of privacy any more than is necessary.   The provisions of subsection 1 shall not prevent the disclosure of traffic data to other  authorities if it is necessary to solve a radio interference violation, prosecute the party that  caused it or to remove or restrict radio interference.   In defining authorities and other parties referred to in subsection 2(2), Ficora shall work in  cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. If the decision on an object  of the disclosure could have a significant effect on society or on the general development of  the communications market, the Ministry of Transport and Communications decides to which  authorities or other parties Ficora may disclose information referred to in subsection 2.                  122   Section 320   The right of the Defence Forces and the Border Guard to obtain information   The Defence Forces and the Border Guard have the right, notwithstanding the  confidentiality obligation, to obtain from Ficora any information on frequency usage that is  important for contingency planning and precautionary measures for exceptional  circumstances. The right to obtain information does not apply to information on messages,  traffic data, location data or the contents or existence of a confidential radio transmission.     Section 321   The right of emergency services authorities to obtain information   A telecommunications operator is obliged to disclose the following to an Emergency  Response Centre, a Marine Rescue Coordination Centre, a Marine Rescue Sub-Centre or the  police for processing purposes:   1) subscriber connection identifier and location data of the subscriber connection and  terminal device from which an emergency call is placed, and information on the subscriber,  user and installation address; and   2) identifier and location data showing the location of the user terminal device and  subscriber connection to which the emergency call applies if, in the considered opinion of the  authority receiving the emergency call, the user is in obvious distress or immediate danger.   The information referred to in subsection 1 above shall be released notwithstanding the  secrecy obligation referred to in section 136 and the requirements for processing location data  specified in sections 160–161, and without reference to what the subscriber or user may have  agreed with the telecommunications operator concerning the secrecy of such information.   An added value service provider has the right to disclose information referred to in  subsection 1 to the respective authority.     Section 322   Certain other authorities’ right to obtain information   The right of authorities to receive traffic data for the purpose of preventing, uncovering or  investigating crimes is laid down in the Police Act, Border Guard Act (578/2005), Act on the  Processing of Personal Data by the Border Guard (579/2005), Customs Act (1466/1994), and  Coercive Measures Act.   Data to be retained under section 157 of this Act is only obtainable from service providers  by the authorities who have a legal right to obtain the data.     Section 323   Non-remuneration of measures and information supply ordered by an authority   A telecommunications operator shall without charge supply a public authority with any  information in its possession:   1) necessary to maintain public order and safety, investigate, uncover and prevent crime or  maintain rescue operations in performing prescribed duties; and   2) to which the authority has a right for which separate provisions are issued.                123   A telecommunications operator shall install free of charge measures that allow interception  by the authorities as provided in law .   In cases where the health or lives of humans are at risk, the disclosure of the information or  measure shall be implemented urgently.   A public authority shall implement at its own expense a system with which it may receive  and process the information referred to in subsection 1 or carry out interception referred to in  subsection 2. The public authority shall also be responsible for the costs of connecting the  system to a public communications network or service. The telecommunications operator shall  perform switching of emergency traffic without charge.   Ficora may issue further regulations on the implementation of measures and disclosure of  information and their time periods referred to in subsections 1 and 2.       Chapter 41   Inspections and Prevention of Radio Interference     Section 324   Limitations to the scope   The provisions of sections 326, 327 and 329(3) do not apply to the Finnish Defence Forces  or the Border Guard when they employ radio communication for military defence, nor to the  radio equipment they possess solely for that purpose.   The provisions of sections 326 and 329(2 and 3) do not apply to radio equipment aboard  warships of a foreign State, military aircraft of a foreign State, or other aircraft of a foreign  State which are used solely for government purposes.   The provisions of section 326(1 and 2) and 329(2) do not apply to radio transmitters of  warships or aircraft of a foreign State other than those referred to in subsection 2. Likewise,  section 329(3) does not apply to said radio transmitters if the holder or user of the transmitter  can present a licence or certificate when requested complying with the provisions in  sections 267(1) and 326(3).     Section 325   Ficora’s right of inspection   Ficora has the right to perform a technical safety and function inspection or financial  inspection of a telecommunications operator in order to supervise compliance with the  obligations imposed under this Act and in provisions, regulations and decisions issued under  it. Provisions on the inspection are laid down in section 39 of the Administrative Procedure  Act.   A public authority network may also be subject to a technical or safety inspection.  Ficora has the right to have the technical and safety inspection performed by an independent   expert. When expert inspectors carry out duties referred to in this Act, the provisions  concerning criminal liability of a civil servant apply to them. Provisions on liability for  damages are laid down in the Tort Liability Act.   In the inspections, Ficora and anyone working for it has the right to access the  telecommunications operator’s equipment facilities and other premises and, notwithstanding                124   secrecy provisions, obtain for examination documents and information that are necessary for  its supervision duty.   The inspections shall not be performed in premises that are used as permanent residence.     Section 326   Inspection of telecommunications device   For supervision of compliance with this Act and the provisions, regulations and decisions  issued by virtue of it, Ficora has the right to perform an inspection at the location of:   1) a radio transmitter for the possession of which a radio licence referred to in this Act or for  the use of which a proficiency certificate or a certificate endorsement referred to in this Act is  required;   2) radio equipment or telecommunications terminal device that is found, or on reasonable  grounds is suspected, to have operated or to be operating in violation of the provisions or  regulations or of causing interference;   3) an electrical appliance referred to in section 97(2) that is found, or on reasonable grounds  is suspected, to have operated or to be operating in violation of the provisions or regulations or  of causing interference;   4) radio equipment or telecommunications terminal device that is offered for sale or is  intended to be placed on the market.   5) a decoding system referred to in section 269(2).  Ficora also has the right to enter a location where the equipment or device referred to in   subsection 1 is, on reasonable grounds, suspected to be found. However, an inspection may be  carried out in a place used as a permanent residential space only if it is necessary for the  examination and there are special grounds to suspect that the provisions in section 348(1)(1–3)  of this Act or sections 5–7 or 8(b) of Chapter 38 of the Criminal Code have been violated.   Upon request, the holder, user or owner of radio equipment shall present the radio licence in  its possession to Ficora, the Border Guard or the police.     Section 327   Removing telecommunications device for examination   If, on reasonable grounds, it is suspected that sections 253, 262(2) or 263 or 269 have been  violated, an inspector shall have the right to remove the device and its documents for  examination and to prohibit the device from being used, offered for sale, transferred,  misplaced or destroyed during the time of the examination, which shall be conducted without  delay. The party whose device has been removed for examination must be furnished with an  official document stating the property removed for examination and the reason for the  examination.   If the telecommunications device removed for examination complies with the requirements  of this Act and the provisions and regulations issued by virtue of it and the value of the device  has decreased because of the examination, compensation for the device corresponding to its  current price shall be payable, on request, to the owner.   If the telecommunications device fundamentally violates this Act or the provisions or  regulations issued by virtue of it, Ficora may oblige the device manufacturer or importer to  compensate it for the costs incurred in the examination and to remove the device from the  market.     Section 328                125   Ensuring efficient and interference-free use of radio frequencies   Ficora has the right to inspect radio communications and its technical implementation to  ensure the efficient and interference-free use of radio frequencies.     Section 329   Prevention of interference   Ficora has the right to prohibit telecommunications device from being imported, offered for  sale, sold, transferred or used, and to prohibit the use of certain types of electrical appliance  referred to in section 97(2), if the device or appliance has caused harmful interference or is, on  reasonable grounds, suspected to cause harmful interference.   Ficora also has the right to prohibit radio equipment from being imported, offered for sale,  sold, transferred or used if, on reasonable grounds, it is suspected that the radio equipment will  interfere the planned use of radio frequencies referred to in sections 95 or 96.   Ficora has the right to inspect radio equipment, and to remove it for examination, if  reasonable grounds exist to suspect that it does not comply with this Act or with the  provisions or regulations issued by virtue of it or it has caused or is, on reasonable grounds,  suspected to cause harmful interference. If it is found that the radio equipment or its use  significantly violates this Act or the provisions and regulations issued by virtue of it, or that  the radio equipment or its use could cause harmful interference, Ficora may render the radio  equipment temporarily inoperable, provided that this does not cause the holder of the radio  equipment harm or damage that would be unreasonable under the circumstances. The  provisions of section 327 otherwise apply to removal of radio equipment for examination.       Chapter 42   Supervision decisions and coercive measures     Section 330   Supervision decision   If anyone violates this Act or provisions, regulations, decisions or licence terms issued under  it, Ficora, the Data Protection Ombudsman and the municipal building supervision authority,  in carrying out their duties under this Act, may issue a complaint and order them to rectify the  error or neglect within a specified reasonable time period.   The provisions of Chapter 2(16), (17), (19), and (20) of the Consumer Protection Act apply  to the compliance with the provisions referred to in section 306 and supervised by the  Consumer Ombudsman.     Section 331   Interim decision   If an error or omission concerning provisions, regulations, decisions or licence terms of this  Act or those issued under or by virtue of this Act represents an immediate and serious threat to  public safety, public security or public health or creates serious economic or operational                126   hindrance to other undertakings, subscribers or users or to the functioning of communications  networks and services, Ficora may without delay decide on necessary interim measures  regardless of the time limit referred to in section 330.   Prior to issuing a decision on an interim measure, Ficora shall reserve the party concerned  an opportunity to be consulted except if the consultation cannot be arranged as quickly as the  urgency of the matter requires.   As an interim measure, Ficora may terminate the operations representing a threat or serious  hindrance. Ficora may also restrict the use of frequencies or order a comparable coercive  measure. Interim measures may be valid for a maximum period of three months. Ficora may  extend the interim measures by a period of up to three months if the fault or neglect has not  been rectified within the prescribed period. An appeal may be made separately against a  decision concerning interim measures in the same manner as against a decision referred to in  subsection 1.     Section 332   Conditional fines, threat of termination and threat of completion   A conditional fine, a threat of termination or a threat of having the act done at the defaulter’s  expense may be imposed in support of the obligation referred to in sections 330 or 331 above.   The threat of termination referred to in subsection 1 shall not apply to obligations referred to  in sections 176–179 or 190.   Provisions on conditional fines, threat of termination and threat of completion are laid down  in the Act on Conditionally Imposed Fines. The costs of action taken at the defaulter’s  expense are paid provisionally from government funds and recovered from the defaulter. The  recovered costs are distrainable. The provisions on their enforcement are laid down in the Act  on the Recovery of Taxes and Fees by Recovery Proceedings.     Section 333   Penalty payment by a telecommunications operator   A telecommunications operator that acts in violation of the obligation laid down by virtue of  provisions of sections 53–55 and despite being requested to do so, fails to rectify its actions  within a reasonable period of at least three months may be ordered to pay a penalty.   A penalty shall not be ordered if the action has no significant effect on the markets or if the  ordering of the penalty is otherwise unjustified with regard to the safeguarding of competition.  An order to pay a penalty need not be made if the telecommunications operator has been or  will be ordered to pay a penalty referred to in the Act on Competition Restrictions for a  corresponding act or omission.   In determining a penalty, regard shall be had to the nature and extent of the action, its  duration and any penalty imposed for a similar breach or neglect under the Act on  Competition Restrictions. The minimum amount of the penalty is EUR 1 000 and the  maximum is EUR 1 million euros. If the act or omission has especially significant effects on  the market, the stated amount may be exceeded. The penalty may, however, be no more than  five per cent of the turnover of the telecommunications operator for the provision of electronic  communications networks and services in the previous year.   The penalty is determined by the Market Court upon proposal of Ficora. The provisions of  the Act on Court Proceedings in the Market Court (100/2013) shall apply to the processing of  a case in the Market Court. Any penalty is ordered to be paid to the State.                   127   Section 334   Penalty payment by a television or radio broadcaster   A television or radio broadcaster that acts in violation of the provisions of sections 25 and  26 and despite being requested to do so, fails to rectify its actions within a period set by an  authority referred to in section 303 or 306, may be ordered to pay a penalty.   A penalty payment shall not be ordered if the action has no significant effect on the  attainment of the objectives laid down in Chapters 25 and 26, or if the ordering of the penalty  is otherwise clearly unjustified with regard to the safeguarding of the objectives.   In determining a penalty payment, regard must be taken to the nature, extent and duration of  the action. The minimum amount of the penalty payment is EUR 1 000 and the maximum is  EUR 1 million. If the act or omission has especially significant effects on the attainment of the  objectives referred to in sections 25 and 26, the stated amount may be exceeded. The penalty  payment may, however, be no more than five per cent of the television or radio broadcaster’s  turnover for the operations subject to a licence during the previous year.   The penalty payment is determined by the Market Court on the proposal of Ficora or in  cases referred to in section 214, on the proposal of the Consumer Ombudsman. The provisions  of the Act on Court Proceedings in the Market Court apply to the processing of a case in the  Market Court. Any penalty is ordered to be paid to the State.     Section 335   Enforcement of penalty payments   Penalty payments are distrainable. The provisions of the Act on the Recovery of Taxes and  Fees by Recovery Proceedings apply to enforcement of a penalty payment. Enforcement of  penalties is attended to by the Legal Registers Centre. Provisions on the duty of authorities to  notify, on the refund of a penalty payment and on other corresponding factors that are of  significance to penalty enforcement as well as further provisions on the enforcement of a  penalty payment may be given by Government Decree.     Section 336   Prohibiting an unfair term of agreement in telecommunication services   Ficora may prohibit from continuing the application of an agreement term in breach of  section 107 or from renewing the application of such, or a similar term, where this is  necessary in order to protect the consumer.   Ficora may impose a conditional fine in support of the prohibition. A decision to pay the  conditional fine is issued by the Market Court.   A decision of Ficora referred to in subsection 1 or 2 shall not be subject to an appeal. A  telecommunications operator may refer a prohibition decision for processing by the Market  Court within 30 days following a notification of the decision of Ficora. Otherwise the decision  remains in force. Provisions of the Act on Court Proceedings in the Market Court apply to the  processing of a case in the Market Court.     Section 337   Closing a number or service                128   The Consumer Ombudsman may under penalty of a fine order a telecommunications  operator to close a number or otherwise bar the use of a service if it is evident that the service  seeks unlawful financial benefit by providing information in marketing material that is  essentially false or misleading with regard to subscribers and users, and if fees resulting from  the service accumulate on the subscriber’s communications service bill. The Consumer  Ombudsman may also issue a temporary decision, which remains in force until a final  decision has been reached in the case.   In a decision under subsection 1, the Consumer Ombudsman shall order a  telecommunications operator immediately after having been informed of the decision to  discontinue billing for the content service and terminate the payment of credits, which have  accumulated or are yet to accumulate from the service, to the service provider or another  telecommunications operator.   Prior to issuing a decision under subsection 1, the Consumer Ombudsman shall reserve an  opportunity for the telecommunications operator and service provider to present their views,  expect if the consultation cannot be arranged as quickly as is necessarily required by the  urgency of the matter.   A decision of the Consumer Ombudsman referred to in subsection 1 shall not be subject to  an appeal. A telecommunications operator or a party whose service has been barred may refer  a decision other than temporary to the Market Court within 30 days following a notification of  the decision. Otherwise the decision remains in force. Provisions of the Act on Court  Proceedings in the Market Court apply to the processing of a case in the Market Court.   If a decision of the Consumer Ombudsman referred to in subsection 1 remains in force, a  telecommunications operator shall without delay and no later than 30 days from the final  resolution of the matter reimburse users in full for the fees paid by them for the service.

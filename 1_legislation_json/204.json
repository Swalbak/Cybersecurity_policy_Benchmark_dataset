(2) Where this subarticle applies - (a) a Court of Magistrates as court of criminal inquiry in  making a decision under article 401(2); (b) the court or jury, in determining whether the person  charged or accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper, which inferences may not by themselves be considered as evidence of guilt but may be considered as amounting to corroboration of any evidence of guilt of the person charged or accused.   (3) In criminal proceedings against any person for an offence the prosecution shall not, without the permission of the court for reasons which it considers just, comment on the fact that that person did not request the assistance of a lawyer or a legal procurator in the course of police investigations before those proceedings.     198 CAP. 9.] CRIMINAL CODE  Sub-title X  TAKING OF SAMPLES, FINGERPRINTING AND OTHER  INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES  Samples under  authorisation.

(4) On an appeal against sentence by the Attorney General, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if it thinks that a sentence of greater severity should have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial and pass such sentence of greater severity warranted in law in substitution therefore as it thinks ought to have been passed, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.  Powers of Court of  Criminal Appeal in  special cases.  Added by:  XXV.1967.18.  Amended by:  XXVII.1975.30.  502. (1) If it appears to the Court of Criminal Appeal that an appellant, though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed on the appellant at the trial or pass such sentence in substitution therefor as it thinks proper and as may be warranted in law by the verdict on the count or part of the indictment on which the court considers that the appellant has been properly convicted:  Provided that such other sentence shall not be of greater severity than the sentence passed at the trial taken as a whole, whether or not the last mentioned sentence was expressed to be passed on that part of the indictment.  (2) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the Court of Criminal Appeal that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the     CRIMINAL CODE [CAP. 9. 269 trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.  (3) Where on conviction of the appellant the jury have found a verdict falling within the provisions of article 480(3), and the Court of Criminal Appeal considers that a wrong conclusion has been arrived at by the Criminal Court on the effect of that verdict, the Court of Criminal Appeal may, instead of allowing the appeal, order such conclusion to be recorded as appears to the court to be in law required by the verdict, and pass such sentence (not being a sentence of greater severity) in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law.  (4) Where on an appeal against conviction the Court of Criminal Appeal i s of opinion that a l though the appel lant committed the act or made the omission charged against him he was insane at the time the act was done or omission made so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the court may quash the sentence passed at the trial and order the appellant to be kept in custody in Mount Carmel Hospital in which case the provisions of article 623(1), (2) and (3) shall apply.

(2) Where apart from this article -  (a) an appeal against a verdict such as is mentioned in  subarticle (1) would fall to be allowed, and (b) none of the grounds for allowing it relates to the  question of the insanity of the accused, the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if of opinion that, but for the insanity of the accused, the proper verdict would have been that he was guilty of an offence other than the offence charged.  (3) In the case of an appeal under subarticle (1) the appeal may be heard and determined in the absence of the appellant and, if he is not assisted by an advocate, the provisions of article 519 shall apply.  (4) Where in accordance with subarticle (1) an appeal is allowed -   (a) if the ground, or one of the grounds, for allowing the appeal is that the finding of the jury as to the insanity of the accused ought not to stand and the Court of Criminal Appeal is of opinion that he was guilty of an offence (whether the offence charged or any other offence of which the jury could have found him guilty), the court shall substitute for the verdict of not guilty on the ground of insanity a verdict of guilty of that offence, and shall have the like powers of punishing or otherwise dealing with the accused as the     270 CAP. 9.] CRIMINAL CODE  court before which he was tried would have had if the jury had come to the substituted verdict;  (b) in any other case, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall substitute for the verdict of the jury a verdict of acquittal:  Provided that where the offence mentioned in paragraph (a) is one for which the sentence is fixed by law, the sentence shall (whatever the circumstances) be one of imprisonment for life or for a term not less than twelve years.

Other computer-  related and content-related offences included in the Bill are computer related forgery,   computer related fraud and child pornography.   1.5 The Bill also enables the investigation and prosecution of such offences and introduces   procedural measures for the collection of evidence in electronic form particularly for   real time collection of data and expedited preservation of stored computer data.   2.0 CLAUSES      2.1 The Bill consists of 7 parts and 36 clauses.      2.2 Part 1 of the Bill provides the preliminary provisions.      2.3 Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by   Parliament, the new legislation will come into force on a date or dates appointed by the   Minister by notice in the Gazette.        26         2.4 Clause 2 of the Bill provides for the definitions of the terms used in the Bill.      2.5 Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the application of the provisions. If passed by   Parliament, the new legislation will apply to inter alia a person present in the territory   of Fiji when extradition of the person is not possible, solely on the basis of the person’s   nationality.      2.6 Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the savings of certain laws. For instance, clause 4 of   the Bill provides unless otherwise provided in the Bill or any other written law, nothing   in the Bill affects inter alia the liability, trial or punishment of a person for an offence   under any other written law. In addition, clause 4 provides that if a person performs an   act which is punishable both under the Bill and any other written law, the person may   only be punished under one such applicable written law.      2.7 Part 2 of the Bill provides for offences against the confidentiality, integrity and   availability of computer data and computer systems.      2.8 Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the offence of unauthorised access to computer systems   and the applicable penalties for individuals and body corporates. Clause 5 also outlines   what “securing access to a computer system” means and the circumstances in which   such access is unauthorised. In addition, clause 5 provides that in terms of the offence   of unauthorised access to computer systems, it is a defence if a person is acting in   reliance of any statutory power for the purpose of inter alia obtaining information.      2.9 Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the offence of unauthorised interception of computer   data or computer systems and the applicable penalties for individuals and body   corporates. Clause 6 also outlines what “an act of interception of any computer data to,   from and within a computer system” means. In addition, clause 6 provides that in terms   of the offence of unauthorised interception of computer data, it is a defence if a person   has the express consent of the person who sent the computer data and the intended   recipient of the computer data, or if a person is acting in reliance of an authorisation   under a court order or any statutory power.      2.10 Clause 7 of the Bill provides for the offence of unauthorised acts in relation to a   computer system or computer data and the applicable penalties for individuals and body   corporates. Clause 7 also outlines what “illegal data interference” means and the   circumstances in which an act performed in relation to a computer system is   unauthorised.      2.11 Clause 8 of the Bill provides for the offence of unlawful supply or possession of a   computer system or other device, or computer data and the applicable penalties for   individuals and body corporates.

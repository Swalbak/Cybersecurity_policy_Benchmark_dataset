Any person   may provide electronic communications networks or services in Cyprus under a   general authorisation regime and/or, on conditions, under an individual right of use   of radio frequencies or numbers, irrespective of whether or not they are of a   commercial or non-commercial nature and irrespective of whether or not they are   profit making.      29(b) of 51(I)   of 2012.   (2) The Commissioner shall be responsible for the grant of all general   authorisations, including the grant of individual rights of use relating to the use of     98      numbers, other than the authorisations relating to the use of radio frequencies.               29(c) of 51(I)   of 2012.   (3) A person wishing to provide electronic communications networks and/or   services pursuant to this Law under a general authorisation regime may commence   operations immediately following the filing of a formal notification with the   Commissioner. The provision of a network and/or service under a general   authorisation regime does not release the provider from the obligation to obtain the   necessary individual rights of use of radio frequencies, local permits and other   rights to install facilities from competent bodies.      146(Ι) 2002   15(Ι) 2003   16(Ι) 2004   ….

Where the   restriction of the number of individual rights of use of scarce resources is   necessary, such restrictions shall be managed so as to ensure that the assignment of   such resources is made in an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and   proportionate manner. The grant of individual rights of use of radio frequencies   falls within the exclusive competence of the Director, acting under the powers   vested in him in the Radio Communications Laws of 2002 to 2004. The   assignment of numbering resources falls within the exclusive competence of the   Commissioner.

(8) The Commissioner must respond to a relevant request of the Director, in all   cases where the Director is considering the restriction of the number of rights of   use of radio frequencies to be granted, and communicates to him in writing his   opinion as to whether a possible restriction of the number of rights of use of radio   frequencies to be granted is expected to maximise benefits for users and facilitate   the development of competition.        100      Notification process   for General   Authorisations.   30 of 51(I) of 2012.   38.

The Commissioner shall grant rights of use for numbers and/or   series of numbers to providers of electronic communications networks   and/or services for their own use and for further allocation to their   subscribers. Where the provision of the service in question requires the   assignment of an individual right of use of radio frequencies, the written     109         146(I) 2002   5(1) 2003   16(I) 2004   (2004)   request for an individual right of use of numbers shall be made after the   Director has granted such individual right under the Radio Communications   Laws of 2002 to 2004.

(b) The Commissioner shall support the harmonisation of the use of specific   numbers or series of numbers of the Phone Numbering Scheme of the   Republic of Cyprus within the Community, where that promotes the   functioning of the single market and the development of pan-European   services.       (3) The Commissioner may impose one or more of the following obligations   on any person operating under an individual right of use of numbers:      32(d) of 51(I)   of 2012.

In the case of numbers previously characterised by the holder   himself or by Decision of the Commissioner as numbers with exceptional   commercial value, should the Office decide, upon consultation with the interested   parties, to grant rights to use these numbers with competitive or comparative   selection procedures, the period of three weeks may be extended by another three   (3) weeks.      32(f) of 51(I)   of 2012.   (b) Where it has been decided after consultation with interested parties that the   rights for use of number of exceptional economic value are to be granted through   competitive or comparative selection procedures, the maximum period of three   weeks may be extended by another three (3) weeks.      32(g) of 51(I)   of 2012.   (5) A person to which a series of numbers is assigned must not discriminate against   other persons providing electronic communications services with regard to the   numbers used for access to their services.       (6) Numbers which are not used within one (1) year of the date provided for by the   relevant right of use may be reassigned by the Commissioner, in line with the   provisions of the Order referred to in subsection (1).       (7) Where competitive or comparative selection procedures are to be used, as   specified in a relevant Order of the Commissioner under Section 38(2), the   Commissioner may extend the maximum period of six (6) weeks referred to in   subsection (4) for as long as is necessary to ensure that such procedures are fair,     112      reasonable, open and transparent to all interested parties, but by no longer than   three (3) months.       (8) The Commissioner may, by Order, impose fees for the right to use numbers,   which reflect the need to ensure the optimal use of these resources and which must   be non-discriminatory.       (9) At reasonable intervals or at the reasonable request of affected persons, the   Commissioner may review the restriction on the number of rights of use by lifting   any restriction or increasing or decreasing the rights included in the relevant list. If   it is established that it is possible to expand the scope of the relevant rights of use   to include additional numbers, the Commissioner shall amend his Decision and   determine the type of procedure to be followed for such amendment.      32(h) of 51(I) of   2012.   (10) In the exercise of his powers relating to naming and addressing, the   Commissioner may, by Orders or Decisions, regulate the rules on naming and,   more specifically, supervise the administration and allocation of domain names and   shall represent Cyprus at international level regarding matters related to   addressing. In doing so, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the   decisions and guidelines set out by international organisations which act in these   fields and shall ensure the transparency of the procedures for the allocation of   domain names, such as domain names ending in “.cy”. and any other names   administered by or concerning the Republic of Cyprus.      32(i) of 51(I) of   2012.

For the purposes of implementing this subsection, the   Commissioner may appoint and authorise competent bodies for the control and   administration of domain names ending in “.cy”.      Provided that, in any case, where the said specialised bodies adopt a decision, they   shall not be required to obtain the opinion of the Advisory Committee.      6 of 113(I) of   2012.   (12) For the purpose of implementing Regulation 733/2002/EC of the European   Parliament and of the Council, of 22 April 2002 on the implementation of the .eu   Top Level Domain and Regulation 874/2004/EC of the Commission, of 28 April   2004, laying down public policy rules concerning the implementation and   functions of the .eu Top Level Domain and the principles governing registration,   the Commissioner shall exercise the competences of a validation agent in   accordance with the provisions of Articles 9, 10 and 13 of Regulation 874/2002/EC   concerning .eu Top Level Domain names for public bodies.      33 of 51(I) of 2012.

(3) The Commissioner may require the cessation of the breach referred to in   subsection (2), either immediately or within a reasonable time limit and take   appropriate and proportionate measures aimed at ensuring compliance.

The decision shall be notified to the person concerned within one week from its   issue and provides for a reasonable time period for compliance of the person with   its content and conditions.       (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Commissioner   may impose financial penalties, as appropriate, to persons that do not supply   information in accordance with the obligations imposed under Sections 39, 41 and   Part 10 of this Law, in relation to access and interconnection, within a reasonable   time limit prescribed by the Commissioner.        115       (5) In cases of serious and repeated breaches by a person of the conditions of the   general authorisation or of the rights of use, and where the measures taken to   ensure compliance have failed to impose such compliance, the Commissioner may   prevent the said person from continuing to provide electronic communications   networks or services pursuant to a general authorisation or may suspend or   withdraw the rights of use. In addition, he may impose efficient, proportionate and   dissuasive penalties to cover the period of any breach, even if where the breach has   been subsequently rectified.       (6) Notwithstanding subsections (2), (3) and (5), where the Commissioner has   evidence of a breach of the conditions of the general authorisation or the rights of   use that represents an immediate and serious threat to public security, public order   or public health or creates serious economic or operational problems for other   providers or users of electronic communications networks or services, he may   order urgent interim measures under Sections 28 and 33(2) to remedy the situation,   in advance of reaching a final decision. The provider concerned shall be given the   opportunity to make representations within a reasonable time limit.

PART 9   THE IMPOSITION OF REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS      36 of 51(I) of 2012.   Principles of   regulatory   intervention   following a market   review process.   46. (1) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Law, regulatory   obligations may only be imposed on persons designated by the   Commissioner as having significant market power in a relevant market. The   designation of a person or persons as having significant market power in a   relevant market presupposes a finding by the Commissioner that there is lack   of effective competition in the relevant market, as defined by the     119      Commissioner. The relevant markets, as well as the process of defining   further relevant markets and of analysis of the competition regime in a   relevant market shall be prescribed by the Commissioner in relevant Orders.       (2) Where the Commissioner decides that there is effective competition in a   defined market, he shall not impose regulatory obligations and where   regulatory measures apply, he shall withdraw the same after a reasonable   period of warning given to affected parties.       (3) Where the Commissioner decides that there is no effective competition in   the defined market, he shall proceed to designate one or more persons as   having significant market power and shall impose on such persons at least a   proportionate regulatory obligation.       (4) On completion of the review process of a relevant market in accordance   with subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this Section, the Commissioner shall   consult with the interested parties and the Commission for the Protection of   Competition regarding the draft notification, on the entire process, both prior   to consultation with the European Commission, BEREC and the Regulatory   Authorities of the other Member States in accordance with Section 50 and   after the issuance of a relevant Decision concerning the entire review process   of the relevant market.       (5) The consultation process, pursuant to the previous subsection, shall   provide all parties the opportunity to comment on the draft notification and   the decision within a prescribed time period, which shall, in no case, be less   than fifteen (15) days. The Commissioner shall ensure the existence of a   central information point, through which access to all consultations shall be   possible, and that the results of such consultation process are published on   his website subject to the right of the interested parties to protect their   confidential information pursuant to the specific protection provided by     120      Section 25 of this Law.       (6) In carrying out his functions under this Part, the Commissioner shall have   power to request from all persons providing electronic communications   networks and services in Cyprus all the information considered necessary to   allow him to fulfill his obligations when adopting a Decision under this Law.       (7) The market review process, which includes the definition of relevant   markets, the conduct of market analyses regarding the level of competition   on each market and the identification of appropriate and proportionate   remedies, shall be performed by the Commissioner for every relevant   market:       (a) Within three (3) months from the adoption of a previous measure with the   issuance of a relevant decision by the Commissioner. This above time limit   may be extended up to three (3) years in those cases where the   Commissioner submits a reasoned request to the European Commission and   the European Commission does not object within one (1) month from the   submission of such reasoned request by the Commissioner.       (b) within two (2) years from the adoption of a new recommendation for   relevant markets, in respect of those markets which shall be reviewed and   notified to the European Commission for the first time.       (8) In exceptional cases, where the Commissioner considers this to be   necessary in order to ensure healthy competition and safeguard the rights of   end users, he may issue an interim Decision by which he may take   proportionate and interim measures without conducting a public   consultation, or without consulting with the National Regulatory Authorities   in the other Member States or the European Commission or BEREC. Where   emergency measures are taken pursuant to this Section, the Commissioner     121      shall inform the European Commission, BEREC and the Regulatory   Authorities in the other Member States regarding the measures taken, by   relevant notification. Such notifications shall be fully justified by the   Commissioner and notified without delay. The Commissioner shall have the   right to make such measures permanent or extend their effect in accordance   with the procedure described in Sections 47 to 50B.       (9) In the case of transnational markets defined by decision of the European   Commission, affected Regulatory Authorities shall conduct a joint market   review, taking the utmost account of the European Commission guidelines,   and shall jointly decide whether to impose, maintain, amend or withdraw   regulatory obligations, where such obligations apply.       (10) In case the review of the relevant market defined in the recommendation   of the European Commission has not been completed within the deadlines   prescribed in Section (7), BEREC shall assist the Commissioner, upon   relevant request, in view of completing the review of the specific relevant   market and notifying the results thereof to the European Commission within   six (6) months, in accordance with the procedure set out in Sections 50A and   50B of this Law.      36 of 51(I) of 2012.   Definition of   relevant markets.   47. (1) The Commissioner shall, taking the utmost account of European   Union Law, define by Order the relevant markets as well as the procedure for   defining additional relevant markets, in accordance with the principles of   competition law, as appropriate to the circumstances of Cyprus.       (2) In the event that the Commissioner intends to define markets that differ   from those listed in the Recommendation published from time to time by the   European Commission, he shall follow the procedures set out in Section 46   of this Law, as further prescribed in a relevant Order by the Commissioner.        122            13(I) of 2008.   (3) Markets defined for the purposes of imposing regulatory obligations   under this Law shall be without prejudice to markets defined under the   Protection of Competition Law of 2008.      Market analysis   procedure.   37(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   48. (1) Having completed the definition of the relevant markets in   accordance with the procedure prescribed in Sections 46 and 47, the   Commissioner shall conduct an analysis of the competition regime.            37(b) of 51(1) of   2012.   (2) Where, as a result of the analysis of competition in a specific market, the   Commissioner finds that market not to be effectively competitive, he shall designate   a person or persons as possessing significant power in that market.               37(c) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) A person shall be deemed to have significant market power if, either   individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position equivalent to dominance,   which is understood to be a position of economic strength affording a person or   persons the power to behave, to an appreciable extent, independently of   competitors, customers and, ultimately, consumers.      37(d) of 51(I) of   2012.   (4) Where a person has Significant Market Power on a specific market (first   market), it may also be deemed to have Significant Market Power on a closely   related market (second market), where the links between the two markets in   question are such as to allow the market power held in the first market to be   leveraged into the second market, thereby strengthening the market power of the   person in question. Consequently, remedies aimed at preventing such leverage may   be applied in the second market in accordance with Sections 56, 57, 58 and 60 of   this Law. Where such remedies prove to be insufficient, remedies pursuant to   Section 65 of this Law may be imposed.            (5) Where, as a result of the analysis of the level of competition in a specific market,   the Commissioner concludes that the market is effectively competitive, he must not     123         37(e) of 51(I) of   2012.   impose or maintain any of the regulatory obligations referred to in Section 49 and   shall withdraw existing obligations imposed by prior relevant Decision, ensuring   that an appropriate period of notice is given to parties affected by any such   withdrawal.      37(f) of 51(I) of   2012.   (6) The market review performed by the Commissioner shall be forward-looking,   with a view to the Commissioner taking into account expected or foreseeable   technological or economic developments over the period until the next review of the   relevant market.      Remedy selection.   38(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   49. (1) The identification of a person or persons as having Significant Market   Power in a relevant market shall, individually or collectively, result in the   selection by the Commissioner of a reasonable remedial measure or   measures which shall be proportionate to the following objectives:      38(b) of 51(I) of   2012.                        38(c) of 51(I) of   2012.

(b) contributing to the development of the internal market, inter alia, by:      (i) removing remaining obstacles to the provision of electronic   communications networks and services, associated facilities and services and   electronic communications services at European level;      (ii) encouraging the establishment and development of trans-European   networks and the interoperability of pan-European services, and end-to-end   connectivity;      (iii) ensuring that, in similar circumstances, there is no discrimination in the   treatment of persons providing electronic communications networks and   services; and      (iv) cooperating with each other and with the European Commission and   BEREC in a transparent manner, such as to ensure the development of   consistent regulatory practice and the consistent application of legal   obligations under European Union Law.       (2) In selecting an appropriate regulatory measure or measures to address the   maintenance of effective competition, the Commissioner shall take the utmost   account of the desirability of such measures being technologically neutral in their   effect.         38(f) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) Where a finding of lack of effective competition relates to a market failure   concerning access or interconnection obligations falling within the scope of   Sections 56-61 of this Law, the Commissioner shall impose one or more of the   measures listed in those provisions and prescribed in Part 10, subject to the   provisions of subsection (3) of Section 53 of this Law.        125         38(g) of 51(I) of   2012.   (4) Where a finding of lack of effective competition relates to issues falling within   the scope of Part 11 of this Law, the Commissioner shall impose one or more of the   measures listed in those provisions.       (5) (6) and (7) are repealed by Section 38(h) of 51(I) of 2012.      39(a)(b) of 51(I) of   2012.

In case of amendment, the Commissioner must follow the   consultation process with the interested parties before submitting a new notification   to the European Commission.       (3) In case the objection of the European Commission concerns the regulatory   obligations that the Commissioner proposes to impose or withdraw in the   notification document, the Commissioner shall take no action on the basis of the   relevant market review results for a period of three (3) months, within which the   European Commission shall inform the Commissioner of its objections, setting out   its justified position.       (4) During the period of three (3) months provided in Section (3), the European   Commission, BEREC and the Commissioner shall cooperate closely in order to   identify the most suitable and effective measure, in the light of the objectives of this   Law, taking at the same time into consideration the views of market stakeholders   and the need to ensure the application of a uniform regulatory practice in the single   market.        129       (5) Within six (6) weeks from the commencement of the aforesaid three-month   period, BEREC shall issue an opinion, taken by majority vote, regarding the   objection of the European Commission referred to in subsection (3), on whether the   draft measure must be amended or withdrawn and, if required, shall submit specific   proposals to this end.

(3) Where exceptional circumstances are shown to exist, the Commissioner may   seek to impose on operators with Significant Market Power obligations on access or   interconnection other than those set out in Sections 56 to 65. He shall apply to the   European Commission for authorisation to impose same, under the procedure   described in an Order. While a Decision of the European Commission authorising   or preventing the imposition of such measures is pending, the Commissioner shall   abstain from the imposition of any such obligations, without prejudice to the powers   of the Commissioner to adopt urgent measures pursuant to Part 9.       (4) The obligations imposed in accordance with this Section shall be based on the   nature of the problem identified, be proportionate and justified and serve the   objectives laid down in Section 49 of this Law. Such obligations shall only be   imposed following consultation with the parties concerned, as prescribed in a   specific Order, which shall regulate these matters, and in the manner described in   Section 50 with respect to consultation with other regulatory bodies.      7 of 113(I) of 2007.

(1) The Commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 49   and 55 of this Law, impose on operators obligations for transparency in relation to   interconnection and/or access, requiring them to make public specified information,   such as accounting information, technical specifications, network characteristics,   terms and conditions for supply and use, including any terms for the restriction of   access or use of services and/or applications, where this is permitted by the national     136      2012. and/or European legislation, and prices.       (2) In particular, where an operator has an obligation of non-discrimination, the   Commissioner may require that operator to publish a reference service offer, which   must be sufficiently detailed to ensure that persons are not required to pay for   facilities which are not necessary for the service requested, giving a description of   the relevant offerings broken down into components and the terms of access   including prices.      46(b) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) Where an operator has the obligation to provide wholesale network   infrastructure access and the associated facilities, the Commissioner shall ensure the   publication of a reference access service offer, containing at least those elements set   out in the Decision in force at the time on the relevant market definition, the market   analysis and the imposition of regulatory obligations on the person with significant   market power in the relevant Wholesale Broadband Access Market.       (5) The Commissioner may by Decision:       (a) specify further and in detail the information to be made available and the   necessary details to be included in the reference service offer of subsections   (2) and (3), and the manner of its publication by the operator;       (b) impose amendments to the contents of the reference service offer of   subsections (2) and (3), aiming at the fulfilment of the obligations imposed   under this Law.       (5) The Commissioner shall issue an Order specifying the procedure of   imposing amendments to the reference service offer.      Obligation of non- 57. (1) The Commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of     137      discrimination.   8 of 113(I) of 2007.   Sections 49 and 55, impose on operators, obligations of non-discrimination   in relation to the provision of interconnection and/or access.       (2) Such obligations shall ensure that the operator that is the subject of the   obligation:       (a) provides access or interconnection by applying equivalent conditions in   equivalent circumstances to persons providing equivalent services; and       (b) provides services and information to third parties under the same conditions and   of the same quality as it provides for its own services, or those of its subsidiaries or   partners.      Obligation of   accounting   separation.   58. (1) The Commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and   the details prescribed in a specific Order, impose on operators obligations for   accounting separation in relation to specified activities regarding interconnection   and/or access.       (2) In particular, the Commissioner may require a vertically integrated person to   make transparent its wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, inter alia, to   ensure compliance where there is a requirement for non-discrimination and to   prevent unfair cross-subsidies. Additionally, the Commissioner may specify the   format and accounting methodology to be used, as is reflected in a specific Order.       (3) In order to establish compliance with the obligations of subsections (1) and (2)   of this Section and with the obligations of transparency and non-discrimination, the   Commissioner may require the submission of accounting records, including data on   revenues received from third parties, and audit such records, as analysed in a   specific Order and without prejudice to the obligation to respect the principle of     138      confidentiality that is included in subsection (3) of Section 25 of this Law.      Obligations of   access to, and use   of specific network   facilities.         47(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   59. (1) The Commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of this   Section, impose obligations on operators to meet reasonable requests for   access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities,   inter alia in cases where the Commissioner considers that denial of access,   or unreasonable terms and conditions which are equivalent to denial of   access, would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at   the retail level, or would not be in the interest of end users.      To this end, the Commissioner may, inter alia, require that operators:      47(b) of 51(I) of   2012.   (a) grant to third parties access to specified network elements and/or facilities,   including access to elements of the network which are not active or unbundled   access to the local loop to, inter alia, allow carrier selection and/or pre-selection   and/or subscriber line resale offer;       (b) negotiate in good faith with persons requesting access;       (c) not withdraw access to facilities already granted;       (d) provide specified services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties;       (e) grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that   are indispensable for the interoperability of the services or the virtual network   services;        139      47(c) of 51(I) of   2012.   (f) provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing;       (g) provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end   services to users, including facilities for intelligent network services or roaming on   mobile networks;       (h) provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems   necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services; and       (i) interconnect networks or network facilities.      47(d) of 51(I) of   2012.   (j) provide access to associated services, such as identity, location and   presence service:      47(e) of 51(I) of   2012.   Provided that the Commissioner may attach conditions to the enforcement of the   above obligations, in order to ensure these are fair, reasonable and up to date.       The conditions attached to the above obligations are fair and reasonable.      47(f) of 51(I) of   2012.   (2) In assessing whether to impose the obligations referred to in subsection (1) of   this Section, and in particular the proportionate imposition of these obligations in   accordance with the objectives of the legislation, as provided in Section 2 of this   Law, the Commissioner shall take into account the following main factors:               47(g) of 51(I) of   2012.   (a) the technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities,   in light of the rate of market development, taking into account the nature and type   of interconnection and access involved, including the viability of other access   products, such as access to ducts;     140         47(h) of 51(I) of   2012   (b) the feasibility of providing the access proposed, in relation to the capacity   available;      47(h) of 51(I) of   2012   (c) the initial investment by the facility owner, bearing in mind any public   investments already made and the risks involved in making the investment;      47(i) of 51(I) of   2012   (d) the need to safeguard competition in the long term, with special emphasis on   economically effective competition based on owned infrastructure;       (e) where appropriate, any relevant intellectual property rights; and       (f) the provision of pan-European services.      47(j) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) When imposing obligations on an operator to provide access in   accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Commissioner may lay   down technical or operational conditions to be met by the provider and/or   beneficiaries of such access, where necessary to ensure normal operation of   the network. The obligations to comply with specific standards or   specifications are consistent with the standards and specifications defined in   Section 53 of this Law.      Price control and   cost accounting   obligations.                     60.(1) The Commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and   the provisions of Orders issued by him, impose obligations relating to cost recovery   and price controls, including an obligation for the cost orientation of prices and an   obligation concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of   interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that   lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices   at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end users.     141            48(1) of 51(I) of   2012.   To encourage investments by the operator, in particular in next generation networks,   the Commissioner shall take into account the investment made by the operator and   allow him a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into   account any risks specific to a particular investment network project.       (2) The Commissioner shall ensure that any cost recovery mechanism or pricing   methodology that is mandated serves to promote economic efficiency and   sustainable competition and maximise consumer benefits. In this regard, the   Commissioner may also take account of prices available in comparable competitive   markets.       (3) Where an operator has an obligation regarding the cost orientation of its prices,   the burden of proof that charges are derived from costs including a reasonable rate   of return on investment shall lie with the operator concerned. For the purpose of   calculating the cost of the efficient provision of services, the Commissioner may   use cost accounting methods independent of those used by the person concerned.   The Commissioner may require an operator to provide full justification for its prices   and may, where appropriate, require prices to be adjusted retrospectively from the   time when the operator was under the cost orientation obligation.       (4) The Commissioner shall ensure that, where implementation of a cost accounting   system is mandated in order to support price controls, a description of the cost   accounting system is made publicly available, showing at least the main categories   under which costs are grouped and the rules used for the allocation of costs. The   Commissioner may entrust the inspections for the purpose of verifying an   operator’s compliance with the cost accounting system to another qualified   independent body. The Commissioner shall publish annually in the Official Gazette   of the Republic a statement concerning compliance under this Section.      49 of 51(I) of 2012.   Functional   60A. –(1) Where the Commissioner establishes that the obligations imposed in   accordance with Sections 56 to 61 of this Law have failed to secure effective     142      separation competition and that important long-standing problems of competition or market   weaknesses remain in the wholesale provision of certain access products, he may, as   an exceptional measure, in accordance with the provisions of Section 55 subsection   (3), impose an obligation on vertically integrated undertakings to place activities   related to the wholesale provision of related access products in an independently   operating business unit. The said business unit shall supply access products and   services to all undertaking, including other business units within the parent   company, on the same timescales, terms and conditions, including with regard to   price and service levels, and by means of the same systems and processes.       (2) When the Commissioner intends to impose an obligation for functional   separation, he shall submit to the European Commission, an application that   includes:       (a) evidence to justify the conclusion reached by the Commissioner under   subsection (1);       (b) a reasoned assessment from which it derives that there is little or no prospect of   effective and viable infrastructure-based competition within a reasonable time   frame;       (c) an analysis of the expected impact on the Regulatory Authority, the affected   provider, in particular the workforce of the provider under separation and the   overall sector of electronic communications, and on investment incentives in the   sector in general, regarding in particular the need to ensure social and territorial   cohesion, and on other interested parties, including the expected impact on   competition and potential effects on consumers;       (d) an analysis of the reasons for which this obligation would be the most efficient   means to enforce remedies aimed at addressing the competition problems or cases     143      of market dysfunction identified.       (3) The regulatory measure may include the following elements:       (a) the precise nature and level of separation, identifying in particular the legal   status of the separate legal entity;       (b) identification of the assets of the separate business entity and the products or   services to be supplied by this entity;       (c) the governance arrangements to ensure the independence of the staff employed   by the separate legal entity and the corresponding incentive structure;       (d) rules for ensuring compliance with the obligations;       (e) rules for ensuring transparency of operational procedures, in particular towards   other stakeholders;       (f) a monitoring programme to ensure compliance, including the publication of an   annual report.       (4) Following the decision of the European Commission on the draft measure taken,   the Commissioner shall conduct a coordinated review of the various markets related   to the access network. Based on his assessment, the Commissioner shall impose,   maintain, amend or withdraw the obligations, in accordance with Part 9 of this Law.       (5) An undertaking on which functional separation has been imposed may be   subject to any of the obligations identified in Sections 56 to 61 of this Law in any     144      specific market where it has been designated as having significant market power or   any other obligation authorised by the European Commission.      49 of 51(I) of 2012.   Voluntary   separation by a   vertically   integrated   undertaking   60B. –(1) Where providers that have been designated as having significant market   power in one or more relevant markets intend to transfer assets of their local access   network or a significant part thereof to a separate legal entity under a different   ownership or establish a separate business entity to ensure the provision of fully   equivalent access products to all retail providers, including their own retail   divisions, shall inform the Commissioner in advance and in due time in order to   allow him to assess the impact of the intended transfer. The undertakings shall also   inform the Commissioner of any change in the intended purpose, as well as the final   outcome of the separation procedure.       (2) The Commissioner shall assess the effect of the intended transfer on existing   regulatory obligations. To this end, the Commissioner shall conduct a coordinated   review of the various markets which are related to the access network. Based on that   assessment, the Commissioner shall impose, maintain, amend or withdraw   obligations, in accordance with Sections 50, 50A and 50B of this Law.       (3) The legally and/or functionally separate business entity may be subject to any of   the obligations of Sections 56 to 61 of this Law in any specific market where it has   been designated as having significant market power or any other obligation   authorised by the European Commission according to the procedure of Section 55,   subsection (3).      Accounting and   structural   separation and   financial reports.   61.(1) The Commissioner shall ensure that operators providing electronic   communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services   with special or exclusive rights for the provision of services in other sectors in   Cyprus are required to:        145       (a) keep separate accounts for the activities associated with the provision of   electronic communications networks or services, to the extent that they would be   required if these entities were carried out by legally independent companies so as to   identify all elements of costs and revenue;       (b) have structural separation for the activities associated with the provision of   electronic communications networks or services.       (2) In keeping the separate accounts referred to in subsection (1) of paragraph (b)   above, the basis of the calculation of costs must be described, as must the detailed   attribution methods used. The accounts must relate to the activities associated with   the provision of electronic communications networks and services, including an   itemised breakdown of fixed assets and structural costs.       (3) The Commissioner may, by Decision, at his discretion, choose not to apply the   requirements referred to in this Section to operators whose annual turnover   associated with electronic communications networks and services is less than EUR   50 million.                     50 of 51(I) of 2012.   (4) Unless they are subject to company law or benefits from the small and medium   size enterprise criteria of Community accounting rules, the operators subject to the   obligations imposed under this Section should have their reports, including those   referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1), drawn up and submitted to an   independent audit and published. This audit shall be carried out in accordance with   European Union Law and this Law.      Co-location and   facility sharing.   51 of 51(I) of 2012.   62. (1) When a person providing electronic communications networks has the right,   under national legislation, to install facilities on, over or under public or private   property, or may take advantage of a procedure for the expropriation or use of   property, the Commissioner shall have power to impose, taking into consideration     146      the principle of proportionality, the sharing of such facilities or property including,   inter alia, buildings or entrances to buildings, building wiring, masts, antennae,   towers and others supporting constructions, ducts, conduits, manholes and street   cabinets.       (2) The Commissioner shall have power to impose on the holders of the   rights referred to in subsection (1), the sharing of facilities or property   (including physical co-location) or the adoption of measures to facilitate the   coordination of public works because of the need to protect the environment   or public health or public security or to meet town and country planning   objectives, following a public consultation during which all interested parties   must be given an opportunity to express their views. Such sharing or   coordination arrangements may include rules for apportioning the costs of   facility or property sharing.       (3) Following public consultation, the Commissioner shall have power to impose on   the holders of the rights referred to in subsection (1) and/or on the owners of the   wiring, obligations regarding the sharing of the wiring within the buildings or up to   the first point of concentration or distribution, when located within a building, in   case the avoidance of re-installing an identical facility is justified, as it proves to be   economically ineffective or is not supported by the installation that supports the   current wiring. These arrangements for sharing or coordination may include rules   for the apportionment of the relevant costs, which shall take into account   investment and or financial risks, as applicable.       (4) (a) The Commissioner shall have power to impose on persons the obligation to   supply the necessary information, on the request of competent authorities, so that   the said authorities may, jointly with the Commissioner, draw up a detailed list of   the nature, availability and geographic position of the facilities referred to in   subsection (1) and make such list available to interested parties.        147       (b) The Commissioner may, on the request of any party, take measures to resolve an   issue or dispute relating to co-location or facility sharing agreements, pursuant to   Part 7 of this Law and the aforesaid agreement shall be deemed to be an   interconnection agreement for this purpose.       (5) The measures taken by the Commissioner in accordance with this Section   are objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate and may be   further regulated by Order of the Commissioner. Where relevant, the said   measures are applied in coordination with the local authorities.         52(a) of 51(I) of   2012.

(2) The enhanced digital television equipment deployed for the reception of   interactive digital television services broadcast on interactive digital   television “platforms” shall comply with an open API, in accordance with   the minimum requirements of the relevant standards or specifications, as   provided in Part 12.      52(d) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) The providers of digital television and equipment services must   cooperate to provide interoperable television services to end users with   special needs.               (4) Without prejudice to Section 25 of this Law, proprietors of APIs shall   make available on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and against     148      52(e)(f) of 51(I) of   2012.   appropriate remuneration, all such information as is necessary to enable   operators of interactive digital television services to provide all services   supported by the API in a fully functional form.      Conditional access   systems and other   facilities.   53(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   64. (1) The Commissioner shall ensure that, in relation to conditional access to   digital television and radio services broadcast to viewers and listeners in Cyprus,   irrespective of the means of transmission, the conditions laid down in an Order shall   apply.                  53(b) of 51(I) of   2012.   (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this Section, the Commissioner may, as soon   as possible after the entry into force of this Law and periodically thereafter, review   the conditions applied in accordance with this Section, by undertaking a market   review in accordance with the provisions of Part 9, in order to determine whether to   maintain, amend or withdraw the conditions applied. Where, as a result of this   market review, the Commissioner finds that one or more operators do not have   Significant Market Power on the relevant market, he may amend or withdraw the   conditions with respect to those operators, in accordance with the procedure set   forth in an Order, but only to the extent that such amendment or withdrawal would   not cumulatively adversely affect:       (a) accessibility of end users to the specific radio and television broadcasts and   broadcasting channels and services specified in accordance with this Section; nor       (b) the prospects for effective competition in the markets for:      (i) the retail sale of digital television and radio broadcasting services; and      (ii) conditional access systems and other associated facilities.     149          The Commissioner shall, in each of these cases, provide for an appropriate   period of notice to be given to parties affected by such amendment or   withdrawal of conditions, as elaborated in a relevant Order.      53(c) of 51(I) of   2012.

(b) obligations imposed under Part 15 would not result, according to the   Commissioner’s assessment, in the achievement of the objectives set out in this   Law.               54(c) of 51(I) of   2012.   (2) The obligations imposed by the Commissioner under subsection (1) of this   Section are based on the nature of the problem identified, are proportionate and   justified in the light of the objectives laid down in this Law and, inter alia, may   include the obligation that the identified persons:      54(d) of 51(I) of   2012.

(4) The Commissioner shall ensure that, where an operator is subject to tariff   regulation, the necessary and appropriate cost accounting systems are implemented.   The Commissioner may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used.   Compliance with the cost accounting system shall be verified by a qualified   independent body. The Commissioner shall ensure that a statement concerning   compliance is published annually.

(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commissioner may order the cessation   of the infringement of any provisions of this Part and impose any of the   penalties provided for in this Law.      (2) Unless otherwise provided in this Part, the Commissioner for the   Protection of Personal Data, in the exercise of his competences under   Section 23(e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) of the Processing of Personal Data   (Protection of the Individual) Laws of 2001 and 2003, shall have power to   examine cases or complaints involving potential infringement of Sections   99, 100, 101, 105 and 106.

PART 15   UNIVERSAL SERVICE      Scope and   availability of   universal service.               81(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   108. (1) The Commissioner shall ensure that the minimum set of services   specified in subsection (2) of this Section is made available at the level of   quality specified to all end users in the territory of Cyprus, independent of   their geographic location and, in the light of specific national conditions, at   an affordable price. Such services shall collectively constitute the concept of   Universal Service for Cyprus, as that concept is specified by Decision of the   Commissioner.      81(b) of 51(I) of   2012.               (2) The scope of Universal Service, which is to be determined by Decision   of the Commissioner, shall include at least the following services:      (a) Connection at a fixed location to the public electronic communications     215      81(c) of 51(I) of   2012.                        81(d) of 51(I) of   2012.      81(e) of 51(I) of   2012.      81(e) of 51(I) of   2012.   network and access to publicly available telephone services at a fixed   location, provided that the relevant request is considered to be reasonable.      (b) Directory enquiry services, and directories in a printed and/or in   electronic form.      (c) Public pay phones and/or other types of points of access to public pay   telephone service.      (d) Operator assistance services.      (e) Free access to emergency services, using the number “112” or other   emergency numbers.      The particular elements of the services listed in (a) to (d) are prescribed in   Sections 110-113 of this Law.       (3) The Commissioner shall determine the most efficient and appropriate   approach by which the provision of Universal Service shall occur, having   regard to the principles of objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and   proportionality. The aim of the Commissioner shall be to minimise the   degree of market distortion, in particular with regard to the provision of   services at prices or subject to other terms and conditions which depart from   normal commercial conditions, while at the same time safeguarding public   interest.       (4) Further to the adoption of a reasoned Decision by the Commissioner, and   upon consultation of the Commissioner with the Minister of   Communications and Works, the Commissioner may require, by way of a   reasoned Decision, that additional services be made available to the public,   beyond those listed in subsection (2) of this Section. In such circumstances,     216      no compensation mechanism involving specific persons shall be imposed.       (5) In considering whether a review of the scope of universal service   obligations should be undertaken, the Commissioner shall take into   consideration, inter alia, the following elements:      (a) social and market developments, measured in terms of the services used   by consumers;      (b) social and market developments, measured in terms of the availability   and choice of services to consumers;      (c) technological developments, measured in terms of the transit provided to   consumers.       (6) In considering whether the scope of universal service obligations should   be modified or redefined, the Commissioner shall take into consideration,   inter alia, whether:      (a) specific services are available to, and used by, a majority of consumers,   and whether the lack of availability or non-use by a minority of consumers,   is likely to result in social exclusion; and      (b) the availability and use of specific services would confer such a general   net benefit to all consumers of such importance that public intervention is   warranted in the circumstances where the specific services are not being   provided to the public under competitive commercial conditions.       (7) In determining the scope of universal service, from time to time, the   Commissioner shall take utmost account of the fact that the concept of   Universal Service should evolve to reflect advances in technology, market     217      developments and changes in user demand.      Designated persons   providing universal   service.   82(a) of 51(I) of   2012.   109. (1) The Commissioner shall designate, by Decision, one or more   persons which will be under an obligation to provide Universal Service for   such period as may be specified by the Commissioner, in compliance with   the conditions set forth in this Part of this Law, so that such Universal   Service may be made available across the entire geographic territory of   Cyprus.       (2) The Commissioner may designate different persons or groups of persons   to comply with one or more of the obligations referred to in subsection (1) of   this Section, or to cover different parts of the geographic territory of Cyprus.      82(b) of 51(I) of   2012.   (3) The Commissioner shall determine, by Decision, the criteria for selecting   the person or persons that are to provide Universal Service pursuant to the   requirements of this Law.      82(c) of 51(I) of   2012.   (4) In designating a person or persons under subsection (1), the   Commissioner shall adopt a designation mechanism which is efficient,   objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, according to which no given   person is a priori excluded from being designated as a provider of universal   service. The designation mechanism adopted shall ensure that the obligations   referred to in Section 108 of this Law are provided in a cost effective   manner, and may be used in such a way as to provide the Commissioner with   the means of determining the net cost of the universal service obligation.      82(c) of 51(I) of   2012.   (5) The Commissioner shall notify the European Commission of the   universal service obligations imposed on the designated persons under   subsection (2). Any change affecting these obligations or the undertakings   concerned by this Part shall be notified to the European Commission.        218      82(d) of 51(I) of   2012.   (6) In case a person designated under subsection (1) intends to make   available all the elements of the local access network or a significant part   thereof to a distinct legal entity under different ownership, it shall first notify   the Commissioner in time, so that he may assess the consequences of the   planned transaction on the provision of access at a fixed location and the   provision of telephone services. As a result, the Commissioner may impose,   amend or lift specific obligations in the general authorisation of the licenced   provider.      83 of 51(I) of 2012.   Provision of access   at fixed locations.   110. (1) A person or persons designated to provide universal service in accordance   with Section 109 of this Law shall satisfy any reasonable request to provide, at a   fixed location, connection to a public communications network.       (2) The connection provided must support voice (making and receiving national and   international calls) and facsimile communication, as well as data transmission at   adequate speeds of functional access to the internet. The minimum speed of data   transmission shall be determined in a Decision taken by the Commissioner, having   regard to prevailing market conditions, include the speed of access used by the   majority of subscribers and available technologies. The Commissioner’s Decision   shall aim to minimise the risk of market distortion.      83 of 51(I) of 2012.   Directory enquiry   services.   111. (1) The Commissioner shall ensure that subscribers of publicly available   telephone services have the right to include their contact details in the publicly   available record referred to in Section 108(2)(b) of this Law and described in   subsection (2) of this Section, which shall be notified to the providers of the   directory enquiry service.       (2) The Commissioner shall ensure that the person or persons designated as   universal service provider(s) in accordance with Section 109 of this Law:     219          (a) make available to end users, at least one comprehensive directory of subscribers,   in a form approved by the Commissioner, either in printed or electronic or in both   forms, which shall be updated on a regular basis, and not less than once a year; and       (b) make available to all end users, including the users of points of access to public   pay telephone service, a comprehensive directory enquiry telephone service.       (3) (a) A person or persons designated as universal service providers in accordance   with Section 109 of this Law shall, subject to the relevant Data Protection and   Privacy obligations set forth in Part 14 of this Law and supplementary obligations   adopted thereunder, shall keep a record (to be known as the Cyprus Directory   Database) of all subscribers of publicly available telephone services in Cyprus,   including those with fixed, personal and mobile numbers, who have not refused to   be included in that record, and shall permit access to any information contained in   such record to any other person offering directory enquiry services in accordance   with such terms and conditions as may be specified by it and approved from time to   time by the Commissioner. Persons that assign telephone numbers to subscribers   are under the obligation to notify to the universal service provider who is   responsible for the provision of the directory enquiry services, all the contact details   of their subscribers who have not refused to be in included in the “Cyprus Directory   Database”, and which are necessary for the publication of directories and the   provision of directory enquiry services based on fair, objective, cost-oriented and   non-discriminatory conditions.       (b) The directories referred to in subsection (2) shall include all subscribers of   publicly available telephone services, subject to the requirements for the protection   of personal data and privacy.        220       (4) (a) The Commissioner shall ensure that all end users to whom a publicly   available telephone service is provided shall have access to directory enquiry   services.       (b) In addition, the Commissioner may impose obligations and conditions on   persons controlling the access of end users to directory enquiry services such as to   enable access of end users to offered services. These conditions and obligations   shall be objective, equitable, transparent and non-discriminatory.       (c) The Commissioner shall not impose regulatory restrictions which prevent end   users in one Member State from accessing directly the directory enquiry service in   another Member State by voice call or SMS and shall take measures to ensure such   access pursuant to the provisions of Section 74 of this Law.       (5) Subsections (1) and (4) apply subject to the legislation that protects personal   data and privacy and in particular Section 105 of this Law.      84(a)(b) of 51(I) of   2012.   Public pay   telephones and   other points of   access to public   pay telephone   service.   112.

(2) The Commissioner may specify the terms and conditions applicable to the   provision of points of access to public pay telephone service, for the purpose of   ensuring that the requirements set forth in subsection (1) of this Section are   satisfied.     221          (3) The Commissioner may decide not to impose obligations under subsection (1)   of this Section, to all or part of his territory if, pursuant to a consultation with   interested parties and having regard to the views expressed to him, he considers that   the said facilities or compatible services are available to satisfy the reasonable   needs for such services in that geographic area, taking into account, inter alia, the   population density in such geographic area and the relative state of development of   the communications market in that area.       (4) The Commissioner may review any Decision adopted under subsection (3) of   this Section as and when he considers such a review to be appropriate.      84(d) of 51(I) of   2012.

(2) A request made under subsection (1) of this Section shall be accompanied by     226      such supporting information as may be reasonably required by the Commissioner   for the purposes of subsection (3) of this Section. The data may cover such period   as may be specified by the Commissioner.       (3) The Commissioner shall, on the basis of the information supplied pursuant to   subsection (2) of this Section, where such information is considered to be sufficient   to enable a determination under this subsection to be made, determine whether an   obligation referred to in subsection (1) of this Section represents an unfair burden   on the person concerned.       (4) Where the Commissioner determines that the obligation referred to in   subsection (1) of this Section may represent an unfair burden on the person   designated to provide such obligation, the Commissioner shall calculate the net cost   of its provision, based on:      (a) the net cost of its provision, taking into account any market benefit which   accrues to the undertaking concerned, calculated in accordance with a relevant   Order, or      (b) where applicable, the net cost identified under an efficient, objective,   transparent and non-discriminatory designation mechanism, according to which no   undertaking is a priori excluded from being designated, and whose key elements   are set forth in a relevant Order.       (5) The persons designated in accordance with Section 109 of this Law shall   provide such information as may be reasonably required by the Commissioner for   the purposes of satisfying the requirements of subsection (4) of this Section.     227          (6) Where the Commissioner determines that an obligation referred to in subsection   (1) of this Section does not represent an unfair burden, it shall notify the person   concerned of that determination, together with the relevant reasons, as soon as is   reasonably practicable thereafter.       (7) The accuracy of the accounts and/or other information which serves as the basis   for the calculation of the net cost of obligations under this Part shall be audited or   verified, as is considered to be appropriate, by the Commissioner or approved by   the Commissioner where that approval body is independent of the person   concerned.       (8) The results of the cost calculations and the conclusions of any audit or   verification undertaken pursuant to this Section shall be published in two daily   newspapers and on the Commissioner’s website within thirty (30) days of being   notified to the Commissioner.      Financing of   universal service   obligations.   118.(1) Where the Commissioner, on the basis of the net cost calculation referred to   in Section 117 of this Law, concludes that the net cost of meeting obligations under   Sections 110-115 of this Law represents an unfair burden on the persons concerned,   he shall, upon receiving a request from a person or persons designated in   accordance with Section 109 of this Law:      (a) introduce a mechanism to compensate that person for the determined net cost   under transparent conditions from public funds, and/or      (b) apportion the net cost of universal service obligations between the providers of     228      electronic communications networks and services.       (2) Where the Commissioner decides to apportion the net cost in accordance with   subsection 1(b) of this Section, he shall establish by Order an apportionment   mechanism to be administered by him or by a body under his supervision, which   shall be independent from the persons designated in accordance with Section 109 of   this Law. Only the net cost, as calculated in accordance with Section 117 of this   Law, of those obligations provided for in Sections 110-115 of this Law, may be   financed.       (3) The apportionment mechanism established under subsection (2) of this Section   shall respect the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality,   and shall also be designed as to cause minimum distortion on the market and the   patterns of user demand. The apportionment mechanism shall rely upon a   transparent and neutral means of collecting contributions in order to avoid the risk   of double imposition of contributions falling within both the expenses and revenues   of the person concerned. The Commissioner may choose not to require   contributions from persons whose audited national turnover is less than a specified   amount as may, from time to time, be determined by the Commissioner. The   national turnover level justifying exemption from the requirements of this Section   shall be published by the Commissioner.       (4) Any charges related to the apportionment of the cost of universal service in   accordance with subsection (1) of this Section shall be unbundled and identified   separately for each person.       (5) The Commissioner shall not impose any charges, pursuant to this Part, on   persons not providing services within the geographic territory of the Republic of   Cyprus.     229          (6) The Commissioner shall notify in writing each person required to share the cost   of universal service of its obligation to contribute to such cost, including the   amount, the manner and the timing of payments to be made.       (7) A person which has been notified of its obligation to contribute an amount   specified by the Commissioner shall pay that amount in the time and manner   specified by the Commissioner.       (8) The Commissioner shall publish and make publicly available all information in   relation to the principles used for cost apportionment, including the details of the   apportionment mechanism used. The Commissioner shall maintain and accept as   confidential all information supplied by the persons providing electronic   communications networks or services expressed by them to be confidential or   containing business secrets, except where he has good reason to consider such   requests to be unfounded.       (9) The Commissioner shall, subject to the exclusion of any information considered   to be confidential or to contain business secrets, publish an annual report setting out   the calculated net cost of universal service obligations. This annual report shall   identify the contributions made by all persons concerned, and shall identify any   market benefit that may have accrued to any designated persons.

In such case,   the tariffs and terms of service provision must comply with the principles of   transparency and non-discrimination. Also, they shall apply equally, for equivalent   services, both as between different third parties and as between third parties and the   universal service provider. Any such tariffs shall also be available to users, in   particular individual users and small and medium-sized enterprises using the postal   services under similar conditions.

(2) The universal postal service provider shall have the obligation, upon   request by a licenced postal service provider, to begin negotiations with such   provider concerning the possibility of providing thereto access to a postal   services network. The universal service provider may refuse access, if the   operational capacity of the facilities or its operational reliability is put at risk   or if there is no staff available to provide the requested service.       (3) In case negotiations fail or a reasonable time period has elapsed and an   outcome has not been reached, the Commissioner may intervene either ex   officio or upon written request of either of the parties, for the purpose of   issuing a decision to resolve the dispute.       (4) Upon their conclusion, all access agreements shall be submitted to the   Commissioner.

(5) Where the Commissioner establishes that the abolition of a term of a licence   regarding access to electronic communications networks, which was valid before the   entry into force of this Law, creates great difficulties to undertakings which had an   access licence to another network, and where these undertakings cannot negotiate new   agreements on reasonable commercial terms before the date of entry into force of this   Law, the Commissioner may request from the European Commission the temporary   prolongation of the relevant terms. The relevant application must specify the terms   and the period for which the temporary prolongation is requested.       (6) A person which has paid, before the entry into force of the present Law, any   administrative charge or fee to an authority responsible for the regulation of electronic   communications or postal services on the basis of an authorisation regime that was in   force before the entry into force of this Law, shall have no obligation to pay any   administrative charge or fee for the rest of the period for which the previous payment   was made.      31 of 160(I) of   2013.

Second Annex   [Section 123(I)]       Guidance on calculating the net cost, if any, of the universal postal service       Part A: Definition of the Universal Postal Service        281       The universal postal service prescribed in Section 119B shall include uniform prices   throughout the Republic. It may also include, inter alia, the following:       (i) a number of days of delivery superior to those set in Section 119B;      (ii) a minimum number of accessible points of access, in order to satisfy the universal   service obligations;      (iii) affordable prices for the universal postal service in the Republic of Cyprus;      (iv) uniform prices for the universal service throughout the Republic of Cyprus,   subject to the provisions of Section 124;      (v) provision of certain free services for blind or partially-sighted persons.       Part B: Calculation of net cost       The Commissioner shall consider all means to ensure appropriate incentives for   postal service providers (designated or not) to provide universal service obligations   cost efficiently.       The net cost of universal postal service obligations is any cost related to and   necessary for the operation of the universal postal service provision. The net cost of   universal postal service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the   net cost of the universal postal service provider of operating with the universal postal   service obligations and the same postal service provider operating without the     282      universal postal service obligations.       The calculation shall take into account all other relevant elements, including any   intangible and market benefits which accrue to a postal service provider designated to   provide universal postal service, the entitlement to a reasonable profit and incentives   for cost efficiency.       Due attention is to be given to correctly assessing the costs that any designated   universal postal service provider would have chosen to avoid, had there been no   universal postal service obligation. The net cost calculation should assess the   intangible benefits to the universal postal service operator.       The calculation shall be based upon the costs attributable to:       (i) elements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or under   cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards. This category may   include elements such as the services defined in Part A;       (ii) specific users or groups of users who, taking into account the cost of providing   the specified service, the revenue generated and any uniform prices imposed by the   Commissioner, can only be served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside   normal commercial standards.       This category includes those users or groups of users that would not be served by a   commercial operator that did not have an obligation to provide universal service.       The calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal postal service   obligations is to be made separately and so as to avoid the double counting of any     283      direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal postal service   obligations to any designated universal postal service provider is to be calculated as   the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of universal postal   service obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for   verifying the net cost lies with the Commissioner. The universal postal service   provider shall cooperate to enable the verification of the net cost.       Part C: Recovery of the net cost of the universal postal service obligations       The recovery or financing of any net costs of universal postal service obligations may   require the designated universal postal service provider to be compensated for the   services offered under non commercial conditions.       As such compensation involves financial transfers, the Commissioner has to ensure   that they are undertaken in an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and   proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result as far as possible in the   least distortion to competition and to user demand.       Pursuant to Section 123 of this Law, a sharing mechanism based through the   compensation fund should use transparent and neutral means for collecting   contributions, in order to avoid a double imposition of contributions falling on both   outputs and inputs of undertakings.       The compensation fund shall be responsible for collecting contributions from the   providers which are assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of the universal   service obligations and shall oversee the transfer of sums due to the universal postal   service provider entitled to receive payments from the fund.           284       PART 16   POSTAL SERVICES   CHAPTER I   UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND SERVICE RESERVED TO POSTS      Universal   postal service.   9(a) of 160(I)   of 2013.   119.

Calculation of   the net cost of   the universal   service. Second   Annex.   123. (1) The Commissioner shall specify by Order the method of calculation of the   net cost of the universal service, in accordance with the guidance set out in the   Second Annex to this Law and, upon being informed by the universal service provider   on the net cost arising from his obligation to provide universal service, he shall   proceed to the control and verification thereof.       (2) The net cost of universal service provision shall be borne by the universal service   provider concerning the part of the postal service provision within the scope of the   universal service, and the postal service operators under special licence concerning   the part of the postal service provision within the universal service. In case a postal   service provider is not active within the scope of the universal service, then the net   cost of universal service provision shall be covered by the State budget and deposited   directly in the compensation fund established under subsection (5).       (3) The apportionment of the cost shall be made by the Commissioner, in a   transparent, objective and neutral manner, taking into consideration, mutatis   mutandis, the gross income of each operator who is active within the scope of     288      the universal service.       (4) The Commissioner shall have competence to calculate and individualise   the contributions under this Section for each postal service provider.

(2) In case the Commissioner imposes an administrative fine or other   pecuniary fine under this Law and/or Orders issued thereunder, as a result of   an act or omission of a legal person, liability for the act or omission and for   the payment of the administrative fine shall lie, apart from the legal persons   themselves, with the persons referred to in paragraph (1).      91 of 51(I) of   2012.   Transitional   provisions.   161. (1) All obligations imposed on persons providing public electronic   communications networks and/or services concerning access and   interconnection that were in force before the 31 st  of December of 2009, shall   be maintained until such time as these obligations are reviewed by the   Commissioner under this Law.     332          (2) The Commissioner shall maintain all obligations imposed before the 31 st    of December 2009 relating to:       (a) retail tariffs for the provision of access to and use of the public telephone   network;       (b) carrier selection or pre-selection; and       (c) leased lines.

(4) Where the application of subsection (5) leads to a limitation of the rights or an   extension of the obligations on the basis of existing general authorisations and   individual rights of use, the Commissioner may extend the validity of these rights and   obligations until the 30 th  of September 2012 at the latest, provided the rights of other   persons under Community law are not affected.

Second Annex   [Section 123(I)]       Guidance on calculating the net cost, if any, of the universal postal service       Part A: Definition of the Universal Postal Service       The universal postal service prescribed in Section 119B shall include uniform prices   throughout the Republic. It may also include, inter alia, the following:       (i) a number of days of delivery superior to those set in Section 119B;      (ii) a minimum number of accessible points of access, in order to satisfy the universal   service obligations;     335         (iii) affordable prices for the universal postal service in the Republic of Cyprus;      (iv) uniform prices for the universal service throughout the Republic of Cyprus,   subject to the provisions of Section 124;      (v) provision of certain free services for blind or partially-sighted persons.       Part B: Calculation of net cost       The Commissioner shall consider all means to ensure appropriate incentives for   postal service providers (designated or not) to provide universal service obligations   cost efficiently.       The net cost of universal postal service obligations is any cost related to and   necessary for the operation of the universal postal service provision. The net cost of   universal postal service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the   net cost of the universal postal service provider of operating with the universal postal   service obligations and the same postal service provider operating without the   universal postal service obligations.          The calculation shall take into account all other relevant elements, including any   intangible and market benefits which accrue to a postal service provider designated to   provide universal postal service, the entitlement to a reasonable profit and incentives   for cost efficiency.        336       Due attention is to be given to correctly assessing the costs that any designated   universal postal service provider would have chosen to avoid, had there been no   universal postal service obligation. The net cost calculation should assess the   intangible benefits to the universal postal service operator.       The calculation shall be based upon the costs attributable to:       (i) elements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or under   cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards. This category may   include elements such as the services defined in Part A;       (ii) specific users or groups of users who, taking into account the cost of providing   the specified service, the revenue generated and any uniform prices imposed by the   Commissioner, can only be served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside   normal commercial standards.       This category includes those users or groups of users that would not be served by a   commercial operator that did not have an obligation to provide universal service.       The calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal postal service   obligations is to be made separately and so as to avoid the double counting of any   direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal postal service   obligations to any designated universal postal service provider is to be calculated as   the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of universal postal   service obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for   verifying the net cost lies with the Commissioner. The universal postal service   provider shall cooperate to enable the verification of the net cost.           337       Part C: Recovery of the net cost of the universal postal service obligations       The recovery or financing of any net costs of universal postal service obligations may   require the designated universal postal service provider to be compensated for the   services offered under non commercial conditions.       As such compensation involves financial transfers, the Commissioner has to ensure   that they are undertaken in an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and   proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result as far as possible in the   least distortion to competition and to user demand.       Pursuant to Section 123 of this Law, a sharing mechanism based through the   compensation fund should use transparent and neutral means for collecting   contributions, in order to avoid a double imposition of contributions falling on both   outputs and inputs of undertakings.       The compensation fund shall be responsible for collecting contributions from the   providers which are assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of the universal   service obligations and shall oversee the transfer of sums due to the universal postal   service provider entitled to receive payments from the fund.",

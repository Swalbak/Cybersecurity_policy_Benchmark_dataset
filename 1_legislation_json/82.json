Search warrant 7. (1) If a judge of the District Court is satisfied by information on oath of a member that   there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the  commission of a relevant offence is to be found in any place, the judge may issue a  warrant for the search of that place and any persons found at that place.  (2) A search warrant under this section shall be expressed, and shall operate, to authorise  a named member, accompanied by such other members or persons or both as the  member thinks necessary—  (a) to enter, at any time within one week of the date of issue of the warrant, on  production if so requested of the warrant, and if necessary by the use of  reasonable force, the place named in the warrant,  (b) to search it and any persons found at that place, and  (c) to examine, seize and retain anything found at that place, or anything found in  possession of a person present at that place at the time of the search, that that  member reasonably believes to be evidence of, or relating to, the commission of a  relevant offence.

(5) A member acting under the authority of a search warrant under this section may, for  the purpose of investigating the commission of a relevant offence, require any person  at the place to which the search warrant relates to—  (a) give to the member his or her name and address, and  5     S.7 [No. 11.] Criminal Justice (Offences [2017.] Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017.  (b) provide such information to the member as he or she may reasonably require.  (6) The Police (Property) Act 1897 or, where appropriate, section 25 of the Criminal  Justice Act 1951 shall apply to property which has come into the possession of the  Garda Síochána under this section as that Act or such section 25, as the case may be,  applies to property which has come into the possession of the Garda Síochána in the  circumstances mentioned in that Act concerned.  (7) A person who—  (a) obstructs or attempts to obstruct a member acting under the authority of a search  warrant under this section,  (b) fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (4)(b) or (5), or  (c) in relation to a requirement under subsection (5), gives a name and address or  provides information which the member has reasonable cause for believing is  false or misleading in a material respect,  shall be guilty of an offence.  (8) The power to issue a warrant under this section is without prejudice to any other  power conferred by statute to issue a warrant for the search of any place or person.  (9) In this section—  “computer” includes a personal organiser or any other electronic means of  information storage and retrieval;  “computer at the place that is being searched” includes any other computer, whether  at the place being searched or at any other place, which is lawfully accessible by  means of that computer;  “member” means a member of the Garda Síochána who falls within paragraph (a) of  the definition of “member” in section 3(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.

(3) A person who commits an offence under section 7(7) shall be liable on summary  conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or  both.  (4) (a) Where a court is determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an  offence under section 3 or 4, the fact that the commission of the offence involved  misusing the personal data of another person (“rightful identity owner”) with the  aim of gaining the trust of a third party, thereby causing prejudice to the rightful  identity owner, shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of  determining the sentence.  (b) Accordingly, the court shall (except when the court considers that there are  exceptional circumstances justifying it not doing so) impose a sentence that is  greater than that which would have been imposed in the absence of such a factor.  (c) The sentence imposed shall not be greater than the maximum sentence  permissible under this section for the offence concerned under section 3 or 4.  Liability for offences by body corporate, etc. 9. (1) Where a relevant offence (other than an offence under this subsection) is committed   for the benefit of a body corporate by a relevant person and the commission of the  relevant offence is attributable to the failure, by a director, manager, secretary or other  officer of the body corporate, or a person purporting to act in that capacity, to  exercise, at the time of the commission of the relevant offence and in all the  circumstances of the case, the requisite degree of supervision or control of the  relevant person, the body corporate shall be guilty of an offence.  (2) In proceedings for an offence under subsection (1), it shall be a defence for a body  corporate against which such proceedings are brought to prove that it took all  reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the  offence.  (3) Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and it is proved  that the offence was committed with the consent or connivance, or was attributable to  any wilful neglect, of a person who was a director, manager, secretary or other officer  of the body corporate, or a person purporting to act in that capacity, that person shall,  as well as the body corporate, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be  proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of the first-mentioned  offence.  (4) Subsection (1)—  (a) is without prejudice to the other circumstances, under the general law, whereby  acts of a natural person are attributed to a body corporate resulting in criminal  liability of that body corporate for those acts, and  (b) does not exclude criminal proceedings against natural persons who are involved  as perpetrators, inciters or accessories in an offence under this Act.  (5) In this section—  7     S.9 [No. 11.] Criminal Justice (Offences [2017.] Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017.  “relevant person”, in relation to a body corporate, means—  (a) a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, or a person  purporting to act in that capacity, or  (b) an employee, subsidiary or agent of the body corporate;  “subsidiary”, in relation to a body corporate, has the meaning it has in the Companies  Act 2014.  Jurisdiction 10. (1) A person may be tried in the State for a relevant offence in relation to an act, to which   this subsection applies by virtue of subsection (2), committed, whether in whole or in  part—  (a) by the person in the State in relation to an information system outside the State,  (b) by the person outside the State in relation to an information system in the State,  or  (c) by the person outside the State in relation to an information system outside the  State if—  (i) that person is a person to whom this subparagraph applies by virtue of  subsection (3), and  (ii) the act is an offence under the law of the place where the act was committed.  (2) Subsection (1) applies to an act which, if it had been committed by a person in the  State in relation to an information system in the State, would constitute a relevant  offence.  (3) Subsection (1)(c)(i) applies to each of the following persons:  (a) an Irish citizen;  (b) a person ordinarily resident in the State;  (c) a body corporate established under the law of the State;  (d) a company formed and registered under the Companies Act 2014;  (e) an existing company within the meaning of the Companies Act 2014.  (4) For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident in  the State if he or she has had his or her principal residence in the State for the period  of 12 months immediately preceding the alleged commission of the relevant offence  concerned.  (5) Proceedings for an offence to which subsection (1)(c) applies may be taken in any  place in the State and the offence may for all incidental purposes be treated as having  been committed in that place.  8    [2017.] Criminal Justice (Offences [No. 11.] Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017.  Evidence in proceedings for offences outside State 11.

(2) A document purporting to be a certificate under subsection (1)(a) or (b) is deemed,  unless the contrary is shown—  (a) to be such a certificate, and  (b) to have been signed by the person purporting to have signed it.  Double jeopardy 12. (1) Where a person has been acquitted of an offence in a place outside the State, he or she   shall not be proceeded against for a relevant offence consisting of the alleged act or  acts constituting the first-mentioned offence.  (2) Where a person has been convicted of an offence in a place outside the State, he or  she shall not be proceeded against for a relevant offence consisting of the act or acts  constituting the first-mentioned offence.

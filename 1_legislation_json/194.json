V C H A P T E R F I V E   CRIMINAL OFFENCE   Article 21  Criminal Offence   A criminal offence is an unlawful act that is prescribed as a criminal offence by law, the characteristics  of which are specified by law and for which a criminal sanction is prescribed by law.   Article 22  Manner of Perpetrating Criminal Offence   (1) A criminal offence can be perpetrated by an act or an omission to act.   (2) A criminal offence is perpetrated by omission when the perpetrator, who is legally obligated to avert the  consequence of a criminal offence defined by law, fails to do so, and such failure to act is tantamount in its  effect and significance to the perpetration of such a criminal offence by an act.   Article 23  Time of Perpetrating Criminal Offence   A criminal offence is perpetrated at the time the perpetrator acts or ought to have acted, irrespective of  the time when the consequences of his action or omission to act occurred.   Article 24  Place of Perpetrating Criminal Offence   (1) A criminal offence is perpetrated both at the place perpetrator acts or ought to have acted, and at the  place where the consequence of his action or omission to act fully or partially occurs.   (2) A criminal offence in the case of a punishable attempt is perpetrated both at the place perpetrator acts or  ought to have acted, and at the place where the consequence of his action or omission to act fully or partially  ought to have occurred according to the perpetrator’s expectation.   (3) A criminal offence in cases of complicity is perpetrated at the place specified in paragraph 1 of this  Article and at the place the accomplice acts or ought to have acted, or at the place where the consequence of  his action or omission to act ought to have occurred according to the expectation of the accomplice.   Article 25  Insignificant Offence   The act that is due to the manner of perpetrating, insignificance or absence of harmful consequences and  low degree of criminal responsibility of the perpetrator an insignificant act, shall not be considered a criminal    8    offence although it has characteristics of a statutory criminal offence.   Article 26  Necessary Defence (Self-Defence)   (1) An act committed in necessary defence is not considered a criminal offence.   (2) A defence is considered necessary if it is absolutely necessary for the defender to avert a coinciding or  direct and imminent illicit attack from himself or from another, and which is proportionate to the attack.   (3) A perpetrator, who exceeded the limits of necessary defence, may be punished less severely, and if he  perpetrated the excess due to strong irritation or fright caused by the attack, may be released from  punishment.   Article 27  Extreme Necessity   (1) An act committed out of extreme necessity is not considered a criminal offence.   (2) Extreme necessity exists when an act was committed for the purpose of averting from the perpetrator or  from another a coinciding or direct and imminent unprovoked danger that could not have been averted in any  other way, provided that the harm resulting from such act did not exceed the harm threatened.   (3) A perpetrator, who himself has negligently provoked the danger, or who has exceeded the limits of  extreme necessity, may be punished less severely, and if the excess was perpetrated under particularly  extenuating circumstances, may be released from punishment.   (4) There is no extreme necessity if the perpetrator was under an obligation to expose himself to the danger.   Article 28  Attempt   (1) Whoever intentionally commences perpetration of a criminal offence, but does not complete it, shall be  punished for the attempted criminal offence when, for the criminal offence in question, the punishment of  imprisonment for a term of three years or a more severe punishment may be imposed, and for the attempt of  another criminal offence when the law expressly prescribes punishment for the attempt alone.   (2) A perpetrator shall be punished for an attempt of criminal offence within the limits of the punishment  prescribed for the same criminal offence completed, but may also be punished less severely.   Article 29  Inappropriate Attempt   A perpetrator, who tries to perpetrate a criminal offence by inappropriate means or toward an  inappropriate object, may be released from punishment or punished less severely.   Article 30  Voluntary Abandonment of the Attempt   (1) A perpetrator, who tried to perpetrate a criminal offence, but has voluntarily abandoned the perpetration  of a punishable attempt, may be released from punishment.   (2) In the event of voluntary abandonment of an attempt, the perpetrator shall be punished for those acts that  constitute other separate criminal offences.   Article 31  Accomplices   If several persons jointly perpetrate a criminal offence, by participating in the perpetration of a criminal  offence or by taking some other act by which a decisive contribution can be made to its perpetration, each of    9    them shall be punished by a punishment prescribed for that criminal offence.   Article 32  Incitement   (1) Whoever intentionally incites another to perpetrate a criminal offence, shall be punished as if he had  perpetrated such offence.   (2) Whoever intentionally incites another to perpetrate a criminal offence for which a punishment of  imprisonment for a term of three years or a more severe punishment may be imposed, and the criminal  offence has never been attempted, shall be punished as for the attempt of the criminal offence.   Article 33  Accessory   (1) Whoever intentionally helps another in perpetration of a criminal offence, shall be punished as if he  himself perpetrated such offence, but may be punished less severely.   (2) The following, in particular, shall be considered as helping in the perpetration of a criminal offence:  giving advice or instructions as to how to perpetrate a criminal offence, supplying the perpetrator with tools  for perpetrating a criminal offence, removing obstacles to the perpetration of criminal offence, and  promising, prior to the perpetration of the criminal offence, to conceal the existence of the criminal offence,  to hide the perpetrator, the tools used for perpetrating the criminal offence, traces of the criminal offence, or  items acquired by perpetration of the criminal offence.   Article 34  Limitations of Criminal Responsibility and Punishability of Collaborators   (1) The accomplice shall be considered criminally responsible within the limits set by his own intent or  negligence, and the inciter and the accessory within the limits of their own intent.   (2) The court shall refrain from imposing a punishment on an accomplice, inciter or accessory that has  voluntarily prevented perpetration of the criminal offence.   (3) The personal relations, characteristics and circumstances to which the law attaches the exclusion of  criminal responsibility, or by reason of which it permits or provides for the remission of punishment or its  mitigation may be taken into consideration only if they are inherent to such perpetrators, accomplices,  inciters or accessories.   V I C H A P T E R S I X   CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY   Article 35  Elements of Criminal Responsibility   (1) A perpetrator who is mentally capable and guilty of perpetrating a criminal offence shall be held  criminally responsible.   (2) A perpetrator shall be guilty if he has perpetrated a criminal offence with intent.   (3) A perpetrator shall also be guilty if he has perpetrated a criminal offence out of negligence only if the  law explicitly prescribes so.   Article 36  Mental Capacity   (1) A mentally incapable person is one who, at the time of perpetrating the criminal office, was incapable of    10    comprehending the significance of his acts or controlling his conduct due to a permanent or temporary  mental disease, temporary mental disorder or retardation (mental incapacity).   (2) If the capacity of the perpetrator to comprehend the significance of his act, and his ability to control his  conduct was considerably diminished due to any of the mental conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this  Article, he may be punished less severely (considerably diminished mental capacity).   (3) The perpetrator shall be considered criminally responsible if, by consuming alcohol or narcotic drugs or  otherwise, he brought himself into such a state of not being capable to comprehend the significance of his  actions or controlling his conduct, and if prior to bringing himself into such a condition, the act was intended  by him, or there was negligence on his part in relation to the criminal offence in cases where criminal  responsibility is prescribed by law for such an offence even if perpetrated out of negligence (voluntary  intoxication).   (4) The state of considerably diminished mental capacity to which the perpetrator has brought himself in the  way provided referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article may not constitute grounds for the mitigation of  punishment.   Article 37  Intent   (1) A criminal offence may be perpetrated with direct or indirect intent.   (2) The perpetrator acts with direct intent when a perpetrator was aware of his deed and desired its  perpetration.   (3) The perpetrator acts with indirect intent when a perpetrator was aware that a prohibited consequence  might have resulted from his action or omission to act but nevertheless consented to its occurrence.   Article 38  Negligence   (1) A criminal offence may be perpetrated by advertent or inadvertent negligence.   (2) The perpetrator acts with advertent negligence when he was aware that a prohibited consequence might  have occurred as a result of his action or omission to act, but carelessly assumed that it would not occur or  that he would be able to avert it.   (3) The perpetrator acts with inadvertent negligence when he was unaware of the possibility that a  prohibited consequence might have occurred, although, under the circumstances and according to his  personal characteristics, he should and could have been aware of such possibility.   Article 39  Mistake of Fact   (1) A person is not criminally responsible if at the time of the perpetration of a criminal offence, he was not  aware of one of its elements defined by law, or if he has mistakenly believed that circumstances existed  which, if they had actually existed, would render such conduct permissible.   (2) If the person's mistake resulted from his negligence, he shall be criminally responsible for the criminal  offence perpetrated out of negligence, provided that the criminal offence in question is punished by law  when perpetrated out of negligence.   Article 40  Mistake of Law   A perpetrator of a criminal offence, who had justifiable reason for not knowing that his conduct was  prohibited, may be punished less severely or released from punishment.    11    V I I C H A P T E R S E V E N   PUNISHMENT      Article 41  Types of Punishment    (1) The following punishments may be imposed on perpetrators of criminal offences who are criminally  responsible:   a) Imprisonment;   b) Fine.   (2) Imprisonment may be imposed only as principal punishment.   (3) A fine may be imposed both as a principal and as an accessory punishment.   (4) If both punishments are prescribed for a criminal offence, only one of them may be imposed as a  principal punishment.   (5) For criminal offences motivated by greed, a fine may be imposed as an accessory punishment even when  that is not specifically prescribed by the law or in cases where the law prescribes that the perpetrator shall be  punished by imprisonment or a fine, and the court decides to impose the punishment of imprisonment as the  principal punishment.   Article 42  The Purpose of Punishment   The purpose of punishment is:   a) To express the community’s condemnation of a perpetrated criminal offence;   b) To deter the perpetrator from perpetrating criminal offences in the future;   c) To deter others from perpetrating criminal offences; and   d) To increase the consciousness of citizens of the danger of criminal offences and of the fairness of  punishing perpetrators.   Article 43  Imprisonment   (1) Imprisonment may not be shorter than thirty days or longer than twenty years.   (2) For the gravest forms of serious criminal offences perpetrated with intent, imprisonment for a term of  twenty to forty-five years may be prescribed (long-term imprisonment).   (3) Long-term imprisonment may never be prescribed as the sole principal punishment for a particular  criminal offence.   (4) Long-term imprisonment may not be imposed on a perpetrator who has not reached twenty-one years of  age at the time of perpetrating the criminal offence.   (5) Under the conditions prescribed by Chapter X (Rules Relating to Educational Recommendations,  Educational Measures and Punishing Juveniles) of this Code, juvenile imprisonment may be imposed.  Juvenile imprisonment is in its purpose, nature, duration and manner of execution a special punishment of    12    deprivation of liberty.   (6) Imprisonment shall be imposed in full years and months; however, the punishment of imprisonment for a  term not exceeding six months may also be imposed in full days. Long-term imprisonment shall be imposed  only in full years.   (7) If long-term imprisonment has been imposed, amnesty or pardon may be granted only after three-fifths  of the punishment has been served.   Article 44  Community Service   (1) When the court metes out and imposes imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, at the same  time it may decide that such punishment, with the consent of the accused, be replaced with community  service.   (2) The decision to replace imprisonment with community service shall be based upon the assessment that,  considering all the circumstances determining the type and range of the sentence, the execution of  imprisonment would not be necessary to realise the purpose of punishment, but at the same time a suspended  sentence would not be sufficient to accomplish the general purpose of criminal sanctions.   (3) Community service shall be determined for duration proportional to the imposed imprisonment, from a  minimum of ten to a maximum of sixty working days. The period for performing community service shall be  neither shorter than one month nor longer than one year.   (4) In assessing the duration of community service, as well as the period for its performance, the court shall  take into consideration the imposed imprisonment that is being substituted and the perpetrator’s possibilities  regarding his personal circumstances and employment.   (5) When, upon the expiry of the determined period, the convicted person has not completed or has only  partly completed the community service, the court shall render a decision on the execution of imprisonment  for a period proportional to the unfulfilled community service.   (6) The substitution of imprisonment with community service may also be applied in the case of substituting  a fine with imprisonment pursuant to Article 47 (Substitution of Fine) of this Code.   (7) Placement in community service as to the type and the place of work shall be made by the cantonal  ministry in charge of justice matters pursuant to the residence or domicile of the convicted person and taking  into consideration his capacities and skills.   Article 45  Release on Parole   (1) A convicted person who has served half of his sentence, and as an exception, a convicted person who has  served one third of his sentence, may be released from serving the punishment of imprisonment under  condition that he does not perpetrate another criminal offence before expiration of the time of the sentence  (parole, conditional release).   (2) A convicted person, who has served half of his sentence, may be released from serving the punishment  of imprisonment if in the course of serving his sentence his conduct has improved to the point where he can  reasonably be expected to behave himself appropriately after his release from serving the punishment of  imprisonment, and particularly not perpetrate criminal offences. In determining whether to release a  convicted person on parole, account shall be taken of his conduct during the term of the sentence, as well as  other circumstances indicating that the purpose of the punishment has been attained.   (3) A convicted person who has served one third of his sentence may be released on parole, provided that  the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article exist, and provided that special circumstances relating  to the personality of the convicted person manifestly indicate that the purpose of the punishment has been  attained.    13    (4) The person sentenced to long-term imprisonment may be granted conditional release after three-fifths of  the punishment have been served.   Article 46  Revocation of Parole   (1) The court shall order revocation of parole if the convicted person, while on parole, perpetrates one or  more criminal offences for which a punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year or a more severe  punishment has been imposed.   (2) The court may order revocation of parole if the parolee perpetrates one or more criminal offences for  which a punishment of imprisonment for a term up to one year has been imposed. In deciding whether to  revoke the parole or not, the court shall take into special consideration the similarity in the nature of the acts  perpetrated, their significance, the motives out of which they were perpetrated, as well as other  circumstances indicating the appropriateness of revoking parole.   (3) When the court orders revocation of parole, it shall impose punishment considering the previously  imposed sentence as an already fixed punishment. The part of the punishment that the convicted person  served under the earlier sentence shall be credited toward service of the subsequent sentence, whereas the  period of time spent on parole shall not be credited.   (4) The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3 of this Article shall also be applied when the parolee is tried  for a criminal offence perpetrated prior to his release on parole.   (5) If the parolee is convicted to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and if the court does not  order revocation of parole, the term of the release on parole shall be extended for a period of time the  convicted person spent serving the punishment of imprisonment.   Article 47  Fines   (1) Fines are imposed in daily amounts and if that is not possible, then in a fixed amount.   (2) If a fine is imposed in daily amounts, it may be a minimum of five and maximum of three hundred sixty  daily amounts, whereas for criminal offences motivated by greed, a maximum imposable fine is one  thousand five hundred daily amounts, except in the cases foreseen by this Code.   (3) If a fine is imposed in a fixed amount, a minimum amount may not be less than 150 KM and a maximum  one may not exceed 50.000 KM whereas for criminal offences motivated by greed, a maximum fixed amount  imposable may not exceed 1.000.000 KM, except in the cases foreseen by this Code.   (4) In imposing a fine for criminal offences motivated by greed, the court may impose a fine exceeding the  maximum prescribed amount in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article if the value of the illegal gain acquired  through the perpetration of criminal offence exceeds the amount of 1.000.000 KM. In such case, the  perpetrator may be imposed a fine in an amount that may not exceed the double amount of the value of the  illegal gain acquired through the perpetration of criminal offence for which he is being imposed a fine.   (5) A number of daily amounts is determined by the court according to the general rules on meting out  punishments. A daily amount is determined by the court according to the amount of the perpetrator’s daily  income calculated on the basis of his net salary during three months and his other income and family  responsibilities. In determining the amount, the court relies on the data not older than six months at the  moment when the fine is imposed.   (6) Data referred to in paragraphs 1 through 5 that are not known to the court, shall be provided by the  accused within the deadline set by the court, but not later than by the closing of the main trial in criminal  proceedings. If the circumstances relevant for the determination of a daily amount of fine are not known to  the court by the end of the main trial in criminal proceedings, a fine is imposed in a fixed amount whereby  the general rules for meting out punishments are applied.    14    (7) A minimum daily amount of fine is 1/60 and a maximum amount is 1/3 of the most recent officially  published employee’s average net salary in the Federation, as published by the Agency of Statistics of the  Federation.   (8) The deadline for payment of the fine is determined in the judgement, but may not be shorter than fifteen  days or longer than six months, but the court may allow in justified cases that the convicted person pays the  fine in instalments, whereby the deadline for payment may not exceed two years.   (9) Fines imposed and collected under this Code shall be credited to the Budget of the Federation.   Article 48  Substitution of Fine   (1) Fine shall not be collected by force.   (2) If a fine is not paid in full or in part within the period determined in the judgement, the court shall,  without delay, issue a decision to substitute the fine by imprisonment.   (3) The fine shall be substituted by imprisonment in such a way that each daily amount started, or if the fine  was imposed in a fixed amount each 50 KM started, is substituted by one day of imprisonment, whereby the  imprisonment may not exceed one year.   (4) If the convicted person has only paid a portion of the fine, the remaining amount will be proportionally  converted into imprisonment and if he then pays the remaining amount, the execution of imprisonment  ceases.   Article 49  General Principles of Meting out Punishments   (1) The court shall mete out the punishment for the perpetrator of a criminal offence within the limits  prescribed by law for that criminal offence, having in mind the purpose of punishment and taking into  account all the circumstances bearing on the magnitude of punishment (extenuating and aggravating  circumstances), and in particular: the degree of criminal responsibility, the motives for perpetrating the  offence, the degree of danger or injury to the protected object, the circumstances in which the offence was  perpetrated, the personal history of the perpetrator prior to the perpetration, his personal situation and his  conduct after the perpetration of the criminal offence, as well as other circumstances related to the person of  the perpetrator.   (2) In meting out the punishment for the perpetrator of a criminal offence perpetrated in recidivism, the  court shall take into special consideration whether the most recent offence is of the same type as the previous  one, whether both acts were perpetrated from the same motive, and the period of time which has elapsed  since the previous conviction or served or pardoned punishment.   (3) In meting out a fine, the court shall take into consideration also the situation of the perpetrator in terms  of property, taking into account the amount of his salary, his other income, his assets and his family  obligations.   Article 50  Reduction of Punishment   The court may met out the punishment for the perpetrator below the limit prescribed by the law, or  impose a less severe type of punishment:   a) When law prescribes that the perpetrator may be punished less severely; and   b) When the court determines the existence of highly extenuating circumstances, which indicate that the  purpose of punishment can be also attained by a reduced punishment.   Article 51    15    Limitations in Reduction of Punishment   (1) When the conditions for the reduction of punishment referred to in Article 50 (Reduction of Punishment)  of this Code exist, the court shall reduce the punishment within the following limits:   a) If a punishment of imprisonment of ten or more years is prescribed as the lowest punishment for the  criminal offence, the punishment may be reduced to five years of imprisonment;   b) If a punishment of imprisonment of three or more years is prescribed as the lowest punishment for  the criminal offence, the punishment may be reduced to one year of imprisonment;   c) If a punishment of imprisonment of two years is prescribed as the lowest punishment for the  criminal offence, the punishment may be reduced to six months of imprisonment;   d) If a punishment of imprisonment of one year is prescribed as the lowest punishment for the criminal  offence, the punishment may be reduced to three months of imprisonment;   e) If a punishment of imprisonment not exceeding one year is prescribed as the lowest punishment for  the criminal offence, the punishment may be reduced to thirty days of imprisonment;   f) If a punishment of imprisonment is prescribed for a criminal offence without indication of the lowest  limit, a fine may be imposed instead of imprisonment;   g) If a fine is prescribed for a criminal offence with the indication of the lowest amount, the  punishment may be reduced up to five daily amounts and if it is imposed in the fixed amount, it may  be reduced to 150 KM.   (2) When deciding on the extent of reducing punishment pursuant to the rules set forth in paragraph 1 of this  Article, the court shall take into special consideration the lowest and the highest measure of punishment  prescribed for the particular criminal offence.   Article 52  Release from Punishment   (1) The court may release the perpetrator of a criminal offence from punishment when such possibility is  explicitly prescribed by law.   (2) In cases when the court is allowed to release the perpetrator of a criminal offence from punishment, the  court may decide to reduce the punishment having no regard to limitations in reduction of punishment  prescribed in Article 50 (Reduction of Punishment) of this Code.   Article 53  Special Condition for Release from Punishment for Criminal Offences Perpetrated out of negligence   The court may release from punishment the perpetrator of a criminal offence perpetrated out of  negligence, when the consequences of the offence affect the perpetrator so severely that imposing a  punishment would obviously not serve the purpose of punishment.   Article 54  Concurrence of Criminal Offences   (1) If the perpetrator, by a single action or by several actions, has perpetrated several criminal offences, for  which he is tried at the same time, the court shall first determine the punishment for each of the criminal  offences separately, and then proceed with imposing a compound punishment of imprisonment, long-term  imprisonment or a compound fine for all the criminal offences taken together.   (2) The court shall adhere to the following rules in imposing compound punishment:   a) If the court has determined punishment of long-term imprisonment for one of concurrent criminal    16    offences, it shall impose only that punishment;   b) If the court has determined punishment of imprisonment for the concurrent criminal offences, the  compound punishment must be higher than each of the individual punishments, but may not be as  high as the sum of all incurred punishments, nor may it exceed a period of twenty years;   c) If for each of the concurrent criminal offences a punishment of imprisonment not exceeding three  years is prescribed, the compound punishment may not exceed eight years;   d) If fines only have been determined by court for the concurrent criminal offences, the compound  punishment must be higher than any individual determined fine, but it may not exceed the sum of all  determined fines.   (3) If the court has determined punishments of imprisonment for some of the concurrent criminal offences,  and fines for other concurrent criminal offences, it shall impose the compound punishment of imprisonment  and the compound fine, pursuant to the provisions set forth in paragraph 2, items b) through d) of this  Article.   (4) The court shall impose an accessory punishment if it is determined for at least one of the concurrent  criminal offences, and if the court has determined several fines, it shall impose the compound fine pursuant  to the provisions set forth in paragraph 2, item d) of this Article.   (5) If the court has determined punishments of imprisonment and juvenile imprisonments for the concurrent  criminal offences, it shall impose the compound punishment pursuant to the provisions set forth in paragraph  2, items b) and c) of this Article.   Article 55  Continued Criminal Offence   (1) The provisions of this Code regarding concurrence of criminal offences shall not apply to a criminal  offence arising out of the same transaction.   (2) A criminal offence arises out of the same transaction when the perpetrator intentionally perpetrates a  number of identical criminal offences or offences of the same type which, according to the manner of  perpetration, the temporal connection and other material circumstances connecting them constitute a whole.   (3) When a criminal offence arising of the same transaction comprises offences of the same legal  description, the court shall choose the type and the range of the punishment prescribed for such a criminal  offence. If criminal offences of the same type are at issue, the court shall choose the type and the range of  punishment prescribed for the most serious of these offences.   Article 56  Meting out Punishment for a Convicted Person   (1) If a convicted person is tried for a criminal offence perpetrated before commencing to serve the previous  sentence, or for a criminal offence perpetrated while serving a sentence of imprisonment, long-term  imprisonment or juvenile imprisonment, the court shall impose a compound punishment for all the criminal  offences applying provisions set forth in Article 53∗ (Concurrence of Criminal Offences) of this Code, taking  the punishment from the earlier sentence as an already fixed punishment. The sentence or part of the  sentence, which the convicted person had already served, shall be credited toward the imposed sentence of  imprisonment or long-term imprisonment.   (2) For a criminal offence perpetrated during the course of serving the punishment of imprisonment, long- term imprisonment or juvenile imprisonment, the court shall impose to the perpetrator the punishment  independently of the punishment from the earlier sentence, in cases when the application of the provisions      ∗ Should be 54.    17    set forth in Article 53∗ of this Code would lead to failure to achieve the purpose of punishment considering  the duration of non-served portion of the previous sentence.   (3) To a convicted person who, while serving the punishment of imprisonment, long-term imprisonment or  juvenile imprisonment, perpetrates a criminal offence for which the law prescribes a fine or punishment of  imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, a disciplinary measure shall be applied.   Article 57  Credit for the Period Spent in Custody and Credit for Punishment under an Earlier Sentence   (1) The time spent in custody pending trial, as well as any deprivation of freedom related to the criminal  offence, shall be counted as part of the imposed punishment of imprisonment, long-term imprisonment,  juvenile imprisonment or fine.   (2) The fine paid or prison term served upon conviction for a minor offence shall be counted in the  punishment imposed a criminal offence whose characteristics are the same as characteristics of the minor  offence.   (3) In each counting of the credit, one day spent in custody pending trial, one day of deprivation of freedom,  one day of juvenile imprisonment, one day of imprisonment, one day of long-term imprisonment and the  amount of 50 KM, shall be deemed equal.   Article 58  Credit for the Detention and Sentence Served Abroad   The detention, deprivation of freedom in the course of an extradition procedure, as well as the  punishment which the perpetrator served upon a judgement of a foreign court, shall be counted in the  punishment imposed by the domestic court for the same criminal offence, whereas if the punishments are not  of the same kind, the credit for the punishment served abroad shall be effected in a way the court finds fit.   V I I I C H A P T E R E I G H T   WARNING SENTENCES (NON-CUSTODIAL MEASURES)   Article 59  Types of Warning Sentences   Warning sentences are:   a) Judicial admonition;   b) Suspended sentence.   Article 60  Purpose of Warning Sentences   (1) The purpose of judicial admonition is to give to a criminally responsible perpetrator a reprimand, when a  punishment does not need to be imposed to achieve the purpose of criminal sanctions nor to ensure criminal  justice protection.   (2) The purpose of a suspended sentence is to give to a perpetrator of a criminal offence a reprimand with a  threat of punishment, which achieves the purpose of criminal sanctions by pronouncing a punishment  without executing it, when the execution of punishment is not necessary to ensure criminal justice protection.      ∗ Should be 54.    18    Article 61  Judicial Admonition   (1) A judicial admonition may be pronounced for criminal offences for which a punishment of imprisonment  for a term not exceeding one year or a fine is prescribed, which have been perpetrated under such  extenuating circumstances which render them particularly minor, when, given all the circumstances  regarding the perpetrator, his attitude toward the injured party and compensation for the damage caused by  the criminal offence in particular, all requirements have been met for achieving the purpose of criminal  sanctions without punishment.   (2) A judicial admonition may be pronounced also for a particular criminal offence for which a punishment  of imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years is prescribed, under conditions prescribed by law and  when the other conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article are met.   (3) Judicial admonition may be pronounced also for concurrent criminal offences, if for each of those  offences the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are met.   (4) In deciding whether to pronounce a judicial admonition, the court shall, taking into account the purpose  of judicial admonition, give special consideration to the personality of the perpetrator, his personal history  prior to the perpetration, his conduct after the perpetration of the criminal offence, the degree of criminal  responsibility and other circumstances under which the criminal offence has been perpetrated.   (5) A judicial admonition may not be pronounced to military persons for criminal offences against the armed  forces of the Federation.   Article 62  Suspended Sentence   (1) By a suspended sentence the court determines a punishment for the perpetrator of criminal offence, but  at the same time orders that it shall not be executed if the convicted person does not perpetrate another  criminal offence over a period of time established by the court, which may not be shorter than one or longer  than five years (probation period).   (2) In deciding whether to pronounce a suspended sentence, the court shall, taking into account the purpose  of the suspended sentence, give special consideration to the personality of the perpetrator, his personal  history prior to the perpetration, his conduct after the perpetration of the criminal offence, the degree of  criminal responsibility and other circumstances under which the criminal offence has been perpetrated.   (3) A suspended sentence may be imposed when a punishment of imprisonment for a term not exceeding  two years or a fine has been determined for the perpetrator.   (4) A suspended sentence may be pronounced for criminal offences for which the punishment of  imprisonment for a term of ten years or a more severe punishment may be imposed, only if a punishment  referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article has been determined by reduction of the punishment prescribed by  law.   (5) A suspended sentence may not be pronounced for criminal offences for which even after a reduction of  the punishment, a punishment of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year may not be imposed.   (6) If both a punishment of imprisonment and a fine have been determined for the perpetrator, the suspended  sentence may be pronounced either for both punishments or only for the punishment of imprisonment.   (7) Security measures, ordered alongside a suspended sentence, shall be executed.   Article 63  Obligations of the Person under Suspended Sentence   (1) In a suspended sentence, the court may order the following obligations: that the convicted person shall  make a restitution of the gain acquired by the perpetration of the criminal offence, that the convicted person    19    shall compensate for the damage caused by the perpetration of the criminal offence, or that the convicted  person shall fulfil other obligations provided for in criminal legislation in the Federation.   (2) For the fulfilment of an obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the court shall determine the  period, which period shall be within the determined probation period.   Article 64  Revocation of Suspended Sentence because of a New Criminal Offence   (1) The court shall revoke the suspended sentence if the convicted person perpetrates one or more criminal  offences for which a punishment of imprisonment for a term of two years or a more severe punishment had  been imposed before the probation period expired.   (2) If the convicted person perpetrates one or more criminal offences during the probation period for which  the punishment of imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine has been imposed, the court  shall decide, upon consideration of all circumstances related to the criminal offences perpetrated as well as to  the perpetrator, particularly the possible similarity of the perpetrated offences, their significance and motives  from which the offences have been perpetrated, whether to revoke the suspended sentence. In taking such  decision, the court is bound by the prohibition on imposing a suspended sentence if a punishment of  imprisonment for a term exceeding two years (Article 62, Suspended Sentence, paragraph 3 of this Code)  needs to be imposed on the perpetrator for the criminal offence for which the suspended sentence was  imposed and for new criminal offences.   (3) In the event of revocation of the suspended sentence, the court shall impose one compound punishment  both for the previously perpetrated and the new criminal offence, pursuant to the provisions of Article 54  (Concurrence of Criminal Offences) of this Code, taking the revoked suspended sentence as an already fixed  punishment.   (4) In the event that the court does not revoke a suspended sentence, it may impose a suspended sentence or  a punishment of imprisonment for a newly perpetrated criminal offence. If the court decides that a suspended  sentence should be imposed for the newly perpetrated criminal offence as well, the court shall apply  provisions set forth under Article 54 of this Code to impose one compound sentence both for the previously  perpetrated and the new criminal offence and it shall also determine one compound probation period, which  may not be shorter than one or longer than five years, commencing on the day the new sentence became  effective. If the court imposes a punishment of imprisonment for the new criminal offence, the period of time  spent serving that punishment of imprisonment shall not be deducted from the probation period established  by the suspended sentence for the previously perpetrated criminal offence.   Article 65  Revocation of Suspended Sentence because of Previously Perpetrated Criminal Offence   (1) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence in case that, after it was imposed, it learned that the  perpetrator had perpetrated a criminal offence prior to the imposition of the suspended sentence, and the  court deems that there would have not been enough grounds for the imposition of a suspended sentence had  the existence of that criminal offence been known. In such a case, the provision set forth under Article 64  (Revocation of Suspended Sentence Because of a New Criminal Offence) paragraph 3 of this Code shall be  applied.   (2) If the court does not revoke a suspended sentence, it shall apply the provision set forth under Article 64,  paragraph 4 of this Code.   Article 66  Revocation of Suspended Sentence caused by Failure to Fulfil Particular Obligations   (1) The court shall revoke the suspended sentence and order the execution of the imposed punishment if the  convicted person, within the course of the determined probation period, does not fulfil the obligations  imposed on him in cases where he could have fulfilled them.   (2) In the case of the impossibility of fulfilling the obligations, the court may extend the deadline for the    20    fulfilling of the obligations, or may replace such obligations with other obligations provided for in criminal  legislation in the Federation, or relieve the convicted person of the obligations.   Article 67  Deadlines for Revocation of Suspended Sentence   (1) A suspended sentence may be revoked during the probation period.   (2) If a convicted person perpetrates a criminal offence entailing revocation of the suspended sentence  during this period, but it is established by judgement only after the expiration of the probation period, the  suspended sentence may be revoked at the latest one year after the probation period has expired.   (3) If a convicted person fails to fulfil a certain obligation referred to in Article 63 (Obligations of the  Person under Suspended Sentence) paragraph 1 of this Code within the determined deadline, the court may  revoke the suspended sentence no later than one year after the expiration of the probation period, and order  execution of the punishment imposed as the suspended sentence.   Article 68  Suspended Sentence with Protective Guardianship   (1) The court may order that a perpetrator, who has been subject to a suspended sentence, be placed under  protective guardianship if, upon having considered the circumstances of the criminal offence, personality of  the perpetrator, his personal history prior to the perpetration and his conduct after perpetrating the criminal  offence, it came to the conclusion that it would contribute to achieving more efficiently the purpose of  suspended sentencing and social rehabilitation.   (2) Protective guardianship encompasses measures of assistance, care, supervision and protection outlined  under this Code, provided that the protective guardianship may not last less than six months nor it may  exceed two years.   Article 69  Contents of Protective Guardianship   Protective guardianship may include the following obligations:   a) Treatment in an appropriate health institution;   b) Refraining from intake of alcoholic drinks or opiates (intoxicating drugs);   c) Attending particular psychiatric, psychological or other counselling centres and acting in accordance  with their instructions;   d) Training for a certain profession;   e) Accepting employment which is appropriate to the skills and abilities of the perpetrator;   f) Disposing with the salary or other income and property in an appropriate way and in accordance with  marital or family obligations.   Article 70  Ordering Protective Guardianship   (1) The court orders in a judgement one or several obligations set forth under Article 69 (Contents of  Protective Guardianship) of this Code, determining what exactly they cover.   (2) When ordering the obligations referred to in Article 69 of this Code, the court shall take into special  consideration the age of the perpetrator, his general physical and mental condition, his life inclinations and  habits, especially at home, in school or at work, the motives out of which the criminal offence has been  perpetrated and his conduct after perpetrating the criminal offence, his personal history prior to the    21    perpetration, personal and family circumstances, as well as other circumstances related to the person of the  perpetrator, which are important for selecting the obligations within protective guardianship and their  duration.   (3) If, during protective guardianship, the court establishes that the purpose of the protective guardianship  has been attained, it may terminate the protective guardianship before the expiration of determined period.   (4) If a convicted person to whom the protective guardianship has been ordered fails to fulfil obligations  imposed on him by the court, the court may warn him or may replace earlier obligations with others or  extend the protective guardianship within the probation period, or may revoke the suspended sentence.   I X C H A P T E R N I N E   SECURITY MEASURES   Article 71  Types of Security Measures   The following security measures may be imposed on perpetrators of criminal offences:   a) Mandatory psychiatric treatment;   b) Mandatory medical treatment of addiction;   c) Ban on carrying out a certain occupation, activity or duty;   d) Ban on driving a motor vehicle;   e) Forfeiture.   Article 72  Purpose of Security Measures   The purpose of security measures is to remove situations or conditions that might influence a perpetrator  to perpetrate criminal offences in the future.   Article 73  Imposing Security Measures   The court may impose one or several security measures on a perpetrator of a criminal offence, when  grounds for imposing them exist under this Code.   Article 74  Mandatory Psychiatric Treatment   (1) The security measure of mandatory psychiatric treatment shall be imposed on a perpetrator who  perpetrates a criminal offence in a state of considerably diminished mental capacity or diminished mental  capacity, if there is a danger that the causes of such a state may in the future also induce the perpetrator to  perpetrate another criminal offence.   (2) The security measure of mandatory psychiatric treatment may, under the conditions provided for in  paragraph 1 of this Article, be executed along with serving the punishment of imprisonment, community  service or a suspended sentence.   (3) The security measure of mandatory psychiatric treatment shall last until the termination of the reason for  which it has been imposed, but in any event no longer than the serving of the punishment of imprisonment or  the completion of community service or the expiry of the probation period accompanying a suspended  sentence.    22    (4) As in the case referred to in Article 44 (Community Service) paragraph 5 of this Code, the execution of  imprisonment may be ordered to the perpetrator of a criminal offence who, while performing community  service as a substitute to imprisonment, fails to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment.   (5) Under the conditions provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, after a convicted person has been  conditionally released, his mandatory psychiatric treatment may continue outside the medical institution. If  the convicted person does not continue the treatment, his conditional release shall be revoked.   (6) The perpetrator of a criminal offence, who does not undergo psychiatric treatment during a probation  period set in a suspended sentence, may be treated pursuant to the provision of Article 66 (Revocation of  Suspended Sentence caused by Failure to Fulfil Particular Obligations) of this Code.   Article 75  Mandatory Medical Treatment of Addiction   (1) The security measure of mandatory medical treatment of addiction may be imposed on a perpetrator who  perpetrates a criminal offence under the decisive influence of addiction to alcohol or to narcotic drugs, if  there is a danger that due to such an addiction he will repeat the offence.   (2) The security measure of mandatory medical treatment of addiction, under the conditions provided for in  paragraph 1 of this Article, may be imposed along with the same criminal sanctions, for the same duration,  and in the same manner as prescribed for the security measure of mandatory psychiatric treatment by this  Code.   (3) As in the case referred to in Article 44 (Community Service) paragraph 5 of this Code, the execution of  imprisonment may be ordered to the perpetrator of a criminal offence who, while performing community  service as a substitute to imprisonment, fails to undergo mandatory treatment of addiction.   (4) Under the conditions provided for in Article 74 (Mandatory Psychiatric Treatment) paragraph 2 of this  Code, after a convicted person has been conditionally released, his mandatory treatment of addiction may  continue outside the medical institution. If the convicted person does not continue the treatment, his  conditional release shall be revoked.   (5) The perpetrator of a criminal offence, who does not undergo the treatment of addiction during a  probation period set in a suspended sentence, may be treated pursuant to the provision of Article 65∗  (Revocation of Suspended Sentence Caused by Failure to Fulfil Particular Obligations) of this Code.   Article 76  Ban on Carrying out a Certain Occupation, Activity or Duty   (1) The security measure of ban on carrying out a certain occupation, activity or duty may be imposed on a  perpetrator who perpetrates a criminal offence with regard to property entrusted or accessible to him by  virtue of his occupation, activity or duty, if there is a danger that such role could induce the perpetrator to  perpetrate another criminal offence through the abuse of the occupation, activity or duty with regard to the  property entrusted or accessible to him.   (2) The security measure of ban on carrying out a certain occupation, activity or duty may be imposed for a  term not less than one but not exceeding ten years, counting from the date the decision becomes final, with  the provision that the time spent serving the punishment of imprisonment shall not be credited toward the  term of this security measure.   (3) As in the case referred to in Article 44 (Community Service) paragraph 5 of this Code, the execution of  imprisonment may be ordered to the perpetrator of a criminal offence who, while performing community  service as a substitute to imprisonment, fails to act in accordance with the ban on carrying out a certain  occupation, activity or duty.      ∗ Should be 66.    23    (4) The perpetrator of a criminal offence who does not act in accordance with the ban on carrying out a  certain occupation, activity or duty during a probation period set in a suspended sentence, may be treated  pursuant to the provision of Article 66 (Revocation of Suspended Sentence Caused by Failure to Fulfil  Particular Obligations) of this Code.   Article 77  Ban on Driving Motor Vehicle   (1) The security measure of ban on driving a motor vehicle may be imposed to a perpetrator of a criminal  offence against traffic safety, if there is a danger that he will, by driving a motor vehicle, perpetrate such  criminal offence again.   (2) Under the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the ban on driving a motor vehicle may be  imposed regarding only a certain type or regarding any type of a motor vehicle.   (3) The security measure of ban on driving a motor vehicle may be imposed for a term not less than three  months nor more than five years, counting from the date the decision becomes final, with the provision that  the time spent serving the punishment of imprisonment shall not be credited toward the term of this security  measure.   (4) To the perpetrator of a criminal offence to whom driving a motor vehicle has been banned along with the  substitution of the punishment of imprisonment or suspended sentence, if he does not comply with the ban,  the provisions of Article 44 (Community Service) paragraph 5 and Article 66 (Revocation of Suspended  Sentence caused by Failure to Fulfil Particular Obligations) paragraph 5 of this Code shall be applied.   Article 78  Forfeiture of objects   (1) Objects used or destined for use in the perpetration of a criminal offence, or those that resulted from the  perpetration of a criminal offence, shall be forfeited, if there is a danger that they will be used again for the  perpetration of a criminal offence, or if the purpose of protecting the public safety or moral reasons make the  forfeiture absolutely necessary, if those objects are owned by the perpetrator.

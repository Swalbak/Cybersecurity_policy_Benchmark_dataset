Articles of the Special Part of this Code envisaging liability for crimes committed by special  dangerous recidivists shall be applied in the instances when a person had been recognized in  accordance with the procedure established by law as a special dangerous recidivist before the  commission of the crime in question.    SECTION THREE. EXCULPATORY CIRCUMSTANCES    CHAPTER 9. NOTION AND TYPES OF EXCULPATORY CIRCUMSTANCES    Article 35. Notion of Exculpatory Circumstances    Circumstances, under which an act containing elements envisaged by this Code is not a crime due  to lack of a social danger, illegality, and guilt, shall be exculpatory.    Exculpatory sentences shall be: minor nature of an act; necessary defense; extreme necessity;  infliction of damage when apprehending a person having committed a socially dangerous act;  execution of an order or another duty; justifiable professional or economic risk.     Article 36. Minor Nature of Act    An action or inaction not being socially dangerous due to minor nature thereof, though containing  elements envisaged by this Code, shall not be a crime.    Article 37. Necessary Defense    An act committed in a state of necessary self-defense, that is, when protecting life or rights of a  person defending oneself or another person, or interests of the State and society from an illegal  attempt by causing harm to an attempter, shall not be a crime, if no excess of self-defense occurred.    Excess of self-defense shall be a clear inadequacy of a defense for a nature and danger of an  attempt.    A right to necessary defense shall be enjoyed regardless of existing possibility to call in aid of other  persons or authorities, or to prevent an attempt by other way.    Intentional provocation of an attempt with the purpose of causing harm shall not be a necessary  defense.    Article 38. Extreme Necessity    An act that caused harm to rights and legitimate interests of a person shall not be a crime, if it was  committed in a state of extreme necessity, that is, for preventing a danger to life or rights of the  person or other individuals, interests of the State and society, and the danger could not have been  prevented by other means, and if the harm caused is less serious than the prevented one.             12  An act committed in a state of extreme necessity shall be justified, if no excess of limits thereof  occurred.    Excess of limits of extreme necessity shall be causing harm to legally protected interests, if danger  could be prevented by other means or harm caused is more serious than the prevented one.    When assessing lawfulness of an act committed in the state of extreme necessity, one shall take into  consideration nature and degree of the prevented danger, how actual it was and how soon was to  emerge, physical abilities of a person to prevent thereof, his psychological state in the situation  emerged and other circumstances of the case.    The issue of liability for damage caused to rights and legally protected interests, as a result of  physical or psychological coercion, shall be resolved with due regard to the provisions of this  Article.    Article 39. Causing Harm When Apprehending Person, Who Committed Socially Dangerous  Act    Causing harm when apprehending a person, who committed a socially dangerous act with a  purpose to give him in charge, if no excess of measures necessary for apprehension occurred  thereat, shall not be a crime.    Excess of measures of apprehension shall be a clear inadequacy of means and ways of  apprehension for danger of an act and a person who committed thereof, as well as circumstances of  apprehension, when intentional harm, which is not grounded by the necessity of apprehension, is  caused to the person.    When assessing the lawfulness of causing harm by apprehension of a person committed a socially  dangerous act, one shall take into consideration his attempt to avoid apprehension, physical abilities  of the apprehender, his psychological state in the situation emerged and other circumstances related  to apprehension.    Right to apprehend a person who committed a socially dangerous act shall be granted to duly  authorized officers and victims, as well as other individuals.    Article 40. Execution of Order or Another Duty    Causing harm by execution of an order or instruction, as well as of one’s duties, shall not be a  crime.    A person, who committed a crime executing an intentionally criminal order or another instruction,  shall be liable in accordance with the general procedure.    A person shall not be liable for non-execution or defiance of an order, instruction or functions, if he  was given them unlawfully. He shall be liable only in the instance, if an act actually committed by  him contains elements of another corpus delicti.    Article 41. Justifiable Professional or Economic Risk    Causing harm to the rights and legally protected interests under justifiable professional or economic  risk for a public benefit shall not be a crime.             13  A risk shall be considered as justifiable, if a committed action meets up-to-date scientific and  technological knowledge and experience, and a purpose could not have been achieved without  actions attended by some risk, and a person who took a risk took every precaution to prevent harm  to rights and legally protected interests.    Under justifiable professional or economic risk a liability for harm caused shall not be incurred in  the instance when a desired public benefit has not been achieved and the harm was more significant  than the pursued publicly beneficial purpose.    A risk shall not be considered as justifiable, if it was knowingly connected with threat to people’s  life, environmental disaster or other grave consequences.      SECTION FOUR.

When imposing deprivation of certain right as an additional penalty to imprisonment, committing  to a disciplinary unit, or imprisonment, it shall be applied to the whole term of serving a primary  penalty and, moreover, to a term established by a sentence.

Correctional labor shall not be imposed on a person of pension age, disabled, pregnant, in maternity  leave, or on military service.

If a penalty inflicted by a sentence on the grounds envisaged by Articles 44 and 46 of this Code, is  substituted by a court with another penalty, a term of cancellation shall be calculated on the  grounds of actually completed penalty.    If a person, who completed a penalty, commits a new crime before cancellation of conviction, a  term of cancellation of conviction shall be saved.

(6) The proposed tariff referred to in the preceding paragraph shall contain a special   explanatory note stating the reasons for the adoption or amendment of the tariff and the   objectives it is designed to achieve, and must be published in advance in accordance with   Article 204 of this Act. The Agency must submit the proposed tariff to the Government of the   Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: Government) no later than by 31 October of the current   year, together with the programme of work and the financial plan for the next calendar year   and the audited financial statements for the previous calendar year. If the Government does   not issue its approval by 15 December of the current year, the tariff currently in force shall be   applied until the entry into force of the new tariff.   (7) Prior to the issuing or amendment of the tariff, the costs referred to in the first paragraph     of this Article must be established and estimated and a deadline set, which may not be shorter   than 15 days or longer than two months, by which the liable entities referred to in the first   paragraph of this Article may submit their opinions, remarks and proposals regarding the   planned issuing or amendment of the tariff. Discussions may also take place at this time   between the relevant parties.      Article 7   (setting and payment of fees)      (1) The fee referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be set by the Agency in a decision   setting the fee.   (2) Fees shall be set in advance for the current calendar year.   (3) In the first calendar year in which the obligation to pay a fee arises, the Agency shall set   the fee as one-twelfth of the annual fee multiplied by the number of months remaining from   the occurrence of the liability to the end of the year. However, it may not amount to less than   one-twelfth of the annual fee.   (4) An entity liable to pay a fee for the calendar year in which it ceases the provision of a   public communications network and/or public communications service shall pay the fee on   the basis of the number of months in which it provided the public communications network   and/or public communications service, but not less than one-twelfth of the annual fee. The   Agency shall, at the request of the liable entity, amend a decision setting the fee that has   already been issued and return any advance payment to the liable entity within 30 days of   delivery of the amended decision setting the fee.      Article 8   (supervision)      The Agency shall oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter.      III.

Procedure     2.1 Procedure for the issuing of a decision allocating radio frequencies      Article 33   (procedure for the issuing of a decision allocating radio frequencies)      (1) The Agency shall issue a decision allocating radio frequencies in accordance with the   general act on the plan of use of radio frequencies, under the provisions of the act governing   the general administrative procedure and following a prior public invitation to tender in cases   determined by this Act. The procedures for the allocation of radio frequencies must be   objective, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory.   (2) A decision shall be issued on the basis of a public invitation to tender when it is   established in the procedure referred to in Article 36 of this Act that efficient use of a specific   radio frequency may only be ensured by restricting the number of decisions allocating radio   frequencies issued.   (3) A decision allocating radio frequencies for broadcasting and a decision allocating radio   frequencies for the provision of public communications services to end-users shall be issued   on the basis of a public invitation to tender, without the procedure referred to in Article 36 of   this Act. If the Agency receives an initiative from an interested party for a public invitation to   tender concerning the use of available frequencies for broadcasting or radio frequencies for   the provision of public communications services to end-users, it shall take a written position   on the initiative within 15 days of receiving it.   (4) Without prejudice to the provision of the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall issue a   decision allocating radio frequencies for the broadcasting services referred to in the second   and third paragraphs of Article 53 of this Act without a public invitation to tender.   (5) Without prejudice to the provision of the third paragraph of this Article, the Agency shall   issue a decision allocating radio frequencies for broadcasting to broadcasting service   providers without a public invitation to tender if another act deems this necessary in order to   comply with public interest objectives.   (6) The Agency shall issue a decision allocating radio frequencies to a natural person or legal   entity selected under a transparent and open procedure (of the ministry or a local community)   as the operator using budget funds of the constructed broadband network for an area in which   this network has already been constructed. The decision shall be issued pursuant to the act   governing the general administrative procedure and without the procedure referred to in   Article 36 of this Act.      Article 34   (coordinated allocation of radio frequencies in connection with joint selection procedures)      (1) If the use of specific radio frequencies has been coordinated, the conditions and   procedures of access agreed upon and the natural persons or legal entities allocated radio   frequencies selected in accordance with international agreements and EU regulations, these   persons and entities shall acquire the right to use these radio frequencies in the Republic of   Slovenia on the basis of a decision issued pursuant to this Act.   (2) Where the general act referred to in Article 27 of this Act prescribes the use of radio   frequencies on the basis of a decision allocating radio frequencies, the Agency shall issue the   decision pursuant to the provisions of the act governing the general administrative procedure   and without a prior public invitation to tender procedure. If all the conditions prescribed for   the allocation of radio frequencies under this Act have been met in the selection procedure   referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Agency may not impose additional conditions,   criteria or procedures that could restrict, change or delay the issuing of the decision allocating     radio frequencies.   (3) Natural persons or legal entities that acquire the right in the Republic of Slovenia to use   the radio frequencies referred to in the first paragraph of this Article without a decision being   issued by the Agency may use these frequencies only in accordance with the selection   decision of EU institutions (hereinafter: selection decision) and the EU regulation on the   basis of which it was issued, and must also meet all the conditions contained therein. The   Agency must notify these persons or entities accordingly of their rights and of the method of   their exercise in the Republic of Slovenia. In doing so, the Agency shall take into account the   selection decision and the EU regulation on whose basis it was issued.   (4) The Agency shall monitor and oversee the use of the radio frequencies referred to in the   first paragraph of this Article and, in doing so, pay due regard to EU regulations, including   any requirement to report to the Commission.      Article 35   (issuing of a decision allocating radio frequencies)      (1) An application to commence a procedure to acquire a decision allocating radio   frequencies must, in addition to the elements laid down by the act governing the general   administrative procedure, contain the information that the Agency requires to maintain the   official register of beneficiaries of decisions allocating radio frequencies and to oversee the   use of radio frequencies, as follows:   1. name, address and tax number (natural persons);   2. company name, registered office, tax number and an indication of the legal representative   (legal entities);   3. an indication of the radio frequency to which the application relates and the purpose of use   of this radio frequency;   4. an indication of the geographical area of use of the radio frequency;   5. information on the envisaged technical solution, particularly information on the envisaged   antenna system and radio equipment, the information required in order to make an assessment   on radiation, and statements regarding the location of the facilities, harmful interference and   the cost-effectiveness of use of the radio frequency.   (2) When no public invitation to tender is required, the Agency must issue and deliver a   decision allocating radio frequencies to an applicant within 42 days of receipt of the   application and, at the same time, insert the information on the allocation into the review of   allocated radio frequencies.   (3) Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall refuse to   issue a decision allocating radio frequencies if it determines that:   1. the applicant has not settled all its outstanding liabilities to the Agency;   2. the allocation of the radio frequency does not comply with the acts referred to in Articles   26 and 27 of this Act;   3. the allocation of the radio frequency does not comply with the requirement for efficient use   of the radio frequency spectrum;   4. the radio equipment signal would cause unavoidable harmful interference to other radio   equipment, receivers, or electrical or electronic systems.      Article 36   (acquisition of opinions from interested parties)     (1) Where the Agency considers that interest in a particular radio frequency could exceed   availability and thereby prevent its efficient use, it shall publish a public call to acquire the   opinions of interested parties concerning the conditions of use of these frequencies,   particularly regarding limiting the number of beneficiaries of decisions allocating radio   frequencies. The Agency shall, at regular intervals of time which may not exceed three years,   check whether a new public call as referred to in the preceding paragraph is required. The   Agency must always publish such a public call when it receives an initiative for a public   invitation to tender from any party interested in using specific radio frequencies.   (2) The Agency shall, in the public call, lay down the deadline for the acquisition of opinions   from interested parties, which may not be shorter than 30 days, and specify those issues   regarding which it wishes to acquire the opinions of interested parties. The Agency must   maintain the confidentiality of any proposals from interested parties regarding the level of the   fee for radio frequencies.   (3) Where the Agency determines, on the basis of the response of interested parties and of   other relevant information at its disposal, that specific radio frequencies will not be made   available to all interested parties, it must carry out a public invitation to tender prior to   issuing decisions allocating radio frequencies. In the opposite case, the Agency shall issue   decisions allocating radio frequencies under the provisions of the act governing the general   administrative procedure.      Article 37   (application of provisions in the implementation of a public invitation to tender)      (1) With the exception of the provisions on exclusion, the provisions of the act governing the   general administrative procedure shall not be applied to the public invitation to tender   procedure itself.   (2) A public invitation to tender shall be conducted by a special impartial commission   (hereinafter: commission) appointed by the director of the Agency, to which persons not   employed by the Agency may also be appointed.   (3) The provisions on the exclusion of an official shall also be applied to members of the   commission who are not officials employed by the Agency.      Article 38   (decision on the initiation of a public invitation to tender)      (1) A public invitation to tender shall commence on the basis of an Agency decision, which   must contain at least the following:   1. a precise indication of the radio frequencies that are the subject of the public invitation to   tender, the radiocommunications services to be provided through the use of these radio   frequencies, and the areas or locations in which these radio frequencies are to be used;   2. the conditions, requirements and qualifications to be met by tenderers, which must comply   with the relevant legislation and spatial planning documents in force;   3. criteria for the selection of the most favourable tender, the method of their application, and   any other restrictions to be taken into account in the evaluation of tenders;   4. the minimum fee for the efficient use of a limited natural resource and the method of   payment (one-off payment, annual payment), unless the public invitation to tender relates to   radio frequencies for the provision of analogue broadcasting services;   5. the deadline by which tenderers may submit tenders and the method applying to their   submission (date, time, address, code);   6. the address, place, date and time of the public opening of tenders;     7. the place, time and person from whom interested parties may obtain the tender dossier, the   price of the tender dossier and the method of payment for the dossier;   8. the contact person from whom tenderers may obtain additional information;   9. the deadline by which tenderers are to be informed of the outcome (deadline by which   decisions will be issued).   (2) When formulating the conditions, requirements, qualifications and criteria referred to in   points 2 and 3 of the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall endeavour to ensure that the   conditions, requirements, qualifications and criteria promote competition, investment,   efficient use of the radio spectrum and the co-existence of existing and new services and   equipment.   (3) Where the subject of a public invitation to tender is the allocation of radio frequencies for   the provision of analogue broadcasting services, the decision must also contain the conditions   that must be met by a tenderer regarding programmes and the criteria for selection of the   most favourable tender that must be taken into account when assessing programmes. The   conditions and criteria referred to in this paragraph shall be determined by the Broadcasting   Council in accordance with the act governing the media.

(6) The Agency may amend the decision referred to in the first paragraph of this Article and,   in doing so, must also decide on an extension to the deadline for submitting tenders with   respect to the extent of the amendments in the decision. All interested tenderers must be   informed of all amendments on an equal and transparent basis. The new decision must be   published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia no later than seven days prior to   the expiry of the deadline set for the submission of tenders in the decision referred to in the   first paragraph of this Article.      Article 39   (deadline for the submission of tenders)      (1) The deadline for the submission of tenders must allow tenderers to be able to compile   high-quality tenders and may not be shorter than 30 days, to run from the day after   publication of the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph.   (2) A tender submitted by the deadline set in the public invitation to tender shall be deemed   to have been submitted on time.   (3) The Agency may not accept a tender, an amended tender or a replacement tender that   arrives after the expiry of the deadline referred to in the preceding paragraph. If such a tender   is submitted by post, it must be returned to the sender unopened.   (4) The Agency must maintain the business secrecy of the list of tenderers and tenders   submitted until the expiry of the deadline for the public opening of tenders.      Article 40   (tender dossier)      In the tender dossier, the Agency shall explain all items of the decision on the initiation of the   public invitation to tender, and indicate which evidence on compliance with the conditions   must be enclosed for tenders to be deemed to be acceptable.     Article 41   (special provisions on the public opening of tenders)      (1) The opening of tenders shall be public.   (2) The tender commission shall keep minutes on the tender opening procedure, which must   contain, in particular, the serial number of the tender and, if the tender is anonymous, the title   or code of the tenderer and the tender price. Care must be taken throughout the procedure to   ensure that tenderers’ business secrets are not disclosed.   (3) At the public opening of tenders, a check shall be made as to whether the tenders contain   all documents required by the tender dossier (formal completeness), where the authenticity   and content of the documents shall not be checked.   (4) Only tenders delivered by the deadline and correctly marked shall be opened. The tender   commission must send incorrectly marked tenders back to the sender unopened.   (5) The public invitation to tender shall be valid if at least one timely and correct tender that   meets the relevant conditions is received.   (6) In the decision on initiation of a public invitation to tender, the Agency may stipulate that   an individual public invitation to tender shall be deemed to be valid if a different minimum   number of tenders meeting the relevant conditions is received.      Article 42   (supplementing of tenders)      (1) Within five days of the opening of tenders, the commission shall write to tenderers that   have submitted incomplete tenders inviting them to supplement the tenders. The deadline for   supplementing a tender may not be shorter than eight nor longer than 15 days. Those parts of   a tender that are subject to evaluation may not be supplemented.

Article 43   (review and evaluation of tenders)      (1) After completion of the public tender opening procedure, the commission shall first   establish whether all the documents in the tender meet the requirements of the law and the   tender dossier. If the commission finds that a tender does not meet the requirements of the   law and the tender dossier, it shall exclude it from further procedure. The commission shall   evaluate the remaining tenders in accordance with the tender criteria.   (2) After reviewing and evaluating the tenders received, the commission shall compile a   report presenting its evaluations of the individual tenders and stating which of the tenders   best meets the published selection criteria.   (3) Where the subject of a public invitation to tender is the allocation of radio frequencies for   the provision of analogue broadcasting services, the commission shall send the complete   tenders and the report on its evaluation in relation to the tender criteria, which shall not   include an evaluation of programmes, to the Broadcasting Council. The Broadcasting Council   shall evaluate the tenders received in relation to their programmes in accordance with the   criteria laid down in the decision on the initiation of the public invitation to tender and, on the   basis of an overall evaluation of all tender criteria, submit a reasoned proposal for selection to   the Agency. The Broadcasting Council must send the reasoned proposal for selection to the   Agency not later than 60 days after receiving the tenders and the Agency’s report.   (4) The commission or the Broadcasting Council may request that tenderers provide     clarifications regarding their tenders; however, in doing so they may not request, permit or   offer any amendments or supplements to the content of a tender.   (5) The commission or the Broadcasting Council must, when reviewing and evaluating   tenders, take into account only those criteria for selection of the most favourable tenderer that   are laid down in the law and the tender dossier, in particular the efficiency of use of the radio   frequency spectrum and the promotion and protection of competition.      2.2 Public auction      Article 44   (public invitation to tender for the preparation of a public auction)      (1) When the only criterion for selection of the most favourable tender is the tendered price,   the Agency may stipulate in the decision on the initiation of the public invitation to tender   that a public auction is to be held after completion of the public invitation to tender   procedure.

(4) The Agency shall determine the time, place and method of implementation of the public   auction in a decision on the selection of auction participants. The public auction shall be held   not less than 20 days and not more than 30 days after the issuing of the decision on the   selection of auction participants. The Agency shall publish the time and place of the public   auction on its website and in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia.      Article 45   (method of implementation of a public auction)      (1) A public auction shall be conducted by the chairman of the commission referred to in the   second paragraph of Article 37 of this Act or by his deputy.   (2) A public auction shall be held orally, using written bids or with certified electronic   applications (for electronic auctions).   (3) A public auction may be held in another suitable manner that enables the Agency official   conducting the auction and each auction participant to monitor the course of the public   auction directly and in real time, and the auction participant to submit bids to an official   freely and directly.     (4) The lowest amount by which a bid for the fee referred to in point 4 of the second   paragraph of the previous Article may be raised at an auction may not be less than one per   cent of the reserve fee.   (5) Before determining the highest bid or bids, the last highest bid or bids must be announced   and the auction participants given at least one opportunity to place a higher bid. If they do   not, the last highest bid or bids shall be accepted and declared to be the highest by decision.   (6) A written decision on acceptance of the highest bid, with an indication of the deadline by   which the fee is to be paid, must be issued to the auction participant or participants placing   the highest bid.   (7) In conducting and maintaining order at a public auction, the head of the commission or   his deputy conducting the public auction shall have official public authorisations in the   administrative procedure in relation to conducting a public hearing.   (8) Should the chair of the commission or his deputy find, in the course of an oral public   auction, that two or more auction participants have come to an agreement on the method of   bidding or the result, or are engaged in coordinated bidding, these participants shall be   excluded from the public auction and a written decision drawn up. There shall be no appeal   against this decision.   (9) Where a public auction has been held, the auction participant or participants who have   been successful at the public auction and who have paid the fee for the efficient use of a   limited natural resource referred to in the second paragraph of Article 47 of this Act by the   prescribed deadline shall be deemed to be the auction participant or participants selected   under the public invitation to tender.      Article 46   (unallocated radio frequencies)      If not all radio frequencies are allocated at a public auction, the Agency may repeat the   procedure referred to in Article 36 of this Act for the remaining radio frequencies or, in the   cases referred to in the third paragraph of Article 33 of this Act, hold a direct public invitation   to tender.      2.3 Procedure following the completion of a public invitation to tender      Article 47   (application of the act governing the general administrative procedure)      (1) Upon receipt of the commission’s report on the evaluation of tenders, the Agency shall   continue its decision-making procedure under the act governing the general administrative   procedure, where all tenderers that have submitted correctly marked tenders by the deadline   laid down in the public invitation to tender shall have the status of parties.   (2) If the decision on the initiation of a public invitation to tender lays down that a public   auction is to be held after completion of the public invitation to tender, an administrative   procedure shall be commenced only after the successful auction participant or participants   have paid the fee for the efficient use of a limited natural resource or, if the payment method   is such, have paid those of the instalments they are obliged to pay under the decision   establishing the highest tender prior to the issuing of the decision allocating radio   frequencies.      Article 48   (limitation of evidence)        In an administrative procedure initiated under a public invitation to tender, it shall not be   permissible to propose or introduce evidence which should have been a constituent part of a   complete and acceptable tender, or which could alter a tender in any way.      Article 49   (selection of tenderers)      The Agency shall decide on tenders by issuing one or more decisions allocating radio   frequencies.

(2) In the case of the extension of a decision allocating radio frequencies as referred to in the   preceding paragraph, for all radio frequencies originally allocated on the basis of a public   invitation to tender, with the exception of radio frequencies for analogue broadcasting   services, a specific fee shall be paid for the efficient use of a limited natural resource so as to   ensure optimal use of the radio frequencies allocated. This shall be a revenue of the budget.   The amount and the method of payment of the fee shall be set by the Agency, which must   obtain the prior approval of the Government. In setting the amount and the method of   payment of the fee, due regard must be paid to the period for which the validity of the     decision allocating radio frequencies is being extended and the supply of and demand for the   frequencies being put to tender, the level of development of the market to which the   frequencies being put to tender relate, and the level of such fees in other Member States. It   may in no case be so high as to hinder the development of innovative services and   competition in the market.   (3) An application for the extension of a decision allocating radio frequencies must be   submitted to the Agency no less than 30 and no more than 90 days prior to the expiry of   validity of the decision.

Article 55   (transfer or leasing of rights to use radio frequencies)      (1) The beneficiary of a decision allocating radio frequencies may transfer or lease its right to   use these radio frequencies by legal transaction to another natural person or legal entity that   meets the prescribed conditions, but only with the prior approval of the Agency. The Agency   shall verify that this other natural person or legal entity meets the conditions laid down in a   law, implementing regulation or Agency act, and that the envisaged transaction does not   cause distortion of competition where the spectrum is left unused.   (2) Without prejudice to the provision of the preceding paragraph, the beneficiary of a   decision allocating radio frequencies that acquired the right to use these radio frequencies   without paying the fee referred to in the eighth paragraph of Article 60 of this Act, except in   the case of radio frequencies for analogue broadcasting services, may not transfer or lease its   right to use these radio frequencies by legal transaction to another natural person or legal   entity.   (3) Without prejudice to the provision of the first paragraph of this Article, the beneficiary of   a decision allocating radio frequencies against whom the Agency is conducting proceedings   to abrogate the decision pursuant to point 3 of the fourth paragraph of Article 58 of this Act   may not transfer or lease its right to use the radio frequencies which are the subject of   proceedings to another natural person or legal entity by legal transaction.   (4) In the case of the transfer of a right to use radio frequencies to another natural person or   legal entity under the first paragraph of this Article, the Agency shall issue a new decision   allocating radio frequencies to this natural person or legal entity in accordance with the   provisions of the act governing the general administrative procedure.   (5) The purpose of the use of radio frequencies, which is harmonised under EU regulations,   may not be changed upon transfer of a right to use radio frequencies.   (6) The conditions referred to in Article 52 of this Act and contained in a decision allocating   radio frequencies issued on the basis of a public invitation to tender may only be amended   with the prior approval of the Agency.      Article 56   (accumulation of radio frequencies in order to distort competition in the market)        Undertakings may not accumulate radio frequencies in order to distort competition in the   market. Such conduct on the part of an undertaking may be detected in particular when it fails   to use radio frequencies to the extent and by the deadlines laid down in the decision itself or   in the undertaking’s tender and there are no objective reasons which the undertaking was   unable to influence or foresee at the time the decision was allocated, or when it follows from   its conduct that the undertaking acquired the radio frequency in order to restrict competition   in the market.      Article 57   (amendment of a decision allocating radio frequencies)      (1) The Agency may amend a decision allocating radio frequencies ex officio or at the   proposal of the beneficiary of the decision.   (2) A decision allocating radio frequencies shall be amended ex officio if:   1. the distribution of radio frequency bands or use of radio frequencies changes;   2. public demand arises that cannot be met in any other way;   3. it is required for efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum for the public benefit;   4. harmful interference cannot otherwise be avoided or radio frequency protection is not   achieved;   5. it is so required by acts of international law applicable in the Republic of Slovenia and   relating to radio frequencies;   6. the name of the beneficiary of the decision allocating radio frequencies or the name of the   programme changes;   7. it is required in order to form beneficiaries of decisions allocating radio frequencies into   wider regional or national radio or television programming networks registered with the   competent body under the act governing the media;   8. it is required in order to implement EU regulations in the field of electronic   communications.   (3) The amendment of a decision allocating radio frequencies at the proposal of its   beneficiary shall be possible only within the area of coverage of the decision and only if it   does not encroach upon the rights of others and if the conditions under this Act are met. In   the case of amendment of a decision allocating radio frequencies for the provision of   broadcasting, amendment shall be possible outside the area of coverage if such an   amendment ensures greater efficiency of use of radio frequencies, does not substantially alter   the area of coverage, and does not encroach on the benefits enjoyed by other beneficiaries of   decisions allocating radio frequencies, if the conditions under this Act are met.   (4) A decision allocating radio frequencies may not be amended at the proposal of its   beneficiary if proceedings to abrogate the decision under point 3 of the fourth paragraph of   Article 58 of this Act are being conducted against the beneficiary of the right to use radio   frequencies.   (5) The Agency shall, when amending a decision allocating radio frequencies, issue a new   decision allocating radio frequencies and annul the previous decision. The Agency may also   determine the extent of and deadline for adjustment in the new decision. In the cases referred   to in the second paragraph of this Article, the Agency may also annul a decision allocating   radio frequencies in its entirety with a new decision and determine new content for that   decision.   (6) In the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Agency may, in exceptional   cases, extend the validity of the decision allocating radio frequencies, but not a decision   allocating radio frequencies for the provision of public communications services to end-users,     if the costs of the adjustment referred to in the preceding paragraph encroach   disproportionately on the benefits enjoyed by the beneficiary of the decision allocating radio   frequencies.   (7) The beneficiary of an amended decision allocating radio frequencies shall have the right   to be allocated other comparable radio frequencies that technologically enable the provision   of the same services, if the reasons for the amendment have not arisen through its own fault.   Radio frequencies with an equivalent area of coverage shall be allocated by means of a   decision under an administrative procedure without a public invitation to tender.   (8) The beneficiary of an amended decision allocating radio frequencies for the provision of   broadcasting as referred to in the preceding paragraph shall have the right to be allocated   additional radio frequencies in the area of coverage of the decision being amended if, owing   to interference, it is not possible to provide services of the expected quality on radio   frequencies with equivalent coverage. The additional radio frequencies shall be allocated by a   decision under an administrative procedure without a public invitation to tender.   (9) Beneficiaries of a decision referred to in the preceding paragraph shall not be liable to pay   an annual fee to the Agency for the use of the additional frequencies.      Article 58   (revocation of a decision allocating radio frequencies)      (1) The Agency may abrogate a decision allocating radio frequencies at the proposal of the   beneficiary of the decision or ex officio.   (2) The Agency shall abrogate a decision allocating radio frequencies at the proposal of the   beneficiary of the decision only if the beneficiary meets all the obligations laid down in the   applicable legislation and in the decision allocating radio frequencies.   (3) The Agency must initiate a procedure to abrogate a decision allocating radio frequencies   intended for analogue broadcasting services ex officio if this is proposed by the Broadcasting   Council.   (4) The Agency shall abrogate a decision allocating radio frequencies ex officio if it finds   that:   1. the application for the decision allocating radio frequencies contained false information;   2. the beneficiary no longer meets the prescribed conditions under the applicable legislation   or its decision allocating radio frequencies;   3. the beneficiary has not commenced using the radio frequency by the deadline set in the   decision allocating radio frequencies or the undertaking’s tender in the public invitation to   tender, or the allocated radio frequency was not used over a period of six months as   ascertained by at least six random checks, unless the decision determines otherwise or the   beneficiary proves the contrary by means of written evidence;   4. the beneficiary has transferred the right to use radio frequencies to another natural person   or legal entity by legal transaction in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 55 of this   Act;   5. there is no other way of avoiding harmful interference caused by the radio equipment   signal to other radio equipment, receivers or electrical or electronic systems;   6. the fee for the use of radio frequencies or the fee for the efficient use of a limited natural   resource have not been paid despite several warnings to do so;   7. there are other serious or recurring irregularities concerning compliance with the   conditions for the use of radio frequencies referred to in Article 52 of this Act and laid down   in the decision allocating radio frequencies, unless these irregularities have been removed by   more lenient measures in a supervisory procedure.        Article 59   (cessation of validity of a decision allocating radio frequencies)      (1) A decision allocating radio frequencies shall cease to be valid under the Act itself:   1. upon expiry of the period for which it was issued;   2. if its beneficiary ceases to exist;   3. upon revocation of the licence to perform radio and television activities issued under a   procedure and under conditions laid down in the act governing the media.   (2) In the cases referred to in points 2 and 3 of the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall   issue a declaratory decision.      Article 60   (fee for the use of radio frequencies)      (1) Beneficiaries of a decision allocating radio frequencies shall be liable to pay an annual fee   to the Agency for the use of the radio frequencies allocated to them. This fee shall cover the   costs incurred by the Agency in the management and supervision of the radio frequency   spectrum.   (2) The Agency shall prescribe the method of calculating the fees due to it under this Article   by means of a general act. The amount of the fee shall be dependent on coverage, the density   of the population in the area of coverage, the radio frequency, the width of the radio   frequency band, the type of radio communications involved, or a combination of the above,   and may not restrict competition or create barriers to market entry.   (3) The amount of the fees referred to in the first and second paragraphs of this Article shall   be set by the Agency using a tariff, with due regard to the necessity to cover the costs referred   to in the first paragraph of this Article and with mutatis mutandis application of the fifth,   sixth and seventh paragraphs of Article 6 of this Act.   (4) Article 7 shall be applied to the charging and payment of fees for the use of radio   frequencies.   (5) Without prejudice to the provision of the second paragraph of Article 7 of this Act, a one-  off fee shall be charged for the use of radio frequencies for the purposes referred to in the   second and third paragraphs of Article 53 of this Act that corresponds to one-twelfth of the   annual fee multiplied by the number of months for which the decision allocating radio   frequencies is valid, but not less than one-twelfth of the annual fee.   (6) Without prejudice to the provision of the fourth paragraph of Article 7 of this Act, the   beneficiary whose right to use radio frequencies has ceased as a result of the expiry of the   period for which it was allocated or through no fault of its own shall pay the fee on the basis   of the number of months for which the right was valid, but not less than one-twelfth of the   annual fee   (7) Without prejudice to the provision of the first paragraph of this Article, state bodies that   are beneficiaries of a decision allocating radio frequencies for the purposes referred to in the   second paragraph of Article 53 of this Act shall not be liable to pay the annual fee referred to   in the first paragraph of this Article.   (8) Without prejudice to the provision of Article 23 of the Digital Broadcasting Act (OGRS,   102/07, 85/10), a fee shall also be paid for the efficient use of a limited natural resource for   all radio frequencies allocated on the basis of a public invitation to tender, but not radio   frequencies for analogue broadcasting services, in order to ensure the optimal use of the   allocated radio frequencies. This shall be a revenue of the state budget. The minimum amount   of this fee and the method of its payment shall be determined in the decision on the initiation   of a public invitation to tender procedure. In setting the amount or minimum amount of this     fee and the method of its payment, due regard must be paid to the supply of and demand for   the frequencies being put to tender, the level of development of the market to which the   frequencies being put to tender relate, and the level of such fees in other Member States. It   may in no case be so high as to hinder the development of innovative services and   competition in the market.      Article 61   (supervision and construction of a monitoring and measuring system)      (1) The Agency shall oversee implementation of the provisions of this Chapter and the   implementation of the decisions issued pursuant thereto.

Article 63   (numbering plan)      (1) The numbering plan shall be adopted by the Agency by means of a general act.   (2) The numbering plan shall lay down the type, length, structure, purpose and method of use   of numbering resources, including numbers for emergency calls and numbers whose use is   harmonised on the basis of EU regulations, and must also enable the portability of numbers   and the introduction of new electronic communications services.   (3) Changes or additions to the numbering plan that significantly affect the numbering system   and whose implementation is technologically complex shall not be applied until two years   after their entry into force.      Article 64   (use of numbering resources)      The undertakings and natural persons or legal entities referred to in the first paragraph of     Article 66 of this Act may use numbering resources only on the basis of a decision allocating   numbering resources by which the Agency allocates rights to their use.      Article 65   (procedure for the issuing of a decision allocating numbering resources)      (1) The Agency shall issue a decision allocating numbering resources in accordance with the   numbering plan, under the provisions of the act governing the general administrative   procedure and following a prior public invitation to tender procedures in cases determined by   this Act. The Agency shall, in allocating numbering resources managed by the International   Telecommunication Union (ITU), pay due regard to the procedures laid down in the   appropriate recommendations of that Union. In allocating numbers whose use is harmonised   under EU regulations, the Agency shall also take into account the procedures laid down in   EU regulations and recommendations.   (2) The Agency shall employ a public invitation to tender procedure only when it is   established, with mutatis mutandis application of Article 36 of this Act, that efficient use of   specific numbering resources (e.g. short numbers) can only be ensured by restricting the   number of decisions issued allocating numbering resources. Undertakings that may allocate   the numbering resources they acquire for use to their users under equal, cost-oriented and   transparent conditions may take part in a public invitation to tender procedure. Other natural   person or legal entities may only take part if they can prove that they require numbering   resources in order to perform an activity for the public benefit under area legislation or EU   regulations.   (3) In this public invitation to tender procedure, the provisions of this Act governing public   invitation to tender procedures for the allocation of specific radio frequencies shall be applied   mutatis mutandis by the Agency.

Article 71   (amendment of a decision allocating numbering resources)      (1) The Agency may, for the purposes of alignment with the changes or additions to the plan   under the third paragraph of Article 63 of this Act, amend a decision allocating numbering   resources that has already been issued, ex officio and by decision, within 30 days of the entry   into force of the changes or additions to the plan. In this case, the beneficiary of a decision   allocating numbering resources or the users to whom they have been allocated shall not have   the right to demand compensation.   (2) The Agency may also amend a decision allocating numbering resources at the proposal of   its beneficiary.      Article 72   (revocation of a decision allocating numbering resources)      (1) The Agency must abrogate a decision allocating numbering resources ex officio if it finds   that:   1. the application for the decision allocating numbering resources contained false   information;   2. the beneficiary no longer meets the prescribed conditions under the applicable legislation   or its decision allocating numbering resources;   3. the allocated numbering resources have not begun to be used within three years of the   issuing of the decision allocating numbering resources or are not used for more than one year;   4. the beneficiary has transferred the right to use numbering resources to another natural   person or legal entity by legal transaction in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 70   of this Act.   (2) The Agency shall also abrogate a decision allocating numbering resources ex officio:   1. if the fee for the use of the numbering resources or the fee for the efficient use of a limited   natural resource have not been paid despite a warning to do so;     2. if there are other serious or recurring irregularities concerning compliance with the   conditions for the use of numbering resources referred to in Article 68 of this Act and laid   down in the decision allocating numbering resources, unless these irregularities have been   removed by more lenient measures in a supervisory procedure.      Article 73   (cessation of validity of a decision allocating numbering resources)      (1) A decision allocating numbering resources shall cease to be valid:   1. at the proposal of the beneficiary of the decision allocating numbering resources;   2. if the beneficiary of the decision allocating numbering resources ceases to exist;   3. upon revocation of the decision allocating numbering resources.   (2) In the cases referred to in points 1 and 2 of the preceding paragraph, the Agency must   issue a declaratory decision.      Article 74   (fees for the use of numbering resources)      (1) Beneficiaries of a decision allocating numbering resources shall be liable to pay an annual   fee to the Agency for the use of the numbering resources allocated to them. This fee shall   cover the costs incurred by the Agency in the management and supervision of numbering   resources.   (2) The Agency shall prescribe the method of calculating the fee due to it under this Article   by means of a general act. The amount of the fee shall be dependent on the quantity, length   and types of numbering resources, and may not restrict competition or create barriers to   market entry.   (3) The amount of the fees referred to in the first and second paragraphs of this Article shall   be set by the Agency using a tariff, with due regard to the necessity to cover the costs referred   to in the first paragraph of this Article and with mutatis mutandis application of the fifth,   sixth and seventh paragraphs of Article 6 of this Act.

(3) Where an undertaking does not act in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the   Agency shall appoint an independent audit organisation registered with the Slovenian   Auditing Institute to conduct the audit referred to in the first paragraph of this Article. The   costs of the audit shall be borne by the audited undertaking.      Article 83   (measures in the event of emergency situations)      (1) In the event of the occurrence of an emergency situation, an undertaking must give   precedence to securing the operation of those parts of the network required for the continuity   of operation of the networks of entities responsible for the security and defence system and   the protection and rescue system. Undertakings must, as required, envisage alternative routes   to ensure that network breakdowns are as short as possible. To this end, these measures must   be coordinated in advance with the entities responsible for the security and defence system   and the protection and rescue system.   (2) Undertakings providing public telephone networks must adjust their networks so as to   give priority to communications from certain network termination points over   communications from other network termination points (hereinafter: priority function).   Communications given a priority function in the public telephone network of an individual   undertaking shall also retain that priority in the public telephone networks of other   undertakings. In emergency situations, undertakings may also give priority to the operation of   network termination points so as to restrict or interrupt the operation of other telephone   connections.   (3) The Government shall, by decree, determine those groups of users with the right to   priority network termination points under the preceding paragraph.   (4) The Government shall, by resolution, also determine other measures and restrictions or   interruptions of operations connected with the provision of public communications networks   or services in the event of a natural or other disaster or a catastrophic network breakdown, if   this is necessary to rectify the situation that has arisen.

(2) The measures referred to in the preceding paragraph must ensure the availability of   publicly available telephone services in the shortest possible time. These measures must also   ensure uninterrupted access to and use of emergency call numbers, in particular the single   European emergency call number ‘112’, the police number ‘113’ and the single European   missing children hotline number ‘116000’.      Article 85   (industrial action)      (1) Universal service providers and/or undertakings obliged to implement obligations   pursuant to this Chapter of the Act shall, by means of an internal act, stipulate the method of   uninterrupted provision of universal service or of the undertaking’s obligations under this   Chapter.   (2) The Agency shall monitor compliance with the obligation to adopt and implement the   internal act referred to in the preceding paragraph.      Article 86   (general act)      The Agency shall lay down the method of implementation of the provisions of this Article in   detail by means of a general act.      Article 87   (supervision)      The Agency shall oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter.      VIII. ENSURING OF COMPETITION      1. General      Article 88   (independence of operation of the Agency in regard of ensuring competition)      (1) In implementing tasks under this Chapter in relation to ensuring competition, the Agency   may not request or receive instructions from any other state bodies. This shall not preclude it   from consulting the body responsible for competition protection nor from cooperating with     other regulatory authorities, the Commission or the Body of European Regulators for   Electronic Communications (BEREC) under this Act.   (2) The Agency may, in order to promote regulatory predictability, draw up a multiannual   regulatory strategy and publish it on its website.      Article 89   (undertakings with special or exclusive rights)      (1) Undertakings having special or exclusive rights to provide other commercial activities and   with annual revenues in the area of electronic communications networks or services in excess   of EUR 10 million must either provide electronic communications networks or services   through a legally independent undertaking or keep separate financial accounts for activities   associated with the provision of electronic communications services or networks, as if these   activities were performed in a legally independent undertaking.   (2) The separate financial accounts referred to in preceding paragraph shall be kept such that   all elements of expenditures and revenues related to activities associated with the provision of   electronic communications services or networks are defined, together with the basis for their   calculation and detailed distribution procedures used, and including a breakdown of the fixed   assets and itemised structural costs.      Article 90   (interconnection and operator access)      (1) Operators of public communications networks shall have the right, and when required by   other operators of public communications networks also the obligation, to negotiate amongst   themselves concerning interconnection in order to provide public communications services   for the purpose of the provision and interoperability of services. Operators of public   communications networks shall provide other operators with operator access or   interconnection under conditions that accord with the obligations imposed by the Agency   under this Act in relation to interconnection and operator access.   (2) The parties shall agree on technical and commercial issues relating to operator access or   interconnection by contract, where this contract may not contravene the provisions of this   Act. Disputes shall, where one of the parties so requests, be resolved by the Agency using the   procedure referred to in Article 218 of this Act.   (3) In concluding contracts on interconnection or operator access, the parties must safeguard   the confidentiality of all the information exchanged in the course of the procedure. The   information exchanged may not be used for any other purpose nor disclosed to a third party,   particularly not to another department, branch office or subsidiary company, or to partners   that could acquire a competitive advantage on the basis of this information. Without prejudice   to the above, the obligations referred to in Articles 102 and 103 of this Act shall apply.   (4) In accordance with Articles 194 to 197 of this Act, the Agency shall encourage and,   where it assesses such a course of action to be appropriate under the circumstances, provide   suitable operator access, interconnection and interoperability of services, by decision, in a   manner that promotes efficiency, long-term competitiveness, efficiency of investment and   innovation, and provides the greatest possible benefits for end-users. The Agency may   impose obligations in particular on operators which monitor access to final users to the extent   necessary to ensure the connection of both terminals, including the obligation of the   interconnection of their networks if that has not yet been performed or, in justified cases and   to the necessary extent, impose on operators the obligation to enable interoperability of their   services. This shall not affect the obligations that the Agency may impose on undertakings     with significant market power under this Act.   (5) The obligations and conditions in the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph must   be objective, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory. The decision must be issued   in accordance with the procedures referred to in Article 204 of this Act and with the   procedures of cooperation and consultation with other regulatory authorities, the Commission   and BEREC referred to in Articles 209 to 212 of this Act.   (6) In order to ensure realisation of the objectives referred to in the fourth paragraph of this   Article in relation to operator access and interconnection, the Agency may, in justified cases,   decide ex officio using the procedures referred to in Articles 204 and Articles 209 to 212 of   this Act, and with mutatis mutandis application of the procedure referred to in Articles 218   and 219 of this Act.   (7) An undertaking that does not provide services or operate a network in the Republic of   Slovenia may request operator access or interconnection without notifying the Agency in   advance under Article 5 of this Act.      Article 91   (shared use)      (1) Where a natural person or legal entity providing an electronic communications network   acquires the right to construct, install, operate or maintain a network and associated   infrastructure on, above or below real estate owned by another, or where it is entitled to make   use of an expropriation or easement procedure on this real estate, the Agency may order   shared use of the communications facilities referred to in the second paragraph of this Article,   with due regard paid to the principle of proportionality.   (2) The Agency may order the measure referred to in the preceding paragraph to the benefit   of natural persons or legal entities providing electronic communications networks that are   deprived of access to viable alternatives due to the need to protect the environment, public   health, public security or spatial planning arrangements, where the parties are unable to reach   agreement between themselves regarding the shared use referred to in the first paragraph of   this Article. In such a case, the Agency may order the natural person or legal entity referred   to in the first paragraph of this Article to allow the other party shared use of the property or of   communications facilities such as buildings, entrances to buildings and the installations   within buildings, posts, antennas, towers and other similar structures, as well as cable ducts,   channels, manholes and terminal boxes, including a shared physical location. The Agency   may lay down rules for the sharing of the costs of shared use of facilities or real estate.   (3) The Agency may, where it assesses such a course of action to be appropriate under the   circumstances, decide on the measure referred to in the first paragraph of this Article ex   officio in accordance with the procedure referred to in the fifth paragraph of the previous   Article.   (4) The Agency may also order shared use at the proposal of a party using the procedure   referred to in Article 218 of this Act, but only after a prior public consultation process has   taken place with stakeholders that lasts for the period referred to in Article 204 of this Act,   where all interested parties must have an opportunity to express their opinion.   (5) The ordering of shared use must be objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and   proportionate. The Agency shall, where it assesses such a course of action to be appropriate   under the circumstances, order shared use in cooperation with the bodies of self-governing   local communities.      Article 92   (shared use of installations in buildings)        (1) The Agency shall impose an obligation of shared use of installations in buildings, or of   the first distribution point if this is outside the building, on the natural persons or legal   entities referred to in the first paragraph of the previous Article, by decision and in   accordance with the procedure referred to in the previous Article, if the duplication of this   infrastructure would be economically inefficient or physically non-feasible. In doing so, it   may determine the rules for the sharing of the costs of shared use of the facilities or property,   adjusted to the investment risk, where the Agency assesses such a course of action to be   appropriate under the circumstances.   (2) Where the owner of an installation referred to in the preceding paragraph is the owner of   the building, he must allow other natural persons and legal entities providing electronic   communications networks shared use of this installation.      Article 93   (shared use of other commercial public infrastructure)      (1) An investor or owner of another type of commercial public infrastructure must, in   accordance with the technical capacities, allow network operators and interested state bodies   shared use of the free capacities of this infrastructure at cost-oriented prices. Free capacities   shall be deemed to be, in particular, empty or partly used ducts, unused optical fibre and the   capacities of support masts for erecting additional cables or antennas for the construction of   electronic communications networks. If an investor or owner of commercial public   infrastructure and a party interested in shared use fail to agree on the concluding of this   contract and its content, the Agency shall decide on the matter, at the request of one of the   parties, under the procedure referred to in Article 218 of this Act. The Agency shall lay down   rules for the sharing of the costs of shared use of facilities or real estate.   (2) The Agency may order shared use only after a prior public consultation process has taken   place, which may not last less than 30 days. All interested parties must be given the   opportunity to express their opinion in the course of the public consultation process.   (3) The ordering of shared use must be objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and   proportionate.      Article 94   (implementation of shared use)      A natural person or legal entity providing a communications network must exercise the right   of shared use of the communications facilities or property referred to in Articles 91 to 93 of   this Act so as to cause minimal disturbance to the owner of the real estate and minimal   encroachments onto the real estate that is the subject of the shared use of facilities or real   estate, and cause minimal disturbance to the owner of the infrastructure to which the right of   shared use has been assigned or to the person that operates this infrastructure.      2. Regulation of undertakings with significant market power      Article 95   (undertakings with significant market power)      (1) In ensuring effective competition on the electronic communications market with ex ante   regulation, an undertaking shall be deemed to have significant market power under this Act   if, either itself or with other undertakings on a particular public communications network     market or public communications services market (hereinafter: relevant market), it holds a   position equivalent to a dominant position, i.e. such economic influence as to enable it to   exercise a considerable degree of independence in respect of its competitors, users and   consumers.   (2) Where two or more undertakings are present in the market, the structure of which is   considered to be conducive to coordinated effects, they may be treated as undertakings with a   joint dominant position within the meaning of the preceding paragraph, even in the absence   of structural or other links between them.   (3) Where an undertaking has significant market power in a relevant market (first market), it   may also be designated as having significant market power on a market closely related to the   first market (second market) if the links between the two markets are such as to allow the   market power held in the first market to be leveraged into the second market, thereby   strengthening the operator’s market power. Remedies aimed at preventing such leverage may   be applied in the second market pursuant to Articles 102 to 104 and Article 106 of this Act.   Where such remedies prove to be insufficient, the remedies referred to in Article 107 of this   Act may be applied.      Article 96   (criteria for assessing a dominant position)      Where the Agency assesses that an undertaking has significant market power under the first   paragraph of the previous Article, the following criteria shall be applied, where these criteria   are not cumulative:   1. the market share of the undertaking in the relevant market and the variation of its market   share in the relevant market over a longer period of time;   2. barriers to entry into the relevant market and the impact on potential competition in that   market;   3. the impact of large users on the power of the undertaking (countervailing buying power);   4. the elasticity of demand;   5. the stage of development of the relevant market;   6. technological advantages;   7. the development of sales and distribution networks;   8. the achievement of economies of scale or economies of integration;   9. the level of vertical integration;   10. the degree of product differentiation;   11. the possibility of access to financial sources;   12. the control of infrastructure that may not easily be duplicated;   13. the interconnection of services.      Article 97   (criteria for assessing joint dominance)      (1) The Agency may consider two or more undertakings to be in a joint dominant position   within the meaning of Article 95 of this Act if, even in the absence of structural or other links   between them, they operate in a market which is characterised by a lack of effective   competition and in which no single undertaking has significant market power.   (2) The circumstances referred to in the first paragraph of this Article are likely to be in place   where the market is concentrated and exhibits a number of appropriate characteristics, of   which the following may be the most relevant without being cumulative:   1. low elasticity of demand;     2. similar market shares;   3. high legal or economic barriers to entry;   4. vertical integration with collective refusal to supply;   5. lack of countervailing buying power;   6. lack of potential competition.      Article 98   (conduct of the Agency in determining significant market power)      In determining significant market power and using the criteria referred to in Articles 96 and   97 of this Act, the Agency shall act in accordance with EU legislation and adhere consistently   to Commission guidelines governing market analysis and the determination of significant   market power in the area of electronic communications networks and services. In doing so,   the Agency shall cooperate with the body responsible for the protection of competition.      Article 99   (determination of relevant markets)      (1) The Agency must, in the area of the provision and implementation of electronic   communications in accordance with the principles of competition law, with consistent   adherence to each and any Commission recommendation on the relevant markets of products   and services in the area of electronic communications and to the guidelines referred to in the   previous Article of this Act, determine the product, service and geographical markets relevant   to conditions in the country in its analysis of an individual relevant market. In doing so, the   Agency shall cooperate with the body responsible for the protection of competition.   (2) Where, by means of the decision referred to in Article 101 of this Act, the Agency intends   to regulate a market that is not mentioned in a recommendation referred to in the preceding   paragraph, it must first carry out a test of three criteria, which are cumulative, in accordance   with this recommendation for such a market:   1. the presence of high and constant barriers to entry of a structural, legal or regulatory   nature;   2. the structure of the market, which tends towards inefficient competition within a suitable   timeframe;   3. the fact that competition legislation does not suffice to ensure an adequate market   response.   (3) In the cumulative compliance with the criteria referred to in the preceding paragraph, the   Agency must, for regulation of such a relevant market, hold a public consultation in   accordance with Article 204, engage in cooperation in accordance with Article 214, and   consult other regulatory authorities, the Commission and BEREC in accordance with Articles   209, 210 and 212 of this Act.      Article 100   (analysis of relevant markets)      (1) The Agency must, at regular intervals of time, analyse the markets referred to in the first   paragraph of the previous Article. In doing so it shall, where it assesses such a course of   action appropriate under the circumstances, work professionally with the body responsible for   the protection of competition in accordance with Article 214 of this Act.   (2) The Agency must conduct the analysis referred to in the preceding paragraph no later than   three years after the adoption of the previous measure relating to the relevant market. This     period may, in exceptional circumstances, be extended by no more than three years if the   Agency notifies the Commission of the proposed extension, with its grounds for doing so,   and if the Commission does not signal its opposition to the extension within one month of   receipt of the notification.   (3) For relevant markets for which the Commission was not notified in advance, the Agency   must conduct the analysis referred to in the first paragraph of this Article within two years of   the adoption of the amended Commission recommendation on the relevant markets referred   to in the first paragraph of the previous Article.   (4) In conducting the analysis referred to in the first paragraph, the Agency must pay due   regard to the provisions of Articles 98 and 99 of this Act and follow the Commission   guidelines governing market analysis and the determination of market power.   (5) If the Agency fails to complete the analysis of the relevant market by the deadlines   referred to in the second and third paragraphs of this Article, it may request assistance from   BEREC. In the event of such assistance, the Agency must notify the Commission of the draft   measure under Articles 209, 201 and 212 of this Act within six months.         Article 101   (imposition, amendment, maintenance or withdrawal of obligations for undertakings with   significant market power)      (1) If the Agency finds, on the basis of an analysis of the relevant market, that this market is   insufficiently competitive, it shall determine by decision the undertaking or undertakings with   significant market power in this market. It shall acquire the opinion of the body responsible   for the protection of competition before issuing the decision.   (2) The Agency must, by means of the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph,   impose on the undertaking with significant market power at least one of the obligations   referred to in Articles 102 to 107 of this Act. In doing so, the Agency shall pay due regard to   the principle of proportionality, for which it must provide due grounds.   (3) If the Agency intends to impose the obligation of functional separation referred to in   Article 108 of this Act on an undertaking with significant market power by decision or, with   due regard to the principle of proportionality, impose other obligations for operator access or   interconnection that are not obligations as referred to in the preceding paragraph, it may do so   only with the prior approval of the Commission.   (4) Where a re-determination is made that a specific undertaking is an undertaking with   significant market power, the Agency may impose on this undertaking the same or other   obligations and repeal the previous decision.   (5) If the Agency finds, on the basis of an analysis of the relevant market, that this market is   sufficiently competitive, it may not determine any undertaking as being an undertaking with   significant market power. If this market was previously uncompetitive, the Agency must, by   means of appropriate decisions, abrogate all decisions that determined operators with   significant market power in this market. In such a case, the decision shall also lay down an   appropriate suspensory deadline, which may not be shorter than 15 days, and publish the   decision in a form that takes into account the prohibition of the publication of the business   secrets of the parties.   (6) In abrogating decisions pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall also   withdraw all obligations that undertakings had as undertakings with significant market power.   (7) The Agency may only take a measure under this Article after holding the prior public   consultation with interested parties referred to in Article 204 of this Act, in cooperation with   the body responsible for the protection of competition under Article 214 of this Act and with     other competent regulatory authorities in Member States, the European Commission and   BEREC under the conditions referred to in Articles 209 to 212 of this Act.   (8) The Agency may impose measures that change the technical details of previously   imposed obligations under this Article and that do not have a significant impact on the market   by decision in an administrative procedure, on the basis of the analysis of relevant markets   that formed the basis for the previously imposed obligations and with due regard to the   provisions of Articles 209 to 212 of this Act. The Agency must acquire the opinion of the   body responsible for the protection of competition before issuing a decision that changes the   technical details of previously imposed obligations.      Article 102   (obligation of transparency)      (1) The Agency may, on the basis of the decision referred to in the first paragraph of the   previous Article, impose obligations of transparency on a specific network operator with   significant market power in relation to interconnection and/or operator access by making   public specified information regarding interconnection or operator access.   (2) In doing so, the Agency may request the following from the operator:   - accounting information;   - technical specifications;   - network characteristics;   - terms and conditions for supply and use;   - all conditions limiting access to and/or use of services and applications;   - prices.   (3) In this decision, the Agency shall set out in detail which information should be made   public, the level of detail required and the manner of publication.   (4) The Agency may, in accordance with the first, second and third paragraphs of this Article,   require a network operator referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, by decision, to   publish a reference offer for interconnection and/or operator access. This reference offer must   be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that other operators that wish to request a service relating   to interconnection and/or operator access are not required to pay for facilities that are not   necessary for the service requested. This reference offer must describe the services that the   operator with significant market power is offering in relation to interconnection and/or   operator access, broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated   terms and conditions, including prices. If this reference offer does not meet the provisions of   this Act or the decision referred to in the first paragraph of the previous Article, the Agency   may, by decision in a supervisory procedure, require its amendment.   (5) Without prejudice to the provisions of the first to fourth paragraphs of this Article, a   reference offer for unbundled access to the local loop must contain at least those elements   that the Agency specifies in a general act drawn up in accordance with EU regulations.      Article 103   (obligation of non-discrimination)      (1) The Agency may, on the basis of the decision referred to in the first paragraph of Article   101 of this Act, impose obligations of non-discrimination on a specific network operator with   significant market power in relation to interconnection and/or operator access by making   public specified information regarding interconnection and/or operator access.   (2) Imposition of the obligations referred to in the preceding paragraph shall ensure, in   particular, that the operator referred to in the preceding paragraph:     1. applies equivalent conditions of interconnection and/or operator access in equivalent   circumstances to other operators providing equivalent services;   2. provides services and information to other operators in relation to interconnection and/or   operator access under the same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own   services or those of its subsidiaries or partners.     Article 104   (obligation of accounting separation)      (1) The Agency may, in the decision referred to in Article 101 of this Act and under the   regulations governing accounting, impose an obligation on a specific network operator with   significant market power to keep accounting records in relation to specified activities relating   to interconnection and/or operator access separate from accounting records for other   activities. This shall not affect application of the act governing the transparency of financial   relations and the separate recording of different activities.   (2) The Agency shall impose this obligation in order to oversee compliance with the   obligation referred to in the previous Article or, where appropriate given the circumstances of   the case, in order to prevent unfair cross-subsidy. This obligation shall be imposed, in   particular, on a vertically integrated undertaking and may require it to make transparent its   wholesale and internal transfer prices. It may also determine the format and accounting   methodology to be used.   (3) At the request of the Agency, the network operator referred to in the first paragraph of this   Article must provide accounting records, including data on the revenues received from other   parties with which it does business.   (4) The Agency may publish such information as would contribute to an open and   competitive market, while respecting the level of confidentiality of the information received   in accordance with national and EU rules relating to business secrecy.   (5) The Agency shall lay down the method of meeting the obligations under this Article in   detail by means of a general act.      Article 105   (obligation of operator access to and the use of specific network facilities)      (1) The Agency may, on the basis of the decision referred to in the first paragraph of Article   101 of this Act, impose an obligation on a specific network operator with significant market   power to meet reasonable requests for operator access to and the use of specific network   elements and associated facilities. The Agency shall do so when it considers that denial of   access, or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect, would hinder the   emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, or would not be in the   interest of end-users. The Agency may also impose additional conditions so as to ensure that   the obligations are met fairly, reasonably and in good time.   (2) The Agency may require, inter alia, that the network operator referred to in the preceding   paragraph:   1. give operator access to specified network elements and/or facilities, including:   - access to inactive network elements,   - or unbundled access to the local loop in order, inter alia, to allow carrier selection or pre-  selection and/or a subscriber line retail offer;   2. negotiate in good faith with undertakings requesting access;   3. not withdraw access to facilities already granted;   4. provide specified services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties on the retail   market;   5. grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are   indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services;   6. provide co-location or other forms of associated facility sharing in accordance with Article   91 and the first paragraph of Article 92 of this Act;   7. provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users,     including facilities for intelligent network services or roaming on mobile networks;   8. provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to   ensure fair competition in the provision of services;   9. interconnect networks or network facilities;   10. provide access to associated services such as identity, location and presence services.   (3) Where the Agency is considering whether to impose the obligation referred to in the first   paragraph of this Article, and in particular when considering whether such obligations would   be proportionate to the objectives set out in Articles 194 to 197 of this Act, it shall take   account, in particular, of the following factors:   1. the technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities, in light of   the rate of market development, taking into account the nature and type of interconnection   and/or operator access involved, including the viability of other upstream access products   such as access to ducts;   2. the feasibility of providing the access proposed, in relation to the capacity available;   3. the initial investment by the facility owner, taking account of any public investment made   and the risks involved in making the investment;   4. the need to safeguard competition in the long term, particularly in the area of   infrastructure;   5. where appropriate, any relevant intellectual property rights;   6. the provision of pan-European services.   (4) The Agency may, by means of a general act, regulate in detail other issues which arise in   the course of implementation of this Article. In doing so, it may determine, in particular, the   technical or operational conditions of access that beneficiaries or providers must meet in   order to secure normal operation of the network. Where this includes the obligation to adhere   to special technical standards or specifications, these must meet the requirements referred to   in Article 201 of this Act.      Article 106   (price control and cost accounting obligation)      (1) The Agency may, in the decision referred to in the first paragraph of Article 101 of this   Act, impose on a specified operator with significant market power an obligation relating to   cost recovery and price controls, including obligations for the cost orientation of prices and   obligations concerning cost-accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of   interconnection and/or operator access.   (2) The Agency shall impose the obligations referred to in the preceding paragraph if, on the   basis of the market analysis referred to in Article 100 of this Act, it assesses that the operator   concerned may sustain prices at an excessively high level, or may apply a price squeeze, to   the detriment of end-users.   (3) In imposing the obligation referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, the Agency   must, in order to encourage investments by network operators, including in next-generation   networks, take into account any investment made by the network operator referred to in the   first paragraph of this Article and allow it a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital   employed, taking into account any risks specific to a particular new network investment   project.   (4) Any cost recovery mechanism or pricing methodology prescribed by the Agency must   serve to promote efficiency and sustainable competition, and maximise consumer benefits. In   this regard, the Agency may also take account of prices available in comparable competitive   markets and from other network operators.   (5) Where the Agency imposes an obligation on the operator referred to in the first paragraph     of this Article regarding the cost orientation of its prices, the burden of proof that charges are   derived from costs, including a reasonable rate of return on investment, shall lie with the   operator concerned. In verifying this obligation, the Agency may use cost accounting   methods independent of those used by the network operator. The Agency may, by decision,   require a network operator to provide full justification for its prices, and may, where   appropriate, require prices to be adjusted. The burden of proof of this shall lie with the   network operator obliged to meet this requirement.   (6) Where the Agency imposes on the operator referred to in the first paragraph of this Article   the obligation to use a cost accounting system in order to support price controls, it shall at the   same time oblige the operator to make a description of the cost accounting system publicly   available, showing at least the main categories under which costs are grouped and the rules   used for the allocation of costs. Compliance with the cost accounting system shall be verified   by a qualified auditor. A statement of compliance shall be published annually.      Article 107   (obligation to regulate retail services)      (1) The Agency may, in the decision referred to in the first paragraph of Article 101 of this   Act, impose on a specified operator with significant market power on a specific retail market   obligations relating to the regulation of retail services.   (2) The Agency may only impose such obligations under this Article if, on the basis of the   market analyses referred to in Article 100 of this Act, it establishes that a relevant market   intended for end-users is insufficiently competitive and the obligations referred to in Articles   102 to 107 of this Act would not achieve the objectives it is seeking in the market.   Obligations under this Article may include prohibitions on:   1. the charging of excessive prices;   2. the creation of barriers to market entry;   3. the restriction of competition by setting excessively low prices;   4. the giving of undue advantages to particular end-users;   5. the unreasonable bundling of particular services.   (3) The Agency may, at the same time as imposing obligations under this Article, prescribe   one of the following methods:   1. retail price capping;   2. the regulation of individual tariffs;   3. cost-oriented prices;   4. prices oriented towards those in comparable markets.   (4) In meeting obligations under this Article relating to retail tariff regulation or other   relevant retail controls, the operator referred to in the first paragraph of this Article must use   the necessary and appropriate cost accounting systems laid down by the Agency in the   decision referred to in the first paragraph of this Article. In doing so, the Agency may specify   the format and accounting methodology to be used by such an operator. Compliance with the   cost accounting system shall be verified by a qualified auditor, in accordance with the act   governing auditing. The Agency shall publish a statement of compliance annually.      Article 108   (functional separation)      (1) Where the Agency establishes that the appropriate obligations referred to in Articles 102   and 106 of this Act have failed to achieve effective competition and that there are important   and persisting problems and/or market failures identified in relation to the provision of     operator access, it may, as an exceptional measure and in the decision referred to in the first   paragraph of Article 101 of this Act, impose an obligation on a vertically integrated   undertaking to place activities relating to the provision of operator access in an independently   operating business entity. This business entity shall supply operator access to all   undertakings, including to other business entities within the vertically integrated undertaking,   on the same timescale, terms and conditions, including those relating to price and service   levels, and by means of the same systems and processes.   (2) Where the Agency intends to impose an obligation of functional separation under the first   paragraph of this Article, it may do so only in accordance with the procedure referred to in   the third paragraph of Article 101 of this Act. It must therefore submit a draft that includes:   - evidence justifying the Agency’s conclusions;   - a reasoned assessment that there is little or no prospect of effective and sustained   infrastructure-based competition within a reasonable timeframe;   - an analysis of the expected impact on regulation of the market, on the undertaking,   including on the workforce of the independent entity and on the electronic communications   sector as a whole, and on incentives to invest in the sector as a whole, particularly with regard   to the need to ensure social and territorial cohesion, and on interested parties, including, in   particular, the expected impact on competition and any potential effects on consumers;   - an analysis of the reasons why the obligation of functional separation would be the most   efficient means of enforcing remedies aimed at addressing the competition problems/market   failures identified.   (3) The draft measure must include the following elements:   - the precise nature and level of separation, specifying in particular the legal status of the   separate business entity;   - an identification of the assets of the separate business entity, and the products or services to   be supplied by that entity;   - the governance arrangements to ensure the independence of the staff employed by the   separate business entity, and the corresponding incentive structure;   - rules for ensuring compliance with the obligations;   - rules for ensuring transparency of operational procedures, in particular towards other   interested parties;   - a monitoring programme to ensure compliance, including the publication of an annual   report.   (4) Following the Commission’s approval referred to in the third paragraph of Article 101 of   this Act, the Agency shall conduct a coordinated analysis of the relevant markets related to   the access network, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 100 of this Act.   On the basis of its assessment, the Agency shall impose, maintain, amend or withdraw   obligations in accordance with the seventh paragraph of Article 101 of this Act.   (5) The Agency may impose on an undertaking on which functional separation has been   imposed any other obligation referred to in Articles 102 to 106 or the second obligation   referred to in the third paragraph of Article 101 of this Act for any relevant market referred to   in Article 99 of this Act on which it has been designated as having significant market power   in accordance with Article 101 of this Act.      Article 109   (voluntary separation by a vertically integrated undertaking)      (1) An undertaking which has been designated as having significant market power in one or   several relevant markets must notify the Agency at least six months in advance of the   intention to transfer its local access network assets or a substantial part thereof to a separate     legal entity under different ownership, or to establish a separate business entity in order to   provide all retail providers, including its own retail divisions, with fully equivalent forms of   operator access under equal conditions. Undertakings shall also notify the Agency of any   change of that intent, as well as the final outcome of the process of voluntary separation.   (2) The Agency shall assess the effect of the intended transaction on existing obligations   imposed on the undertaking under Article 101 of this Act. For that purpose, the Agency shall,   in accordance with Article 100 of this Act, conduct a coordinated analysis of relevant markets   related to the access network without delay. On the basis of its assessment, the Agency shall   impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations in accordance with the seventh paragraph   of Article 101 of this Act.   (3) The Agency may impose on a legally and/or functionally undertaking any other obligation   referred to in Articles 102 to 106 or the second obligation referred to in the third paragraph of   Article 101 of this Act for any relevant market referred to in Article 100 of this Act on which   it has been designated as having significant market power in accordance with Article 101 of   this Act.      Article 110   (determination and analysis of transnational markets and the imposition, amendment,   maintenance or withdrawal of obligations on transnational markets)      (1) Where the Commission defines transnational markets in the area of the provision and   implementation of electronic communications by decision, every definition of a transnational   market by the Agency must accord with that decision.   (2) The Agency shall conduct an analysis of transnational markets together with the   regulatory authorities of other Member States covered by the transnational market.   (3) The Agency shall decide on the imposition, amendment, maintenance or withdrawal of   obligations for undertakings with significant market power on transnational markets together   with the regulatory authorities of other Member States covered by the transnational market.      Article 111   (supervision)      Within the framework of its authorisations, the Agency shall oversee the application of the   provisions of this Act on the ensuring of competition and compliance with obligations   imposed by decision under the provisions of this Chapter.      IX. DIGITAL RADIO AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION      Article 112   (digital radio and television distribution)      (1) Public communications networks intended for the distribution of digital television   services must be planned so as to also be appropriate for the distribution of high-definition   television services and programmes.   (2) An operator providing the public communications networks referred to in the preceding   paragraph must, in the receipt and redistribution of high-definition television services or   programmes, maintain their high-definition format. In doing so, it must retain the original   picture and sound quality, except where there is a need to adjust to the technical capacities of   the equipment for receiving and decoding a television programme or to the properties of the   network.     (3) The Agency may, by means of a general act, issue instructions for the classification of   programmes for which a licence has been issued under the Act governing the media. In doing   so it must pay due regard to the public interest sought by media legislation and the interests   of end-users. An operator referred to in the preceding paragraph that intends to change the   programme location within the framework of the general act referred to in the general act   referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph must inform the publisher of this programme   and notify them of the new programme location not less than 30 days prior to the intended   change. The classification of programmes under the general act referred to in the first   sentence shall not impinge upon the right of an end-user to freely choose the order of   programmes for his own use.   (4) The Agency may, by decision and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article   90 of this Act or the procedure referred to in the sixth paragraph of Article 90 of this Act,   order an operator that provide electronic communications networks as referred to in the first   paragraph of this Article to ensure access to application programme interfaces and electronic   programme guides under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.   (5) The Agency shall, by means of a general act, lay down the requirements for the   interconnection of digital interactive television services and digital television equipment used   by consumers.      Article 113   (conditional access systems)      (1) Conditional access systems for digital television and radio services operated in the EU   market must have the necessary technical capabilities for cost-effective transcontrol that   allow the possibility of full control by operators of public communications networks at local   and regional levels of the services using such conditional access systems.   (2) Operators of conditional access services that provide access to digital television and radio   services and on whose access services broadcasters depend must provide all broadcasters, on   a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis, with technical services enabling the services   to be received by subscribers by means of a decoder.   (3) The operators referred to in the preceding paragraph must keep separate accounting   records for conditional access services.   (4) Holders of industrial property rights to conditional access products and systems must   grant licences to manufacturers of consumer equipment on fair, reasonable and non-  discriminatory terms. When granting licences, such holders may not, through any conditions,   prevent manufacturers from including common interfaces in the same product enabling   connection to other access systems or elements specific to another access system, provided   that they comply with the relevant and reasonable conditions ensuring the security of   transactions of conditional access system operators.      Article 114   (supervision)      The Agency shall oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter and the   obligations imposed pursuant thereto.      X. UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND ADDITIONAL MANDATORY SERVICES      Article 115   (universal service)        (1) Universal service shall mean the minimum set of services of specified quality which is   available to all end-users in the Republic of Slovenia at an affordable price and regardless of   their geographical location.   (2) The minimum set of services under universal service shall include:   1. connection to the public communications network and access to publicly available   telephone services at a fixed location upon a reasonable request of an end-user, capable of   allowing end-users to make and receive local, national and international telephone calls,   facsimile communications and data communications, at data rates that are sufficient to permit   functional internet access;   2. the provision of access to publicly available telephone services upon a reasonable request   of an end-user via a connection to the public communications network referred to in the   preceding paragraph capable of allowing the establishment and receipt of national and   international telephone calls;   3. the provision of and access to a comprehensive directory and comprehensive telephone   directory enquiry service (hereinafter: comprehensive directory enquiry service) in   accordance with Article 116 of this Act;   4. the provision of public pay telephones or other public voice telephony access points, from   which it is possible to make emergency calls free of charge and without having to use any   means of payment, so as to meet the reasonable needs of end-users in terms of geographical   coverage, number of telephones or other public voice telephony access points, accessibility   for disabled end-users and quality of service;   5. the provision of measures for disabled end-users defined by the Government in agreement   with the minister responsible for the disabled that ensure that the use of and access to the   services referred to in the previous points of this paragraph are equivalent to that enjoyed by   other end-users, including access to emergency services. These measures shall also include   the obligation of a universal service provider to make available to disabled end-users, at a   reasonable price, the purchase or leasing of such terminal equipment that allows them to   enjoy equivalent use of and access to services.   (3) The reasonable request of an end-user referred to in the preceding paragraph shall include   connection to a single location at which the end-user lives or carries on his activity. The   connection may be made using wired or wireless technologies. If an end-user has the   possibility of alternative access to services from the set of universal services at an affordable   price, he may not request these services from a universal service provider under the   conditions of this Chapter.      Article 116   (comprehensive directory and comprehensive directory enquiry service)      (1) The comprehensive directory must contain at least the details referred to in points 1 to 4   of the first paragraph of Article 148 of this Act on all subscribers of publicly available   telephone services that have given their prior consent in accordance with Article 150 of this   Act. The comprehensive directory may be in printed or electronic format. The Agency shall   give its prior consent to the format.   (2) The comprehensive directory enquiry service, to which all end-users, including users of   public pay telephones, must have access at an affordable price, must contain information on   all the subscribers included in the comprehensive directory.   (3) Information in the comprehensive directory must be updated on a regular basis or at least   once a year, taking into account the method of its publication. The information provided by a   comprehensive directory enquiry service must be updated at least once a month. A universal     service provider providing a comprehensive directory or comprehensive directory enquiry   service shall immediately notify the Agency if another operator of publicly available   telephone services fails to provide it with the information referred to in the first paragraph of   this Article.   (4) A universal service provider providing a comprehensive directory or comprehensive   directory enquiry service may not treat information provided to it by different providers of   publicly available telephone services in a different manner.   (5) The universal service provider referred to in the preceding paragraph may not charge   providers of publicly available telephone services for the publication of information on their   subscribers in a comprehensive directory or the use of that information in a comprehensive   directory enquiry service.      Article 117   (provision of universal service)      (1) All end-users in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia must be provided with the   universal services referred to in Article 115 of this Act.   (2) The Agency may designate one or universal service providers when, on the basis of an   analysis of the situation and after prior consultation with interested parties, it assesses that   this is necessary in order to ensure the high-quality provision of universal service for the   entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia. The Agency may designate different universal   service providers in order to provide different parts of universal service or to cover different   parts of the territory of the Republic of Slovenia.   (3) Where the Agency finds, on the basis of the analysis of the situation and after the   consultation with interested parties referred to in the preceding paragraph, that a universal   service provider need not be designated for a particular part of universal service or to cover a   particular part of the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, it must, at regular intervals, which   may not be longer than two years, make checks to ensure that the designation of universal   service provider is still not required.   (4) The Agency may decide not to designate the universal service provider referred to in   point 4 of the second paragraph of Article 115 of this Act for the entire territory of the   Republic of Slovenia or a part thereof if, on the basis of consultation with interested parties, it   finds that this service or comparable services are available to a sufficient degree in this area.      Article 118   (designation of a universal service provider)      (1) Unless this Chapter determines otherwise, the Agency shall designate a universal service   provider by decision for a period of five years, on the basis of mutatis mutandis application of   the provisions of Chapter V of this Act governing public invitations to tender.   (2) The subject of the public invitation to tender shall be the provision of the various services   included under universal service, or the provision of universal service in a specific area or on   the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia.   (3) In formulating the criteria for the selection of a universal service provider, the Agency   shall take into account the objectives of reliability, quality and cost-effectiveness of the   provision of universal service.   (4) The Agency must, in procedures pursuant to this Article, pay due regard to the principles   of efficiency, objectivity, transparency and non-discrimination.   (5) If the public invitation to tender is unsuccessful, the Agency shall designate, by decision,   that undertaking with significant market power in the area of publicly available telephone     services at a fixed location referred to in the first paragraph of Article 95 of this Act to act as   the universal service provider. In the absence of such an undertaking, it shall designate the   undertaking with the greatest number of subscribers to publicly available telephone services   at a fixed location. In doing so, the Agency must adhere to the principles of efficiency,   objectivity and transparency.   (6) The Agency must, at least six months prior to expiry of the validity of the decision   referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, and on the basis of information on the   provision of universal service, establish whether the general availability of facilities and   services included in universal service requires redesignation of a universal service provider,   where it shall take into account the opinions of interested parties.   (7) The Agency shall notify the Commission of the universal service obligations imposed on   the universal service provider or providers referred to in the first paragraph of this Article.         Article 119   (disposal of a local access network)      (1) A universal service provider must notify the Agency in writing prior to the intended   disposal of all or a substantial part of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity   under different ownership.   (2) The Agency shall assess the effects of the intended disposal on the provision of access at   a fixed location and on the provision of telephone services in accordance with points 1 and 2   of the second paragraph of Article 115 of this Act. On the basis of its assessment, the Agency   may, by decision, impose, amend or withdraw a universal service obligation. If a universal   service provider has to be redesignated in a specific area or on the entire territory of the   Republic of Slovenia owing to the disposal, the Agency must use the procedure referred to in   Article 118 of this Act.      Article 120   (prices and general terms and conditions)      (1) The Agency shall monitor the development and level of retail prices of the services   referred to in Article 115 of this Act.   (2) The prices of specific services provided as universal service by a specific universal   service provider must be the same across the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia.   (3) The Agency may require a specific universal service provider to adjust the prices of the   services it provides as universal service if, on the basis of the information referred to in the   first paragraph of this Article, it finds that the prices are not affordable or that they are not the   same across the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia.   (4) The Agency shall, on the basis of collected information referred to in the first paragraph   of this Article, require an individual universal service provider, by decision, to offer price   options or packages for consumers with low incomes or special needs that differ from those   otherwise provided under normal commercial terms so as to ensure that they are not   prevented from accessing the network and using the services referred to in the second   paragraph of Article 115 of this Act. The Agency shall require this if it determines, on the   basis of the information collected, that the prices referred to in the first paragraph of this   Article are too high with regard to the average monthly income in the Republic of Slovenia as   published by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia and if they grow by more than   5 percentage points faster than the cost-of-living index from the previous year. The Agency   shall lay down in detail, by means of a general act, the method of taking these criteria into     account. The minister shall, in agreement with the minister responsible for social affairs,   determine those categories of consumers deemed to be persons with low incomes or special   needs. In doing so, he shall take into account the level of funds needed to satisfy the   minimum living requirements, or the level of physical disability in accordance with the   legislation governing disabled care. The legal representative, custodian or carer of a child   with special needs shall also be deemed to be a person with special needs.   (5) The prices of specific services provided as universal service, and the terms and conditions   applying to those services, must be made public and must be transparent and non-  discriminatory.   (6) A universal service provider must set the prices and the general terms and conditions in   such a way that subscribers to specific services provided as universal service are not obliged   to pay for facilities or services which are not necessary or not required for such services.   (7) A universal service provider designated pursuant to Article 118 of this Act must provide   its subscribers with the following cost-monitoring options:   1. itemised billing in accordance with Article 121 of this Act;   2. free-of-charge selective call-barring for outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS or, where   technically feasible, other kinds of similar application to prevent calls or premium SMS or   MMS or, where technically feasible, other kinds of similar applications of defined types or to   defined types of number;   3. a pre-payment system for payment for access to the public communications network and   the use of publicly available telephone services for consumers;   4. the phased payment of fees for connection to the public communications network;   5. at the request of the subscriber, information on other low-cost tariffs, if available;   6. other cost-monitoring methods for publicly available telephone services, including free-of-  charge alerts in the event of abnormal or excessive consumption patterns, if the Agency so   determines in the decision referred to in the first paragraph of Article 118 of this Act.      Article 121   (obligation to issue an itemised bill)      (1) A universal service provider must make available to subscribers with whom it has signed   a contract a level of itemised billing that allows them to verify and control their use and the   charges incurred (basic level of itemised billing). Calls which are free of charge, including   emergency calls, may not be identified in an itemised bill.   (2) The basic level of itemised billing shall be sent to subscribers free of charge and upon the   issuing of every bill, unless the subscriber informs the universal service provider that he does   not wish to receive itemised bills.   (3) The Agency may, by means of a general act, prescribe the minimum set of elements that   must be stated separately in the basic level of itemised billing.   (4) A universal service provider shall act in accordance with the provisions of the fourth and   fifth paragraphs of Article 139 of this Act in order to protect the privacy of calling users and   called subscribers in the issuing of itemised bills.      Article 122   (restriction or disconnection of service for reasons on the part of the subscriber)      (1) A universal service provider may restrict access to its services or disconnect a subscriber   and terminate his subscriber contract only if he has not settled his outstanding liabilities or   has breached other conditions laid down in the subscriber contract. A universal service   provider must lay down in the general terms and conditions which measure is to be taken in     the event of a specific breach, and the deadline by which it will be carried out. The selected   measure and the deadline must be proportionate to the breach and must be non-  discriminatory.   (2) In the event of a breach, a universal service provider must send a warning to the   subscriber in a reliable manner stating the deadline by which the subscriber must cease the   breach or settle his liabilities, and the measure that will be taken by the operator if the   subscriber fails to cease the breach or settle his liabilities by this deadline.   (3) Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a universal service   provider shall not be obliged to notify a subscriber of a measure in advance if the breach   results in an immediate and serious threat to public order, public safety or public health, and   if such a measure is envisaged in the general terms and conditions. Non-payment of bills shall   in no instance be deemed to be a breach requiring the introduction of a measure without prior   warning.   (4) Where technically feasible, a universal service provider must restrict access only to those   services in relation to which the user breached the subscriber contract, except in instances of   abuse or the persistent late payment or non-payment of bills. A universal service provider   may not restrict access to and use of the single European emergency call number ‘112’, the   police number ‘113’ and the single European missing children hotline number ‘116000’.      Article 123   (quality of universal service)      (1) The Agency shall prescribe, by means of a general act, the quality of universal service so   as to determine, in particular, the quality parameters, the limit values thereof, and the method   of measuring such parameters.   (2) The Agency shall also, by means of the general act referred to in the first paragraph of   this Article, prescribe the content, form, method and frequency of publication of information   on the quality of universal service.   (3) Universal service providers must send information on the quality of universal service,   including any changes thereto, to the Agency.   (4) The Agency shall monitor the quality of universal service and may take steps in   accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 224 of this Act.   (5) Should the Agency have grounds for doubting the veracity of the information referred to   in the third paragraph of this Article, it may, ex officio, order an independent audit, or a   review similar to an audit, of the information on the quality of provision of universal service,   with the costs of this being borne by the universal service provider.   (6) If the measured values of the quality parameters for a specific universal service provider   fail to reach the limit values at least three times in succession, the Agency may initiate a   procedure to select a new universal service provider.      Article 124   (data rate)      (1) The Agency shall lay down, by means of a general act, the data rate necessary for   functional internet access and the deadline by which this rate is to be achieved, which may   not be longer than two years. In doing so, it shall take into account the prevailing   technologies and bandwidth used by the majority of subscribers, and the technological   feasibility, with minimum distortion of the market.   (2) The Agency may, pursuant to the preceding paragraph, also determine the data rate that   enables broadband access, if broadband access is already used by at least half the households     in the Republic of Slovenia. The data rate shall be determined by taking into account the data   rate used by at least 80% of households with existing broadband access.   (3) Where the Agency finds that at least half the households in the Republic of Slovenia are   already using the broadband access referred to in the preceding paragraph, it shall draw up an   analysis of the impact of a change to the data rate which also takes into account the envisaged   costs of implementing this obligation. The analysis must be submitted for public discussion in   accordance with the second paragraph of Article 204 of this Act, together with the draft   general act.   (4) After expiry of the deadline set in the general act referred to in the first paragraph of this   Article, the Agency shall review the circumstances that led to determination of the data and,   where required, determine a new date rate in the general act.      Article 125   (compensation of the net costs of universal service provision)      (1) A universal service provider may request compensation for the net costs of provision of   the universal services referred to in the second paragraph of Article 115 or the fourth   paragraph of Article 120 of this Act.   (2) The net costs of the provision of universal service shall be calculated as the difference   between the net costs for a designated undertaking of operating with the universal service   obligations and operating without the universal service obligations, whereby the net cost   calculation should assess the benefits, including intangible benefits, to the universal service   provider. The Agency shall prescribe in detail, by means of a general act, the method of   calculating the net costs and the intangible benefits taken into account in the calculation of   the net costs of universal service provision. In doing so, it shall take into account the premises   defined in EU legislation governing universal service.   (3) A universal service provider must send accounting records and information that provides   a basis for calculation of the net costs of the provision of universal service to the Agency   within 90 days of the end of the business year. If it fails to do so, it shall forfeit the right to   claim net costs.   (4) The Agency, or an auditor authorised by the Agency, shall audit or check the accounting   records and information referred to in the preceding paragraph.   The Agency shall determine whether universal service provision could be an unfair burden on   a universal service provider. In such a case, it shall calculate the net costs of universal service   provision. If a universal service provider was selected by public invitation to tender, the   Agency shall, in its calculation, take into account the costs of provision of the universal   service offered by the provider in the public tender. The Agency shall take into account   different costs to those offered by the universal service provider in the public invitation to   tender only if the conditions taken into account in the public invitation to tender have   changed and if the universal service provider proves the justifiability of the deviations on an   objective and transparent basis. The Agency shall publish the results of the cost calculation   and the results of the review of the information provided by a universal service provider.   (6) Where the Agency establishes, on the basis of a calculation of the net costs of universal   service provision, that they do in fact represent an unfair burden, it shall set, by decision, the   amount of compensation, which may not exceed the calculated net costs.   (7) A universal service provider shall, at its request and under the conditions set out in this   Article, be paid compensation for the provision of universal service from the compensation   fund, which shall be established and administered by the Agency.      Article 126     (compensation fund and its operation)      (1) The Agency shall establish the compensation fund referred to in the seventh paragraph of   the previous Article by opening a separate bank account and keeping separate accounting   records for the fund.   (2) All undertakings operating in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and receiving   revenue from the provision of public communications networks and/or public   communications services in excess of EUR 2 million must contribute to the compensation   fund referred to in the preceding paragraph.   (3) The amount of an individual undertaking’s contributions shall be determined by the   Agency on the basis of its revenue from the provision of public communications networks   and/or services as a proportion of the total revenue from the provision of public   communications networks and/or public communications services of all undertakings referred   to in the preceding paragraph in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia.   (4) A universal service provider whose calculated contribution to the compensation fund is   less than the calculated compensation for the provision of universal service obligations shall   not pay a contribution to the compensation fund. It shall receive compensation in the form of   the difference between the calculated compensation and the calculated contribution.   (5) The entities liable under the second paragraph of this Article shall contribute the   calculated liability to the compensation fund on the basis of an Agency decision. In the   decision, the Agency shall also determine the deadline for payment, which may not be shorter   than 30 days.   (6) Undertakings shall notify the Agency by 31 March each year of the level of revenue   arising in the previous year from the provision of public communications networks and   public communications services. If an undertaking fails to do so by this deadline, the Agency   shall take into account as the revenue referred to in the second paragraph of this Article the   undertaking’s total revenue for the previous year, obtained on the basis of information held   by the Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services.   (7) Should it have grounds for doubting the veracity of the information reported to it by an   undertaking, the Agency, or a qualified auditor selected by the Agency, may review the   information and estimate the revenue, with the costs of this procedure being borne by the   undertaking. Where the estimated revenue deviates substantially from the revenue income   referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Agency shall take the estimated revenue into   account in its calculation.   (8) Information on the compensation of the net costs of universal service provision, the   method of its allocation and use and the parts that were financed shall be public. For this   purpose, the Agency shall publish an annual report on compensation of the net costs of   universal service provision, the calculated net costs, the intangible benefits taken into account   in the calculation of the net costs, and the contributions paid.      Article 127   (additional mandatory services)      (1) The Government may, by decree, lay down additional services to be publicly available   across the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia, in addition to the services referred to in   the second paragraph of Article 115 of this Act, and their level of quality, with due regard to   the development of electronic communications, the existing range of public communications   services in the market, the development strategy of the state as a whole, and the interests of   end-users.   (2) If certain additional services are not publicly available in a certain area of the Republic of     Slovenia or if the prescribed quality is not provided in that area, a provider of additional   services shall be selected for that area.   (3) A provider of additional services shall be selected by the Agency by decision and on the   basis of a public invitation to tender, with mutatis mutandis application of the provisions of   Chapter V of this Act and taking into account the principles of efficiency, objectivity and   transparency. The subject of the public invitation to tender shall be the provision of an   additional service in a specific area of the Republic of Slovenia. The selection criteria shall,   in particular, be the ability to provide an additional service and the costs of such provision.   (4) The selected provider of an additional service must provide it in a cost-effective manner   and apply the same conditions to all users.   (5) Neither the provisions of Article 126 of this Act nor any other compensation mechanism   that would include contributions from undertakings in the Republic of Slovenia shall be   applied to the financing of additional services. The ministry responsible for electronic   communications shall, through mutatis mutandis application of Article 125 of this Act,   finance the compensation of any net costs of the provision of an additional mandatory   service.      Article 128   (supervision)      The Agency shall oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter and the   obligations imposed pursuant thereto.      XI. USERS’ RIGHTS      Article 129   (subscriber contracts)      (1) A subscriber contract must include at least the following in a clear, comprehensible and   easily accessible form:   1. the name and address or company name and registered office of the undertaking;   2. a statement of the services, in particular:   - information on whether it provides access to emergency services and caller location data,   and all restrictions relating to the provision of the emergency services referred to in Article   134 of this Act,   - information on all other conditions restricting access to or the use of services and   applications and permitted pursuant to other regulations,   - information on the minimum level of quality of the services provided, including the supply   time for initial connection and, where appropriate in light of the circumstances, information   on other service quality parameters as laid down in the general act referred to in Article 133   of this Act,   - information on all procedures put in place by the undertaking to measure and shape traffic   so as to avoid filling or overfilling a network link, and information on how those procedures   could affect service quality,   - the types of maintenance service offered and customer support services provided, and the   means of contacting these services,   - all restrictions imposed by the provider on the use of terminal equipment supplied;   3. where an obligation exists under Article 137 of this Act, information on whether the   subscriber has the option to choose whether or not his personal data is included in the   directory, and the data concerned;     4. details of the prices and tariffs for the services that are the subject of the contract and apply   from the signing of the contract, information on the method of receiving up-to-date   information on all applicable tariffs and maintenance charges, and information on the   possible payment methods and the differences in costs based on the payment method;   5. the period of validity of the subscriber contract and the conditions for renewal and   termination of the contract or the provision of services, including information on:   - any minimum usage or duration required to benefit from promotional terms,   - any charges related to portability of numbers and other identifiers,   - any charges due on termination of the contract, including any cost recovery with respect to   terminal equipment;   6. details on any compensation and the refund arrangements which apply if the undertaking   fails to meet the contractually agreed service quality levels;   7. the procedure for the settlement of disputes under this Act;   8. the types of action available to the undertaking in reaction to security or integrity incidents   or in the event of network threats and vulnerabilities;   9. the method used to notify subscribers of an intended change to the terms and conditions   laid down in the subscriber contract, and the method of exercise of a subscriber’s right to   terminate a contract in such a case;   10. procedures applying to non-payment for services;   11. the method used to calculate the user fee for the period of use of any terminal equipment   received in the event of early termination of a subscriber contract, if the contract also includes   the sale of terminal equipment;   12. information specifically intended for disabled subscribers;   13. other provisions in agreement with the subscriber.   (2) Subscribers must be notified of any change to the terms and conditions laid down in the   subscriber contract not less than 30 days prior to the proposed introduction of the changes.   Subscribers must be informed that, unless the change to the terms and conditions laid down in   the subscriber contract are necessary as a result of the requirement to adjust to this Act or to   regulations adopted pursuant thereto, they shall have the right to withdraw from the   subscriber contract, by the same deadline, without a notice period, without paying the costs of   termination of the subscriber contract and without a contractual penalty, if they do not accept   the changes. The Agency may, by means of a general act, prescribe the form and method of   publication of the notice.   (3) The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not affect or impinge upon the   subscriber’s due and unpaid liabilities nor the subscriber’s contractually agreed obligations.   (4) A subscriber who, upon concluding a subscriber contract, received terminal equipment at   a promotional price may, when withdrawing from a contract prior to expiry of the   commitment period under the second paragraph of this Article, choose to return to the   operator an amount that corresponds to a proportionate part of the total value of the terminal   equipment and retain the terminal equipment, or return the terminal equipment in the state in   which it was delivered to him and pay the user fee applying to the period of use of the   terminal equipment, with the operator returning the purchase amount to him. An operator   may offer to maintain a subscriber contract under the terms and conditions laid down in the   existing contract for a subscriber who wishes to exercise the right of withdrawal.   (5) The provisions of this Article shall be applied to consumers when they conclude a   subscriber contract with an operator and to other end-users when the provisions so require.      Article 130   (commitment period of a subscriber contract)        (1) A subscriber contract with a consumer and a service provider may not lay down an initial   commitment period that exceeds 24 months. In every case an operator must offer users the   possibility of concluding a subscriber contract with a commitment period of not more than 12   months.   (2) Without prejudice to any minimum contractual period, the conditions and procedures for   contract termination must not act as a disincentive against changing service provider.      Article 131   (number portability)      (1) All operators must enable subscribers with numbers from the telephone numbering plan   referred to in Article 63 of this Act to retain their number or numbers when changing service   providers in the following instances:   1. in the case of geographic numbers, at a specific location;   2. in the case of non-geographic numbers, at any location.   (2) Without prejudice to the provision of the preceding paragraph, this shall not apply to the   porting of numbers from a network providing services at a fixed location to a mobile   network, or vice versa.   (3) An operator may charge a subscriber a one-off fee for the porting of a number to another   operator. This fee shall take account of the costs of the porting, but may not be so high as to   act as a disincentive to use this facility.   (4) The Agency may not set retail prices for the porting of numbers in a manner that would   distort competition, for example through the setting of specific or common retail tariffs.   (5) The costs of the provision of a network facility that enables number portability shall be   borne by the operator. The operator of the network in which the call was generated shall pay   the costs under the interconnection contract to the operator of the network in which the call to   the ported number ends.   (6) The prices charged between operators in relation to number portability must be cost-  oriented.   (7) Operators must port and activate a number as quickly as possible. In every case the   number must be activated within one working day counting from the moment the operator to   which the number is to be ported receives a signed contract on the porting of the number   from the other operator.   (8) The Agency shall regulate the method of implementation of number portability, as well as   technical and other requirements for compliance with the provisions of this Article, in detail   by means of a general act.   (9) An operator must send the Agency a printout of the total number of all numbers, by type   and block, that were ported to another operator or ported to that operator in the last year by   15 January of the current year, i.e. reflecting the situation as at 31 December as reported by   the manager of the central database of ported numbers. The operator may also mandate the   manager of the database of ported numbers to send the information on the ported numbers to   the Agency.      Article 132   (transparency and publication of information)      (1) The Agency shall encourage operators to publish transparent, comparable, adequate and   up-to-date information on applicable prices and tariffs, on any charges due upon termination   of a contract, and on the standard terms and conditions in respect of access to publicly   available electronic communications services and the use of these services for end-users and     consumers. This information must be published in a clear, comprehensive and easily   accessible form. To this end, the Agency may issue recommendations, including additional   requirements regarding the form in which such information must be published. The Agency   may, where appropriate, encourage operators to undertake self-regulatory or co-regulatory   measures such as the signing of voluntary codes of conduct.   (2) If the Agency finds that adequate and high-quality information is not available on the   basis of the preceding paragraph, it may, by means of a general act, specify that operators   must, inter alia:   1. provide subscribers with information on applicable tariffs regarding any number or service   that is subject to special pricing conditions, where, with respect to individual categories of   service, the Agency may require such information to be communicated directly prior to   connecting the call;   2. notify subscribers of all changes regarding the provision of access to emergency services   or to caller location data as part of the services to which they are subscribed;   3. notify subscribers of all changes to conditions that restrict access to or the use of services   and applications and permitted under the legislation of the Republic of Slovenia, in   accordance with EU regulations;   4. provide information on all procedures put in place by the undertaking to measure and   shape traffic so as to avoid filling or overfilling a network link, as well as information on how   those procedures could affect service quality;   5. inform subscribers of the right to include their personal data in the directory and of the   types of personal data, in accordance with Article 137 of this Act;   6. regularly inform disabled subscribers, using technologies adapted to their needs, of details   of products and services designed for them.   (3) The Agency shall publish up-to-date links to the websites of operators to allow   information on operators’ services, prices and general terms and conditions to be monitored   and compared. If applications that provide comparable information are not available free of   charge or at a reasonable price in the market, the Agency may provide those applications   itself.      Article 133   (quality of public communications services)      (1) The Agency may, after taking account of the views of interested parties, require operators   to publish comparable, adequate and up-to-date information on the quality of their services   and on measures taken to ensure equivalence of access for disabled end-users. The operator   must, upon request, supply this information to the Agency in advance of its publication.   (2) The Agency may, by means of a general act, regulate in detail the issues arising from the   implementation of this Article. In particular, it may set the quality of service parameters to be   measured and the content, form and manner of the information to be published, including   possible quality certification mechanisms, in order to ensure that end-users, including   disabled end-users, have access to comprehensive, comparable, reliable and user-friendly   information.   (3) The Agency may, by decision, impose a minimum quality of service requirement on   operators of public communications networks in order to prevent the degradation of service,   including the hindering or slowing down of traffic over their networks.   (4) Prior the issuing of the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Agency must   send the Commission and BEREC a summary of the grounds for action, the envisaged   requirements and the proposed course of action. The Agency shall take utmost account of any   comments and recommendations the Commission might make after examining this     information.   (5) The Agency may issue a recommendation on the method of setting the compensation to   be reimbursed to its end-users in the event of non-operation or poor quality of operation of   public communications services.      Article 134   (emergency call numbers)      (1) An operator must ensure that all users of electronic communications services that enable   the making of internal calls to a number or numbers from the numbering plan referred to in   Article 63 of this Act, including users of public pay telephones, are able to call the emergency   services free of charge and without having to use any means of payment.   (2) An operator must enable disabled users to make emergency calls using spoken and sign   languages and other forms of non-verbal language. An operator or provider must provide   such emergency calls in the method and to the extent allowed by the technology. Should an   operator or provider claim that it is unable to meet the obligations referred to in the previous   two sentences, the burden of proving the technical incapacity to provide such emergency calls   shall rest with that operator or provider.   (3) Operators of public communications networks and providers of publicly available   telephone services must ensure that the transfer of a call to the emergency service dealing   with the call is free of charge.   (4) Operators of public communications networks must, for every call to the single European   emergency call number ‘112’ and police number ‘113’ send number and caller location data   free of charge to the emergency service handling the call as soon as the call reaches that   service. Operators shall send all information to the extent allowed by the technology.   Operators shall bear the burden of proving the extent of any technical incapacity.   (5) An operator must inform its users of the existence and importance of the single European   emergency call number ‘112’ and the single European missing children hotline number   ‘116000’ in a visible place on its website and in the directory. It must inform its users of the   existence and importance of the emergency call number ‘112’ by SMS upon their entry into   the network of another Member State. With the prior agreement of the roaming user’s   operator, a roaming user may upon, entry into its network, be informed of the existence and   importance of the emergency call number ‘112’ by SMS, if this is technically possible. The   content of the notification shall be determined by the body responsible for handling   emergency calls to the single European emergency call number ‘112’.   (6) In agreement with the minister responsible for protection and rescue, the minister shall   prescribe the service quality for the single European emergency call number ‘112’,   determining, in particular, the quality parameters, their limit values and the method of   measuring these parameters, and the criteria for ensuring accurate and reliable caller location   identification.   (7) Abuse of an emergency call shall be prohibited. Any person who calls an emergency call   number at least three times a day for the same purpose despite being warned on each occasion   by a body that receives emergency calls that the content of the call is not of the type handled   by any body charged with receiving emergency calls in the Republic of Slovenia shall be   deemed to be abusing an emergency call.      Article 135   (measures for disabled users)      (1) The Government may, at the coordinated proposal of the minister and the minister     responsible for the disabled, and if it deemed it necessary, lay down by decree the technical   and functional requirements that must be met by providers of electronic communications   services to provide disabled end-users with access to electronic communications services that   is equivalent to the access enjoyed by the majority of end-users and the possibility of taking   advantage of the choice of undertakings and service providers available to the majority of   end-users.   (2) The Republic of Slovenia shall, in accordance with the act governing the media, give   particular support to the creation and broadcast of programmes intended for blind, deaf and   deaf-blind users using technologies adapted to their needs, and the development of the   corresponding technical infrastructure.   (3) The ministry responsible for radio and telecommunications terminal equipment shall take   steps to encourage the making available of appropriate terminal equipment to provide the   necessary services and functions to disabled end-users.   (4) The ministry referred to in the preceding paragraph, with the cooperation of the ministry   responsible for the media, shall encourage suppliers of digital television equipment and   providers of digital television services to work together to provide interoperable television   services for disabled end-users.      Article 136   (radio and telecommunications terminal equipment)      (1) Users may not connect to a public communications network radio or telecommunications   terminal equipment that does not comply with requirements under the regulations governing   radio and telecommunications terminal equipment and the regulations governing   electromagnetic compatibility.   (2) Operators may not reject any reasonable request to connect the terminal equipment of a   user that complies with requirements under the regulations governing radio and   telecommunications terminal equipment and the regulations governing electromagnetic   compatibility.      Article 137   (directories and directory enquiry services)      (1) Subscribers to publicly available telephone services shall have the right to have an entry   in the comprehensive directory referred to in Article 116 of this Act.   (2) Subscribers referred to in the preceding paragraph that wish to be entered in the   comprehensive directory shall have the right to have their information made available to   providers of directory enquiry services and/or directories.   (3) Every end-user of publicly available telephone services must have access to the   comprehensive directory enquiry services referred to in Article 116 of this Act, as well as   access to directory enquiry services in other Member States by voice call or SMS.   (4) Operators and the resellers of their services that allocate telephone numbers to subscribers   must meet all reasonable requests to provide publicly available directory services and   directories, including the comprehensive directory enquiry service and comprehensive   directory, and make available to providers of directory services and directories the relevant   information in an agreed format on fair, objective, cost-oriented and non-discriminatory   terms. The Agency shall decide in accordance with Articles 217 and 218 of this Act in the   event of a dispute.   (5) The Agency may impose, by decision, obligations and conditions on operators that   control end-users’ access in relation to the provisions of directory enquiry services in     accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 90 of this Act.      Article 138   (additional facilities and obligations)      If the Agency, after consultation with interested parties, establishes that the facilities listed   below are not provided to a sufficient extent or that the obligations are sufficiently met in the   entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia or in a part thereof, it may, by means of a general   act, lay down that undertakings that provide publicly available telephone services or access to   a public communications network:   1. enable tone-dialling or the presentation of calling-line identification, if this is technically   and economically feasible;   2. enable all or some of the cost-monitoring options referred to in the seventh paragraph of   Article 120 of this Act, including the option of controlling costs for data services;   3. meet the obligations referred to in Article 122 of this Act.      Article 139   (itemised billing)      (1) All subscribers to publicly available telephone services shall have the right to receive   unitemised bills.   (2) If a provider of publicly available telephone services offers an itemised billing service   under its general terms and conditions or the general act referred to in the previous Article,   the provisions of Article 121 of this Act shall be applied mutatis mutandis to this service.   (3) All itemised billing offered by an operator which exceeds the basic level of itemised   billing referred to in the first paragraph of Article 121 of this Act must be defined in the   general terms and conditions. If an operator offers such itemised billing against payment, the   prices must be set at the level of the actual costs incurred by the operator from the requested   additional itemisation. This aforementioned shall not affect the possibility for other users and   subscribers to pay separately for individual services, where technically feasible, and in such   instances they shall not be included in the itemised bill.   (4) An operator shall, at the request of a subscriber to publicly available telephone services,   issue an itemised bill referred to in the preceding paragraph with a level of itemisation of   called numbers that guarantees protection of the privacy of calling users that are legal entities   and of called subscribers by deleting or concealing the last three digits of a number called. An   operator shall not be required to conceal called numbers:   1. in an itemised bill for calls between telephone numbers of the same subscriber;   2. if the subscriber is a consumer;   3. if the subscriber is a natural person or legal entity that performs a commercial or other   activity in the market and they request an unconcealed itemised bill and enclose with the   request a document showing to which user the number for which they are requesting an   itemised bill has been allocated and the user’s consent to disclosure of the called numbers   stating that it has been given in order to provide grounds for exceeding the costs of a   company telephone that had been agreed upon. An operator shall send the itemised bill to the   user, who may conceal the telephone numbers called for private purposes on the bill.   (5) An operator must retain a request relating to the sending of itemised bills with   unconcealed called numbers in accordance with point 3 of the preceding paragraph for one   year following the day the bill was sent and submit it to the competent authorities for   inspection at their request.        Article 140   (deprivation or restriction of access to and use of services and applications)      (1) Only a court in a specific criminal procedure, with due regard to the principle of   proportionality and in accordance with the act governing the criminal procedure, may deprive   an individual end-user of access to and the use of services and applications provided via   electronic communications networks.   (2) The provision of the preceding paragraph shall not affect the rights of an operator to   restrict access to and the use of its services for other reasons, under conditions laid down in   this Act.      Article 141   (restriction or interruption of service for reasons on the part of the operator)      (1) An operator may, without the consent of users, temporarily restrict or interrupt access to   its services if this is necessary for upgrading, modernisation or maintenance, or in the event   of faults or damage.   (2) An operator must announce restrictions or interruptions due to upgrading, modernisation   or maintenance in the public media at least one day in advance and, at the same time, inform   the Agency, and inform users and the Agency of wider restrictions or interruptions due to   faults or damage without delay.   (3) Restrictions or interruptions may only last as long as necessary for the execution of the   relevant works or for the removal of faults or damage.      Article 142   (right of objection and complaint)      (1) Every end-user shall have the right to object to a decision or the conduct of operators in   relation to the rights and obligations laid down in this Act and in the regulations issued   pursuant thereto, and to contracts on the provision of electronic communications networks   and/or services, to the relevant authority or body established by the operator.   (2) Organisations that may file an action under the act governing consumer protection may   file an objection in response to a breach of general terms and conditions and prices by   operators in transactions with users and consumers, as well as act under the provisions   referred to in the fifth to ninth paragraphs of this Article.   (3) An operator must log every error reported in relation to its decision-making or conduct as   referred to in the first paragraph of this Article by an end-user using a dedicated telephone   number of the operator.   (4) An end-user must file an objection within 15 days of the day on which they learned of the   contested decision or conduct referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, but no later   than 60 days from the issuing of the bill or the day the contested event that is the subject of   the objection occurred, where the objection shall also be deemed to have been made on time   if submitted by registered mail on the last day of the deadline for the complaint. If the   deadline would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, public holiday or non-working day, the   objection shall be deemed to have been made on time if submitted on the next working day.   (5) An objection may also be filed using a dedicated telephone number of the operator for the   reporting of errors. In such a case, the end-user must state that he is filing an objection within   the meaning of the first paragraph of this Article. The authorised person of an operator that   receives telephone calls relating to the reporting of errors must record all the information   important for the filing of such an objection. An operator shall be deemed to have received an     objection on the day it was reported via a call to the operator’s telephone number.   (6) Where an end-user sends an objection via electronic mail, the operator may, with the prior   consent of the end-user, send its decision on the objection via electronic mail to the address   from which the objection was sent or to the electronic mail address stated by the end-user in   the objection or supplied in the consent.   (7) An operator must, in its decision, state explicitly that this is its final decision and, in the   legal caution, set out the possibility of launching proceedings before the Agency, and state   the deadline for filing such a proposal. An operator must send a decision on an objection to   an end-user using a method that makes it possible to prove it has been delivered.   (8) If an operator fails to accept an objection within 15 days of its submission, the end-user   may, within 15 days of receipt of the decision, submit a proposal for settlement of the dispute   to the Agency.   (9) If an operator fails to decide on an objection within 15 days of its submission, the end-  user may, within 30 days of submission of the objection to the operator, submit a proposal for   settlement of the dispute.   (10) An end-user may also submit a proposal for settlement of the dispute to the Agency   when the operator accepts the objection but then fails to meet its obligations within 15 days   of the submission of the decision. In this case, the end-user may submit a proposal for   settlement of the dispute within 15 days of the expiry of the deadline for compliance with the   obligations.   (11) The Agency shall reject a proposal for the settlement of a dispute if the proposal is not   submitted by the deadlines referred to in the eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs of this Article.   (12) If a subscriber submits an objection or a proposal for the settlement of a dispute under   this Article using the procedure referred to in Article 218 of this Act, the operator may not   restrict access to its services, disconnect the subscriber or terminate the subscriber contract   for the non-payment of liabilities until final settlement of the dispute or a final decision is   made by the Agency, if the subscriber has, by the relevant deadline, settled the uncontested   part of the bill or paid a sum equal to the average value of the last three uncontested bills.   (13) The Agency shall handle a proposal for the settlement of a dispute in accordance with   the procedure referred to in Article 218 of this Act.   (14) An operator must lay down the method and procedure of resolving objections from end-  users in its general terms and conditions.      Article 143   (supervision)      The Agency shall oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter. In overseeing   the implementation of the first paragraph of Article 136 of this Act, the Agency shall only   supervise the operations of radio or telecommunications equipment in operation, and   cooperate and work in conjunction with the inspectorate responsible for the control of goods   in the market, with mutatis mutandis application of Article 222 of this Act.      XII. PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING AND PROTECTION OF THE PRIVACY OF   ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS      Article 144   (the terms ‘user’ and ‘services concerned’)      (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, ‘user’ shall mean any natural person using a publicly   available communications service, for private or business purposes, without necessarily     having subscribed to this service.   (2) This Chapter shall regulate the processing of personal data in connection with the   provision of publicly available electronic communications services over public   communications networks, including public communications networks supporting data   collection and identification devices.      Article 145   (general provisions on security of processing)      (1) Providers of publicly available electronic communications services must take appropriate   technical and organisational measures to safeguard the security of their services. If it is   necessary in order to ensure the security of their services with respect to network security,   they shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures in conjunction with the   provider of the public communications network.   (2) Having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, these measures   must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented. Risk shall mean, in   particular, every activity, service or product that encroaches on the secrecy, confidentiality   and security of the electronic communications network or electronic communications   services, which alters the accessibility, content or quality of service, and which an operator   can effectively eliminate itself or in conjunction with other operators.   (3) The measures referred to in the preceding paragraph must at least:   - ensure that personal data can be accessed only by authorised personnel for legally   authorised purposes;   - protect personal data retained or transmitted against accidental or unlawful destruction,   accidental loss or alteration, and unauthorised or unlawful storage, processing, access or   disclosure;   - ensure the implementation of a security policy with respect to the processing of personal   data.   (4) The Agency shall conduct periodic audits of the measures taken by providers of publicly   available electronic communication services, and may issue recommendations regarding best   practices concerning the level of security which those measures should achieve.      Article 146   (obligation to inform of a particular risk to network security)      (1) Providers of public communications services must inform their subscribers of each   particular risk to the security of the network immediately upon learning of that risk, with an   announcement on their website and in another appropriate manner. Where the risk lies   outside the scope of measures which the service provider can take, it must, at the same time,   inform subscribers of all possible remedies by which they can remove such risk, including a   statement of the likely costs, and allow them quick and effective access to protective   measures.   (2) In the case of abuse committed by third parties and arising through no fault of subscribers   or users, providers of publicly available communications services shall bear the costs of   providing public communications services that have arisen as a result of the abuse. It shall be   deemed that abuse did not arise through the fault of a subscriber or user when the subscriber   or user deployed all reasonable protective measures and adhered to the instructions of which   they were informed by the provider of public communications services under the preceding   paragraph.        Article 147   (confidentiality of communications)      (1) Confidentiality of communications shall be ensured under this Act for the purposes of   safeguarding the expected level of confidentiality in the use of electronic communications,   and ensuring freedom of communication and freedom of expression. Confidentiality of   communications shall relate to:   1. the content of communications;   2. traffic and location data relating to the communications referred to in the previous point;   3. the facts and circumstances in connection with the interruption of the connection or the   connection not being established.   (2) An operator and anyone involved in the provision and performance of its activities must   continue to safeguard the confidentiality of communications after ceasing performance of the   activity for which it was bound to safeguard confidentiality.   (3) Those entities liable under the preceding paragraph may only obtain the information on   communications referred to in the first paragraph of this Article to the extent necessary for   the provision of specific publicly available communications services, and may only use or   communicate this information to others in order to provide these services.   (4) Where operators obtain information on the content of communications or record or retain   communications and the traffic data related to them under the preceding paragraph, they must   notify the user of this when the subscriber contract is signed or upon the commencement of   provision of the publicly available communications service, and erase information on the   content of communications or the communications themselves as soon as this is technically   feasible and the information is no longer necessary for the provision of the particular publicly   available communications service.   (5) All forms of surveillance or interception of communications by third parties other than   users, such as listening, tapping, recording, retention and forwarding of the communications   referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, without the consent of the users concerned   shall be prohibited, unless this is permitted under the preceding paragraph or under Article   153, Article 160 or Articles 162 to 168 of this Act, or if this form of surveillance or   interception is necessary for the sending of messages (e.g. facsimile messages, electronic   mail, electronic mailboxes, voicemail and SMS services).   (6) The recording and retention of communications without the prior consent of the   participants of the communications shall be prohibited in the case of communications in   which such processing is not normal and where the participants, because of the nature of the   communication, do not expect such processing and cannot expect it in advance.

(3) Notification of a personal data breach to the subscriber or individual concerned shall not   be required if the provider of a public communications service has demonstrated to the   satisfaction of the Agency that it has implemented appropriate technological protection   measures and that those measures were applied to the data related to the security breach. The   provider of a public communications service must ensure that such measures render the data   unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it.   (4) Where the provider of a public communications service has not notified the subscriber or   individual concerned of the personal data breach, the Agency may, having considered the   likely adverse effects of the breach, require it to do so.

(7) Providers of public communications services must maintain a sufficient inventory of data   on personal data breaches. The data inventory must comprise the facts surrounding the   breach, its effects, including an assessment of the number of persons affected, and the   remedial action taken, which shall enable the Agency to verify compliance with the   provisions of this Article.

(6) Operators must, at their own expense, ensure adequate equipment and appropriate   interfaces in their networks enabling the lawful interception of communications in their   networks. In the lawful interception of communications in international electronic   communications networks pursuant to the act governing the Slovenian Intelligence and   Security Agency, network operators must, at their own expense, ensure adequate equipment   and delivery interfaces enabling the lawful interception of international communications in   their networks, or adequate pathways to delivery interfaces at the competent body’s control   centre.   (7) The minister shall, in agreement with the minister responsible for the interior, the minister   responsible for defence and the director of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency,   prescribe the functionality of the equipment and determine the appropriate interfaces referred   to in the preceding paragraph.   (8) The Agency shall oversee compliance with the obligations of operators referred to in this   Article.

Article 163   (general provisions on data retention)      (1) Operators must, for the purpose of acquiring data on traffic in the electronic   communications network as stipulated by the act governing the criminal procedure, for the   purpose of ensuring national security, constitutional order and the security, political and   economic interests of the state as stipulated by the act governing the Slovenian Intelligence   and Security Agency, and for the purpose of national defence as stipulated by the act   governing national defence, retain the data referred to in Article 164 of this Act if it is created   or processed during the provision of associated public communications services.   (2) An operator that acquires or processes the data referred to in Article 164 of this Act and   has its head office or branch office and equipment for the provision of public   communications services or a public communications network in the Republic of Slovenia   shall be subject to the obligation referred to in the preceding paragraph.   (3) The obligation referred to in the first paragraph of this Article shall also apply to the   retention of data referred to in Article 164 of this Act on unsuccessful call attempts, where   that data is generated and processed or retained (as regards telephony data) or logged (as   regards internet data) by providers of public communications services or network operators.   This obligation shall not include the retention of data on the content of communications.   (4) Operators may also cooperate to ensure retention of the data referred to in Article 164 of   this Act. The Agency may order an operator, by decision, to ensure retention for other   operators as well, if this is appropriate and necessary in light of their mutual business   relations. The decision shall also determine the eligible costs of an operator charged with   retaining data.   (5) Operators shall ensure retention of the data referred to in the first, third and fourth   paragraphs of this Article in accordance with the provisions of this Act for 14 months     following the day of communication for data related to publicly available telephone services   and eight months from the day of communication for other data.   (6) The competent body that decides on access to the data referred to in the first paragraph of   this Article may, at the suggestion of the person proposing a data access order, extend the   period of retention for a limited period if this justified by the specific circumstances of   criminal prosecution as stipulated by the act governing the criminal procedure, and the   requirement to ensure national security, constitutional order and the security, political and   economic interests of the state as stipulated by the act governing the Slovenian Intelligence   and Security Agency and national defence as stipulated by the act governing national   defence. The competent body that decides on access to data shall inform the ministry and the   Information Commissioner of this. The ministry shall officially notify the Commission and   other Member States of the extension of a retention period, and state the reasons for   extension.

All persons who have access to classified information as part of their work or service for  an undertaking covered by the act have a duty of secrecy in respect of the content of such  information. The duty of secrecy continues to apply after such work or service has  concluded.  Section 5-5.Technical surveillance countermeasures  The National Security Authority may inspect premises, buildings and other objects which  an undertaking controls either alone or together with other parties to determine whether  unauthorised persons could gain access to classified information through wiretapping,  physical observation or signal interception.  Information gathered during such an inspection may only be used for the purpose of the  inspection. The information shall be erased when it is no longer needed. Knowledge and  experience acquired by the National Security Authority through the inspection may be    11/30  used in the further development of the National Security Authority's general security  work.  The National Security Authority shall issue a report to the undertaking on the results of  the inspection. The report shall only contain information which may help to improve the  undertaking's security.  The King may issue regulations on technical surveillance countermeasures, and  regulations authorising the performance of such inspections by parties other than the  National Security Authority.  Section 5-6.Cryptosecurity  Cryptosystems which are to be used to protect classified information must be approved by  the National Security Authority.  The National Security Authority is the national administrator of cryptomaterials and a  supplier of cryptosecurity services to undertakings. The National Security Authority may  approve other suppliers of cryptosecurity services.  The National Security Authority shall approve encryption algorithms used in equipment  intended for export.  The King may issue regulations on cryptosecurity.  Chapter 6. Information system security  Section 6-1.Critical national information systems  An information system is nationally critical if it handles critical national information or if  it is itself of vital importance to fundamental national functions.  The King may issue regulations on the identification of critical national information  systems.

Section 6-4.Monitoring of critical national information systems  Undertakings shall continuously monitor their critical national information systems to  prevent, detect and counter incidents which may harm national security interests.  Incidents relevant to such security work shall be registered.  The sending of information to, from and within critical national information systems shall  be registered, stored and analysed to the extent necessary for the purpose of the  monitoring.  Information systems which process personal data shall only be monitored using the  methods and to the extent necessary for the purpose of the monitoring.  Information pursuant to the first and second paragraphs may be stored for up to five  years. Stored personal data may only be used to the extent necessary for the purpose of  the monitoring.  Where multiple undertakings are linked with the same information system, they may  agree that one of the undertakings shall conduct monitoring pursuant to the first and  second paragraphs on behalf of all of the undertakings. The undertaking which conducts  the monitoring shall ensure that the information security requirements in section 5-2 are  followed.  The undertaking shall ensure that authorised users of monitored information systems are  informed of the purpose of the processing of the personal data and what monitoring  measures have been implemented. They shall also be informed if the personal data is  released and, if so, to whom.  The King may issue regulations on monitoring of critical national information systems,  including provisions specifying    13/30  a) which types of information may or must be registered, stored and analysed in connection with the monitoring  b) who shall have access to information which is registered and stored in connection with the monitoring  c) how access is to be granted to registered or stored information  d) that information pursuant to the first and second paragraphs shall be subject to different storage period than five years.  Section 6-5.Penetration testing of critical national information systems  An undertaking may ask the National Security Authority to attempt to penetrate its  critical national information systems. The purpose must be to check whether security  measures are adequate. The undertakings' employees must be informed that such a check  may be performed.  If the check entails the processing of personal data, this shall not be more extensive than  necessary for the purpose.  Information to which the check provides access may only be used for the purpose of the  check. When the information is no longer required, it shall be erased. Knowledge and  experience acquired by the National Security Authority through the penetration testing  may be used in the further development of the National Security Authority's general  security work.  The National Security Authority shall issue a report to the undertaking on the results of  the check. The report shall only contain information which may help to improve the  undertaking's security.  The King may issue regulations on the penetration of critical national information  systems, and regulations authorising the performance of such checks by parties other  than the National Security Authority.  Section 6-6.Communication and content monitoring of information systems  An undertaking may ask the National Security Authority to check whether its information  systems process classified information beyond the scope permitted by the system's  security approval. The undertakings' employees must be informed that such a check may  be performed.  The National Security Authority may perform the check by intercepting and reading  information which is processed by or sent between information systems.    14/30  The check shall not encompass private communications or communications with  undertakings which are not covered by the act. If the check nevertheless intercepts such  communications, the check shall be stopped immediately, and information to which the  check has secured access shall be erased.  All persons who have access to information as specified in the third paragraph in  connection with work or service for the National Security Authority have a duty of secrecy  in respect of the content of such information.  The National Security Authority shall notify the management of the undertaking of the  methods to be used in the check and the National Security Authority's assessment of the  risk that the check may intercept communications as specified in the third paragraph. If  the management of the undertaking concludes that the objective of information system  security cannot justify the methods and the risk, the check shall not be performed.  Information to which the check provides access may only be used for the purpose of the  check. When the information is no longer required, it shall be erased. Knowledge and  experience acquired by the National Security Authority through the check may be used in  the further development of the National Security Authority's general security work.  The National Security Authority shall issue a report to the undertaking on the results of  the check. The report shall only contain information which may help to improve the  undertaking's security.  The King may issue regulations on communication and content monitoring of  information systems, and regulations authorising the performance of such checks by  parties other than the National Security Authority.  Chapter 7. Object and infrastructure security  Section 7-1.Critical national objects and infrastructure  Objects and infrastructure are nationally critical if fundamental national functions may be  harmed if their functionality is reduced or they are subjected to vandalism, damage or  unlawful seizure.  Ministries shall designate, classify and maintain an overview of critical national objects  and infrastructure in their areas of responsibility. All identified and classified objects and  infrastructure shall be notified to the National Security Authority together with a  specification of the classification category.  The National Security Authority shall identify, classify and maintain an overview of  critical national objects and infrastructure which do not fall within the area of  responsibility of any ministry.  Undertakings which control objects or infrastructure identified pursuant to the second or  third paragraph shall be notified of such identification.    15/30  Decisions on identification and classification which affect an independent natural or legal  person may be appealed. The ministry is the body of appeal in respect of decisions made  by the National Security Authority.  The National Security Authority may on its own initiative propose to a ministry that the  ministry make a decision pursuant to the second paragraph. If the ministry does not make  a decision in accordance with the proposal of the National Security Authority, the  National Security Authority may submit the matter to the ministry which has overall  responsibility for protective security work in the civilian sector or the ministry which has  overall responsibility for protective security work in the defence sector for a final decision.  The King may issue regulations on the identification of objects and infrastructure, and  regulations on notification of the National Security Authority.  Section 7-2.Classification of critical national objects and infrastructure  Critical national objects and infrastructure shall be classified if fundamental national  functions may be harmed if their functionality is reduced or they are subjected to  vandalism, damage or unlawful seizure. The following classification categories shall be  used:  a) HIGHLY CRITICAL if critical adverse consequences could result  b) CRITICAL if serious adverse consequences could result  c) IMPORTANT if adverse consequences could result.  The classification shall be based on a damage potential assessment, and the fundamental  national functions supported by the object or infrastructure and the consequences of  reduced functionality shall be specified. The reasons for the classification shall be  included in the overviews of critical national objects and infrastructure prepared by the  ministries and the National Security Authority.  If part of an object or item of infrastructure has a higher classification than the rest of the  object or item of infrastructure, that part shall be defined as an independent object or  item of infrastructure.  The King may issue regulations on the classification of critical national objects and  infrastructure.  Section 7-3.Protection of objects and infrastructure  Undertakings shall implement necessary security measures to maintain an appropriate  level of security. Such security measures may include  a) physical, electronic, human or organisational barriers,    16/30  b) systems designed to detect and give warnings about activities or incidents,  c) systems and procedures designed to clarify activities and incidents and the background to them,  d) monitoring of undesirable activities and undesirable incidents, or  e) a combination of the measures specified in a) to d).  Undertakings shall conduct a risk assessment to determine what measures are needed to  protect the object or infrastructure.  Protection of objects and infrastructure may also include a requirement for access  clearance pursuant to section 8-3.  The King may issue regulations on the protection of objects and infrastructure at each  classification level, and regulations on the use of security forces.  Section 7-4.Testing of security measures  An undertaking may ask the National Security Authority to attempt to overcome  established security measures in order to gain access to critical national objects or  infrastructure. The purpose must be to check whether security measures are adequate.  The undertakings' employees must be informed that such a check may be performed.  If the check entails the processing of personal data, the check shall not be more extensive  than necessary for the purpose.  Information to which the check provides access may only be used for the purpose of the  check. When the information is no longer required, it shall be erased. Knowledge and  experience acquired by the National Security Authority through the check may be used in  the further development of the National Security Authority's general security work.  The National Security Authority shall issue a report to the undertaking on the results of  the check. The report shall only contain information which may help to improve the  undertaking's security.  The King may issue regulations on the testing of security measures related to critical  national objects and infrastructure, and regulations authorising the performance of such  testing by parties other than the National Security Authority.  Section 7-5.Prohibition against accessing locations and areas  In the interests of defence, security and contingency preparedness, the King may issue  regulations on or make individual decisions providing that persons may not    17/30  a) access or stay in the vicinity of military areas  b) access or stay in the vicinity of specified locations or areas  c) observe military exercises or tests, military operations or other military activity.  Chapter 8. Personnel security  Section 8-1.Requirement for security clearance, access clearance and authorisation  Persons who are to have access to classified information shall be authorised in accordance  with section 8-9. The same applies to persons who are to have access to critical national  objects and infrastructure in respect of which a decision has been made pursuant to  section 8-3.  Persons who are to be authorised for access to information with a classification of  CONFIDENTIAL or above must hold a valid security clearance. Persons who are to be  authorised for access to critical national objects and infrastructure in respect of which a  decision has been made pursuant to section 8-3 must hold valid access clearance.  The King may issue regulations on the processing of clearance cases and the validity  period of clearances.  Section 8-2.Security clearance  Persons shall require security clearance if they are to have access to information with a  classification of CONFIDENTIAL or above pursuant to section 5-3.  The same applies to persons who may gain access to such information through their work.  However, security clearance shall not be undertaken if the risk that such persons may gain  access to such information can be eliminated through other, simpler security measures.  The King may issue regulations on the relationship between national security  classification levels and the security classification levels used by NATO, other countries or  international organisations.  Section 8-3.Access clearance  Within its area of responsibility, a ministry may decide that access clearance is required  for access to all or parts of critical national objects or infrastructure. The National  Security Authority may make such decisions with respect to undertakings which do not  fall within the area of responsibility of any ministry.  No decision requiring access clearance shall be made if other suitable security measures  can be implemented.    18/30  A decision requiring access clearance which affects an independent natural or legal person  may be appealed.  Persons may be granted access clearance if they are to have access to objects or  infrastructure classified pursuant to section 7-2. The ministry may decide that persons  holding a particular level of security clearance shall also be cleared for access to a  specified critical national object or specified critical national infrastructure.  The King may issue regulations on decisions requiring access clearance and the  relationship between access clearance and security clearance.  Section 8-4.Clearance decisions  A person may only be cleared if there are no reasonable grounds for doubting the persons  suitability related to security. Clearance decisions are made by the clearance authority.  In the assessment of suitability related to security, emphasis shall be given to  circumstances relevant to the person's reliability, loyalty and judgment in connection with  the processing of classified information and access to critical national objects and  infrastructure. The assessment shall be based on vetting.  The clearance authority shall ensure that clearance cases are elucidated as well as  possible. If there is doubt about whether a person is suitable for security clearance, the  clearance authority shall conduct a security interview with the person.  Emphasis may be given to information related to the following circumstances:  a) espionage, planning or committing acts of terrorism, sabotage, assassinations or similar acts, and attempts to engage in such activities  b) criminal acts or preparing for or inciting criminal acts  c) circumstances which may cause the person, or that person's associates, to be subjected to threats against their life, health, freedom or honour, such that the person may be coerced into acting contrary to national security interests  d) falsification or incorrect or non-presentation of factual circumstances which the person had to understand to be relevant to their security clearance  e) abuse of alcohol or other intoxicants  f) any illness that on medical grounds temporarily or permanently may reduce reliability, loyalty or judgment  g) compromise of critical national information or breach of security provisions    19/30  h) refusal or failure by the person to provide personal data  i) failure to notify the authorisation authority of personal circumstances relevant to security  j) refusal to make a pledge of secrecy, a statement confirming a desire not to be bound by a pledge of secrecy or refusal or failure to participate in a security interview  k) financial circumstances which might tempt the person to act contrary to national security interests  l) connections with organisations which have an unlawful purpose and which may threaten the democratic social order or which regard violence and terrorism as acceptable instruments  m) inability to perform satisfactory vetting  n) ties with other countries  o) other circumstances which may give reason to fear that a person may act contrary to national security interests.  In the assessment of whether a person is suitable for security clearance, no emphasis shall  be given to political engagement and other lawful social participation, such as  membership of, sympathising with or activities on behalf of lawful political parties or  organisations.  Emphasis may only be given to information about associated persons if it is relevant from  a security perspective.  The King may issue regulations on clearance and the conduct of security interviews.  Section 8-5.Conduct of vetting  The National Security Authority shall vet all persons requiring clearance.  The person requiring clearance must have consented to vetting. Such consent shall  include re-vetting pursuant to the third paragraph. Vetting shall be conducted at the  request of the clearance authority unless the National Security Authority has decided  otherwise.  The clearance authority shall wherever necessary request re-vetting within the validity  period of a clearance.    20/30  Vetting shall cover information provided by the person requiring clearance. The person  shall have a duty to provide complete information on circumstances which may be  relevant in the assessment of whether the person is suitable for security clearance. A  clearance case may be closed without a substantive decision if a person fails to respond to  enquiries by the clearance authority.  If the person requires security clearance at the security classification level SECRET or  higher, or is to be cleared for access to objects or infrastructure classified as HIGHLY  CRITICAL, and in other special cases, vetting may be conducted in respect of associated  persons.  Vetting shall also cover other information in the possession of the clearance authority,  and information from relevant registers. It may also cover information from other  sources, such as public authorities, places of service, workplaces and other references.  No information shall be gathered, registered or passed on which concerns political  engagement as specified in section 8-4, fifth paragraph.  The controller of relevant registers has a duty to release records information irrespective  of any duty of secrecy. Records information shall be notified in writing. No payment may  be demanded in respect of such register information.  The controller of relevant registers shall facilitate digital transfer of records information  to the National Security Authority.  Information received by the clearance authority in connection with vetting shall not be  used for purposes other than assessment of whether the person is suitable for security  clearance. However, the clearance authority may release information to the authorisation  authority if necessary for security monitoring of the person.  The King may issue regulations on  a) vetting of associates  b) re-vetting  c) which registers are relevant in the context of vetting  d) the procedure for records checks abroad  e) the release of information in connection with corresponding vetting conducted by the authorities in other countries  f) the archiving, storage, despatch and digital transfer of vetting information.  Section 8-6.Application of clearance on terms    21/30  In special cases, clearance on terms may be granted, for example restriction to one  specific position.  The King may issue regulations on the application of conditions for clearance.  Section 8-7.Clearance of persons holding foreign citizenship  A person holding foreign citizenship may be granted clearance following an individual  overall assessment, provided that there are no reasonable grounds for doubting that the  person is suitable for security clearance. In addition to the circumstances specified in  section 8-4, the assessment shall emphasise the security-related significance of the home  state, the person's ties with the home state and ties with Norway.  When conducting clearance of a person holding foreign citizenship, special consideration  shall be given to whether risk may be reduced through the application of conditions, for  example position clearance.  The King may issue regulations on clearance of persons holding foreign citizenship.  Section 8-8.Revocation, downgrading or suspension of clearance  If the clearance authority receives information giving grounds for doubting whether a  cleared person is suitable for security clearance, the clearance authority shall consider  revoking or downgrading the clearance, or suspend the clearance and implement further  investigations. The authorisation authority shall be notified immediately of any decision  to revoke, restrict or suspend a clearance. The clearance authority shall give the National  Security Authority notice of the decision, which shall include a statement of reasons.  Section 8-9.Authorisation  The head of the undertaking constitutes the authorisation authority, and is responsible for  security-related management and control of authorised persons.  An authorisation interview shall be held before authorisation is granted. Authorisation  may only be granted if the authorisation authority is not in possession of information  giving reasonable grounds for doubting whether a person is suitable for access to  classified information or critical national objects and infrastructure.  The National Security Authority may require the undertaking to keep the National  Security Authority informed of persons authorised.  The King may issue regulations on authorisation, the duties of the authorisation authority  and the duty of the undertaking to keep the National Security Authority informed of the  identities of authorised persons.  Section 8-10.Downgrading, suspension and revocation of authorisation    22/30  If the authorisation authority receives information giving reasonable grounds for  doubting an authorised persons suitability related to security, the authorisation authority  shall assess whether the authorisation should be maintained, revoked, downgraded or  suspended. The authorisation authority shall notify the clearance authority of the  decision.  An authorisation shall lapse if  a) the person leaves the position to which the authorisation relates  b) the need for authorisation is no longer present  c) the person no longer holds adequate clearance.  Section 8-11.Duty to give notice of circumstances which may affect suitability related to security  A cleared and authorised person shall immediately notify the authorisation authority of  circumstances which may be relevant to whether the person is suitable for access to  classified information or critical national objects and infrastructure.  Section 8-12.Release of information to the Police Security Service  In clearance cases where persons have ties with other states, the National Security  Authority shall at the request of the Police Security Service provide information about  persons' clearance status, ties with other states, place of service or which undertaking has  requested clearance.  Information may only be released pursuant to the first paragraph when the Police  Security Service states this to be necessary for performance of the service's tasks pursuant  to section 17 b and section 17 c (1) of the Police Act.  The King may issue regulations on the release of information to the Police Security  Service in clearance cases.  Section 8-13.Reasons for and notice of decisions in clearance cases  Any person who has been assessed for clearance is entitled to know the outcome of the  assessment. If it is decided that the person should not be granted the desired clearance,  the clearance authority shall on its own initiative notify the person of the outcome and the  reasons for it. The clearance authority shall also give notice of the right to appeal the  decision.  The statement of reasons shall not include information which may reveal circumstances  a) which are relevant to national security interests    23/30  b) which are relevant for the protection of sources  c) of which the person should not gain knowledge in the interests of their health  d) which concern the person's associates and of which the person should not gain knowledge  e) which concern technical installations, production methods, business analyses and calculations, and business secrets otherwise, provided that these are such that third parties could exploit them in a commercial context.  The clearance authority shall prepare an internal statement of reasons which specifies all  relevant circumstances.  Chapters IV and V of the Public Administration Act does not apply to clearance or  authorisation decisions.  Section 8-14.Disclosure in clearance cases  Once a clearance decision has been made, the person who has been assessed for clearance  is entitled to examine the case documents.  The person is not entitled to disclosure of all or parts of documents which contain  information as specified in section 8-13, second paragraph. Nor is the person entitled to  disclosure of documents prepared as part of the internal case preparations of the  clearance authority or the body of appeal. The exception in the second paragraph does not  apply to factual information or summaries or other processed forms of factual  information.  A person entitled to disclosure shall be provided with copies of the documents if he or she  so requests.  The King may issue regulations on disclosure in clearance cases.  Section 8-15.Despatch to a specifically appointed lawyer  A person who has received a statement of reasons pursuant to section 8-13, first  paragraph, from which information as specified in section 8-13, second paragraph, has  been omitted, or who has had a request for disclosure pursuant to section 8-14, second  paragraph, first sentence, refused is entitled to the assistance of a specifically appointed  lawyer.  The lawyer shall be granted access to factual case information and the parts of the  statement of reasons which are unknown to the person who has been assessed for  clearance, but not to documents prepared for the purposes of the internal preparation of  the case by the clearance authority or the body of appeal.    24/30  The lawyer shall advise the person assessed for clearance on whether he or she should  appeal.  The ministry appoints lawyers, who shall require security clearance at the highest level.  The King may issue regulations on entitlement to the assistance of a lawyer, the  appointment of lawyers and the information to which such lawyers may have access.  Section 8-16.Clearance authorities and central register of clearance decisions  The King will appoint one clearance authority for the defence sector and one for civilian  sectors. The intelligence and security services will clear their own personnel.  When special reasons so indicate, the King may appoint clearance authorities other than  those specified in the first paragraph.  The King may issue regulations on the establishment of a central register of clearance  decisions.  Section 8-17.Appeals related to clearance decisions  A decision concerning clearance, clearance on terms or determination of the earliest date  for re-opening a clearance case may be appealed by the person to whom the decision  relates. The same applies to refusal to provide a statement of reasons and refusal of a  disclosure request.  The appeal shall be submitted to the clearance authority. The National Security Authority  is the body of appeal. The ministry is the body of appeal in respect of clearance decisions  made by the National Security Authority at first instance.  The appeal deadline is three weeks from the date on which the recipient receives the  notice of decision. The appeal deadline is interrupted by any appeal against refusal to  provide a statement of reasons or refusal of a disclosure request. A new appeal deadline  relating to the clearance decision starts on the date the body of appeal's decision is  received or the recipient is otherwise notified of it. In cases where a lawyer has reviewed  the case pursuant to section 8-15, a new appeal deadline runs as of the date on which the  recipient receives the lawyer's advice.  Chapter VI of the Public Administration Act applies in clearance cases unless otherwise  provided in or pursuant to this act.  Chapter 9. Classified procurements, etc.  Section 9-1.Classified procurements    25/30  A classified procurement is a procurement where the supplier of the good or service may  gain access to or produces classified information, see section 5-3, or may gain access to a  critical national object or infrastructure, see section 7-1.  Section 9-2.Security agreements with suppliers  A classified procurement may only be implemented if the undertaking's agreement with  the supplier includes a security agreement. If a foreign supplier or its personnel have to be  cleared or granted access to classified information, the National Security Authority shall  approve the supplier before the agreement is entered into.  The security agreement shall clarify and specify the parties' duties and responsibilities  pursuant to the act. The security agreement shall always specify the security classification  level of the procurement, see sections 5-3 and 7-2, specified for each part of the  assignment, and how the supplier is to comply with the requirements of the act which  apply to the procurement.  Unless otherwise provided in the security agreement, the supplier must cover the cost of  compliance with requirements which follow from the provisions of the act.  The King may issue regulations on the content of a security agreement and on exceptions  to the requirement for a security agreement.  Section 9-3.Facility security clearance  Before a supplier may be granted access to information with a classification of  CONFIDENTIAL or higher, the supplier must hold valid clearance for the specified  security classification level. The supplier shall also be cleared if necessary for other  reasons.  A facility security clearance shall only be issued if there are no reasonable grounds for  doubting that the supplier is suitable for security clearance. In the assessment, emphasis  shall only be given to circumstances which may affect the supplier's ability and  willingness to perform protective security work pursuant to the act. The assessment basis  shall include vetting of persons who are members of the supplier's board and  management.  The supplier shall provide the clearance authority with all information which may be  relevant to the facility security clearance.  The supplier shall notify the clearance authority as soon as possible of changes to its  board or management, changes to its ownership structure, the relocation of offices and  equipment, the commencement of debt settlement proceedings, any bankruptcy petition  and other circumstances which may affect the assessment as to whether the supplier is  suitable for security clearance. If a security risk arises which cannot be eliminated  through protective security measures, the clearance authority may rescind the facility  security clearance. Classified information or critical national objects or infrastructure may    26/30  not be transferred to a new owner or be included in the administration of the estate in  connection with debt settlement proceedings or bankruptcy unless the clearance authority  has consented to this.  The provisions of Chapter 8 otherwise apply insofar as they are relevant.  The King will appoint a clearance authority for facility security clearance. The King may  issue regulations on requirements related to facility security clearance and the duration of  the clearance.  Section 9-4.Duty to give notice and authority to make decisions in connection with procurements for use in critical national information systems, objects and infrastructure  In the context of procurements for use in a critical national information system, object or  infrastructure, the undertaking shall assess whether the procurement may present a not  insignificant risk that the information system, object or infrastructure may be affected by  or be used in activities which present a threat to security. The duty to conduct such an  assessment does not apply if it is obvious that the procurement does not present any such  risk.  The undertaking shall notify the ministry if the assessment shows that the procurement  presents a risk as specified in the first paragraph. Undertakings which are not subject to  any ministry shall notify the National Security Authority. The duty to give notice applies  irrespective of any duty of secrecy. The duty does not apply if the undertaking itself  implements measures which eliminate the risk or render it insignificant.  The ministry which is notified pursuant to the second paragraph may ask relevant bodies  to comment on the risk associated with the procurement and the supplier's reliability in  security terms.  If a procurement for use in a critical national information system, object or infrastructure  may present a not insignificant risk as specified in the first paragraph, the King in Council  may decide that the procurement shall not be implemented, or that it shall be subject to  conditions. This applies even if an agreement has been entered into in relation to the  procurement. If no decision is made pursuant to the first sentence, the ministry shall  notify the undertaking accordingly. A decision pursuant to the first sentence constitutes a  special ground for enforcement pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Enforcement Act.  The King in Council may issue regulations on the duty to give notice and on authority to  make decisions.  Chapter 10. Restrictions on ownership  Section 10-1.Duty to notify in connection with acquisition of an undertaking    27/30  Any person who wishes to acquire a qualified ownership interest in an undertaking which  is subject to the act, see section 1-3, shall notify the ministry accordingly. In cases where  the undertaking does not fall within the area of responsibility of any ministry, such notice  shall be given to the National Security Authority.  A qualified ownership interest exists if the acquisition will, overall, give the acquirer,  either directly or indirectly,  a) at least one-third of the share capital, participating interests or votes in the undertaking  b) the right to own at least one-third of the share capital or participating interests, or  c) significant influence over the management of the company otherwise.  Shares which are owned or taken over by the shareholder's associates have the same  status as the shareholder's own shares; see section 2-5 of the Securities Trading Act. The  same applies to participating interests which are owned or taken over by associates of the  owner of the participating interests.  The King may issue regulations on the duty to notify.  Section 10-2.Processing of notice of acquisition of undertaking  The ministry or the National Security Authority which receives a notice pursuant to  section 10-1 shall make a decision on the notice as soon as possible.  Any person who receives a notice pursuant to section 10-1 may ask relevant bodies to  comment on the potential risks associated with the acquisition and the acquirer's  reliability in security terms.  Within 60 working days, the ministry or the National Security Authority shall notify the  party which has given notice that the acquisition has been approved or that the matter  will be considered by the King in Council pursuant to section 10-3. The period shall be  calculated as of the date on which the ministry or the National Security Authority received  such notice. If the ministry or the National Security Authority submits a written request  for further information within 50 working days, the period shall be suspended until the  acquirer's reply is received.  The King may issue regulations on processing of the notice by ministries and the National  Security Authority.  Section 10-3.Decision to prohibit acquisition of an undertaking  If an acquisition pursuant to section 10-1 may present a not insignificant risk of a threat to  national security interests, the King in Council may decide that the acquisition shall not  be implemented, or that implementation shall be subject to conditions. This applies even    28/30  if an agreement has been entered into in relation to the acquisition. If no decision is made  pursuant to the first sentence, the ministry shall notify the acquirer accordingly.  A decision pursuant to the first sentence constitutes a special ground for enforcement  pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Enforcement Act.  The King may issue regulations on the prohibition of acquisition of an undertaking.  Chapter 11. Special oversight arrangements. Coercive fines, fines and legal penalties  Section 11-1.Special oversight arrangements  Protective security work pursuant to the act is subject to the control and supervision of  the Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee in accordance with provisions laid  down in and pursuant to the Intelligence Services Oversight Act.  Section 11-2.Coercive fines  In the event of contravention of provisions laid down in or pursuant to sections 3-4, 4-3,  4-4, 4-5, 5-2, 6-2, 6-3, 7-3, section 9-2, first paragraph, section 9-4, first paragraph, first  sentence, or section 9-4, second paragraph, first or second sentence, the supervisory  authority may impose a coercive fine, which shall accrue until the matter has been  rectified. The same applies to instructions issued pursuant to section 3-6.  A decision on a coercive fine may be appealed to the ministry.  A decision pursuant to the first paragraph constitutes a special ground for enforcement  pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Enforcement Act.  The King may issue regulations on coercive fines.  Section 11-3.Fines  The supervisory authority may impose a fine on an undertaking if the undertaking or any  person acting on its behalf intentionally or negligently  a) contravenes provisions laid down in or pursuant to sections 3-4, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, 5-2, 6-2, 6-3, 7-3, 9-2, first paragraph, 9-4, first paragraph, first sentence, or section 9- 4, second paragraph, first or second sentence  b) contravenes instructions issued pursuant to section 3-6  c) provides incorrect or incomplete information to the supervisory authority pursuant to sections 3-4 or 4-5  d) contributes to contraventions as specified in a to c.    29/30  When setting the size of the fine, particular emphasis shall be given to the grossness of the  contravention, the duration of the contravention, demonstrated culpability and the  turnover of the undertaking. A decision to impose a fine constitutes a special ground for  enforcement pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Enforcement Act.  The power to impose a fine shall be subject to a five-year limitation period. The limitation  period shall be interrupted if the supervisory authority notifies the undertaking that it is  suspected of contravention of the act or a decision made pursuant to the act.  A decision to impose a fine may be appealed til the ministry.  The King may issue regulations on fines.  Section 11-4.Legal penalties  A penalty of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both, shall be  applied to any person who intentionally or negligently contravenes provisions laid down  in or pursuant to section 3-4, 4-3 or section 5-2, section 5-3, first paragraph, sections 6-2,  6-3 or 7-3, section 9-2, first paragraph, section 9-4, first paragraph, first sentence, or  section 9-4, second paragraph, first or second sentence, or who contravenes instructions  issued by the supervisory authority pursuant to section 3-6, unless the matter is covered  by a stricter penal provision.  A penalty of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both, shall be  applied to any person who intentionally or with gross negligence breaches a duty of  secrecy pursuant to section 5-4, second paragraph, or section 6-6, fifth paragraph, unless  the matter is covered by a stricter penal provision.  A penalty of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both, shall be  applied to any person who contravenes a prohibition issued pursuant to section 7-5,  unless the matter is covered by a stricter penal provision.  The same penalties shall be imposed in respect of attempted contraventions as specified  in the first to third paragraphs.  Chapter 12. Entry into force and amendment of other acts  Section 12-1.Entry into force  The act shall enter into force on the date decided by the King. The King may provide that  difference provisions shall enter into force on different dates.  1 As of 1 January 2019 in accordance with res. 20 December 2018 No. 2052.

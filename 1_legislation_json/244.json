Text in Bulgarian: Íàêàçàòåëåí êîäåêñ    GENERAL PART      Chapter One   OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THE   CRIMINAL CODE      Section I   Objective of the Criminal Code      Article 1       (1) (Amended, SG No. 1/1991) The objective of the Criminal Code shall be to protect the   person and rights of citizens and the whole legal order established in this country against   criminal encroachments.    (2) For achievement of this objective the Criminal Code shall determine which acts   dangerous to society constitute crimes and what punishments shall be imposed for them, and   shall specify the cases where instead of punishment measures for social influence and education   may be imposed.    Section II   Scope of application of the Criminal Code      Article 2       (1) To each crime applied shall be that law, which was in force at the time of its   perpetration.    (2) If by the entry of the sentence into force different laws are issued, that law shall be   applied which is most favourable for the perpetrator.      Article 3       (1) The Criminal Code shall apply to all crimes committed on the territory of the Republic   of Bulgaria.    (2) The issue of liability of foreign citizens who enjoy immunity with respect to the penal   jurisdiction of the Republic of Bulgaria shall be decided in compliance with the norms of   international law adopted thereby.    Article 4       (1) The Criminal Code shall apply to the Bulgarian citizens also for crimes committed by   them abroad.    (2) (Amended, SG No. 75/2006) No citizen of the Republic of Bulgaria can be transferred   to another state or an international court of justice for the purposes of prosecution, unless this has   been provided for in an international agreement, which has been ratified, published and entered   into force in respect to the Republuc of Bulgaria.    Article 5       The Criminal Code shall also apply to foreign citizens who have committed crimes of   general nature abroad, whereby the interests of the Republic of Bulgaria or of Bulgarian citizens   have been affected.    Article 6       (1) The Criminal Code shall also apply to foreign citizens who have committed abroad   crimes against peace and humanity, whereby the interests of another state or foreign citizens   have been affected.    (2) The Criminal Code shall also apply to other crimes committed by foreign citizens   abroad, where this is stipulated in an international agreement, to which the Republic of Bulgaria   is a party.    Article 7       In the cases of Articles 4 and 5 the pre-trial detention and the punishment served abroad   shall be deducted. Where the two punishments are different in kind, the punishment served   abroad shall be taken into consideration in determining the punishment by the court.    Article 8       (Previous text of Article 8, SG No. 33/2011, effective 27.05.2011)   (1) Any sentence of a foreign court for a crime to which the Bulgarian Criminal Code is   applicable shall be taken into consideration in the cases specified in an international agreement to   which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party.    (2) (New, SG No. 33/2011, effective 27.05.2011) Any binding conviction decreed in   another EU Member State for an act which constitutes a crime according the Bulgarian Criminal   Code shall be taken into consideration in every criminal proceedings against the same person   conducted in the Republic of Bulgaria.    Chapter Two   CRIME         Section I   General Provisions      Article 9       (1) Crime shall be an act dangerous to society (action or inaction), which has been   culpably committed and which has been declared punishable by law.    (2) Criminal shall not be an act which, although formally containing the elements of crime   provided by law, because of its insignificance is not dangerous to society or its danger to society   is obviously insignificant.    Article 10       (Amended, SG No. 50/1995)    Dangerous to society shall be an act which threatens or harms the person, the rights of the   citizens, the property, the legal order established by the Constitution in the Republic of Bulgaria   or other interests, protected by the legal system.    Article 11       (1) An act dangerous to society shall be considered culpably committed where it is   intentional or committed through negligence.    (2) An act shall be considered intentional where its perpetrator was conscious its nature of   dangerous to society, foresaw its consequences as dangerous to society and wished or allowed   the occurrence of such consequences.    (3) An act shall be considered committed through negligence where the perpetrator did not   foresee the occurrence of consequences dangerous to society, but was obliged to and could   foresee them, or where he foresaw the occurrence of such consequences but intended to avert   them.    (4) Acts committed through negligence shall be punishable only in the cases provided by   law.    (5) Where the law qualifies an act as aggravated crime due to the occurrence of additional   consequences dangerous to society, if no intent is required for such consequences the perpetrator   shall be held responsible for aggravated crime where he has acted with negligence with regard to   those consequences.    Article 12       (1) An act shall be considered not dangerous to society where it has been committed in   situation of inevitable defence against immediate unlawful attack on state or public interests, on   the person or the rights of the person defending himself or of another person, by inflicting harm   on the attacker within the framework of the necessary limits.    (2) The limits of inevitable self-defence shall be considered exceeded where the defence   obviously did not compare to the nature and danger of the attack.    (3) (New, SG No. 62/1997, amended, SG No. 120/1997, SG No. 75/2006) The limits of   inevitable defence shall not be considered exceeded where the attack took place through violent   penetration into premises or through violent housebreaking.      (4) (Amended, SG No. 28/1982, renumbered from Paragraph 3, SG No. 62/1997) The   acting person shall not be punishable if he has committed the act of exceeding the limits of   inevitable self-defence due to fright or confusion.    Article 12a       (New, SG No. 62/1997)    (1) It shall not be considered dangerous to society if damages are inflicted on a person who   has committed a crime, where this occurs in the course of detention of such person for his/her   delivery to the authorities and for prevention of opportunities for committing another crime,   provided there is no other way to detain such person and provided the necessary lawful measures   have not been exceeded.    (2) The necessary lawful measures for detention of a person who has committed a crime   shall be considered exceeded in the case of obvious discrepancy between the nature and the   degree of public danger of the crime committed by the person detained, and the circumstances of   detention, as well as where obviously excessive damages are inflicted on the person without   necessity. In such cases penal responsibility shall be sought only in the event of deliberately   inflicted damages.    Article 12b       (New, SG No. 32/2010, effective 28.05.2010)    An act shall be considered not dangerous to society where committed by a person acting in   his capacity of undercover employee within the powers conferred on him/her by law.    Article 13       (1) An act shall be considered not dangerous to society where committed by a person in   situation of emergency - in order to save state or public interests, as well as personal or property   rights belonging to him or to others, from immediate danger which the acting person could not   possibly avert in another way, provided the damages caused by the act are less significant than   those averted.    (2) There shall be no situation of emergency where the evading of danger itself constitutes   a crime.    Article 13a       (New, SG No. 28/1982)    (1) An act shall be considered not dangerous to society where committed under justified   economic risk - in order to achieve substantial results for the benefit of society or to avoid   considerable damages, provided it is not counter to explicit ban established by normative act,   complies to the modern scientific and technical achievements and experience, does not endanger   the life and health of another, and if the acting person has done everything within his capacity to   avert the occurrence of the harmful consequences.    (2) In deciding the issue whether the risk was justified, taken into consideration must also   be the correlation between the expected positive result and the eventual negative consequences,   as well as the probability of their occurrence.    Article 14       (1) The lack of knowledge of the factual circumstances, which belong to the elements of     the crime, shall exclude the intentional nature of this crime.    (2) This rule shall apply also to acts committed through negligence, where the lack of   knowledge itself of the factual circumstances was not due to negligence.    Article 15       An act shall be considered not culpably committed where the perpetrator was not obliged   to or was unable to foresee the occurrence of the consequences dangerous to society (accidental   act).    Article 16       An act shall be considered not culpably committed where perpetrated in fulfilment of   unlawful official order given in the established manner, unless it imposes the commission of   crime obvious to the perpetrator.

Section II   Preparation and Attempt      Article 17       (1) Preparation shall be the getting ready of the means, the finding of accomplices and the   creating of conditions in general for the perpetration of intended crime, before the   commencement of its perpetration.    (2) Preparation shall be punishable only in the cases provided for by the law.    (3) The acting person shall not be punished where he has given up the perpetration of the   crime of his own accord.    Article 18       (1) An attempt shall be the commenced perpetration of intentional crime, whereas the act   has not been completed or, although completed, the consequences dangerous to society provided   by the law and desired by the perpetrator have not occurred.    (2) For an attempt, the perpetrator shall be punished by the punishment provided for   completed crime, with due consideration taken of the degree of implementation of the intent and   the reasons because of which the crime remained unaccomplished.    (3) For an attempt, the perpetrator shall not be punished where of his own accord:    a) he has given up the completion of the crime, or    b) he has averted the occurrence of criminal consequences.      Article 19       In the cases of Article 17, paragraph (3), and Article 18, paragraph (3), if the act of   preparation or attempt contained elements of another crime, the perpetrator shall be held liable   for that crime.    Section III   Complicity      Article 20       (1) Accomplices in the perpetration of intentional crime shall be: perpetrators, abettors and   accessories.    (2) A perpetrator shall be a person who took part in the perpetration itself of the crime.    (3) An abettor shall be a person who intentionally incited another to commit a crime.    (4) An accessory shall be a person who intentionally facilitated the perpetration of a crime   through advice, explanations, promises to render assistance after the act, removal of obstacles,   supply of means or in any other way.    Article 21       (1) All accomplices shall be punished by the punishment provided for the perpetrated   crime, with due consideration of the nature and degree of their participation.    (2) Abettors and accessories shall be held responsible only for what they have intentionally   abetted or by what they have assisted the perpetrator.    (3) Where because of certain personal characteristics or attitude of the perpetrator the law   treats the perpetrated act as a crime, liable for this crime shall be both the abettor and the   accessory with respect of whom such circumstances do not exist.    (4) The special circumstances, due to which the law excludes, reduces or increases the   punishment for some of the accomplices, shall not be taken into account for the remaining   accomplices with respect to whom such circumstances do not exist.    Article 22       (1) The abettor and the accessory shall not be punished, if of their own accord they have   given up further participation and hindered the perpetration of the act or averted the occurrence   of criminal consequences.    (2) In such cases the provisions of Article 19 shall apply, respectively.    Section IV   Multiple Crimes      Article 23       (1) If by one act several crimes have been committed, or if a person has committed several   separate crimes before the issue of sentence that has entered into force for any of them, the court   shall, after determining punishments for each crime separately, impose the most severe thereof.    (2) (Amended, SG No. 92/2002 - effective 1.01.2005 with respect to the punishment of     probation - amended, SG No. 26/2004, effective 1.01.2004, SG No. 103/2004, effective   1.01.2005) Imposed punishments such as public censure and deprivation of rights under Article   37 (1), sub-paragraphs 6, 7 and 9, shall be added to the most severe punishment determined.   Where deprivation of the same rights has been ruled, imposed shall be deprivation for the longest   period of time.    (3) Where the punishments are different in kind and one of them is fine or confiscation, the   court may add it entirely or in part to the most severe punishment.    Article 24       Where the punishments imposed are of the same kind, the court may increase the   determined total most severe punishment by at most one half, but the punishment thus increased   may not exceed neither the sum total of the separate punishments, nor the maximum extent   provided for the respective kind of punishment.    Article 25       (1) The provisions of Articles 23 and 24 shall also apply where the person has been   convicted with separate sentences.    (2) In such cases, if the punishment under any of the sentences has been served entirely or   in part, it shall be deducted, provided it is of the same kind as the cumulated punishment   determined to be served.    (3) (Amended, SG No. 103/2004, effective 1.01.2005) The service of a probation sentence   shall be fully deductible from imprisonment and vice versa, two days of probation counting as   one day of imprisonment.    (4) (New, SG No. 28/1982) Where under one or more of the sentences the person has been   exempted from serving the imposed punishment pursuant to Article 64, paragraph (1), or to   Article 66, the issue of serving the cumulative punishment shall be decided at the time of its   determination.    Article 26       (Amended and supplemented, SG No. 28/1982, supplemented, SG No. 10/1993, amended,   SG No. 50/1995, SG No. 62/1997, SG No. 92/2002)    (1) Provisions of Articles 23 - 25 shall not apply to cases of undisrupted crime - a series of   two or more acts, which, taken separately, would qualify under the same or under different sub   headings of a specific crime, are committed over short periods of time, in similar surrounding   circumstances, and are characterized with a homogenous form of guilt, the subsequent acts   appearing, both objectively and subjectively - as regards guilt - a continuation of the preceding   ones.    (2) In cases of undisrupted crime perpetrator shall be punished in accordance with   constitutive acts thereof, taken as a whole, as well as in accordance with the overall criminal   outcomes by them caused.    (3) Where separate acts qualify under different sub-headings of a specific crime,   undisrupted crime shall be punished as provided for with regard to the aggravated act committed,   consideration being had to the implications of the aggravated acts for the overall criminal activity,   and to the aggravating circumstances proper.    (4) Where aggravating circumstances do not have significant impact in increasing the   seriousness of overall criminal activity, it shall qualify under the privileged sub-heading of a     specific crime, particular circumstances being reckoned with in determining the amount of   punishment to serve.    (5) Where some of the acts have been completed, while others have ended at the stage of   attempt, and the acts completed do not have significant impact in increasing the overall   seriousness of criminal activity, perpetrator shall be punished as provided for attempted crime.    (6) Provisions of this article shall not apply to crimes committed against various citizens,   qualifying as Crimes against the Person, nor shall they apply to crimes committed following   submission of indictment to the courts, or to crimes committed prior to submission of indictment,   which have not, however, been therein included.    Article 27       (1) (Amended, SG No. 28/1982) Where a person commits a crime after he has been   sentenced to imprisonment by sentence that has entered into force, but before serving this   punishment, the court shall add to the unserved part, entirely or in part, the punishment of the   second sentence, provided it is imprisonment. The total punishment as determined may not be   less than the punishment under the second sentence.    (2) (Supplemented, SG No. 28/1982) The punishment under the second sentence shall be   added entirely if it is imprisonment for more than five years or if it is imposed for repeated crime   or crime constituting a case of dangerous recidivism.    (3) Where the person has committed a crime after serving the punishment imposed by the   preceding sentence, the punishment imposed for this crime shall be served entirely.    Article 28       (1) The punishment for repeated crime provided in the special part of this Code shall be   imposed, if the perpetrator has committed a crime after he has been convicted with sentence that   has entered into force for another similar crime.    (2) This provision shall also apply to cases of crimes of one and the same kind against   public and personal property.    Article 29       (1) The more severe punishments provided in the special part of this Code for crimes   which constitute dangerous recidivism, shall be imposed where the perpetrator:    a) (amended, SG No. 28/1982) commits the crime after he has been convicted for grave   intentional crime to imprisonment for not less than one year, and the serving of the punishment   has not been suspended pursuant to Article 66;    b) (amended, SG No. 28/1982) has committed the crime after he has been convicted two or   more times to imprisonment for intentional crimes of general nature, provided at least for one of   them the serving of the punishment has not been suspended under Article 66;    c) (repealed, SG No. 28/1982).    (2) In applying the provisions of the preceding paragraph the crimes committed by the   perpetrator as a minor shall not be taken into consideration.    (3) (New, SG No. 95/1975) Where for a certain crime there are provisions for concurrent   elements of crime as repeated perpetration and as dangerous recidivism and the act implements   the characteristics of both elements, the provision for dangerous recidivism shall apply.    Article 30         (1) The provisions of Article 28 and 29 shall not be applied, if more than five years have   elapsed since the serving of punishment under the preceding sentences.

It was thereby increased from BGN 0.5 to 100. In § 87 Additional Provisions   a substitution of all fines from the Special Part whose amount was below BGN 100 was   envisaged.    The drafting of § 87 is not fully precise, since it is not clear in what way the fines   contained in the Special Part, both of whose minimum and maximum are below BGN 100 or of   which only the minimum is below BGN 100 and the maximum above BGN 300, need to be   amended. In our view, a corrective interpretation of the provision of § 87 CCAA is required, i. e.:    • The fines in respect of which only a maximum amount below BGN 100 has been set up   shall be substituted for fines between BGN 100 to 300.    • The fines both of whose minimum and maximum are below BGN 100 shall be   substituted for fines between BGN 100 to 300.

The Working Group has developed its  Work Plan, a living document that will  serve as the basis for a 5-year strategic  plan that is due to Congress by the end  of calendar year 2021. In this Work  Plan, the Working Group identified  ongoing existing activities, as well as  new lines of effort, that comprise the  initial focus of Federal government  actions under the purview of the  Working Group. Many of the new  activities proposed in the Work Plan  emphasize the use of maritime  intelligence and the involvement of  military departments to support efforts  to combat IUU fishing. The Work Plan  can be found here:    maritime-safe-act-interagency-working-  group-iuu-fishing.   The Working Group is exploring  potential ways in which the government  and private sector stakeholders can  work together to combat IUU fishing  and enhance maritime security. We are  interested to hear from the seafood  industry, non-governmental  organizations, and other stakeholders  that are engaged in efforts to combat  IUU fishing. We welcome comments in  relation to the Work Plan, particularly  any responses to the following  questions:   • Which activities in the Work Plan  are connected to the expertise or  interests of your organization related to  combating IUU fishing?   • What kinds of distinctive  capabilities or capacities could your  organization bring to the activities in the  Work Plan?   • Which specific activities could  serve as the basis for a partnership  between your organization and  particular Federal agencies?   • Are there specific geographic  regions or seafood industry sectors (e.g.,  harvesting, processing, or trade) where  your organization focuses efforts to  build capacity in combating IUU fishing  that could be tied to activities in the  Work Plan?   • Which elements in the Work Plan  do you see as priorities to include in the  5-year Strategic Plan of the Working  Group?

ACTION: Notice of approval of the revised  management plan for the North Carolina  National Estuarine Research Reserve.   SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that  the Office for Coastal Management,  National Ocean Service, National  Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, U.S. Department of  Commerce approves the revised  management plan for the North Carolina  National Estuarine Research Reserve. In  accordance with applicable Federal  regulations, the North Carolina  Department of Environmental Quality’s  Division of Coastal Management revised  the reserve’s management plan, which  replaces the plan previously approved  in 2009.  ADDRESSES: The approved management  plan can be downloaded or viewed at    Reserves_NOC_MgmtPlan.pdf. The  document is also available by sending a  written request to the point of contact  identified below (see FOR FURTHER  INFORMATION).  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Stephanie Robinson of NOAA’s Office  for Coastal Management, by email at  steph.robinson@noaa.gov, phone at  843–740–1174, or mail at 2234 South  Hobson Ave., Charleston, SC 29405.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant  to 15 CFR 921.33(c), a state must revise  the management plan for a research  reserve at least every five years. Changes  to a reserve’s management plan may be  made only after receiving written  approval from NOAA. NOAA approves  changes to management plans via notice  in the Federal Register. On October 28,  2019, NOAA issued a notice in the  Federal Register announcing a 30-day  public comment period for the proposed  revision of the management plan for the  North Carolina National Estuarine  Research Reserve (Federal Register,  Volume 84, No. 208, pg. 57701). No  comments were received; however, a  summary of the public input process is  available in Appendix U of the plan.   The management plan outlines the  reserve’s strategic goals and objectives;  administrative structure; programs for   conducting research and monitoring,  education, and training; resource  protection, restoration, and  manipulation plans; public access and  visitor use plans; consideration for  future land acquisition; and facility  development to support reserve  operations. Since 2009, the reserve has  completed its habitat map and added  marsh vegetation and surface elevation  monitoring; conducted a habitat  vulnerability assessment to understand  marsh vulnerability; led a number of  research and training initiatives related  to living shorelines; increased education  programming at the Masonboro Island  component of the reserve; begun  implementing Teachers on the Estuary  (TOTE) training; expanded use of  volunteers to conduct citizen science  regarding sensitive species and site  conditions; and implemented training  focused on informing real estate  professionals about coastal issues. The  revised management plan will serve as  the guiding document for the 10,568-  acre research reserve for the next five  years.   NOAA reviewed the environmental  impacts of the revised management plan  and determined that this action is  categorically excluded from further  analysis under the National  Environmental Policy Act, consistent  with NOAA Administrative Order 216–  6.]   Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.; 15 CFR  921.33.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Background and Authority: On March  25, 2020, the President signed into law  the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020,  Public Law 116–129 (Act), which  required the development of a strategy  to ensure the security of next generation  wireless communications systems and  infrastructure.1   On the same day, and in fulfilment of  the requirement established by the Act,  the Administration published the  National Strategy to Secure 5G of the  United States of America (Strategy).2 In  so doing, the Administration recognizes  both the importance of fifth generation  wireless technologies (also known as  5G) to the future prosperity and security  of the United States, as well as the risks  and vulnerabilities posed by malicious  actors that will seek to exploit these  technologies. The Strategy is focused on  four areas: (1) Facilitating domestic 5G  rollout; (2) assessing the cybersecurity  risks to and identifying core security  principles of 5G capabilities and  infrastructure; (3) addressing risks to  United States economic and national  security during development and  deployment of 5G infrastructure  worldwide; and (4) promoting  responsible global development and  deployment of secure and reliable 5G  infrastructure. In accordance with both  the Act and the Strategy, the National  Security and National Economic  Councils are developing an  Implementation Plan, in consultation  with relevant Departments and  Agencies, to execute the actions  identified to secure 5G infrastructure  and development.   In accordance with the Act, NTIA  published a Request for Comment on   March 28th, 2020,3 and posted the  responses on June 29th, 2020.4 To assist  in the implementation of the strategy  NTIA will conduct industry engagement  and listening sessions with 5G industry  groups and manufacturers to formulate  policy approaches for market incentives  to do the following: Leverage trusted  domestic and international partner  suppliers; close 5G security gaps; and  ensure domestic industrial base  viability. To this end, NTIA will  convene two virtual roundtables. The  January 28 roundtable will focus on  market incentives for 5G security. The  February 25 roundtable will focus on  principles for fostering global 5G vendor  diversity and open, interoperable  architectures. The discussions held at  these roundtables will be analyzed and  turned into a report to help the  Administration further develop its  policy approach to the secure  development and deployment of 5G.   Time and Date: NTIA will convene  the roundtable listening session on  January 28 and February 25, from 10:00  a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard  Time. The exact time of the meeting is  subject to change. Please refer to NTIA’s  website, for the  most current information.

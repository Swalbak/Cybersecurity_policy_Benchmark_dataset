Introduction  Electronic communication networks and interconnected digital services have become ubiquitous as they  have permeated every fold of everyday life. At a time when automated profiling and electronic surveillance  have become commodities, citizens and businesses alike may face limitations and threats when they have  personal data processed or seek to protect their privacy on the internet or when using general  communication services. Limitations in the transparency, the functionality and interconnectivity of online  and communication services increase the risk of having personal data processed out of control of any  accountable person or organisation or simply becoming exposed to all sorts of privacy threats.  The recalibrated legal framework in the EU as manifested by the promulgation of the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR)1, is key in an effort to better control the processing of personal data.  Additionally the recent EC proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications2 is  expected to give new impetus to the way privacy is protected in electronic communications. Even the best  legislative efforts cannot keep up to speed with the pace of innovative technology and business models  that challenge the way personal data is processed and privacy is protected across the EU and beyond;  therefore examining what is at stake and where threats originate from becomes of paramount importance.  In the light of GDPR and the recent EC proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic  Communications, DG CONNECT, ENISA and the Law Faculty of the University of Vienna, Arbeitsgruppe  Rechtsinformatikis organized the fifth edition of Annual Privacy Forum (APF) in Vienna, Austria on June 7 &  8, 2017.  The event encouraged dialogue with panel discussions and provided room for exchange of ideas in  between scientific sessions. This two-day conference was well attended by more than 100 participants in  addition to more than 70 viewers through the web streaming service.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-privacy-and-electronic-communications  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-privacy-and-electronic-communications  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Programme  Invited speeches  Three keynote speakers were invited, namely Peter Fleischer, Google, Reinhard Posch, TU Graz & Austria  Chief Information Officer and Rosa Barcelo3, European Commission.  Their details are listed below.  Peter Fleischer has worked as Google’s Global Privacy Counsel since 2006.  Based in Europe, Peter is Google’s longest serving privacy leader. He counsels  Google teams on how to design privacy sensitive and legally compliant products.  Peter has designed many of Google’s privacy compliance programs. He has met  with thousands of privacy officials and leaders worldwide. Peter has managed  scores of regulatory actions around the world, and appeared before some of the  world’s highest courts.  Prior to joining Google, Peter worked for 10 years at Microsoft, as EMEA privacy  leader and Director of Regulatory Compliance.  Peter is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School.  Reinhard Posch is chairman of the board of trustees of the non-profit  foundation Stiftung Secure Information and Communication Technologies SIC  which has been donated by Graz University of Technology. Reinhard Posch was  also Chair of the Board of ENISA, the European Network and Security Agency.  Reinhard Posch takes part in groups installed by the European Commission to  elaborate ICT and security strategies (e.g.  „Future Internet Visionaries“,  RISEPTIS). Being a member of the \"Rat der IT Weisen\" he has provided advice to  Commissioners Kroes and Sefkovic in the area of IT-Security to assist the  implementation of the Digital Agenda.  3 The keynote of Ms. Barcelo was provided by a colleague of hers, due to last minute change in her agenda.  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error! No text of specified style in document.  |  December 2017  06  Rosa Barcelo works at the European Commission, in DG CONNECT (Unit H1 –  Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy Unit) where she is Deputy Head of Unit. The Unit  is responsible the review of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58). It is also competent  for legislative, policy and R&I actions to improve network and information  security, such as the NIS Directive.Prior to taking up this job, Rosa worked for the  European Data Protection Supervisor (2006-2011) and in DG JUSTICE Data  Protection Unit of the European Commission.  Rosa has worked as a private lawyer in the Brussels offices of Morrison and  Foerster and DLA Piper where she advised clients on European privacy and data  protection, electronic commerce and technology law. She also worked for some years in the academia  (Belgium and Spain).  She obtained her PhD in Law with a dissertation on electronic contracts and digital  signatures.  Panel Sessions  Throughout the programme, four panel sessions were organized, targeting mainly topics and areas closely  related to the Agency’s activities for 2017. An overview of the sessions is presented hereinafter.  2.2.1 Privacy regulation in a global context considering new challenges like Artificial Intelligence  User interfaces - hardware and software - are produced for a global market. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools  with big data analytics allow more personalised services, resulting in a competitive advantage for  respective companies. Therefore, privacy regulation must face these challenges and take into account that  the global market must focus on privacy-friendly solutions. Ethics can play a strong role in this direction.  2.2.2 Towards a European Data Protection Certification Scheme  In the Recitals of GDPR it is stated that “In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this  Regulation, the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be  encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and  services”. The objective of this panel was to identify and explore the challenges and opportunities of GDPR  personal data protection certification mechanisms.  2.2.3 Practical Implementation of GDPR in Mobile Applications  In the course of the GDPR implementation, one very important aspect is the practical application of the  specific data protection obligations (e.g. purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency, consent,  etc.) into technical and organisational controls that can be used to achieve and/or assess compliance. The  aforementioned concern is especially crucial in the area of mobile applications (apps). The objective of this  panel was to discuss the current software development practices and challenges specific to app developers  with regard to the processing of personal data and explore the level of practical implementation of GDPR.  2.2.4 Lawful Interception and PETs  With the increasing importance of information services in virtually every aspect of life, the need for strong  protection mechanisms for private information arises. This need is addressed by a wide spectrum of tools  providing confidentiality, integrity and anonymity, which play a key role in the prevention of cybercrime.  On the flip, side these tools can be adapted and used with criminal intend and then pose a critical  impediment to the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminals across all crime areas. This leaves  law enforcement with a conflict where cryptographic tools that are used to prevent crime are also used by  criminals to engage in crime. Experts from ENISA, EUROPOL and Academia discussed how to find practical  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Scientific Track  As in previous years, half of the conference agenda was dedicated to presentations of new ideas from  research. To identify these new ideas, a call for papers was published in early 2017. This call was  advertised by the programme committee (PC) members and published at relevant platforms, e.g. wiki-CfP4.  The Program Committee (PC) presented in section B.2 was composed of senior academics, alongside legal  and technical experts. The submission process was supported by EasyChair5. In total, we received 41  submissions in response to our call for papers. Each paper was peer-reviewed by at least four members of  the Program Committee. On the basis of significance, novelty, and scientific quality, 12 full research papers  were selected and were presented to the event. Revised versions of these papers were published as post- proceedings from Springer LNCS6.  4 http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/  5 http://easychair.org/  6 http://www.springer.com/cn/book/9783319672793  http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/ http://easychair.org/ http://www.springer.com/cn/book/9783319672793  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Organisational overview  APF17 has been significant as it has become the first ever edition that has been funding neutral to the  Agency. While a modest amount of appropriations in the order of 20 000 EUR has been put at the disposal  of the organisers as has been the case in the past, the efficient organisational practices of all parties  involved has rendered the event very attractive for sponsorships. The private sector, clearly motivated by  the prominence of GDPR repeated events in this period, has provided adequate financial support. In  addition, certain costs have been covered via third party funding which is available through public services  in Vienna, such as a dinner sponsored by the City of Vienna.  ENISA has bene reviewing its approach towards the APF to (a) include private sector representatives as  local co-organisers to complement academic ones and (b) encouraging local actors to support the  conference in a way that it becomes self-sufficient in funding. Clearly for extraordinary costs and a  precautionary measure it is recommended to retain the option to support the organisation budget with a  modest sum as it has been the case over the years.  The next two editions of the APF are planned to be organised as follows:  1. In 2018, Barcelona, with the support of the Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya and Telefonica  2. In 2019, Rome Universita La Sapienza and a private sector partner TBD  Suitable arrangements have bene made with for both cases.  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Conclusions  In conclusion, the 5th edition of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) has been deemed successful as it managed  not only to continue attracting well acknowledged experts in the areas of privacy and data protection but  also to engage a large number or stakeholders and researchers. Within the two days, the organizers  succeeded in promoting discussions and exchange of novel ideas, bridging the gap between research,  business models and policy.  Building on top of the experience accumulated all these five years, it is safe to say that the next edition of  the Annual privacy Forum, which is expected to take place in June 2017, will continue attracting multi- disciplinary experts, researchers and policy makers in the areas of privacy and data protection.

No text of specified style in document.  |  December 2017  06  Rosa Barcelo works at the European Commission, in DG CONNECT (Unit H1 –  Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy Unit) where she is Deputy Head of Unit. The Unit  is responsible the review of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58). It is also competent  for legislative, policy and R&I actions to improve network and information  security, such as the NIS Directive.Prior to taking up this job, Rosa worked for the  European Data Protection Supervisor (2006-2011) and in DG JUSTICE Data  Protection Unit of the European Commission.  Rosa has worked as a private lawyer in the Brussels offices of Morrison and  Foerster and DLA Piper where she advised clients on European privacy and data  protection, electronic commerce and technology law. She also worked for some years in the academia  (Belgium and Spain).  She obtained her PhD in Law with a dissertation on electronic contracts and digital  signatures.  Panel Sessions  Throughout the programme, four panel sessions were organized, targeting mainly topics and areas closely  related to the Agency’s activities for 2017. An overview of the sessions is presented hereinafter.  2.2.1 Privacy regulation in a global context considering new challenges like Artificial Intelligence  User interfaces - hardware and software - are produced for a global market. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools  with big data analytics allow more personalised services, resulting in a competitive advantage for  respective companies. Therefore, privacy regulation must face these challenges and take into account that  the global market must focus on privacy-friendly solutions. Ethics can play a strong role in this direction.  2.2.2 Towards a European Data Protection Certification Scheme  In the Recitals of GDPR it is stated that “In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this  Regulation, the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be  encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and  services”. The objective of this panel was to identify and explore the challenges and opportunities of GDPR  personal data protection certification mechanisms.  2.2.3 Practical Implementation of GDPR in Mobile Applications  In the course of the GDPR implementation, one very important aspect is the practical application of the  specific data protection obligations (e.g. purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency, consent,  etc.) into technical and organisational controls that can be used to achieve and/or assess compliance. The  aforementioned concern is especially crucial in the area of mobile applications (apps). The objective of this  panel was to discuss the current software development practices and challenges specific to app developers  with regard to the processing of personal data and explore the level of practical implementation of GDPR.  2.2.4 Lawful Interception and PETs  With the increasing importance of information services in virtually every aspect of life, the need for strong  protection mechanisms for private information arises. This need is addressed by a wide spectrum of tools  providing confidentiality, integrity and anonymity, which play a key role in the prevention of cybercrime.  On the flip, side these tools can be adapted and used with criminal intend and then pose a critical  impediment to the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminals across all crime areas. This leaves  law enforcement with a conflict where cryptographic tools that are used to prevent crime are also used by  criminals to engage in crime. Experts from ENISA, EUROPOL and Academia discussed how to find practical  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Scientific Track  As in previous years, half of the conference agenda was dedicated to presentations of new ideas from  research. To identify these new ideas, a call for papers was published in early 2017. This call was  advertised by the programme committee (PC) members and published at relevant platforms, e.g. wiki-CfP4.  The Program Committee (PC) presented in section B.2 was composed of senior academics, alongside legal  and technical experts. The submission process was supported by EasyChair5. In total, we received 41  submissions in response to our call for papers. Each paper was peer-reviewed by at least four members of  the Program Committee. On the basis of significance, novelty, and scientific quality, 12 full research papers  were selected and were presented to the event. Revised versions of these papers were published as post- proceedings from Springer LNCS6.  4 http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/  5 http://easychair.org/  6 http://www.springer.com/cn/book/9783319672793  http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/ http://easychair.org/ http://www.springer.com/cn/book/9783319672793  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Organisational overview  APF17 has been significant as it has become the first ever edition that has been funding neutral to the  Agency. While a modest amount of appropriations in the order of 20 000 EUR has been put at the disposal  of the organisers as has been the case in the past, the efficient organisational practices of all parties  involved has rendered the event very attractive for sponsorships. The private sector, clearly motivated by  the prominence of GDPR repeated events in this period, has provided adequate financial support. In  addition, certain costs have been covered via third party funding which is available through public services  in Vienna, such as a dinner sponsored by the City of Vienna.  ENISA has bene reviewing its approach towards the APF to (a) include private sector representatives as  local co-organisers to complement academic ones and (b) encouraging local actors to support the  conference in a way that it becomes self-sufficient in funding. Clearly for extraordinary costs and a  precautionary measure it is recommended to retain the option to support the organisation budget with a  modest sum as it has been the case over the years.  The next two editions of the APF are planned to be organised as follows:  1. In 2018, Barcelona, with the support of the Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya and Telefonica  2. In 2019, Rome Universita La Sapienza and a private sector partner TBD  Suitable arrangements have bene made with for both cases.  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

Conclusions  In conclusion, the 5th edition of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) has been deemed successful as it managed  not only to continue attracting well acknowledged experts in the areas of privacy and data protection but  also to engage a large number or stakeholders and researchers. Within the two days, the organizers  succeeded in promoting discussions and exchange of novel ideas, bridging the gap between research,  business models and policy.  Building on top of the experience accumulated all these five years, it is safe to say that the next edition of  the Annual privacy Forum, which is expected to take place in June 2017, will continue attracting multi- disciplinary experts, researchers and policy makers in the areas of privacy and data protection.

No text of specified style in document.  |  December 2017  13  Annex B: Call for Papers  Call for papers text  In APF 2017 we invite papers presenting original work on the themes of data protection and privacy and  their repercussions on technology business, government, law, society, policy and on law enforcement. An  inter-disciplinary approach is high in demand to contribute to bridging the gap between research, business  models and policy much like proposing new models and interpretations are.  Research - Opinion Papers  APF2017 seeks contributions from policy makers and implementers, Data Protection Authorities, industry,  consultants, NGOs and civil society as well as law enforcement representatives. Opinion and interpretation  papers are expected to reflect the views of the author(s). Submissions can be up to 8000 words long,  excluding bibliography and appendices. Both research and opinion papers should deal with at least one of  the following aspects:   Implementation aspects of \"by design\" and \"by default\" paradigms   Implementation and adoption of PETs in contemporary digital services   Modelling of data protection and privacy requirements, such as:   Machine readable representations and automatic evaluation of policies   Enabling transparency: technological and organizational challenges   Technical solutions for the enforcement and the implications of the subject’s right, e.g. right to  erasure, access and correction.   Aspects of privacy impact and risk assessment   Technical solutions for data portability   Sustainable business models for privacy friendly online services   Information and consent in online environments: practical solutions and implementations   Privacy education, reliability and usability of PETs   Trust services for the protection of personal data - privacy aware trust services (i.e. electronic  certificates, signatures, etc.)   Security measures for the protection of personal data   Economics of privacy and personal data   Legal, technical and organisational aspects of privacy and law enforcement   Ethical conditions to the applicable framework   Procedural issues   Issues of transatlantic interest  Student Papers  In order to encourage participation of young researchers, the submission of papers by students is  encouraged. These papers will be treated as thoroughly as full papers, but can be shorter (up to 4000  words) and reflect novel thinking that might not have been fully elaborated just yet.  Short Papers  Annual Privacy Forum 2017  |  |  Error!

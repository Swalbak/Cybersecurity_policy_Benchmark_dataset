Key findings and conclusions 42  Annex A: Network and services covered by national implementations of Art. 13a 45  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  05  Executive Summary  In today’s interconnected world, telecommunications are transforming the way people engage in their  everyday lives. Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Electronic communications services guarantee the smooth transmission of  data in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for businesses and critical services  to run. Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency  response and in the economic development of a country. As a result, a security incident affecting one of  these areas can result in severe consequences.  Art. 13a gave a new momentum in the telecom industry at European level. Being part of the Framework  Directive 2009/1401 EC within the Telecom Package, the set of obligations in the article aims at ensuring the  security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services, dealing mostly with prevention of  outages or service disruption (availability of the service).  Although availability seems to be the main concern  of Art. 13a, some countries (as you will notice later) have decided to cover also other types on security  incidents within their national legislation (e.g. privacy). By amending the 2002 legislation, the Art. 13a within  the 2009 Telecom Package, addresses specific security and resilience obligations for the telecom sector, for  the first time in EU, as the 2002 directive had only vague provisions on this area.  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the Framework Directive including  Art. 13a, an impact evaluation of the new article was the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose  of assessing the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects  caused by this particular set of obligations within the Telecom Package. The evaluation focused on 5 key  areas, where we tried to identify possible outcomes:   The new security measures implemented in the member states ;   The transparency resulting from the incident reporting process;   The learning process resulting from incidents ;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders ;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  The compendious evaluation we have done within this project has brought to light some important  outcomes that have definitely contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the  telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a European Union which was highly diversified in terms of  security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of uniformity in the approach taken regarding security  of telecommunication services, but more importantly contributed to strengthening the European telecom  infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the  coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped considerably in bringing more  harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among stakeholders (NRAs and  providers).  Overall, Art. 13a has undeniably contributed to improving the level of security in the telecommunication  sector but in a balanced way as some countries were already in line or even ahead of the requirements and  1 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending Directives  2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC  on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  06  were already experiencing the expected benefits, whereas other less advanced countries or providers  experienced strong benefits in spite of the costs and effort provided.  It was also noted throughout this project that further analysis is needed in order to draw some strong  conclusions on next steps that are needed in this area. This report only covers a set of findings that must be  further analyzed, by responsible parties, in order to propose concrete recommendations and next steps to  be considered by different types of stakeholders.  The main findings of the study are the following, grouped into categories:  The scope of Art. 13a  1. Current lack of precise information within Art. 13a and Telecom Directive, as regards the types of  networks and services that should be covered, has led to some differences among national  implementations within member states. Although, the level of harmonization seem to be  satisfactory, the differences within services covered by member states could represent obstacles in  achieving the overall or specific objectives stated within the Telecom Package. Further assessments  in this area are needed (more details in section 2.1.2. and Annex I) in order to establish possible next  steps.  2. More than half of the respondents (54%) considered that Art. 13a cannot sufficiently and clearly  cover by itself security of electronic communications, but together with Art. 4 in the e-Privacy  Directive.  Appropriate security measures for providers:  1. The majority (45%) of the respondents (NRAs) considered that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures within the sector, but further analyses are needed as more than half of them (55%) do not  share this opinion, 23% stating “no” and 32% “do not know”.  2. Almost 60% of the respondent NRAs are not aware of the areas where the providers have improved  the most, in terms of security measures.  Transparency in incident reporting  1. The approach of providers towards NRAs as regards the implementation of Art. 13a mandatory  incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative. Withal the majority of the respondent NRAs  are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in their incident reports  and declared that they are receiving reports as expected.  2. Bringing more clarity to the incident reporting process, by issuing guidelines and additional  legislation – 73%, was by far the most effective method of improving transparency.  Learning and improving based on reported incidents  1. NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement, but mostly for  internal purposes such as compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations. The use of annual  incident statistics as an input for evaluating risk at national or sectorial level is not a common  approach among NRAs (more details in section 5.1. and 5.3).  Collaboration between the actors  1. The establishment and development of Art. 13a expert group, under ENISA coordination, turned out  to be a successful and helpful experience (more details in section 6.3.), as appreciated by 80% of the  respondents. The operation and development of the group should definitely be continued, under  ENISA’s coordination.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  07  2. Bi-directional communication with the population in the incident reporting process is poorly  addressed by both NRAs and providers. Further analyses should be carried in order to determine the  necessity of developing such processes (more details in section 4.3.).  3. The amount of resource employed by NRAs in the cross-border collaboration area appears to be low  (more details in section 6.3.).  Harmonization of practices within the EU  1. Over 80% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the current level of  harmonization within the EU, which sustains also national specificities, and do not think that an  improvement is needed in present.  2. ENISA’s work, together with Art. 13a expert group, in the area of guidelines and good practices, was  considered useful by up to 70% of the respondent NRAs, as it supported the achievement of a  mature level of harmonization.  Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  1. More and more reported incidents (at ENISA level) are caused by third party failures (more details  in section 8.2.), meaning they are caused by parties out of provider’s direct control, but within the  provider’s supply chain.  2. The main root cause for incidents at EU level in 2014 and years before, is “system failures”. Further  assessment needs to be done in this area, in order to identify more detailed causes and security  measures that can be adopted.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  08  1. Introduction  1.1. Background  In today’s interconnected world, telecommunications are transforming the way people engage in their  everyday lives. Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Electronic communications services guarantee the smooth transmission of  data in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for business services to run.  Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency response and  in the economic development of a country. As a result, an outage in any one of these areas can result in  severe consequences.  The Telecom Package represents the EU's regulatory framework for electronic communications, and is,  according EU Commission’s website, “[…] a series of rules which apply throughout the EU member states. It  encourages competition, improves the functioning of the market and guarantees basic user rights.  The overall goal is for European consumers to be able to benefit from increased choice thanks to low prices,  high quality and innovative services”2. The Telecom Package was adopted in November 2009, as a review of  the European Union Telecommunications Framework 2007 – 2009.  Art. 13a, of the Directive 2009/140 EC, is part of the Telecom Package and aims at ensuring the security and  integrity of electronic communication networks and services, dealing mostly with prevention of outages or  service disruption (availability of the service). This is partially achieved through requiring telecommunication  service providers to take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed  to security of networks and services, guarantee the integrity of their networks (ensure the continuity of  supply of services provided over those networks) and notify the competent national regulatory authority  (NRA) of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services.  Published in 2009, Art. 13a required that the deadline for the transposition should be up to 2011. However,  the transposition timeframe and process significantly varied from one country to the other. As a matter of  fact, countries maturity level, national legislation complexity and process impacted some countries in their  ability to comply with the deadlines, resulting in certain gaps between countries overtime. Today, the  majority of countries implemented the provisions of the Art. 13a, in one way or another, besides one  country. Art. 13a also designates ENISA, along with the European Commission (EC), as responsible bodies for  collecting notifications received and actions taken within member states, under the provisions of national  implementations of Art. 13a. Besides this specific mandate, according to the directive, ENISA should also  contribute to the “harmonization of appropriate technical and organizational security measures by providing  expert advice” and by “promoting the exchange of best practices”.  As a response to the directive’s requirements, in 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs from member states,  initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) in order to achieve a harmonized  implementation of Art. 13a of the Framework directive. As a result of these meetings, a group of experts  from NRAs, now entitled the Art. 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on three non-binding technical  documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU member states:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting3  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/telecoms-rules (November 2015)  3 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/35 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  09   Technical Guideline on Security Measures4   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets5.  The Art. 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year, to develop and improve technical  guidelines, to discuss upon the implementation of Art. 13a and to share knowledge and exchange views  about past incidents, and how to address them.  1.2. Scope  Considering the above, as several years have passed since the implementation of Art. 13a, an impact  evaluation of the new regulation is the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose of assessing the  changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects caused by this  particular regulation within the Telecom Package. The ultimate goal of this study is to assess the “as-is”  situation and the outcomes produced through implementations of Art. 13a. The results of this study are  intended for understanding the impact of the regulation on the European telecommunications industry, and  for further improving the security and resilience of the networks and services within the sector.  1.3. Target audience  This report is addressed to:   policy makers at EU level, including the European Commission and ENISA, in order to help them  understand the impact of the regulation on the telecommunications market and EU digital single  market and further improve the security and resilience of the sector;   policy makers within member states, in order to help them better understand the impact of the  regulation on their internal market;   telecommunications providers, in order to help them better understand the impact of the regulation  on their business;   any other stakeholder interested in this policy field;  1.4. Impact evaluation methodology  This report is based on a qualitative survey type approach, consisting of a desktop research, an online surveys  and telephone interviews. The approach aimed to collect all the available information regarding the national  implementations of Art. 13a and identify the outcomes produced at national and European level. This helped  in building a baseline on which the interviews and survey relied upon. With the background set from the  desktop research, the interview guides and the survey focused on understanding the point of view of both  NRAs and providers in their respective countries. Focus was given in understanding the differentiating  factors in each country as well as the successes and failures. The interviews were structure around 5 key  areas in order to provide the fullest picture:   The new security measures implemented in the member states ;   The transparency resulting from the incident report process;   The learning process resulting from the incidents ;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders ;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  Respondents: 22 respondents (exclusively NRAs) for the online survey, 14 participants for telephonic  interviews (both NRAs and providers).  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  10  2. Status of Art. 13a implementation  2.1. Introduction to Art. 13a  2.1.1. Requirements  Art. 13a states that the EU member states shall ensure that telecom service providers “take appropriate  technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and  services” and “take all appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the  continuity of supply of services provided over those networks”.  A closer look on the article, will reveal 3 terms: “security incidents”, “security breaches” and “integrity  losses”:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize  the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security  or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services”  The use of the term integrity in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer to the definition  in technical literature on networks and network interconnections6, which defines integrity “as the ability of  the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”. Integrity of networks  would be called availability or continuity in most information security literature7. In this document we call  these types of incidents simply “security incidents” or “incidents” and we use the following definition in this  document: a breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation of  electronic telecommunications networks and services.  In this respect, although we may assume that Art. 13a relates mostly with the availability of the service, as  its main purpose is to “ensure the continuity of supply of services”, the text of the article allows certain  interpretations as regards to the scope. According to the graph below (Fig. 1), the requirements related to  continuity/availability of the services has been implemented by 100% of the surveyed NRAs. Nevertheless,  some countries have made a step further and covered in their national implementation other security  concepts than availability, such as confidentiality (Fig. 1).  Furthermore, telecom service providers have the obligation to notify the competent NRA regarding any  breach of security or loss of network integrity that has a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services. In this case also, 100% of the NRAs implemented an incident reporting process for any disruption/  outages in the electronic communications networks and services, while a minority (20%) also included  breaches impacting information confidentiality or denial of services attacks not necessarily impacting the  availability of the electronic communications (as shown in Fig. 2). This requirement is also followed by all EU  member states along with some EFTA members also.  6 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  7 In information security literature the term ‘integrity’ usually refers to the property that data or communications  cannot be altered or tampered with.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  11  Figure 1: Scope of Art. 13a national implementation (security measures)  Figure 2: Scope of Art. 13a national implementation (mandatory incident reporting)  After receiving reports/notifications at a national level, NRAs shall report to ENISA any incident that had a  significant impact on the operation of networks or services. As the term “significant incident” has not been  defined by the directive, neither has been defined within the national implementations of Art. 13a in most  of the countries, ENISA, in collaboration with the Art. 13a Expert Group has defined “significance” by  adopting certain thresholds through a set of informal guidelines, adopted/referred to by all member states,  as shown in Chapter 1 - Introduction.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Continuity/ availability of electronic communications  networks and services  Measures to protect the confidentiality of information/  data carried over electronic communications networks  and services  Protecting customers against denial of service attacks  Protecting customers against malware attacks  Among these examples, what does your national implementation of Article  13a mainly address in terms of scope regarding the security measures?  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Disruption/ outages in electronic communications  networks and services  Breaches impacting the confidentiality of  information/ data carried over electronic  communications networks and services  Denial of service attacks not impacting the availability of the  electronic communications service but impacting  customers  Malware attacks not impacting the availability  of the electronic communications service but impacting customers  Among these examples, what does your national implementation of Article  13a mainly address in terms of scope regarding the incident reporting?  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  12  2.1.2. Networks and services in scope of Art. 13a  Art. 13a aims at safeguarding network availability through minimizing the impact of security incidents and  ensuring the continuity of service supplying provided over those networks. The article applies for several  types of networks and services, depending on the national implementation of the directive by each member  state. Services such as mobile and fixed telephony but also to mobile and fixed internet are covered by all  member states. In addition to these networks and services, NRAs included in Art. 13a several other services  such as SMS (almost 70%), TV and radio broadcasting (45% and 31% respectively), according to their national  implementations of the framework directive. For a full set of networks and services covered by national  implementations of Art. 13a please see Annex I.  Figure 3: Services in scope of national implementation of Art. 13a  As telecommunication networks and services can also be affected by other types of incidents that may or  may not have an impact on the availability of the service, we have also tried to understand if stakeholders  (meaning only NRAs) are satisfied with the current types of incidents covered by Art. 13a as regards to the  overall security of electronic communications within a member state. 54% of the surveyed NRAs consider  that appropriate level of security within the telecom sector is achievable together with Article 4 of e- Privacy Directive, so that more types of incidents could be covered.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  SMS TV Broadcasting  Radio broadcasting  Other IXPs - Internal  Exchange Points  Satellite telephony  Commercial with  hotspots  Webmail and  messaging services  ccTLDS - Country  Code Top Level  Domains  Webbased voice not using the E.164 tel  number plan  What publicly available networks and services are in scope on your national  implementation of Article 13a, in addition to fixed/ mobile telephony and fixed/  mobile internet  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  13  Figure 4: Coverage of telecom security by Art. 13a  2.2. Situation of the countries before the implementation of Art. 13a  Before the implementation of Art. 13a, the telecom security landscape was fragmented and very specific to  each country, with no pan European regulation. In other words, the legal maturity, practices and governance  of the network resilience of each country were very heterogeneous which impacted the transposition and  implementation process according to the level of maturity.  Although the 2002 Telecom Package tended to obliterate the legal differences among the countries at EU  level by providing harmonized guidelines, countries kept their national prerogative and transposed the  requirements into national law according to their countries specificities, market and maturity. However, the  differences observed during the implementation process of the 2002 Telecom Package resurfaced in the  approach taken by each country when implementing Art. 13a requirements from 2009. As you may see from  Fig. 3 (or the Annex 1) although all countries have implemented mandatory incident reporting for service  disruptions on telecom providers, they do cover differently the types of networks and services in scope of  Art. 13a, meaning that incidents affecting different types of services are reported by each state.  2.2.1. Approach of the NRAs and providers  Art. 13a has been received in many different ways by the consulted stakeholders, ranging from reluctance  to enthusiasm but most commonly by skepticism. NRAs and providers were challenged to have a clear  understanding of the scope and how to assess the criteria defining the impact of an incident or the  appropriate level of security measures as per Art. 13a requirements, although the provisions of the European  regulations were quite unclear.  NRAs  When Art. 13a was initially published, many NRAs were uncertain about the level of details and precision of  the Directive, because several aspects of it were left – on purpose – open for the NRAs’ interpretation. For  example, Art. 13a states that member states shall ensure that providers take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, but does not specify what is meant by “appropriate steps” or how  “integrity” is defined. In this situation, NRAs referred in their replies to the Technical Guideline on Incident  23%  54%  23%  Do you  think that Article 13a is sufficiently clear and covers  security of electronic communications?

Following the consultation of these guidelines, some NRAs issued second level regulations  and/or some specific guidelines to support their national providers in their national implementation process.  In addition, NRAs were invited on a regular basis to participate in the Art. 13a Expert Group, an information  exchange group especially created in this context by ENISA. This group had a critical role in federating NRAs  during and after the implementation process. During these meetings, NRAs shared their point of view,  experiences and thoughts about Art. 13a requirements.  Providers  As far as providers are concerned, the reaction of those consulted varied significantly and it can be directly  correlated with their level of maturity in terms of country legislation and practices as well as to the level and  maturity of collaboration with the NRA. Therefore, in the cases where providers were very mature, they  were for most indifferent to Art. 13a, as such requirements were already included in their day-to-day  practices and obligations.  As far as was shown from the qualitative approach of interviewing providers, those with a good level of  maturity were either eager to improve their process and security measures, or reluctant due to the  additional cost and due to stricter rules. Small providers or immature ones were either welcoming Art. 13a,  identified as a strong opportunity to improve or reluctant to these new requirements, due to the additional  effort to be provided while they face limited resources.  As a conclusion regarding the providers, whatever their maturity and development was, had whether a  reluctant or embracing attitude towards adopting the new requirements, depending more on other causes  (like business processes) than their maturity. Unfortunately, the survey could not capture more insights on  this area, future work needing to be done.  8 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  15  3. Appropriate security measures for providers  3.1. Specific objective context  Art. 13a requires NRAs to ensure that providers take the appropriate security measures to protect and  guarantee the integrity and service continuity of their networks. In that regard, ENISA collected feedbacks  regarding the level of satisfaction with the security measures implemented and assessed the resulting  outcomes for providers and NRAs.  3.2. Level of satisfaction with the security measures implementation  It is noted that 45% of the interviewed NRAs are satisfied with the level of security achieved by  implementing new security measures in their respective countries. Telecom service providers share the  same opinion, although some of them adopted an approach that goes beyond the current legal  requirements, with continuous improvement process and more demanding security measures.  Figure 5: NRA satisfaction regarding stronger security measures in the sector  For 45% of the respondents, Art. 13a requirements led to stronger security measures in the sector and the  country. But, the majority of interviewed NRAs think that it is not possible to attribute this improvement  only to the new security regulations. This is reflected by the heterogeneity of the answers, which can be  attributed mostly to the fact that:   The level of implementation differs from one country to another. Art. 13a requirements had an  important impact on harmonizing the level of security measures among countries, as the general  approach was highly different in some cases before the enforcement of the regulation. Although  harmonizing has been achieved at the higher level, the situation still remains fragmented at lower  levels of detail from one country to another.   NRAs do not have sufficient information from the providers to assess the impact of Art. 13a on the  security measures already in place.   Providers’ maturity and the level of security measures vary from one country to another. Thus Art.  13a requirements will impact the level of security measures in a heterogeneous manner, with more  improvement and stronger impact in countries where the providers are less mature and where the  legal framework is weak.  45%  23%  32%  In your opinion, have Article 13a requirements led to stronger security  measures in the sector in your country?  Yes  No  Don't Know  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  16   The variety in size between providers lead to a difference in impact. For instance, Art. 13a  requirements had a much stronger impact on small providers than on large providers. Small  providers experienced an increase in security severity and overhead, while large providers did not  face any particular issue or strong benefits.  Based on opinions expressed, providers, on the other hand, expressed two different. Either (a) they were  already experiencing such level of security measures and did not see any particular changes, resulting in  indifference or neutral opinion, or (b) they were quite satisfied with the level of security measures included  in Art. 13a. The responses of the providers only underlined linear development in the industry, as more  mature operators already had similar measures implemented, whereas the more immature ones had to  invest some resources in adopting the new measures.  3.3. Challenges encountered during the implementation  On average, most of the NRAs faced relatively small challenges with regards to the implementation of the  security measures. The most common were:   37% of the NRA respondents indicated challenges within the process of auditing and following-up  on the security measures, meaning that after implementation of the regulations and the  subsequent security measures, authorities found it difficult to check whether those  measures/requirements were properly implemented.   27% of the NRAs indicated as a medium to big challenge the reluctance of some of the providers in  implementing the new regulations;   over 25% of the respondents mentioned as a medium to big challenge the available budget and the  administrative burdens;   21% indicated as a medium to big challenge the limited value for money as an outcome for the  overall process, meaning that the expected benefits were not as consistent as expected.  It has been mentioned in the interviews that in most cases smaller providers were lacking the appropriate  internal processes and methodology to implement these requirements. On top of that, most of them faced  some operational challenges as they did not have sufficient resources and knowledge about the security  measures to implement them without struggling at some point.  As revealed from the interview, another challenge in the implementation process of the security measures  has to do with the lack of precision in the definition of “critical assets” and other key concepts such as  “appropriate level of security”. Indeed, Art. 13a does not specify or define what is to be considered as a  critical asset leaving the interpretation to NRAs. In order to overcome this challenge, providers and NRAs  consulted the ENISA’s technical guidelines (see Introduction). Based on those some NRAs issued a second  level of legislation as well as other guidelines.  As indicated within the interviews, the activities developed by ENISA within the area of Art. 13a, including  hosting and coordination of the Art. 13a expert group, was perceived as an essential support in easing the  implementation process and supporting NRAs and providers during their transition phase.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  17  Figure 6: Main NRA challenges during the implementation process  3.4. Outcome/benefit analysis of stronger security measures  The implementation of the Art. 13a requirements affected both NRAs and providers, in terms of resources  needed. Even though policy making and implementation is the day-to-day business of most NRAs, they faced  additional costs such as: educational costs (for training the providers on the new regulations), costs for  developing secondary legislation or other guidelines, follow-up and audit on the progress of the  implementation.  Providers faced implementation, maintenance and management costs. In their case, the size of the costs is  largely depending on:   the average level of security measures already implemented in the providers in the country   the flexibility / ability of the providers to comply with the requirements within a short time frame   the complexity of the process for security measures implementation   the level of involvement of the NRA   the availability and allocation of resources (FTEs9) necessary for the implementation process.  Some providers have been advertising security measures and resilience, as a competitive advantage.  Especially in the countries where the level of the security measures was weak, providers emphasized the  quality of their infrastructures, network and connections.  It is difficult to link the improvement of security measures with the evolution of the number of incidents  experienced.

No challenge Small challenge Medium challenge Big challenge  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  18  not necessarily mean that the security measures have worsened. Providers deal with some external risks  that cannot be controlled nor prevented by an increase of the security measures. Such risks mainly include  environmental risks and malicious actions. As such it becomes difficult to measure direct benefits attributed  to Art. 13a.  Nevertheless, according to the consulted parties, Article13a has definitely helped in reducing the risks  related to infrastructure resilience through reporting and learning. That is especially true for the smaller or  less advanced operators, where technical assistance and know-how were needed. For larger operators,  especially in more developed countries, the security measures where already implemented as part of their  corporate strategy.  Figure 7: Areas in which providers improved the most  *based on Art. 13a Technical Guideline on Security Measures  The numbers from the Figure 7 discount the fact that in many areas, NRAs do not have sufficient information  to assess whether Art. 13a brought improvements. For instance, 28% of the surveyed NRAs do not have  information on the improvement level regarding human resources security and 18% don’t know if Art. 13a  positively impacted business continuity management.  Moreover, NRAs estimate that in general, stronger security measures have indeed improved the overall  security in their countries. As shown in Fig. 7, NRAs consider that most of the improvements were done in  the following areas:   incident management (27% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   operations management (18% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   security of systems and facilities (18% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   business continuity management (14% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   governance and risk management (14% fair amount or a lot of improvement)  It is reported that for front-runner providers, when Art. 13a came out, it did not bring strong benefits  compared to the practices already in place.

Security measures positively impacted the quality of the infrastructures and thus of the services  provided, which is the core business of telecom providers.  Regarding the improvements on the assets operated by providers, Fig. 8 expresses the opinion of NRAs on  this matter.  Figure 8: Asset classes most improved by providers  3.5. Areas of further improvement  Suppliers of telecom components have a key role in the resilience of the infrastructures, but are not  included in Art. 13a requirements. In case of a security incident, only the telecom service provider is  responsible while the telecom components suppliers are not part of the legal action/ incident action. Further  assessments in this area are needed, with the involvement of responsible stakeholders, in order to develop  an optimal approach to addressing this issue.  As more than half of the respondents (55%) haven’t indicated that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures in the sector, and 60% of the respondents are not aware of areas where providers have improved  the most, further analyses must be carried out in this area in order to determine next steps to be taken.

Transparency in incident reporting  4.1. Specific objective context  Transparency is achieved through the reporting obligation that falls on providers experiencing incidents and  is driven by the quality of information provided. Transparency is fundamental for the NRAs as they need  correct and relevant information in order to take adequate and proper supervision measures. NRAs also  have a reporting obligation towards ENISA and the European Commission, as information collected at  national level is sent at European level for aggregated analysis. Therefore the more the information is  detailed and transparent, the more the reporting flow is straight forward and the less NRAs request  complementary information, which is time and resource consuming. All in all, transparency is an asset for  providers, NRAs and ENISA as it enables the stakeholders to understand the issues faced in order to take  appropriate actions (by the providers themselves, but also by the NRAs who can assist the providers or  amend the national regulations in place).  In order to promote transparency, NRAs usually issue templates for incident reporting with a list of the  mandatory information and the level of details required. Besides, providers have a specific point of contact  at the responsible NRA to enhance communication and anticipate any need for further information.  4.2. Level of satisfaction regarding the transparency in the incident reporting  On average, NRAs are satisfied with the level of transparency reflected in the incident reports filled by the  providers, meaning that the information quality of the incident reports is satisfying. This part assesses in  more detail the level of satisfaction regarding the level of transparency, based on 3 perspectives:   the provider’s compliance with the expected level of information transparency,   the information quality,   the number of incident reports collected.  4.2.1. Providers’ level of collaboration  Providers’ attitude towards Art. 13a mandatory incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative,  as 68% of the respondent NRAs attest that providers were overall collaborative with the incident reporting  compliance requirements (Fig. 9). Nevertheless NRAs also faced two other distinct behaviors. On the one  hand, most of the providers were neutral or even indifferent (up to 40% of the responses) regarding the new  incident reporting requirements and provided the reports as required as per the defined thresholds. This is  due to the fact that some providers were already using such process at internal level and that Art. 13a did  not bring major changes, constraints or benefits on this point. On the other hand, a minority of providers  (21% of the responses) were reluctant towards the changes imposed by the new incident reporting process.  These providers are mainly from countries were the practices are not as mature as in the most advanced  countries and are, in most cases, small providers. This attitude can be explained by the investments that  providers were asked to do in order to complete the requirements. Such investments can prove to be a real  challenge for smaller providers with limited resources (financial or otherwise).  As an incentive to promoting a more collaborative and transparent approach for providers, 86% of NRA  respondents stated they have issued several guidelines or country level legislation to fill in the lack of  precision in the directive and mitigate the level of reluctance due to the lack of information. As shown by  Fig. 10 below other measures adopted by NRAs to promote transparency are: provide online tools for  incident reporting (59%), issue second level regulation on top of the standard requirements (inform  customers (59%), inform general public on major disruptions (41%)), inform other member states, ENISA or  the public for major disruptions.

Regarding the information quality  77% of the respondent NRAs are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in  their incident reports. Information collected by NRAs mainly follows the ENISA guidelines on incident  reporting. Most relevant pieces of information reported are: numbers of users/connections affected,  duration of the incidents, services affected, assets affected, measures taken etc.  Figure 12: Opinion regarding the information quality  In cases where the information provided is insufficient, usually NRAs contacted the providers to obtain the  complementary information.

Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  23  lingo of the provider’s organization. Due to this feedback process, the level of the quality of the information  self-maintains itself.  In the special case of emergency services incident or outage, providers are requested to provide more details  and information in their incident reports, increasing transparency requirements for the providers.  4.2.3. Regarding the number of incident reports collected  The number of reports collected by the NRAs is linked to several factors. First and most important is the  level of thresholds that determines whether an incident report is triggered or not. As the directive does not  specify details regarding thresholds or how “significance” should be detailed, the Art. 13a expert group, has  issued a non-binding document to help member states define significant incidents. The ENISA’s Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting establishes absolute and relative thresholds, so that countries in different  sizes in terms of population or providers in different sizes in terms of customers can be covered.  Figure 13: Appropriate numbers of incidents collected  68% of the surveyed NRAs reported that they are receiving reports as per the expected levels, however  one third of the surveyed NRAs do not receive as many reports as expected. One of the reasons could be  that the thresholds are not fine-tuned to the number of incidents, market or provider size; therefore the  reports do not capture as many incidents as expected in the first place. The second reason has to do with  the size of the provider. Outages from small providers do not impact as many users as the larger ones, and  as such thresholds do not trigger incident reporting in their cases. As no additional information was obtained  in this area, this remains still to be further analyzed.  Another challenge addressed by the majority of the interviewed NRAs, is that 90% of the telecom services  providers are SMEs, which represent only 10% of the incident reports received by the NRAs. Given that  smaller providers (SMEs) – usually – do not have enough customers to breach the reporting thresholds, the  vast majority of incident reports come from the large operators (the 10%). Consequently, the number of  incidents reported could represent a distorted view of the status of each country.  27%  68%  5%  Do you get the appropriate number of incident reports by the  providers?

Level of communication  Although according to the surveyed NRAs, all stakeholders are sufficiently informed about the incidents (at  least 50% of all stakeholders are sufficiently informed), some nuances are to be mentioned. After a deeper  look, it appears that if sufficient communication takes place, it is often upon affected users request that  information is disclosed and exclusively to this specific user. Instead of receiving information from providers,  affected users often have to inquire themselves on the experienced incident. In some cases, it also happens  that incident notifications are not published in the media or on the provider’s website, whereas the  thresholds have been reached.  Figure 14: Informing the stakeholders  Communication with affected users is not an obligation triggered by Art. 13a requirements, but can be  requested by the NRA if the disclosure of the breach is in public’s interest.

Challenges  From the interviews conducted, it appeared that the main challenge for providers, in terms of incident  reporting and transparency is to compile a report while the incident handling process is in progress (77% of  the NRAs answered that they require notifications from providers during ongoing incidents). In this case  resources are allocated to the reporting process whereas they could be affected to the resolution of the  incident. The full use of the resources for reaching other providers practices, level and maturity can be  detrimental for the providers which are still in the maturation process. The incident may last longer and  impact the providers’ reputation and finances.

Outcome/Benefits analysis regarding transparency  4.5.1. Costs for the incident reporting from transparency requirements  Based on the graph below, for the majority of the NRAs, transparency requirements as per Art. 13a had a  relatively low cost. The main costs regarding the improvement of transparency are the development of a  new tool to support the providers in their incident reporting process and the creation (in some cases) of a  dedicated team. Indeed 60% of the NRAs had to increase their workforce and faced this issue with a medium  or high cost.  Figure 17: Main costs associated with improving transparency  The burden supported by the providers with regards to the transparency highly depends on whether the  indicators used by the providers are the same as the indicators used by the NRAs to assess the impact of the  incident. When the indicators used are not the same between providers and NRAs, providers have to  generate two reports with different indicators to assess, which is time and resources consuming. As a  consequence, the quality of the report differs from one provider to another.  4.5.2. Benefits of the incident reporting from transparency requirements  Although for more than 60% of the surveyed NRAs, the implementation of an incident reporting process  had greater benefits than costs, the rest (40%) remains quite neutral on the question. It is certain that such  process has been beneficial for the providers and NRAs, but 40% of neutral opinions show that there is still  some space for further improvement.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Educate providers about the need to conduct incidents reporting  Provide guidelines/ secondary  legislation to providers to  report incidents  Develop tools to support  providers in the incidents  reporting process  Gather data from  providers to report to  ENISA  Meet providers on  a regular basis  Meet other NRAs on a  regular basis to discuss incidents  report  Increased FTEs -  dedicated team  Other  What were the main costs for the NRA associated with improving transparency?  No cost  Low cost  Medium cost  High cost  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  27  Figure 18: Costs vs. benefits on implementing Art. 13a incident reporting  Incident reporting and transparency requirements, as requested by NRAs in their incident report templates,  do contribute to the improvement of the information quality and quantity. Such transparency requirements  benefit the NRAs because they have uniform and detailed information about the incidents in order to  generate reports and country level analyses.  4.6. End – user feedback regarding Art. 13a  As part of this survey NRAs were inquired on whether the end-users have expressed any opinion on Art. 13a  and whether there’s any type of communication regarding improvements. The general consensus is that  NRAs do not have feedback from end-users regarding these effects. Most of the public remains unaware  of the initiative, and even if some improvement in the communications has been noticed, it would be  difficult for the NRAs to gather the sentiment, and even more so, to attribute it to Art. 13a – related  procedures (rather than advances of technology for example). Consequently, no feedback has been collected  from the end – user (citizen) perspective.  4.7. Area of further improvement  Providers only officially report incidents to the NRAs but end-users do not have access to such information.  Being business-impact orientated, in opposition to NRAs and ENISA which are more end-users orientated,  some providers do not proactively communicate directly to their customers on the on-going faced incident.  End-users have to either request the information or wait for the yearly report from the NRAs and ENISA to  obtain information on the past incidents. Further developments in this area are needed to add more  transparency to customers and the general public, by periodically informing them about outages, measures  taken etc.  Current thresholds are more likely to trigger an incident report from large providers than from the small  providers, resulting in NRAs receiving more incident reports from large providers than from the small  providers. Consequently, NRAs have an overview only of the incidents that impact large providers. Thus  NRAs should adapt the thresholds to capture incidents experienced also by small providers. However this  option is difficult to implement because it assumes a very delicate fine-tuning of the thresholds in order to  cover incidents affecting smaller providers.  63%  23%  0% 14%  Do you think that the costs of implementing incident  reporting are less than the resulting benefits?

Learning and improving based on reported incidents  5.1. Incident reporting as a tool for learning  The incident reporting process is a tool itself to learn from incidents and to sustain a continuous and dynamic  internal learning process for both providers and NRAs. According to the surveyed NRAs, incident reporting  is used as a tool for learning in many areas, as shown in Fig. 19. Statistical purposes, post incident supervision,  periodic reports, developing guidelines and root causes studies are areas where incident reporting is mostly  used for learning, confirmed by 70% or more of the NRA respondents.  Figure 19: Areas where incident reporting is used for learning  5.2. Outcomes/benefits of the learning process  Incident reporting and the resulting learning process contribute to continuously strengthening and  maintaining providers’ infrastructures. As reflected in the graph below, the notion of the reporting obligation  pushes providers to improve (identified as an important benefit by 77% of the surveyed NRAs), and is an  input for sector wide risk and vulnerability assessment (qualified as “quite important benefit” by 69% of the  surveyed NRAs).  87% of the respondents also stated that the incident reporting process is used as an input for appropriate  policy decision, meaning improving regulations within the sector.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  As a basis for maintaining  statistics  As a basis for post incident supervision  As a basis for publishing  annual/ periodic  reports on reported incidents  As a basis for developing guidelines/ secondary legislation  As a basis for studies on root  causes  As a basis for workshops  with providers  As a basis for sharing  experiences with other  NRAs  As an input for sector wirde  risk and vunerability  As a basis for participating in  the management/ mitigation of the incident  Other  How do you use the incident reports you receive in the learning/ improvement  process?  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  29  Figure 20: Benefits of incident reporting  However incident reporting and a learning process cannot guarantee a drop in the number of incidents,  especially in case of incidents that are due to environmental causes, although they surely contributed to  improving the overall process of addressing different types of incidents.  5.3. Areas of further improvement  In this part, the suggestions made in order to further improve the learning process, as communicated by the  surveyed NRAs and providers, are conflicting. Some NRAs and providers think that sharing more information  regarding the learning and preventive actions taken could help other providers in their own incident solution  process and would bring stronger knowledge to small providers. In addition, cross country collaboration on  incidents and supervision matters for NRAs could be reinforced by more information sharing.  However, this suggestion raises the issue related to confidential information disclosure and a concern from  providers regarding the risk of being penalized for the incident that they have experienced. In addition, such  information sharing may not bring as many benefits as expected to the other providers as the impact and  the corresponding solution may be specific to the infrastructures of the providers. Therefore driven solutions  and lesson learnt may not be compatible from one situation to another or from one provider to the other.  As you may notice NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement but  mostly for compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations (Fig. 19). The percentage of those who use  the results of the process also as an input for sector wide or nationwide risk assessment is rather low.

Collaboration between the actors  6.1. Specific objective context  Collaboration is at the very heart of the implementation process, especially when the telecommunications’  market landscape is quite different from one country to another.  A successful implementation at national level is possible only if the NRA and the national providers work  together, helping each other to overcome the challenges. NRAs involvement is all the more important given  that small providers do not have as much experience as the front-runners and may face more difficulties in  the implementation process.  However, such collaboration faces some limits when brought at EU level. Indeed, providers and NRAs are  hesitant in sharing confidential and sensitive data to other stakeholders, even in the context of Art. 13a and  for collaboration and improvement purposes.  6.2. Collaboration during the implementation of Art. 13a requirements  6.2.1. Collaboration between ENISA and NRAs  ENISA’s role has been to support NRAs along the implementation process of the requirements mandated in  Art. 13a, to provide expertise, advice and to promote the exchange of good practices among the member  states. In order to do so, ENISA built a strong relationship and collaborative working environment. As a  matter of fact, 68% of the surveyed NRAs agreed/strongly agreed that ENISA‘s role was beneficial for the  implementation process.

N/A Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  31  ENISA worked closely with the NRAs to provide more detailed information to them as well as the providers  and has issued several guidelines. These guidelines have been helpful for the NRAs to better understand the  requirements of Art. 13a, especially the scope and definitions, and to have a concrete perception of the  threshold levels to set up. Indeed, ENISA’s guidelines provide definition and advice to NRAs and providers  on how to consider the interpretation of the requirements, and were very well received and appreciated  by the community (as stated by 68% by the respondents).  Exchange of information between NRAs is facilitated by the Art. 13a Expert Group meetings, which are  organized on a regular basis, and aim at involving all the EU member states in an open discussion about Art.  13a. This observation includes discussing implementation in detail, sharing knowledge and exchanging  views, in order to achieve a harmonized approach of implementing Art. 13a.  6.2.2. Collaboration between NRAs and providers  As shown by Fig. 22 most of the NRAs indicated some overloading as regards to the implementation  process of Art. 13a, but most of them rarely indicated overloads of more than 25% of the total time of the  responsible personnel involved (FTE). In order to support their domestic telecom service providers,  dedicated personnel within 20% of the NRAs spent half or more than half of their time to issue second level  regulations, guidelines and educate providers. Developing reporting tools for providers was also indicated  as time consuming by less than 20% of the respondent NRAs.  Regarding the collaboration between NRAs and providers, as described in Fig. 23, the majority (77%) stated  that the collaboration lasted for the whole implementation period, and 64% of them declared that the  providers requested additional supporting documentation, as guidelines or advice. Given the level of detail  provided within the directive, we can certainly say that collaboration was more than necessary at this level,  both at European level and at national level.

Collaboration after the implementation of Art. 13a requirements  As regards to the situation after the implementation period of Art. 13a, we can notice from Fig. 24 that  collaboration between NRAs and ENISA was still needed, as by the majority of the respondents. More  specifically guidelines on particular areas were still needed, and the overall activities carried out by ENISA  alone or within the Art. 13 Expert Group are considered beneficial by more than 80% of the respondents.  ENISA continues to hold the Art. 13a Expert Group Meetings with the intent to keep a high level of  collaboration and information exchange between the member states. The Expert Group is also a way for  ENISA to measure the level of harmonization in regards to the member states practices.  The estimated time spent by the NRAs’ FTE dedicated personnel during the implementation phase of Art.  13a (Fig. 22), with the time spent after the implementation (Fig. 25), is more or less the same, highlighting  that Art. 13a has developed to a continuous process within NRAs. Although the implementation process is  complete, providers still need the support of the NRAs, as further improvements to the incident reporting  process are developed periodically and, as statistics show, the number of incidents is increasing. The only  activity that sees its allocated time decreasing is the supplying of guidelines/secondary legislation to  providers, as the market has reached a certain level of maturity within this area.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  Providers were reluctant to implement the requirements  of Article 13a  Providers requested guidelines and advices from the NRA  Collaboration with the providers took place along the whole implementation process  How would you describe the collaboration between  providers and the NRAs during the implementation of Article  13a?  N/A Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  33  Figure 24: Current collaboration NRAs – ENISA after the implementation of Art. 13a  However the need for developed tools and supervision/audit of the providers remains almost the same as  during the implementation process. This is the consequence of a need for a continuous effort in monitoring  the measures implemented for compliance with Art. 13a.  This graph (Fig. 25) confirms that the cross border collaboration between NRAs remains quite limited as  82% of the surveyed NRAs estimate spending less than 10% in exchanging information with NRAs in other  member states impacted by the same type of incident. In addition interviewed NRAs confirmed that they  did not often collaborate or exchange information with other NRAs on a regular basis.  Regarding the supervision and audit of the providers, 63% of the dedicated personnel within NRAs spent up  to 50% of their total time doing this activity. Other time consuming activities are gathering data for reporting  to ENISA, develop tools and meet with providers on a regular basis etc.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Providers are still reluctant to  implement the requirements of  Article 13a  Providers are open to share relevant  information about incidents  Providers request guidelines and  advices from NRAs  Useful and accurate  guidelines were provided by ENISA through the Article 13a Expert Group  On average, the relationship with  ENISA is beneficial for the work within  Article 13a  On average, the collaboration  within the Article 13a Expert Group  is beneficial for your Article 13a  related work  Other  How would you describe the current collaboration between providers, NRAs  and ENISA after the implementation of Article 13a?

Areas of further improvement  The opinions on the possibility and benefits of improving the current level of collaboration differ among  different types of stakeholders.  On the one hand, for some NRAs, it would be useful to collect incident reporting and information from  national providers, which will be anonymized, in order to share this information with the other NRAs, so  their domestic providers have access to other providers’ incident reports, experiences and practices. On the  other hand, some NRAs do not agree with this proposition for several reasons. First, if the incident is a major  incident and has been related in the media, it is always easy to find the identity of the provider. Secondly,  some NRAs state that each incident is specific to a provider, a market structure, the providers’  infrastructures, etc. and that it is not possible to adapt preventive measures from one country to another  where the culture, infrastructures and market structure is not the same. Meanwhile ENISA is trying to  develop, along with the Art. 13a expert group, a provider to provider sharing capability in order to facilitate  this kind of cooperation and, of course, satisfy the majority of requests by member states.  However, providers do share their need for more information exchange on the incidents experienced by  other providers. This information sharing is already in place in some countries, under the NRA’s supervision  and in project in some others. Providers also underline their continuous need for feedback and support from  their NRAs on incident reporting quality and assessment, and a true bi-directional beneficial communication.  Last but not least, collaboration could be improved further, as the different indicators used by NRAs and  providers to measure the impact of an incident are not aligned. If this situation is persistent, it shows that  communication and collaboration are not optimum between NRAs and providers.  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  Draft and provide guidelines/ secondary legislation to providers  Internal educational activities (workshop, training, etc.)  Educate providers about the need to conduct incidents reporting  Meet providers on a regular basis  Develop tools for providers in the incident reporting process  Gather data from providers to report to ENISA  Meet ENISA and other NRAs on a regular basis to discuss the…  Inform/ collaborate with NRAs in other Members States impacted by…  Participate in surveys and in the drafting/ review of ENISA Technical…  Supervising/ auditing the providers  Other  How much time are your NRA's FTEs spending currently on the following  activities related to Article 13a?  above 76% 51% - 75% 26% - 50% 11% - 25% Below 10%  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  35  7. Harmonization of practices within the EU  7.1. Paradox: harmonization at EU level vs fragmentation at country level  7.1.1. Harmonization vs differentiation  In the European Union, directives prevail on national law and bind upon the EU member states as to the  implementation of the requirements, regardless the specificities of the national law. EU member states have  an obligation of transposition into domestic legislation, although they are free to choose the means and the  ways to reach this objective within the given time frame. Lastly, countries are always free to adapt the  requirements on the national level. Differences between countries can include: difference of maturity,  different practices and cultures, etc. For example, some countries issue one or two incident reports annually,  while other countries can issue hundreds.  If the directive sets up minimum standards to be implemented within national legal framework, member  states are free to apply more demanding national measures, as long as they do not conflict with the  requirements of the directive and with the free movement and free market rules. Although this principle  wants to respect countries’ sovereignty, this is a source of differentiation among countries. If the legal  framework is by definition harmonized at EU level, the content of the domestic law is impacted by the  countries specificities and needs. For instance, thresholds that trigger the incident reporting process are  different from one country to another, although the NRAs referred to the ENISA’s Technical Guideline on  Incident Reporting. This guideline and the others aim at providing more details and indications to the NRAs  in order to facilitate the implementation of Art. 13a requirements.  As per the Directive 2009/140/EC, member states were required to conduct a national public consultation  to “give interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period10”  but remain free to take the results more or less into consideration.  In the context of Art. 13a, the transposition of the directive into domestic law has been successfully achieved  by all the member states but one, which is still under progress. Furthermore, the implementation process  has not been completed within the same timeline. For example, some countries implemented Art. 13a  requirements by 2011, while some countries needed an additional time period to complete the process by  2012, 2013 and 2014.  If countries kept their specificities and regulation prerogatives, Art. 13a definitively helped to harmonize the  provider and member states general approach regarding incident reporting.  10 Directive 2009/140/EC, Article 6  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  36  Figure 26: The use of ENISA’s technical guidelines by NRAs  However, if the NRAs do refer to the ENISA technical guidelines, reports and studies, most of them use those  documents as an inspiration or guidance when the European regulations or domestic laws are not clear  enough (on average 30% of the surveyed NRAs use most or all of ENISA’s technical guidelines on incident  reporting and on security measures in their work, and 40% of the NRAs use ENISA’s technical guidelines  on incident reporting and on threats and assets as a source of inspiration in their work). Nevertheless,  ENISA’s technical guidelines are the most important source of harmonization, given the fact that the  Directive does not provide sufficient level of details regarding the scope and thresholds for the incident  reporting process, and also lack of definition of what to consider as an asset.  On the other hand, the frequent meeting groups held by ENISA enabled NRAs to share good practices,  experiences and advices among themselves, resulting in a trend for harmonization of the practices within  the member states. This harmonization is driven indirectly but does not reach every country.  7.1.2. Different approaches in implementing Art. 13a requirements  Most of the countries held a public consultation, according to Article 6 of the Directive 2009/140/EC, before  adopting the new regulations; the NRAs as regulatory authorities are free to take the results of the  consultation into consideration or to follow their own prerogatives. Therefore, the levels of input from the  providers are different from one country to another and impact more or less the domestic legislation.  Furthermore, if the majority of the countries benefit from a second level legislation, some countries do not  have such legal framework and are keener in interpreting the Directive and refer to the guidelines than  countries which have such level of regulation. ENISA’s technical guidelines remain in each situation the main  point of information, although countries did not implement Art. 13a through the same level of regulation  and legal means.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident  Reporting  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Security  Measures  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Threats and  Assets  Article 13a and Article 4 Technical  Guideline on Security  Measures  ENISA Annual reports on reported incidents  ENISA studies  To what extent are you using Article 13a Technical Guideline and  studies in your national implementation and work?  Hardly/ not at all  Not so much but we refer to it in our work  We get enough inspiration and use a fair amount of it in our work  We use mot/ all of it in our work  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  37  In most cases, countries with a second level legislation are the most advanced countries with regards to their  legal framework and good practices, resulting in different level of efforts required in comparison with  countries that have a very young or immature legal framework. Given that some countries had already a  more mature legal framework in place and a NRA issuing supportive guidelines, there were only limited  efforts to be provided for the implementation of Art. 13a requirements.  Consequently, as the ways and means used to implement Art. 13a requirements differ from one country to  another, the thresholds for incidents reporting defined and implemented in the countries differ. First some  NRAs set up their thresholds based only on ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting, while some  other countries took in consideration the comments collected during the public consultation to adapt the  level of thresholds proposed in the guidelines. Last but not the least, some countries implemented the  thresholds based on the guideline but updated them later to better fit the market specificities, sector  practices and the need to collect more information.  Harmonization of the regulation within the European Union will facilitate the continuous development of a  single EU market. Furthermore, diverging regulatory requirements across EU member states may deter and  hinder effective competition and thus limit the benefits for some customers in specific countries.  Harmonized procedures in terms of incident reporting will also guarantee customers getting access to  information related to interruption of service or other types of incidents. On the other hand, harmonized  security measures and incident reporting processes will enable cross-border providers to realize economies  of scale, as they are already familiar with the incident reporting process, the requirements and then benefit  from synergies in the training materials, tool usage, incident management, lessons learnt on passed incident  in other countries, etc.  For ENISA, a harmonized approach in the incident reporting is necessary to compare, benchmark and assess  the situation within the European Union. Without a common template, indicators and process, the  assessment and benchmark of the incidents would be complicated.  7.2. NRAs level of satisfaction regarding harmonization  Taking into account the mandatory level or harmonization imposed by the directive, the necessary level of  harmonization induced by ENISA’s guidelines and the common specificities noticed at member states level,  90% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the level of harmonization within the EU,  which sustains also national specificities (as shown in Fig. 27).  Figure 27: Appropriate level of harmonization  86%  14%  Do you think that the level of harmonization is appropriate up to  date?  Yes, a harmonized approach allowing for national differences is appropriate  No, more harmonization across the Member States would be preferable  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  38  7.3. Areas of further improvement  The interviews and the online survey revealed that the 82% of the NRAs are currently satisfied with the  level of harmonization, and do not think that an improvement is needed for the member states and the  telecom market.  Figure 28: Ways of carrying harmonization  However, 18% of the surveyed NRAs do think that ENISA could improve the current level of alignment among  the NRAs regarding the secondary level of legislation and supervision methodology. Also, an enhanced level  of alignment would reduce the differences between the countries and enable cross-border service providers  to reduce the current faced costs and barriers.  Nonetheless, improving the level of harmonization might be a challenge as the current achieved result is  already quite satisfying for ENISA also. Besides the more the harmonization level is raised, the more  countries tend to lose their particularities, as created by their internal markets. The risk is that countries  start to be reluctant to the implementation of new and stricter regulations.  On the other hand, it may be more difficult for cross border operators to continue to expand and to grow  with these differences among the countries, regarding the security measures, the security incident reporting  triggering thresholds and the security incident indicators. Complying with all the different legislations  requires considerable much effort and could impact the decision to enter the market and compete with the  already established national providers.  82%  18%  0%  Do you think the way the harmonization has been carried out at EU level  is appropriate?  Yes, the way we work through the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group drafting and agreeing on common technical guidelines and sharing experiences, is appropriate  Yes, but ENISA could push more for aligning the NRAs with each other regarding secondary legislation and supervision methodologies  No, we would prefer the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures for us to follow on an equal basis  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  39  8. Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  8.1. ENISA’s annual incident reports  For four years now, ENISA publishes the annual report about significant disruption/outage incidents in the  EU electronic communications sector, which are reported to ENISA and the European Commission under  Art. 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)11, by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) from all  member states. This annual report covers the incidents that occurred in a year and it gives an aggregated  analysis about severe outages across the EU, keeping details about individual countries or providers  confidential.  As you may notice from the chart below (Fig. 29), the number of incidents reported every year is  continuously increasing, showing year by year, the stakeholder’s maturity in identifying, collecting and  processing more and more incidents. The number of reported incidents has grown along with the number  of reporting countries. Only 51 significant incidents in 2011 reported by 11 countries, and 137 incidents  reported by 25 countries in 2014.  Figure 29: Total incidents reported 2011 - 2014  Looking at the root causes, as shown in the figure below, system failures is one of the main causes that  triggers disruptions in Europe. On a closer look, we will notice that a part of the system failures were actually  third party failures (16% from all incidents in 2014, 11% in 2013), meaning failures caused by other parties  along the supply chain and not the providers that suffered the actual incident. These findings raise other  issues regarding causes of disruption incidents around Europe, and how to address them.  11 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending Directives  2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC  on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services  51  79 90  137  Incidents reported  2011 2012 2013 2014  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  40  Figure 30: Root causes for reported 2011 - 2014  Supply chain security and responsibility is one of the issues to be taken into consideration in future  developments within the area.  8.2. Areas of further improvement  In agreement with the NRAs in the Art. 13a expert group, at the moment incidents affecting only 4 types of  services are expected to be reported to ENISA:   Fixed telephony   Fixed internet   Mobile telephony   Mobile internet  However, the types of services offered by modern telecommunications providers have developed over the  years (e.g. messaging services, software based voice services). Consequently the range of covered services  within ENISA’s annual report needs to be updated, by adopting the modern services offered by providers.  As third party failures represent an important part of reported incidents, signaling different issues within  this area, further actions need to be considered in the near future. Developing requirements regarding the  supply chain security and responsibility could be a further action to be considered by responsible  stakeholders.  12 6  14  5  12  5  19 20  6 8 6 9  47  76  61 66  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  2011 2012 2013 2014  Natural phenomena Human errors Malicious actions System failures  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  41  9. Key findings and conclusions  Art. 13a gave a new momentum in the telecom industry at European level. By amending the 2002  regulations, the Art. 13a within the Framework Directive of the 2009 Telecom Package, addresses security  and resilience issues for the first time in the EU.  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the new regulations, an impact  evaluation of the new provisions was the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose of assessing  the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, and the effects caused  by this particular regulation within the Telecom Package.  The compendious evaluation we have done within this project has brought to light some important  outcomes that have definitely contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the  telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a European Union which was highly diversified in terms of  security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of uniformity in the approach taken regarding security  of telecommunication services, but more importantly contributed to strengthening the European telecom  infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the  coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped considerably in bringing more  harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among stakeholders (NRAs and  providers).  Despite the obvious positive outcomes that have been expressed by the majority of the respondents, there  are also some areas of further improvement. Clarifying the scope of art. 13a in order to provide clear  information on the types of networks and services that should be covered is one of them, along with  reinforcing cross-border collaboration and also other areas that can contribute to a higher degree of  resilience of European networks and services.  Overall, Art. 13a has contributed to improving the level of security in the telecommunication sector but in a  balanced way as some counties were already in line or even ahead of the requirements and were already  experiencing the expected benefits. By opposition, the less advanced countries and providers experimented  strong benefits and improvement in their security measures and infrastructures resilience in spite of the  costs and efforts provided.  It has been also noted throughout this project that further analyses are needed in order to draw some strong  conclusions on next steps that are needed in this area. The short period of time allocated to this project  along with the complexity of the area, prevented the project team to further analyze additional details and  areas that could also have influenced the result of this evaluation. In this respect, this report will only cover  a set of findings that must be further analyzed in order to propose concrete recommendations and next  steps to be considered by different types of stakeholders. Main findings of the study are the following,  grouped into categories:  The scope of Art. 13a  1. Current lack of precise information within Art. 13a and Telecom Directive, as regards the types of  networks and services that should be covered, has led to some differences among national  implementations within member states. Although, the level of harmonization seem to be  satisfactory, the differences within services covered by member states could represent obstacles in  achieving the overall or specific objectives stated within the Telecom Package. Further assessments  in this area are needed (more details in section 2.1.2. and Annex I) in order to establish possible next  steps.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  42  2. More than half of the respondents (54%) considered that Art. 13a cannot sufficiently and clearly  cover by itself security of electronic communications, but together with Art. 4 in the e-Privacy  Directive.  Appropriate security measures for providers:  1. The majority (45%) of the respondents (NRAs) considered that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures within the sector, but further analyses are needed as more than half of them (55%) do not  share this opinion, 23% stating “no” and 32% “don’t know”.  2. Almost 60% of the respondent NRAs are not aware of the areas where the providers have improved  the most, in terms of security measures.  Transparency in incident reporting  1. The approach of the providers towards NRAs as regards the implementation of Art. 13a mandatory  incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative. Withal the majority of the respondent NRAs  are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in their incident reports  and declared that they are receiving reports as expected.  2. Bringing more clarity to the incident reporting process, by issuing guidelines and additional  legislation – 73%, was by far the most effective method of improving transparency.  Learning and improving based on reported incidents  1. NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement, but mostly for  internal purposes such as compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations. The use of annual  incident statistics as an input for evaluating risk at national or sectorial level is not a common  approach among NRAs (more details in section 5.1. and 5.3).  Collaboration between the actors  1. The establishment and development of Art. 13a expert group, under ENISA coordination, turned out  to be a successful and helpful experience (more details in section 6.3.), as appreciated by 80% of the  respondents. The operation and development of the group should definitely be continued, under  ENISA’s coordination.  2. Bi-directional communication with the population in the incident reporting process is poorly  addressed by both NRAs and providers. Further analyses should be carried in order to determine the  necessity of developing such processes (more details in section 4.3.).  3. The amount of resource employed by NRAs in the cross-border collaboration area appears to be low  (more details in section 6.3.).  Harmonization of practices within the EU  1. Over 80% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the current level of  harmonization within the EU, which sustains also national specificities, and do not think that an  improvement is needed in present.  2. ENISA’s work, together with Art. 13a expert group, in the area of guidelines and good practices, was  considered useful by up to 70% of the respondent NRAs, as it supported the achievement of a  mature level of harmonization.  Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  1. More and more reported incidents (at ENISA level) are caused by third party failures (more details  in section 8.2.), meaning they are caused by parties out of provider’s direct control, but within the  provider’s supply chain.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  43  2. The main root cause for incidents at EU level in 2014 and years before, is “system failures”.

Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Electronic communications services guarantee the smooth transmission of  data in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for businesses and critical services  to run. Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency  response and in the economic development of a country. As a result, a security incident affecting one of  these areas can result in severe consequences.  Art. 13a gave a new momentum in the telecom industry at European level. Being part of the Framework  Directive 2009/1401 EC within the Telecom Package, the set of obligations in the article aims at ensuring the  security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services, dealing mostly with prevention of  outages or service disruption (availability of the service).  Although availability seems to be the main concern  of Art. 13a, some countries (as you will notice later) have decided to cover also other types on security  incidents within their national legislation (e.g. privacy). By amending the 2002 legislation, the Art. 13a within  the 2009 Telecom Package, addresses specific security and resilience obligations for the telecom sector, for  the first time in EU, as the 2002 directive had only vague provisions on this area.  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the Framework Directive including  Art. 13a, an impact evaluation of the new article was the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose  of assessing the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects  caused by this particular set of obligations within the Telecom Package. The evaluation focused on 5 key  areas, where we tried to identify possible outcomes:   The new security measures implemented in the member states ;   The transparency resulting from the incident reporting process;   The learning process resulting from incidents ;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders ;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  The compendious evaluation we have done within this project has brought to light some important  outcomes that have definitely contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the  telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a European Union which was highly diversified in terms of  security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of uniformity in the approach taken regarding security  of telecommunication services, but more importantly contributed to strengthening the European telecom  infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the  coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped considerably in bringing more  harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among stakeholders (NRAs and  providers).  Overall, Art. 13a has undeniably contributed to improving the level of security in the telecommunication  sector but in a balanced way as some countries were already in line or even ahead of the requirements and  1 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending Directives  2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC  on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  06  were already experiencing the expected benefits, whereas other less advanced countries or providers  experienced strong benefits in spite of the costs and effort provided.  It was also noted throughout this project that further analysis is needed in order to draw some strong  conclusions on next steps that are needed in this area. This report only covers a set of findings that must be  further analyzed, by responsible parties, in order to propose concrete recommendations and next steps to  be considered by different types of stakeholders.  The main findings of the study are the following, grouped into categories:  The scope of Art. 13a  1. Current lack of precise information within Art. 13a and Telecom Directive, as regards the types of  networks and services that should be covered, has led to some differences among national  implementations within member states. Although, the level of harmonization seem to be  satisfactory, the differences within services covered by member states could represent obstacles in  achieving the overall or specific objectives stated within the Telecom Package. Further assessments  in this area are needed (more details in section 2.1.2. and Annex I) in order to establish possible next  steps.  2. More than half of the respondents (54%) considered that Art. 13a cannot sufficiently and clearly  cover by itself security of electronic communications, but together with Art. 4 in the e-Privacy  Directive.  Appropriate security measures for providers:  1. The majority (45%) of the respondents (NRAs) considered that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures within the sector, but further analyses are needed as more than half of them (55%) do not  share this opinion, 23% stating “no” and 32% “do not know”.  2. Almost 60% of the respondent NRAs are not aware of the areas where the providers have improved  the most, in terms of security measures.  Transparency in incident reporting  1. The approach of providers towards NRAs as regards the implementation of Art. 13a mandatory  incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative. Withal the majority of the respondent NRAs  are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in their incident reports  and declared that they are receiving reports as expected.  2. Bringing more clarity to the incident reporting process, by issuing guidelines and additional  legislation – 73%, was by far the most effective method of improving transparency.  Learning and improving based on reported incidents  1. NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement, but mostly for  internal purposes such as compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations. The use of annual  incident statistics as an input for evaluating risk at national or sectorial level is not a common  approach among NRAs (more details in section 5.1. and 5.3).  Collaboration between the actors  1. The establishment and development of Art. 13a expert group, under ENISA coordination, turned out  to be a successful and helpful experience (more details in section 6.3.), as appreciated by 80% of the  respondents. The operation and development of the group should definitely be continued, under  ENISA’s coordination.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  07  2. Bi-directional communication with the population in the incident reporting process is poorly  addressed by both NRAs and providers. Further analyses should be carried in order to determine the  necessity of developing such processes (more details in section 4.3.).  3. The amount of resource employed by NRAs in the cross-border collaboration area appears to be low  (more details in section 6.3.).  Harmonization of practices within the EU  1. Over 80% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the current level of  harmonization within the EU, which sustains also national specificities, and do not think that an  improvement is needed in present.  2. ENISA’s work, together with Art. 13a expert group, in the area of guidelines and good practices, was  considered useful by up to 70% of the respondent NRAs, as it supported the achievement of a  mature level of harmonization.  Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  1. More and more reported incidents (at ENISA level) are caused by third party failures (more details  in section 8.2.), meaning they are caused by parties out of provider’s direct control, but within the  provider’s supply chain.  2. The main root cause for incidents at EU level in 2014 and years before, is “system failures”. Further  assessment needs to be done in this area, in order to identify more detailed causes and security  measures that can be adopted.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  08  1. Introduction  1.1. Background  In today’s interconnected world, telecommunications are transforming the way people engage in their  everyday lives. Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Electronic communications services guarantee the smooth transmission of  data in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for business services to run.  Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency response and  in the economic development of a country. As a result, an outage in any one of these areas can result in  severe consequences.  The Telecom Package represents the EU's regulatory framework for electronic communications, and is,  according EU Commission’s website, “[…] a series of rules which apply throughout the EU member states. It  encourages competition, improves the functioning of the market and guarantees basic user rights.  The overall goal is for European consumers to be able to benefit from increased choice thanks to low prices,  high quality and innovative services”2. The Telecom Package was adopted in November 2009, as a review of  the European Union Telecommunications Framework 2007 – 2009.  Art. 13a, of the Directive 2009/140 EC, is part of the Telecom Package and aims at ensuring the security and  integrity of electronic communication networks and services, dealing mostly with prevention of outages or  service disruption (availability of the service). This is partially achieved through requiring telecommunication  service providers to take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed  to security of networks and services, guarantee the integrity of their networks (ensure the continuity of  supply of services provided over those networks) and notify the competent national regulatory authority  (NRA) of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services.  Published in 2009, Art. 13a required that the deadline for the transposition should be up to 2011. However,  the transposition timeframe and process significantly varied from one country to the other. As a matter of  fact, countries maturity level, national legislation complexity and process impacted some countries in their  ability to comply with the deadlines, resulting in certain gaps between countries overtime. Today, the  majority of countries implemented the provisions of the Art. 13a, in one way or another, besides one  country. Art. 13a also designates ENISA, along with the European Commission (EC), as responsible bodies for  collecting notifications received and actions taken within member states, under the provisions of national  implementations of Art. 13a. Besides this specific mandate, according to the directive, ENISA should also  contribute to the “harmonization of appropriate technical and organizational security measures by providing  expert advice” and by “promoting the exchange of best practices”.  As a response to the directive’s requirements, in 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs from member states,  initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) in order to achieve a harmonized  implementation of Art. 13a of the Framework directive. As a result of these meetings, a group of experts  from NRAs, now entitled the Art. 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on three non-binding technical  documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU member states:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting3  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/telecoms-rules (November 2015)  3 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/35 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  09   Technical Guideline on Security Measures4   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets5.  The Art. 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year, to develop and improve technical  guidelines, to discuss upon the implementation of Art. 13a and to share knowledge and exchange views  about past incidents, and how to address them.  1.2. Scope  Considering the above, as several years have passed since the implementation of Art. 13a, an impact  evaluation of the new regulation is the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose of assessing the  changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects caused by this  particular regulation within the Telecom Package. The ultimate goal of this study is to assess the “as-is”  situation and the outcomes produced through implementations of Art. 13a. The results of this study are  intended for understanding the impact of the regulation on the European telecommunications industry, and  for further improving the security and resilience of the networks and services within the sector.  1.3. Target audience  This report is addressed to:   policy makers at EU level, including the European Commission and ENISA, in order to help them  understand the impact of the regulation on the telecommunications market and EU digital single  market and further improve the security and resilience of the sector;   policy makers within member states, in order to help them better understand the impact of the  regulation on their internal market;   telecommunications providers, in order to help them better understand the impact of the regulation  on their business;   any other stakeholder interested in this policy field;  1.4. Impact evaluation methodology  This report is based on a qualitative survey type approach, consisting of a desktop research, an online surveys  and telephone interviews. The approach aimed to collect all the available information regarding the national  implementations of Art. 13a and identify the outcomes produced at national and European level. This helped  in building a baseline on which the interviews and survey relied upon. With the background set from the  desktop research, the interview guides and the survey focused on understanding the point of view of both  NRAs and providers in their respective countries. Focus was given in understanding the differentiating  factors in each country as well as the successes and failures. The interviews were structure around 5 key  areas in order to provide the fullest picture:   The new security measures implemented in the member states ;   The transparency resulting from the incident report process;   The learning process resulting from the incidents ;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders ;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  Respondents: 22 respondents (exclusively NRAs) for the online survey, 14 participants for telephonic  interviews (both NRAs and providers).  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  10  2. Status of Art. 13a implementation  2.1. Introduction to Art. 13a  2.1.1. Requirements  Art. 13a states that the EU member states shall ensure that telecom service providers “take appropriate  technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and  services” and “take all appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the  continuity of supply of services provided over those networks”.  A closer look on the article, will reveal 3 terms: “security incidents”, “security breaches” and “integrity  losses”:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize  the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security  or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services”  The use of the term integrity in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer to the definition  in technical literature on networks and network interconnections6, which defines integrity “as the ability of  the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”. Integrity of networks  would be called availability or continuity in most information security literature7. In this document we call  these types of incidents simply “security incidents” or “incidents” and we use the following definition in this  document: a breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation of  electronic telecommunications networks and services.  In this respect, although we may assume that Art. 13a relates mostly with the availability of the service, as  its main purpose is to “ensure the continuity of supply of services”, the text of the article allows certain  interpretations as regards to the scope. According to the graph below (Fig. 1), the requirements related to  continuity/availability of the services has been implemented by 100% of the surveyed NRAs. Nevertheless,  some countries have made a step further and covered in their national implementation other security  concepts than availability, such as confidentiality (Fig. 1).  Furthermore, telecom service providers have the obligation to notify the competent NRA regarding any  breach of security or loss of network integrity that has a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services. In this case also, 100% of the NRAs implemented an incident reporting process for any disruption/  outages in the electronic communications networks and services, while a minority (20%) also included  breaches impacting information confidentiality or denial of services attacks not necessarily impacting the  availability of the electronic communications (as shown in Fig. 2). This requirement is also followed by all EU  member states along with some EFTA members also.  6 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  7 In information security literature the term ‘integrity’ usually refers to the property that data or communications  cannot be altered or tampered with.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  11  Figure 1: Scope of Art. 13a national implementation (security measures)  Figure 2: Scope of Art. 13a national implementation (mandatory incident reporting)  After receiving reports/notifications at a national level, NRAs shall report to ENISA any incident that had a  significant impact on the operation of networks or services. As the term “significant incident” has not been  defined by the directive, neither has been defined within the national implementations of Art. 13a in most  of the countries, ENISA, in collaboration with the Art. 13a Expert Group has defined “significance” by  adopting certain thresholds through a set of informal guidelines, adopted/referred to by all member states,  as shown in Chapter 1 - Introduction.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Continuity/ availability of electronic communications  networks and services  Measures to protect the confidentiality of information/  data carried over electronic communications networks  and services  Protecting customers against denial of service attacks  Protecting customers against malware attacks  Among these examples, what does your national implementation of Article  13a mainly address in terms of scope regarding the security measures?  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Disruption/ outages in electronic communications  networks and services  Breaches impacting the confidentiality of  information/ data carried over electronic  communications networks and services  Denial of service attacks not impacting the availability of the  electronic communications service but impacting  customers  Malware attacks not impacting the availability  of the electronic communications service but impacting customers  Among these examples, what does your national implementation of Article  13a mainly address in terms of scope regarding the incident reporting?  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  12  2.1.2. Networks and services in scope of Art. 13a  Art. 13a aims at safeguarding network availability through minimizing the impact of security incidents and  ensuring the continuity of service supplying provided over those networks. The article applies for several  types of networks and services, depending on the national implementation of the directive by each member  state. Services such as mobile and fixed telephony but also to mobile and fixed internet are covered by all  member states. In addition to these networks and services, NRAs included in Art. 13a several other services  such as SMS (almost 70%), TV and radio broadcasting (45% and 31% respectively), according to their national  implementations of the framework directive. For a full set of networks and services covered by national  implementations of Art. 13a please see Annex I.  Figure 3: Services in scope of national implementation of Art. 13a  As telecommunication networks and services can also be affected by other types of incidents that may or  may not have an impact on the availability of the service, we have also tried to understand if stakeholders  (meaning only NRAs) are satisfied with the current types of incidents covered by Art. 13a as regards to the  overall security of electronic communications within a member state. 54% of the surveyed NRAs consider  that appropriate level of security within the telecom sector is achievable together with Article 4 of e- Privacy Directive, so that more types of incidents could be covered.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  SMS TV Broadcasting  Radio broadcasting  Other IXPs - Internal  Exchange Points  Satellite telephony  Commercial with  hotspots  Webmail and  messaging services  ccTLDS - Country  Code Top Level  Domains  Webbased voice not using the E.164 tel  number plan  What publicly available networks and services are in scope on your national  implementation of Article 13a, in addition to fixed/ mobile telephony and fixed/  mobile internet  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  13  Figure 4: Coverage of telecom security by Art. 13a  2.2. Situation of the countries before the implementation of Art. 13a  Before the implementation of Art. 13a, the telecom security landscape was fragmented and very specific to  each country, with no pan European regulation. In other words, the legal maturity, practices and governance  of the network resilience of each country were very heterogeneous which impacted the transposition and  implementation process according to the level of maturity.  Although the 2002 Telecom Package tended to obliterate the legal differences among the countries at EU  level by providing harmonized guidelines, countries kept their national prerogative and transposed the  requirements into national law according to their countries specificities, market and maturity. However, the  differences observed during the implementation process of the 2002 Telecom Package resurfaced in the  approach taken by each country when implementing Art. 13a requirements from 2009. As you may see from  Fig. 3 (or the Annex 1) although all countries have implemented mandatory incident reporting for service  disruptions on telecom providers, they do cover differently the types of networks and services in scope of  Art. 13a, meaning that incidents affecting different types of services are reported by each state.  2.2.1. Approach of the NRAs and providers  Art. 13a has been received in many different ways by the consulted stakeholders, ranging from reluctance  to enthusiasm but most commonly by skepticism. NRAs and providers were challenged to have a clear  understanding of the scope and how to assess the criteria defining the impact of an incident or the  appropriate level of security measures as per Art. 13a requirements, although the provisions of the European  regulations were quite unclear.  NRAs  When Art. 13a was initially published, many NRAs were uncertain about the level of details and precision of  the Directive, because several aspects of it were left – on purpose – open for the NRAs’ interpretation. For  example, Art. 13a states that member states shall ensure that providers take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, but does not specify what is meant by “appropriate steps” or how  “integrity” is defined. In this situation, NRAs referred in their replies to the Technical Guideline on Incident  23%  54%  23%  Do you  think that Article 13a is sufficiently clear and covers  security of electronic communications?

Following the consultation of these guidelines, some NRAs issued second level regulations  and/or some specific guidelines to support their national providers in their national implementation process.  In addition, NRAs were invited on a regular basis to participate in the Art. 13a Expert Group, an information  exchange group especially created in this context by ENISA. This group had a critical role in federating NRAs  during and after the implementation process. During these meetings, NRAs shared their point of view,  experiences and thoughts about Art. 13a requirements.  Providers  As far as providers are concerned, the reaction of those consulted varied significantly and it can be directly  correlated with their level of maturity in terms of country legislation and practices as well as to the level and  maturity of collaboration with the NRA. Therefore, in the cases where providers were very mature, they  were for most indifferent to Art. 13a, as such requirements were already included in their day-to-day  practices and obligations.  As far as was shown from the qualitative approach of interviewing providers, those with a good level of  maturity were either eager to improve their process and security measures, or reluctant due to the  additional cost and due to stricter rules. Small providers or immature ones were either welcoming Art. 13a,  identified as a strong opportunity to improve or reluctant to these new requirements, due to the additional  effort to be provided while they face limited resources.  As a conclusion regarding the providers, whatever their maturity and development was, had whether a  reluctant or embracing attitude towards adopting the new requirements, depending more on other causes  (like business processes) than their maturity. Unfortunately, the survey could not capture more insights on  this area, future work needing to be done.  8 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  15  3. Appropriate security measures for providers  3.1. Specific objective context  Art. 13a requires NRAs to ensure that providers take the appropriate security measures to protect and  guarantee the integrity and service continuity of their networks. In that regard, ENISA collected feedbacks  regarding the level of satisfaction with the security measures implemented and assessed the resulting  outcomes for providers and NRAs.  3.2. Level of satisfaction with the security measures implementation  It is noted that 45% of the interviewed NRAs are satisfied with the level of security achieved by  implementing new security measures in their respective countries. Telecom service providers share the  same opinion, although some of them adopted an approach that goes beyond the current legal  requirements, with continuous improvement process and more demanding security measures.  Figure 5: NRA satisfaction regarding stronger security measures in the sector  For 45% of the respondents, Art. 13a requirements led to stronger security measures in the sector and the  country. But, the majority of interviewed NRAs think that it is not possible to attribute this improvement  only to the new security regulations. This is reflected by the heterogeneity of the answers, which can be  attributed mostly to the fact that:   The level of implementation differs from one country to another. Art. 13a requirements had an  important impact on harmonizing the level of security measures among countries, as the general  approach was highly different in some cases before the enforcement of the regulation. Although  harmonizing has been achieved at the higher level, the situation still remains fragmented at lower  levels of detail from one country to another.   NRAs do not have sufficient information from the providers to assess the impact of Art. 13a on the  security measures already in place.   Providers’ maturity and the level of security measures vary from one country to another. Thus Art.  13a requirements will impact the level of security measures in a heterogeneous manner, with more  improvement and stronger impact in countries where the providers are less mature and where the  legal framework is weak.  45%  23%  32%  In your opinion, have Article 13a requirements led to stronger security  measures in the sector in your country?  Yes  No  Don't Know  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  16   The variety in size between providers lead to a difference in impact. For instance, Art. 13a  requirements had a much stronger impact on small providers than on large providers. Small  providers experienced an increase in security severity and overhead, while large providers did not  face any particular issue or strong benefits.  Based on opinions expressed, providers, on the other hand, expressed two different. Either (a) they were  already experiencing such level of security measures and did not see any particular changes, resulting in  indifference or neutral opinion, or (b) they were quite satisfied with the level of security measures included  in Art. 13a. The responses of the providers only underlined linear development in the industry, as more  mature operators already had similar measures implemented, whereas the more immature ones had to  invest some resources in adopting the new measures.  3.3. Challenges encountered during the implementation  On average, most of the NRAs faced relatively small challenges with regards to the implementation of the  security measures. The most common were:   37% of the NRA respondents indicated challenges within the process of auditing and following-up  on the security measures, meaning that after implementation of the regulations and the  subsequent security measures, authorities found it difficult to check whether those  measures/requirements were properly implemented.   27% of the NRAs indicated as a medium to big challenge the reluctance of some of the providers in  implementing the new regulations;   over 25% of the respondents mentioned as a medium to big challenge the available budget and the  administrative burdens;   21% indicated as a medium to big challenge the limited value for money as an outcome for the  overall process, meaning that the expected benefits were not as consistent as expected.  It has been mentioned in the interviews that in most cases smaller providers were lacking the appropriate  internal processes and methodology to implement these requirements. On top of that, most of them faced  some operational challenges as they did not have sufficient resources and knowledge about the security  measures to implement them without struggling at some point.  As revealed from the interview, another challenge in the implementation process of the security measures  has to do with the lack of precision in the definition of “critical assets” and other key concepts such as  “appropriate level of security”. Indeed, Art. 13a does not specify or define what is to be considered as a  critical asset leaving the interpretation to NRAs. In order to overcome this challenge, providers and NRAs  consulted the ENISA’s technical guidelines (see Introduction). Based on those some NRAs issued a second  level of legislation as well as other guidelines.  As indicated within the interviews, the activities developed by ENISA within the area of Art. 13a, including  hosting and coordination of the Art. 13a expert group, was perceived as an essential support in easing the  implementation process and supporting NRAs and providers during their transition phase.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  17  Figure 6: Main NRA challenges during the implementation process  3.4. Outcome/benefit analysis of stronger security measures  The implementation of the Art. 13a requirements affected both NRAs and providers, in terms of resources  needed. Even though policy making and implementation is the day-to-day business of most NRAs, they faced  additional costs such as: educational costs (for training the providers on the new regulations), costs for  developing secondary legislation or other guidelines, follow-up and audit on the progress of the  implementation.  Providers faced implementation, maintenance and management costs. In their case, the size of the costs is  largely depending on:   the average level of security measures already implemented in the providers in the country   the flexibility / ability of the providers to comply with the requirements within a short time frame   the complexity of the process for security measures implementation   the level of involvement of the NRA   the availability and allocation of resources (FTEs9) necessary for the implementation process.  Some providers have been advertising security measures and resilience, as a competitive advantage.  Especially in the countries where the level of the security measures was weak, providers emphasized the  quality of their infrastructures, network and connections.  It is difficult to link the improvement of security measures with the evolution of the number of incidents  experienced.

No challenge Small challenge Medium challenge Big challenge  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  18  not necessarily mean that the security measures have worsened. Providers deal with some external risks  that cannot be controlled nor prevented by an increase of the security measures. Such risks mainly include  environmental risks and malicious actions. As such it becomes difficult to measure direct benefits attributed  to Art. 13a.  Nevertheless, according to the consulted parties, Article13a has definitely helped in reducing the risks  related to infrastructure resilience through reporting and learning. That is especially true for the smaller or  less advanced operators, where technical assistance and know-how were needed. For larger operators,  especially in more developed countries, the security measures where already implemented as part of their  corporate strategy.  Figure 7: Areas in which providers improved the most  *based on Art. 13a Technical Guideline on Security Measures  The numbers from the Figure 7 discount the fact that in many areas, NRAs do not have sufficient information  to assess whether Art. 13a brought improvements. For instance, 28% of the surveyed NRAs do not have  information on the improvement level regarding human resources security and 18% don’t know if Art. 13a  positively impacted business continuity management.  Moreover, NRAs estimate that in general, stronger security measures have indeed improved the overall  security in their countries. As shown in Fig. 7, NRAs consider that most of the improvements were done in  the following areas:   incident management (27% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   operations management (18% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   security of systems and facilities (18% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   business continuity management (14% fair amount or a lot of improvement)   governance and risk management (14% fair amount or a lot of improvement)  It is reported that for front-runner providers, when Art. 13a came out, it did not bring strong benefits  compared to the practices already in place.

Security measures positively impacted the quality of the infrastructures and thus of the services  provided, which is the core business of telecom providers.  Regarding the improvements on the assets operated by providers, Fig. 8 expresses the opinion of NRAs on  this matter.  Figure 8: Asset classes most improved by providers  3.5. Areas of further improvement  Suppliers of telecom components have a key role in the resilience of the infrastructures, but are not  included in Art. 13a requirements. In case of a security incident, only the telecom service provider is  responsible while the telecom components suppliers are not part of the legal action/ incident action. Further  assessments in this area are needed, with the involvement of responsible stakeholders, in order to develop  an optimal approach to addressing this issue.  As more than half of the respondents (55%) haven’t indicated that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures in the sector, and 60% of the respondents are not aware of areas where providers have improved  the most, further analyses must be carried out in this area in order to determine next steps to be taken.

Transparency in incident reporting  4.1. Specific objective context  Transparency is achieved through the reporting obligation that falls on providers experiencing incidents and  is driven by the quality of information provided. Transparency is fundamental for the NRAs as they need  correct and relevant information in order to take adequate and proper supervision measures. NRAs also  have a reporting obligation towards ENISA and the European Commission, as information collected at  national level is sent at European level for aggregated analysis. Therefore the more the information is  detailed and transparent, the more the reporting flow is straight forward and the less NRAs request  complementary information, which is time and resource consuming. All in all, transparency is an asset for  providers, NRAs and ENISA as it enables the stakeholders to understand the issues faced in order to take  appropriate actions (by the providers themselves, but also by the NRAs who can assist the providers or  amend the national regulations in place).  In order to promote transparency, NRAs usually issue templates for incident reporting with a list of the  mandatory information and the level of details required. Besides, providers have a specific point of contact  at the responsible NRA to enhance communication and anticipate any need for further information.  4.2. Level of satisfaction regarding the transparency in the incident reporting  On average, NRAs are satisfied with the level of transparency reflected in the incident reports filled by the  providers, meaning that the information quality of the incident reports is satisfying. This part assesses in  more detail the level of satisfaction regarding the level of transparency, based on 3 perspectives:   the provider’s compliance with the expected level of information transparency,   the information quality,   the number of incident reports collected.  4.2.1. Providers’ level of collaboration  Providers’ attitude towards Art. 13a mandatory incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative,  as 68% of the respondent NRAs attest that providers were overall collaborative with the incident reporting  compliance requirements (Fig. 9). Nevertheless NRAs also faced two other distinct behaviors. On the one  hand, most of the providers were neutral or even indifferent (up to 40% of the responses) regarding the new  incident reporting requirements and provided the reports as required as per the defined thresholds. This is  due to the fact that some providers were already using such process at internal level and that Art. 13a did  not bring major changes, constraints or benefits on this point. On the other hand, a minority of providers  (21% of the responses) were reluctant towards the changes imposed by the new incident reporting process.  These providers are mainly from countries were the practices are not as mature as in the most advanced  countries and are, in most cases, small providers. This attitude can be explained by the investments that  providers were asked to do in order to complete the requirements. Such investments can prove to be a real  challenge for smaller providers with limited resources (financial or otherwise).  As an incentive to promoting a more collaborative and transparent approach for providers, 86% of NRA  respondents stated they have issued several guidelines or country level legislation to fill in the lack of  precision in the directive and mitigate the level of reluctance due to the lack of information. As shown by  Fig. 10 below other measures adopted by NRAs to promote transparency are: provide online tools for  incident reporting (59%), issue second level regulation on top of the standard requirements (inform  customers (59%), inform general public on major disruptions (41%)), inform other member states, ENISA or  the public for major disruptions.

Regarding the information quality  77% of the respondent NRAs are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in  their incident reports. Information collected by NRAs mainly follows the ENISA guidelines on incident  reporting. Most relevant pieces of information reported are: numbers of users/connections affected,  duration of the incidents, services affected, assets affected, measures taken etc.  Figure 12: Opinion regarding the information quality  In cases where the information provided is insufficient, usually NRAs contacted the providers to obtain the  complementary information.

Due to this feedback process, the level of the quality of the information  self-maintains itself.  In the special case of emergency services incident or outage, providers are requested to provide more details  and information in their incident reports, increasing transparency requirements for the providers.  4.2.3. Regarding the number of incident reports collected  The number of reports collected by the NRAs is linked to several factors. First and most important is the  level of thresholds that determines whether an incident report is triggered or not. As the directive does not  specify details regarding thresholds or how “significance” should be detailed, the Art. 13a expert group, has  issued a non-binding document to help member states define significant incidents. The ENISA’s Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting establishes absolute and relative thresholds, so that countries in different  sizes in terms of population or providers in different sizes in terms of customers can be covered.  Figure 13: Appropriate numbers of incidents collected  68% of the surveyed NRAs reported that they are receiving reports as per the expected levels, however  one third of the surveyed NRAs do not receive as many reports as expected. One of the reasons could be  that the thresholds are not fine-tuned to the number of incidents, market or provider size; therefore the  reports do not capture as many incidents as expected in the first place. The second reason has to do with  the size of the provider. Outages from small providers do not impact as many users as the larger ones, and  as such thresholds do not trigger incident reporting in their cases. As no additional information was obtained  in this area, this remains still to be further analyzed.  Another challenge addressed by the majority of the interviewed NRAs, is that 90% of the telecom services  providers are SMEs, which represent only 10% of the incident reports received by the NRAs. Given that  smaller providers (SMEs) – usually – do not have enough customers to breach the reporting thresholds, the  vast majority of incident reports come from the large operators (the 10%). Consequently, the number of  incidents reported could represent a distorted view of the status of each country.  27%  68%  5%  Do you get the appropriate number of incident reports by the  providers?

Level of communication  Although according to the surveyed NRAs, all stakeholders are sufficiently informed about the incidents (at  least 50% of all stakeholders are sufficiently informed), some nuances are to be mentioned. After a deeper  look, it appears that if sufficient communication takes place, it is often upon affected users request that  information is disclosed and exclusively to this specific user. Instead of receiving information from providers,  affected users often have to inquire themselves on the experienced incident. In some cases, it also happens  that incident notifications are not published in the media or on the provider’s website, whereas the  thresholds have been reached.  Figure 14: Informing the stakeholders  Communication with affected users is not an obligation triggered by Art. 13a requirements, but can be  requested by the NRA if the disclosure of the breach is in public’s interest.

Challenges  From the interviews conducted, it appeared that the main challenge for providers, in terms of incident  reporting and transparency is to compile a report while the incident handling process is in progress (77% of  the NRAs answered that they require notifications from providers during ongoing incidents). In this case  resources are allocated to the reporting process whereas they could be affected to the resolution of the  incident. The full use of the resources for reaching other providers practices, level and maturity can be  detrimental for the providers which are still in the maturation process. The incident may last longer and  impact the providers’ reputation and finances.

Outcome/Benefits analysis regarding transparency  4.5.1. Costs for the incident reporting from transparency requirements  Based on the graph below, for the majority of the NRAs, transparency requirements as per Art. 13a had a  relatively low cost. The main costs regarding the improvement of transparency are the development of a  new tool to support the providers in their incident reporting process and the creation (in some cases) of a  dedicated team. Indeed 60% of the NRAs had to increase their workforce and faced this issue with a medium  or high cost.  Figure 17: Main costs associated with improving transparency  The burden supported by the providers with regards to the transparency highly depends on whether the  indicators used by the providers are the same as the indicators used by the NRAs to assess the impact of the  incident. When the indicators used are not the same between providers and NRAs, providers have to  generate two reports with different indicators to assess, which is time and resources consuming. As a  consequence, the quality of the report differs from one provider to another.  4.5.2. Benefits of the incident reporting from transparency requirements  Although for more than 60% of the surveyed NRAs, the implementation of an incident reporting process  had greater benefits than costs, the rest (40%) remains quite neutral on the question. It is certain that such  process has been beneficial for the providers and NRAs, but 40% of neutral opinions show that there is still  some space for further improvement.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Educate providers about the need to conduct incidents reporting  Provide guidelines/ secondary  legislation to providers to  report incidents  Develop tools to support  providers in the incidents  reporting process  Gather data from  providers to report to  ENISA  Meet providers on  a regular basis  Meet other NRAs on a  regular basis to discuss incidents  report  Increased FTEs -  dedicated team  Other  What were the main costs for the NRA associated with improving transparency?  No cost  Low cost  Medium cost  High cost  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  27  Figure 18: Costs vs. benefits on implementing Art. 13a incident reporting  Incident reporting and transparency requirements, as requested by NRAs in their incident report templates,  do contribute to the improvement of the information quality and quantity. Such transparency requirements  benefit the NRAs because they have uniform and detailed information about the incidents in order to  generate reports and country level analyses.  4.6. End – user feedback regarding Art. 13a  As part of this survey NRAs were inquired on whether the end-users have expressed any opinion on Art. 13a  and whether there’s any type of communication regarding improvements. The general consensus is that  NRAs do not have feedback from end-users regarding these effects. Most of the public remains unaware  of the initiative, and even if some improvement in the communications has been noticed, it would be  difficult for the NRAs to gather the sentiment, and even more so, to attribute it to Art. 13a – related  procedures (rather than advances of technology for example). Consequently, no feedback has been collected  from the end – user (citizen) perspective.  4.7. Area of further improvement  Providers only officially report incidents to the NRAs but end-users do not have access to such information.  Being business-impact orientated, in opposition to NRAs and ENISA which are more end-users orientated,  some providers do not proactively communicate directly to their customers on the on-going faced incident.  End-users have to either request the information or wait for the yearly report from the NRAs and ENISA to  obtain information on the past incidents. Further developments in this area are needed to add more  transparency to customers and the general public, by periodically informing them about outages, measures  taken etc.  Current thresholds are more likely to trigger an incident report from large providers than from the small  providers, resulting in NRAs receiving more incident reports from large providers than from the small  providers. Consequently, NRAs have an overview only of the incidents that impact large providers. Thus  NRAs should adapt the thresholds to capture incidents experienced also by small providers. However this  option is difficult to implement because it assumes a very delicate fine-tuning of the thresholds in order to  cover incidents affecting smaller providers.  63%  23%  0% 14%  Do you think that the costs of implementing incident  reporting are less than the resulting benefits?

Learning and improving based on reported incidents  5.1. Incident reporting as a tool for learning  The incident reporting process is a tool itself to learn from incidents and to sustain a continuous and dynamic  internal learning process for both providers and NRAs. According to the surveyed NRAs, incident reporting  is used as a tool for learning in many areas, as shown in Fig. 19. Statistical purposes, post incident supervision,  periodic reports, developing guidelines and root causes studies are areas where incident reporting is mostly  used for learning, confirmed by 70% or more of the NRA respondents.  Figure 19: Areas where incident reporting is used for learning  5.2. Outcomes/benefits of the learning process  Incident reporting and the resulting learning process contribute to continuously strengthening and  maintaining providers’ infrastructures. As reflected in the graph below, the notion of the reporting obligation  pushes providers to improve (identified as an important benefit by 77% of the surveyed NRAs), and is an  input for sector wide risk and vulnerability assessment (qualified as “quite important benefit” by 69% of the  surveyed NRAs).  87% of the respondents also stated that the incident reporting process is used as an input for appropriate  policy decision, meaning improving regulations within the sector.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  As a basis for maintaining  statistics  As a basis for post incident supervision  As a basis for publishing  annual/ periodic  reports on reported incidents  As a basis for developing guidelines/ secondary legislation  As a basis for studies on root  causes  As a basis for workshops  with providers  As a basis for sharing  experiences with other  NRAs  As an input for sector wirde  risk and vunerability  As a basis for participating in  the management/ mitigation of the incident  Other  How do you use the incident reports you receive in the learning/ improvement  process?  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  29  Figure 20: Benefits of incident reporting  However incident reporting and a learning process cannot guarantee a drop in the number of incidents,  especially in case of incidents that are due to environmental causes, although they surely contributed to  improving the overall process of addressing different types of incidents.  5.3. Areas of further improvement  In this part, the suggestions made in order to further improve the learning process, as communicated by the  surveyed NRAs and providers, are conflicting. Some NRAs and providers think that sharing more information  regarding the learning and preventive actions taken could help other providers in their own incident solution  process and would bring stronger knowledge to small providers. In addition, cross country collaboration on  incidents and supervision matters for NRAs could be reinforced by more information sharing.  However, this suggestion raises the issue related to confidential information disclosure and a concern from  providers regarding the risk of being penalized for the incident that they have experienced. In addition, such  information sharing may not bring as many benefits as expected to the other providers as the impact and  the corresponding solution may be specific to the infrastructures of the providers. Therefore driven solutions  and lesson learnt may not be compatible from one situation to another or from one provider to the other.  As you may notice NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement but  mostly for compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations (Fig. 19). The percentage of those who use  the results of the process also as an input for sector wide or nationwide risk assessment is rather low.  Considering widening the usage of the results to other areas, related to national security or industry  related risk analysis, could be a further improvement in this area.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Facilitate appropriate  follwo up supervision  Give direction to planned  supervision/ auditing  Can support fast and  appropriate incident  response/ management  Inform the public,  customers and  important functions about the  current situation  Input for providing and maintaining  statistics  The notion of a reporting obligation  pushes providers to  improve  Can provide information back to the  providers on root causes and issues  Input for discussing challenges and issues  with providers and other sectors  Input for illustrating root causes and trends  for appropriate  policy decisions  Input for developing appropriate guidelines/ secondary legislation  Input for thematic  studies on root causes  Input for sharing  experiences with other  NRAs  Input for sector wide  risk and vulnerability assessments  Other  In your opinion, what are the main benefits from incident reporting?

Collaboration between the actors  6.1. Specific objective context  Collaboration is at the very heart of the implementation process, especially when the telecommunications’  market landscape is quite different from one country to another.  A successful implementation at national level is possible only if the NRA and the national providers work  together, helping each other to overcome the challenges. NRAs involvement is all the more important given  that small providers do not have as much experience as the front-runners and may face more difficulties in  the implementation process.  However, such collaboration faces some limits when brought at EU level. Indeed, providers and NRAs are  hesitant in sharing confidential and sensitive data to other stakeholders, even in the context of Art. 13a and  for collaboration and improvement purposes.  6.2. Collaboration during the implementation of Art. 13a requirements  6.2.1. Collaboration between ENISA and NRAs  ENISA’s role has been to support NRAs along the implementation process of the requirements mandated in  Art. 13a, to provide expertise, advice and to promote the exchange of good practices among the member  states. In order to do so, ENISA built a strong relationship and collaborative working environment. As a  matter of fact, 68% of the surveyed NRAs agreed/strongly agreed that ENISA‘s role was beneficial for the  implementation process.

N/A Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  31  ENISA worked closely with the NRAs to provide more detailed information to them as well as the providers  and has issued several guidelines. These guidelines have been helpful for the NRAs to better understand the  requirements of Art. 13a, especially the scope and definitions, and to have a concrete perception of the  threshold levels to set up. Indeed, ENISA’s guidelines provide definition and advice to NRAs and providers  on how to consider the interpretation of the requirements, and were very well received and appreciated  by the community (as stated by 68% by the respondents).  Exchange of information between NRAs is facilitated by the Art. 13a Expert Group meetings, which are  organized on a regular basis, and aim at involving all the EU member states in an open discussion about Art.  13a. This observation includes discussing implementation in detail, sharing knowledge and exchanging  views, in order to achieve a harmonized approach of implementing Art. 13a.  6.2.2. Collaboration between NRAs and providers  As shown by Fig. 22 most of the NRAs indicated some overloading as regards to the implementation  process of Art. 13a, but most of them rarely indicated overloads of more than 25% of the total time of the  responsible personnel involved (FTE). In order to support their domestic telecom service providers,  dedicated personnel within 20% of the NRAs spent half or more than half of their time to issue second level  regulations, guidelines and educate providers. Developing reporting tools for providers was also indicated  as time consuming by less than 20% of the respondent NRAs.  Regarding the collaboration between NRAs and providers, as described in Fig. 23, the majority (77%) stated  that the collaboration lasted for the whole implementation period, and 64% of them declared that the  providers requested additional supporting documentation, as guidelines or advice. Given the level of detail  provided within the directive, we can certainly say that collaboration was more than necessary at this level,  both at European level and at national level.

Collaboration after the implementation of Art. 13a requirements  As regards to the situation after the implementation period of Art. 13a, we can notice from Fig. 24 that  collaboration between NRAs and ENISA was still needed, as by the majority of the respondents. More  specifically guidelines on particular areas were still needed, and the overall activities carried out by ENISA  alone or within the Art. 13 Expert Group are considered beneficial by more than 80% of the respondents.  ENISA continues to hold the Art. 13a Expert Group Meetings with the intent to keep a high level of  collaboration and information exchange between the member states. The Expert Group is also a way for  ENISA to measure the level of harmonization in regards to the member states practices.  The estimated time spent by the NRAs’ FTE dedicated personnel during the implementation phase of Art.  13a (Fig. 22), with the time spent after the implementation (Fig. 25), is more or less the same, highlighting  that Art. 13a has developed to a continuous process within NRAs. Although the implementation process is  complete, providers still need the support of the NRAs, as further improvements to the incident reporting  process are developed periodically and, as statistics show, the number of incidents is increasing. The only  activity that sees its allocated time decreasing is the supplying of guidelines/secondary legislation to  providers, as the market has reached a certain level of maturity within this area.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  Providers were reluctant to implement the requirements  of Article 13a  Providers requested guidelines and advices from the NRA  Collaboration with the providers took place along the whole implementation process  How would you describe the collaboration between  providers and the NRAs during the implementation of Article  13a?  N/A Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  33  Figure 24: Current collaboration NRAs – ENISA after the implementation of Art. 13a  However the need for developed tools and supervision/audit of the providers remains almost the same as  during the implementation process. This is the consequence of a need for a continuous effort in monitoring  the measures implemented for compliance with Art. 13a.  This graph (Fig. 25) confirms that the cross border collaboration between NRAs remains quite limited as  82% of the surveyed NRAs estimate spending less than 10% in exchanging information with NRAs in other  member states impacted by the same type of incident. In addition interviewed NRAs confirmed that they  did not often collaborate or exchange information with other NRAs on a regular basis.  Regarding the supervision and audit of the providers, 63% of the dedicated personnel within NRAs spent up  to 50% of their total time doing this activity. Other time consuming activities are gathering data for reporting  to ENISA, develop tools and meet with providers on a regular basis etc.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Providers are still reluctant to  implement the requirements of  Article 13a  Providers are open to share relevant  information about incidents  Providers request guidelines and  advices from NRAs  Useful and accurate  guidelines were provided by ENISA through the Article 13a Expert Group  On average, the relationship with  ENISA is beneficial for the work within  Article 13a  On average, the collaboration  within the Article 13a Expert Group  is beneficial for your Article 13a  related work  Other  How would you describe the current collaboration between providers, NRAs  and ENISA after the implementation of Article 13a?

Areas of further improvement  The opinions on the possibility and benefits of improving the current level of collaboration differ among  different types of stakeholders.  On the one hand, for some NRAs, it would be useful to collect incident reporting and information from  national providers, which will be anonymized, in order to share this information with the other NRAs, so  their domestic providers have access to other providers’ incident reports, experiences and practices. On the  other hand, some NRAs do not agree with this proposition for several reasons. First, if the incident is a major  incident and has been related in the media, it is always easy to find the identity of the provider. Secondly,  some NRAs state that each incident is specific to a provider, a market structure, the providers’  infrastructures, etc. and that it is not possible to adapt preventive measures from one country to another  where the culture, infrastructures and market structure is not the same. Meanwhile ENISA is trying to  develop, along with the Art. 13a expert group, a provider to provider sharing capability in order to facilitate  this kind of cooperation and, of course, satisfy the majority of requests by member states.  However, providers do share their need for more information exchange on the incidents experienced by  other providers. This information sharing is already in place in some countries, under the NRA’s supervision  and in project in some others. Providers also underline their continuous need for feedback and support from  their NRAs on incident reporting quality and assessment, and a true bi-directional beneficial communication.  Last but not least, collaboration could be improved further, as the different indicators used by NRAs and  providers to measure the impact of an incident are not aligned. If this situation is persistent, it shows that  communication and collaboration are not optimum between NRAs and providers.  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  Draft and provide guidelines/ secondary legislation to providers  Internal educational activities (workshop, training, etc.)  Educate providers about the need to conduct incidents reporting  Meet providers on a regular basis  Develop tools for providers in the incident reporting process  Gather data from providers to report to ENISA  Meet ENISA and other NRAs on a regular basis to discuss the…  Inform/ collaborate with NRAs in other Members States impacted by…  Participate in surveys and in the drafting/ review of ENISA Technical…  Supervising/ auditing the providers  Other  How much time are your NRA's FTEs spending currently on the following  activities related to Article 13a?  above 76% 51% - 75% 26% - 50% 11% - 25% Below 10%  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  35  7. Harmonization of practices within the EU  7.1. Paradox: harmonization at EU level vs fragmentation at country level  7.1.1. Harmonization vs differentiation  In the European Union, directives prevail on national law and bind upon the EU member states as to the  implementation of the requirements, regardless the specificities of the national law. EU member states have  an obligation of transposition into domestic legislation, although they are free to choose the means and the  ways to reach this objective within the given time frame. Lastly, countries are always free to adapt the  requirements on the national level. Differences between countries can include: difference of maturity,  different practices and cultures, etc. For example, some countries issue one or two incident reports annually,  while other countries can issue hundreds.  If the directive sets up minimum standards to be implemented within national legal framework, member  states are free to apply more demanding national measures, as long as they do not conflict with the  requirements of the directive and with the free movement and free market rules. Although this principle  wants to respect countries’ sovereignty, this is a source of differentiation among countries. If the legal  framework is by definition harmonized at EU level, the content of the domestic law is impacted by the  countries specificities and needs. For instance, thresholds that trigger the incident reporting process are  different from one country to another, although the NRAs referred to the ENISA’s Technical Guideline on  Incident Reporting. This guideline and the others aim at providing more details and indications to the NRAs  in order to facilitate the implementation of Art. 13a requirements.  As per the Directive 2009/140/EC, member states were required to conduct a national public consultation  to “give interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period10”  but remain free to take the results more or less into consideration.  In the context of Art. 13a, the transposition of the directive into domestic law has been successfully achieved  by all the member states but one, which is still under progress. Furthermore, the implementation process  has not been completed within the same timeline. For example, some countries implemented Art. 13a  requirements by 2011, while some countries needed an additional time period to complete the process by  2012, 2013 and 2014.  If countries kept their specificities and regulation prerogatives, Art. 13a definitively helped to harmonize the  provider and member states general approach regarding incident reporting.  10 Directive 2009/140/EC, Article 6  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  36  Figure 26: The use of ENISA’s technical guidelines by NRAs  However, if the NRAs do refer to the ENISA technical guidelines, reports and studies, most of them use those  documents as an inspiration or guidance when the European regulations or domestic laws are not clear  enough (on average 30% of the surveyed NRAs use most or all of ENISA’s technical guidelines on incident  reporting and on security measures in their work, and 40% of the NRAs use ENISA’s technical guidelines  on incident reporting and on threats and assets as a source of inspiration in their work). Nevertheless,  ENISA’s technical guidelines are the most important source of harmonization, given the fact that the  Directive does not provide sufficient level of details regarding the scope and thresholds for the incident  reporting process, and also lack of definition of what to consider as an asset.  On the other hand, the frequent meeting groups held by ENISA enabled NRAs to share good practices,  experiences and advices among themselves, resulting in a trend for harmonization of the practices within  the member states. This harmonization is driven indirectly but does not reach every country.  7.1.2. Different approaches in implementing Art. 13a requirements  Most of the countries held a public consultation, according to Article 6 of the Directive 2009/140/EC, before  adopting the new regulations; the NRAs as regulatory authorities are free to take the results of the  consultation into consideration or to follow their own prerogatives. Therefore, the levels of input from the  providers are different from one country to another and impact more or less the domestic legislation.  Furthermore, if the majority of the countries benefit from a second level legislation, some countries do not  have such legal framework and are keener in interpreting the Directive and refer to the guidelines than  countries which have such level of regulation. ENISA’s technical guidelines remain in each situation the main  point of information, although countries did not implement Art. 13a through the same level of regulation  and legal means.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident  Reporting  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Security  Measures  Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Threats and  Assets  Article 13a and Article 4 Technical  Guideline on Security  Measures  ENISA Annual reports on reported incidents  ENISA studies  To what extent are you using Article 13a Technical Guideline and  studies in your national implementation and work?  Hardly/ not at all  Not so much but we refer to it in our work  We get enough inspiration and use a fair amount of it in our work  We use mot/ all of it in our work  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  37  In most cases, countries with a second level legislation are the most advanced countries with regards to their  legal framework and good practices, resulting in different level of efforts required in comparison with  countries that have a very young or immature legal framework. Given that some countries had already a  more mature legal framework in place and a NRA issuing supportive guidelines, there were only limited  efforts to be provided for the implementation of Art. 13a requirements.  Consequently, as the ways and means used to implement Art. 13a requirements differ from one country to  another, the thresholds for incidents reporting defined and implemented in the countries differ. First some  NRAs set up their thresholds based only on ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting, while some  other countries took in consideration the comments collected during the public consultation to adapt the  level of thresholds proposed in the guidelines. Last but not the least, some countries implemented the  thresholds based on the guideline but updated them later to better fit the market specificities, sector  practices and the need to collect more information.  Harmonization of the regulation within the European Union will facilitate the continuous development of a  single EU market. Furthermore, diverging regulatory requirements across EU member states may deter and  hinder effective competition and thus limit the benefits for some customers in specific countries.  Harmonized procedures in terms of incident reporting will also guarantee customers getting access to  information related to interruption of service or other types of incidents. On the other hand, harmonized  security measures and incident reporting processes will enable cross-border providers to realize economies  of scale, as they are already familiar with the incident reporting process, the requirements and then benefit  from synergies in the training materials, tool usage, incident management, lessons learnt on passed incident  in other countries, etc.  For ENISA, a harmonized approach in the incident reporting is necessary to compare, benchmark and assess  the situation within the European Union. Without a common template, indicators and process, the  assessment and benchmark of the incidents would be complicated.  7.2. NRAs level of satisfaction regarding harmonization  Taking into account the mandatory level or harmonization imposed by the directive, the necessary level of  harmonization induced by ENISA’s guidelines and the common specificities noticed at member states level,  90% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the level of harmonization within the EU,  which sustains also national specificities (as shown in Fig. 27).  Figure 27: Appropriate level of harmonization  86%  14%  Do you think that the level of harmonization is appropriate up to  date?  Yes, a harmonized approach allowing for national differences is appropriate  No, more harmonization across the Member States would be preferable  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  38  7.3. Areas of further improvement  The interviews and the online survey revealed that the 82% of the NRAs are currently satisfied with the  level of harmonization, and do not think that an improvement is needed for the member states and the  telecom market.  Figure 28: Ways of carrying harmonization  However, 18% of the surveyed NRAs do think that ENISA could improve the current level of alignment among  the NRAs regarding the secondary level of legislation and supervision methodology. Also, an enhanced level  of alignment would reduce the differences between the countries and enable cross-border service providers  to reduce the current faced costs and barriers.  Nonetheless, improving the level of harmonization might be a challenge as the current achieved result is  already quite satisfying for ENISA also. Besides the more the harmonization level is raised, the more  countries tend to lose their particularities, as created by their internal markets. The risk is that countries  start to be reluctant to the implementation of new and stricter regulations.  On the other hand, it may be more difficult for cross border operators to continue to expand and to grow  with these differences among the countries, regarding the security measures, the security incident reporting  triggering thresholds and the security incident indicators. Complying with all the different legislations  requires considerable much effort and could impact the decision to enter the market and compete with the  already established national providers.  82%  18%  0%  Do you think the way the harmonization has been carried out at EU level  is appropriate?  Yes, the way we work through the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group drafting and agreeing on common technical guidelines and sharing experiences, is appropriate  Yes, but ENISA could push more for aligning the NRAs with each other regarding secondary legislation and supervision methodologies  No, we would prefer the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures for us to follow on an equal basis  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  39  8. Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  8.1. ENISA’s annual incident reports  For four years now, ENISA publishes the annual report about significant disruption/outage incidents in the  EU electronic communications sector, which are reported to ENISA and the European Commission under  Art. 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)11, by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) from all  member states. This annual report covers the incidents that occurred in a year and it gives an aggregated  analysis about severe outages across the EU, keeping details about individual countries or providers  confidential.  As you may notice from the chart below (Fig. 29), the number of incidents reported every year is  continuously increasing, showing year by year, the stakeholder’s maturity in identifying, collecting and  processing more and more incidents. The number of reported incidents has grown along with the number  of reporting countries. Only 51 significant incidents in 2011 reported by 11 countries, and 137 incidents  reported by 25 countries in 2014.  Figure 29: Total incidents reported 2011 - 2014  Looking at the root causes, as shown in the figure below, system failures is one of the main causes that  triggers disruptions in Europe. On a closer look, we will notice that a part of the system failures were actually  third party failures (16% from all incidents in 2014, 11% in 2013), meaning failures caused by other parties  along the supply chain and not the providers that suffered the actual incident. These findings raise other  issues regarding causes of disruption incidents around Europe, and how to address them.  11 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending Directives  2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC  on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services  51  79 90  137  Incidents reported  2011 2012 2013 2014  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140&from=en  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  40  Figure 30: Root causes for reported 2011 - 2014  Supply chain security and responsibility is one of the issues to be taken into consideration in future  developments within the area.  8.2. Areas of further improvement  In agreement with the NRAs in the Art. 13a expert group, at the moment incidents affecting only 4 types of  services are expected to be reported to ENISA:   Fixed telephony   Fixed internet   Mobile telephony   Mobile internet  However, the types of services offered by modern telecommunications providers have developed over the  years (e.g. messaging services, software based voice services). Consequently the range of covered services  within ENISA’s annual report needs to be updated, by adopting the modern services offered by providers.  As third party failures represent an important part of reported incidents, signaling different issues within  this area, further actions need to be considered in the near future. Developing requirements regarding the  supply chain security and responsibility could be a further action to be considered by responsible  stakeholders.  12 6  14  5  12  5  19 20  6 8 6 9  47  76  61 66  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  2011 2012 2013 2014  Natural phenomena Human errors Malicious actions System failures  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  41  9. Key findings and conclusions  Art. 13a gave a new momentum in the telecom industry at European level. By amending the 2002  regulations, the Art. 13a within the Framework Directive of the 2009 Telecom Package, addresses security  and resilience issues for the first time in the EU.  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the new regulations, an impact  evaluation of the new provisions was the proper thing to do. The evaluation has the purpose of assessing  the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, and the effects caused  by this particular regulation within the Telecom Package.  The compendious evaluation we have done within this project has brought to light some important  outcomes that have definitely contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the  telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a European Union which was highly diversified in terms of  security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of uniformity in the approach taken regarding security  of telecommunication services, but more importantly contributed to strengthening the European telecom  infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the  coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped considerably in bringing more  harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among stakeholders (NRAs and  providers).  Despite the obvious positive outcomes that have been expressed by the majority of the respondents, there  are also some areas of further improvement. Clarifying the scope of art. 13a in order to provide clear  information on the types of networks and services that should be covered is one of them, along with  reinforcing cross-border collaboration and also other areas that can contribute to a higher degree of  resilience of European networks and services.  Overall, Art. 13a has contributed to improving the level of security in the telecommunication sector but in a  balanced way as some counties were already in line or even ahead of the requirements and were already  experiencing the expected benefits. By opposition, the less advanced countries and providers experimented  strong benefits and improvement in their security measures and infrastructures resilience in spite of the  costs and efforts provided.  It has been also noted throughout this project that further analyses are needed in order to draw some strong  conclusions on next steps that are needed in this area. The short period of time allocated to this project  along with the complexity of the area, prevented the project team to further analyze additional details and  areas that could also have influenced the result of this evaluation. In this respect, this report will only cover  a set of findings that must be further analyzed in order to propose concrete recommendations and next  steps to be considered by different types of stakeholders. Main findings of the study are the following,  grouped into categories:  The scope of Art. 13a  1. Current lack of precise information within Art. 13a and Telecom Directive, as regards the types of  networks and services that should be covered, has led to some differences among national  implementations within member states. Although, the level of harmonization seem to be  satisfactory, the differences within services covered by member states could represent obstacles in  achieving the overall or specific objectives stated within the Telecom Package. Further assessments  in this area are needed (more details in section 2.1.2. and Annex I) in order to establish possible next  steps.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  42  2. More than half of the respondents (54%) considered that Art. 13a cannot sufficiently and clearly  cover by itself security of electronic communications, but together with Art. 4 in the e-Privacy  Directive.  Appropriate security measures for providers:  1. The majority (45%) of the respondents (NRAs) considered that Art. 13a has led to stronger security  measures within the sector, but further analyses are needed as more than half of them (55%) do not  share this opinion, 23% stating “no” and 32% “don’t know”.  2. Almost 60% of the respondent NRAs are not aware of the areas where the providers have improved  the most, in terms of security measures.  Transparency in incident reporting  1. The approach of the providers towards NRAs as regards the implementation of Art. 13a mandatory  incident reporting regulations was mostly collaborative. Withal the majority of the respondent NRAs  are satisfied with the quality of the information provided by the operators in their incident reports  and declared that they are receiving reports as expected.  2. Bringing more clarity to the incident reporting process, by issuing guidelines and additional  legislation – 73%, was by far the most effective method of improving transparency.  Learning and improving based on reported incidents  1. NRAs mostly use the incident reporting process as a tool in learning/improvement, but mostly for  internal purposes such as compliance, internal statistics and improve regulations. The use of annual  incident statistics as an input for evaluating risk at national or sectorial level is not a common  approach among NRAs (more details in section 5.1. and 5.3).  Collaboration between the actors  1. The establishment and development of Art. 13a expert group, under ENISA coordination, turned out  to be a successful and helpful experience (more details in section 6.3.), as appreciated by 80% of the  respondents. The operation and development of the group should definitely be continued, under  ENISA’s coordination.  2. Bi-directional communication with the population in the incident reporting process is poorly  addressed by both NRAs and providers. Further analyses should be carried in order to determine the  necessity of developing such processes (more details in section 4.3.).  3. The amount of resource employed by NRAs in the cross-border collaboration area appears to be low  (more details in section 6.3.).  Harmonization of practices within the EU  1. Over 80% of the surveyed NRAs declare that they are satisfied with the current level of  harmonization within the EU, which sustains also national specificities, and do not think that an  improvement is needed in present.  2. ENISA’s work, together with Art. 13a expert group, in the area of guidelines and good practices, was  considered useful by up to 70% of the respondent NRAs, as it supported the achievement of a  mature level of harmonization.  Impact evaluation based on reported incidents  1. More and more reported incidents (at ENISA level) are caused by third party failures (more details  in section 8.2.), meaning they are caused by parties out of provider’s direct control, but within the  provider’s supply chain.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU  43  2. The main root cause for incidents at EU level in 2014 and years before, is “system failures”. Further  assessment needs to be done in this area, in order to identify more detailed causes and security  measures that can be adopted.

    "abstract": "As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the Framework Directive 2009/140 including Art. 13a, an impact evaluation of the new article was necessary. The evaluation has the purpose of assessing the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects caused by this particular set of obligations within the Telecom Package. The evaluation focused on 5 key areas, where we tried to identify possible outcomes."

INTRODUCTION  2.1 BACKGROUND  In line with the ENISA’s European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s sixth strategic objective,  “Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges2”, the Agency seeks to improve  the EU’s cybersecurity resilience, by increasing awareness of future threats and  countermeasures amongst its member states and stakeholders. Fulfilling this objective likewise  supports the other 6 strategic objectives as it provides input on future threats and challenges.  Figure 1: ENISA Strategic Objectives  To achieve this goal, ENISA has applied its methodological framework grounded in foresight  research and future studies that was developed in 2021.3 The framework, created in  collaboration with an interdisciplinary expert group that included futurists, sociologists, business  leaders, cybersecurity experts, and others, will now be used in practice to identify threats and  challenges likely to emerge by 20304.  Drawing on the insights of previous ENISA projects and reports including “Looking into the  Crystal Ball5” and “Foresight Challenges,” the framework combines foresight methods with  creative thinking approaches and co-creation/innovation methods; it leverages individual skills,  knowledge, and reasoning in a collaborative setting. The overarching mission of this framework  is to produce insight about the future and to enrich the dialogue between experts with various  professions and backgrounds.  We believe that the key to defending the European Union is to prepare for the future; the future  is made by us all and therefore to imagine it we need the input of a diverse range of people.  Beyond identifying emerging futures, the agency will enable member states and other  stakeholders to improve their cybersecurity based on the findings of the foresight exercise.  2.2 PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE  This study aims to identify and collect information on future cybersecurity threats that could  affect the Union’s infrastructure and services, and its ability to keep European society and  citizens digitally secure. It is our intention to arm ENISA stakeholders with new insights with  which to begin combatting future threats. The outcome generated by this practical application of  2 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  3 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021). The framework can be found on page 33 of the report.  4 (ENISA, Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight On Emerging And Future Cybersecurity Challenges, 2021)  5 (ENISA, Looking into the crystal ball., 2018)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  7  the framework is the identification of 21 cybersecurity threats which may emerge or be  exacerbated by the year 2030.  A secondary objective of this Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity threats 2030  exercise is to demonstrate that the foresight framework outlined in the Foresight Challenges  report from 2021 can be applied in a practical context and to identify areas of opportunity in the  framework to improve the applicability of ENISA’s foresight activities.  Finally, the exercise of threat identification and prioritization serves an internal purpose of  supporting each of ENISA’s strategic objectives by providing relevant focus topic for future  planning.  ENISA’s strategy proposes concrete goals for the Agency in the form of seven strategic  objectives that will set the priorities for European Union Agency for Cybersecurity in the coming  years. The strategic objectives6 are as follows:  1. Empowered and engaged communities across the cybersecurity ecosystem  2. Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  3. Effective cooperation amongst operational actors within the Union in case of massive  cyber incidents  4. Cutting-edge competencies and capabilities in cybersecurity across the Union  5. High level of trust in secure digital solutions  6. Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity challenges  7. Efficient and effective cybersecurity information and knowledge management for  Europe  2.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  Our main target demographic for this project are stakeholders from the cybersecurity domain  including national cybersecurity authorities, national and EU decision makers, experts, and  practitioners. We specifically hope to target operational cybersecurity practitioners and response  teams, using the identified threats and scenarios to build resilience and response arrays.  6 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  8  3. EMERGING  CYBERSECURITY THREATS  FOR 2030  The threats identified and ranked within this report represent a range of topics, many of which  are already relevant today. The outcomes of this exercise illustrate that in 8 years many of  today’s threats will remain pressing but will have shifted in character – increased dependencies  and the democratization and development of new technologies add complexity to our  understanding of threats. Our wish for readers of this report is that they are able to recognize  shifts in the threat landscape and already begin preparations to ensure security and resilience in  the face of morphing threats. In cybersecurity there is limited leeway to postpone actions that  aid in the avoidance and mitigation of future risks; one must continuously anticipate  approaching threats. These additional measures, however, need not come at the cost of  necessary wide-reaching cybersecurity controls such as education, awareness, patching, etc.  Figure 2: Top 10 threats  Methodology  Through a series of workshops and interviews between March and August 2022, with relevant  experts in the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental)  fields, ENISA has identified and ranked 21 threats that will increase in prevalence by 2030.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  9  Figure 3: Foresight Exercise Methodology Overview  The methodology used has four phases. The first, “collaborative exploration,” is a phase of  trend research and information gathering that integrates expert knowledge, feedback, and  validation. The second phase, “group forecast workshops,” gathered groups of experts with  experience in one of the PESTLE dimensions to further discuss, explore, assess, and prioritize  the identified trends.  The third phase, “threat identification”, is based on the threat casting7 methodology for  identifying emerging challenges within the next 10 years. To do so, small groups of  cybersecurity experts are provided a scenario that combines prioritized trends. The scenarios  are an integral part of the work in order to immerse in the future trends, however their  description specific as it may be, does not influence the exploration and identification of threats.  The scenarios merely serve as a medium to convey the content related to threats. The group  explores this scenario by building personas and writing a short imaginative science fiction  essay. The experts then assume an adversarial perspective to explore potential threat actors  and vulnerabilities in the described future. This change in perspective enables the group to  establish adversary motivations and define the possible threats.  The threats identified by the expert participants were then given scores on likelihood, impact,  novelty, and whether the threat has been previously published by ENISA. Novelty is considered  in this project in order to prioritize lesser-known threats.  7 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  10  Further details about the methodology used can be found in Annex A.  Threat Descriptions  Each threat is described below with a focus on the top 10 most highly ranked threats. The threat  actors are four main groups described in ENISA’s 2022 Threat Landscape Report - state-  sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists8.  The described methods refer to ENISA’s current threat taxonomy9. It divides threats into the  following high-level categories: physical attack (deliberate), unintentional damage / loss of  information or IT assets, disaster (natural), failures/malfunctions, outages,  eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, nefarious activity/abuse, and legal.  The focus of this  report is primarily on intentional threats; unintentional threats are considered here as  vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat actor.  Each threat is also linked10 to one or more of the scenarios to indicate the origins of the threat.  The threat description also includes a link to ENISA’s strategic objectives (SO). This linkage  supports the connection between identified threats and ENISA’s ongoing and future initiatives.  ENISA’s sixth strategic objective, foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity challenges, is  relevant for each of the threats but is not included in the threat description as all threats are the  result of a foresight exercise.  Table 1: Scenario-Trend Relationship Diagram  8 (ENISA, Threat Landscape Report, 2022)  9 (ENISA, Threat Taxonomy, 2016)  10 Linking threats to scenarios took place by ENISA during the preparation for the threat identification workshops.

As the market demands quick product release cycles, component-based programming  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  12  will strongly increase11, leading to the reuse of code and the use of open-source code libraries.  While some of these components will be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, the combination of  software, hardware and component-based code will create unmonitored interactions and  interfaces12. This will lead to novel and unforeseen vulnerabilities, creating more opportunities  for malicious actors to compromise the supply chain from the supplier and customer side.  Financial and political motivations of these threat actors can lead to exploitation of software  vulnerabilities, attacks on the configuration of hardware and software, malware injections in  code libraries, as well as phishing attacks. This would lead to global supply chain issues and  can be used by threat actors for political disruptions, financial gains, or espionage.  Adversaries may manipulate these software dependencies and development tools by adding  backdoors to the code components. The easiest method for attackers is the manipulation of  open-source libraries. If focusing more on commercial applications, the attackers can gain initial  access through several techniques, including drive-by compromises or social engineering  attacks. By placing trojans, droppers or rootkits into the software components of the suppliers,  they can later gain network access to their ultimate target which uses the hardware or software  component in their organization. Physical tampering with hardware in their production facilities  are also a possibility. This would require the attackers to have physical access (or at the very  least physical proximity) to the hardware component production facility. The attackers would  infiltrate the facilities legitimately by having an insider working at the facilities who would be in  an ideal position to tamper with the hardware for the purpose of data or system compromise.  Once compromised (leaving no trace) a state actor will purchase the manipulated hardware or  software, install it across the country, and open themselves up to a very widespread attack.  Another case can be the compromise of a widely used private company with access to sensitive  data, as seen in the SolarWinds incident13.  Threat #1 - Score 25  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored groups,  criminal organizations  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 2, 4  Probable Methods  Sabotage, Theft, Network  Reconnaissance, Malicious  code, Abuse of Information  Leakage  Topics for future SPD  Transparency in critical  infrastructure supply chain (2nd  and 3rd level), CE Certification  schemes, CVD, Awareness  raising and education, software  bill of materials / Chain of trust  Probable Impacts  Disruption, Malfunction, Data  Loss, Data Leakage  Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO5, SO7  Supply chain compromises are very relevant for EU policies  that cross nations and sectors (SO2). The sheer scale of  supply chain attacks also demands effective operational  cooperation in the event of an incident (SO3). These threats  are in direct opposition to ENISA’s SO5 – high level of trust in  secure digital solutions. Finally, comprehensive knowledge  management and education on potential supply chain attacks  is necessary to mitigate the threat (SO7).  Example: State-sponsored actors insert a backdoor  in a well-known and popular open-source library on  online code repository. They use this to infiltrate  information from most major European corporations  and use the information to blackmail leaders,  espionage, or otherwise initiate disruptions across the  EU.  11 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  12 (Jubb, 2022)  13 (Newman, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  13  3.2 ADVANCED DISINFORMATION / INFLUENCE OPERATIONS (IO)  CAMPAIGNS - #2  In 2030, non-state actors like criminal groups, hackers-for-hire as well as government actors will  likely have the technological capabilities (e.g., deepfakes) to expand their disinformation efforts  in the EU to manipulate communities. While the application of deepfake technology allows for  illicit financial enrichment of criminal groups or individuals, the primary motivation for  disinformation campaigns through faked identities is (geo)political and will likely be  predominantly performed by state actors and other politically motivated actors.  Data sources are now immeasurable; adversaries can train their AI for deepfake attacks14 with a  wide range of publicly available videos, pictures, and voice recordings of individuals (even those  not in the public sphere). Biometric facial images are particularly vulnerable to morphing attacks  in which the threat actor can, to a high degree of accuracy, impersonate their target. Deepfake  technology can also create unreal faces that the human eye is unable to differentiate from real  faces. Therefore, adversaries can create realistic avatars that go beyond the current social  media15 bots that already have elaborate profiles. The bots of the future that can influence  elections and public trust also share videos of themselves on social media to participate visibly  in the debate. Disinformation campaigns could be further reinforced with AI text or voice  analysis to provide personalized responses to individuals.  Threat #2 - Score 20  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored groups, criminal  organizations, hackitvists  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 2, 5  Probable Methods  Fraud, Unauthorized access,  Session Hijacking, Identity Theft,  Abuse of Personal Data  Topics for future SPD  Advanced awareness  activities, deepfake  identification research,  authentication best practices  Probable Impacts  Distrust, disinformation, financial  damage Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO4  EU policies need to be prepared to address disinformation  (especially when powered by deepfakes and digital IDs)  (SO2). Because these attacks will be difficult to detect, it is  paramount that cross-border mitigations and incident  response be enabled (SO3). These attacks will test the  capabilities of EU Member States – from non-experts to  highly-skilled professionals (SO4).  Example: A state-sponsored actor may impersonate a  political rival by using deepfakes and spoofing the  candidate’s digital identity, significantly impacting  election results.  3.3 RISE OF DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITARIANISM /  LOSS OF PRIVACY - #3  Criminals are increasingly being identified through technologies like location tracking, public  cameras, and facial recognition16. In the future, this may encourage states, and likewise private  actors, to vastly expand the use of these technologies. Through technologies like facial  recognition in the public sphere, increased digital surveillance on internet platforms, or the  adoption of digital identities, European individual freedoms may be curtailed for the sake of  safety and security. Access to this data will enable and encourage law enforcement agencies  and other government entities to track potential suspects. These data stores may also become  a huge target for criminal groups who are able to sell data online for individuals based on just a  photo. The private sector also plays an important role – especially when major facial recognition  technologies or content platforms are dominated by a single market leader. Single providers  14 (Shein, 2022)  15 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  16 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  14  who provide facial recognition technology or content platforms will be targeted for the troves of  consolidated voice and image data available. Furthermore, the actions of private corporations  may not always align with data protection and security requirements.  Governments (including law enforcement) and private enterprises as part of public-private  partnerships can, within their legal boundaries, legitimately collect personal data - including  biometric data. This creates challenges17 for privacy regulators and the public to make sure the  laws that protect their privacy are enforced. Additionally, it requires all entities collecting this  data to have the necessary defence mechanisms in place. Once adversaries gain access to the  network, they can engage in automated collection of data, potentially including a command and  scripting interpreter as well as APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load  (ETL) services in cloud environments. One use case would include an abuse of the collected  data by law enforcement or online vigilante communities to track down potential criminals.

Example:  An authoritarian leader uses their power to  retrieve databases of information about individuals who  have visited their country – from both public and private  entities. They track all those who participated in anti- government protests, put them on a watch list, and  subsequently are able to manipulate those individuals’  access to national services like voting, visits to their  healthcare providers, or access to other online services.  3.4 HUMAN ERROR AND EXPLOITED LEGACY SYSTEMS WITHIN  CYBER-PHYSICAL ECOSYSTEMS - #4  In 2030, IoT permeates large parts of transport, power and water grids, and industrial  infrastructure to increase efficiency and improve intelligent decision-making. Furthermore, we  will see a significant increase in the number of smart devices the average user has associated  to them (as of 2021, the average person had seven smart devices).18 Because of this, it may  become exceedingly difficult to maintain and manage all devices, especially from a security  perspective. Additionally, the manufacturers of the smart devices will likely be unsuccessful on  educating end-users of the need for device maintenance. The fast adoption of IoT and the  ongoing skill shortage will lead to a lack of knowledge, training and understanding of the cyber-  physical ecosystem by 2030, leading to IT and OT security maintenance issues arising from the  misconfiguration, delayed maintenance, and inadequate end-of-life support of discontinued IoT  software. In addition to these issues, threat actors may deploy intelligent attacks using  techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which may dramatically reduce the  detection rate of cyberattacks. One example of the use of GAN would be to target servers  distributing patches in order to disrupt scheduled updates19. Because of the criticality of the  17 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021)  18 (BSI-Magazin, 2021)  19 (Shi, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  15  devices, this can create a systemic risk, leading to outages, damage as well as the interception  of data between the devices.  On the end user side, IoT devices are often managed by mobile devices running on iOS or  Android. The end-users communicate through their mobile applications with the smart devices  that are part of their home, transport or other surrounding. Adversaries can try to get initial  access to the mobile devices by biometric spoofing, brute force attacks, or exploiting  vulnerabilities on the device. Once they have access to the phone and the legitimate  communication channels between the end-user phone and the infrastructure, they can tamper  with the smart devices, laterally move to the network or get access to the account that manages  the smart devices.20 In an industrial ecosystem, adversaries could get initial access through  employees by social engineering attack or through their endpoints, move laterally within the  corporate network and look for internet accessible devices that are connected to the industrial  control systems. Additionally, attacks could succeed through transient cyber assets that are  deployed with an insecure configuration – including those from third party suppliers and  partners.  Threat #4 - Score 18  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored groups, cyber  criminals, hacktivists  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 3, 4  Probable Methods  Tampering, Failure of  Communication links, Denial of  Service, Malicious activity,  Manipulation of Information,  Targeted Attacks, Brute force,  Unauthorized Physical Access  Topics for future SPD  Guidelines for securing the  IOT21, Certification Schemes,  Secure communication  standards, guidelines for  secure storage of data, *  Processes related to security- by-design, Software bill of  materials  / Chain of trust,  Economical value of cyber- attacks and cyber security  Probable Impacts  Malfunction, Failures and Outages,  Physical Damage Relevant strategic objectives: SO3, SO4  Incidents involving legacy equipment typically impact  cross-border critical infrastructure (SO3.) More expertise  and experience in securing a range of products and  retrofitting legacy systems requires additional education  and research into these fields (SO4).  Example: Manuals for all legacy OT equipment are  available online and studied primarily by state-sponsored  groups. Once a vulnerability is found, they target user  devices or other IoT products used at the plant. Cyber  criminals begin a new form of ransomware in which they  bring down important infrastructure and demand  payment – given that the operator likely lacks the  resources to solve the issue themselves.  3.5 TARGETED ATTACKS (E.G. RANSOMWARE) ENHANCED BY SMART  DEVICE DATA - #5  In 2030, the collection of behavioural data will have exponentially increased. The use of smart  devices in our daily lives will significantly increased; data from all aspects of life will be collected,  leading to an accurate and unique behavioural profile of each user. Collected data may include  (among other sources) health data in from wearables and medical equipment, or IoT devices in  Smart Homes that collect information of behaviour at home, movement data, or behaviour  across online platforms. As the smart devices will often be insecure due to the unwieldy  20 (SOCRadar, 2022)  21 (ENISA, Guidelines for Securing IOT, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  16  amounts of devices and lack of end user awareness, this data is at danger of being exploited22.  Intelligent edge devices are already difficult to protect from manipulation and eavesdropping.  Criminal groups will try to get access to troves of data to tailor social engineering attacks based  on the behaviour profile of the user. The level of sophistication of these social engineering  attacks will challenge end users, law enforcement and governments alike to find new ways to  prevent social engineering and improve authentication.  Attackers may obtain initial access through internet-connected smart devices that are  unpatched, or still running default settings. Criminals and hackers-for-hire23 will gather victim  identity information, credentials, and contact information to gain initial access and then move  laterally within the network to access more sensitive information. The attackers will use  automated data collection and infiltration, correlate and interpret the data to create the  behavioural profile of their victim. Adversaries will use persistence techniques to maintain their  foothold. With the behavioural profile, they will try to get access to financial assets, use the  profile to spoof high-profile individuals within the victim’s network or sell the collected data on  the black market.

Example: Cybercriminals may use the increased  amount of available data from smart devices and  analyze it with AI to create behavioral models of their  victims for spear phishing campaigns or stalking.  3.6 LACK OF ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF SPACE-BASED  INFRASTRUCTURE AND OBJECTS - #6  The early 2010s and 2020s have started a new era of space travel, with private companies  joining governments in the pursuit to explore our universe. By 2030, the space sector will likely  transform even more with more investments of private actors, partnerships between private  companies and governments, and increased geopolitical and commercial competition in space.  The fast growth of this sector will enable many key services. Despite the advances made in  recent years, the sector is still emerging as a focus topic for the security community.  From a security perspective, there is a lack of understanding, analysis and control of space-  based infrastructure. Without a broader EU-wide focus, building up a strong defence of space  infrastructure may be too slow (e.g. R&D projects that take time to be planned and budgeted  for.) This also means that there may be a lack of timely preparation for the identification and  22 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  23 (ENISA, Threat Landscape Report, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  17  exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities24 (zero-days) – if the resources are not appropriately  allocated. Markets incentivise private companies to execute and innovate faster, and to lower  cost at the expense of cybersecurity. Private companies may try to use this to sabotage their  rivals; governments may try to exploit vulnerabilities to create a competitive geopolitical  advantage in space; and criminal groups will use the vulnerabilities to extort companies for  financial gains and to create havoc.  Because of the intersections between private and public infrastructure in space, attackers can  gain initial access to space-based infrastructure by either targeting the private actors,  government agencies or the individuals interacting with the infrastructure. As governments and  societies largely depend on satellites (e.g. GPS), state-sponsored attackers and Hackers-for-  Hire will try to get initial access to hardware through supply-chain attacks and use techniques to  maintain their presence within the space infrastructure – including base stations. 25Base stations  are transceivers that connect satellites to a central terrestrial hub that connects the satellite to a  network. They are a key element that attackers will target with denial-of-service attacks to  disrupt critical military and civilian systems. Attackers will use available techniques to evade  defence and detection mechanisms but remain dormant until they execute their exploit  strategically, e.g. during a conflict as a mean for hybrid-warfare. The introduction of space-  based weapons may shift the geopolitical paradigm.

Example: State-sponsored attackers access space  infrastructure, build up their capabilities and knowledge  of the technology, and secure their presence to execute  attacks. Their aim may be to create infrastructure  malfunctions as a statecraft tool to sabotage other  governments during geopolitical conflicts.  3.7 RISE OF ADVANCED HYBRID THREATS - #7  By 2030, cyberattacks will become more sophisticated and will be matched with physical or  offline attacks. Attack methods are constantly evolving and are often combined – in sequence  and in parallel – to reach their goals. These hybrid operations are more difficult to detect and  defend against due to their complexity and the tendency to treat each attack individually. With a  new modus operandi, detection tools need greater correlation capabilities including connecting  seemingly unrelated events. They therefore pose a growing challenge for governments,  companies, and citizens alike. In the past, hybrid attacks were primarily executed by state  actors as a combination of traditional and cyber warfare. In 2030, hybrid threats have evolved to  24 (Erwin, 2022) (Forum, 2022)  25 (Tim Starks, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  18  apply new technologies and combine different types of exploit mechanisms in order to evade  existing response systems.  For example, attackers will also increasingly use artificial intelligence and deep learning to  combine their capabilities26 to create new, unforeseen modus operandi. Attackers will use a  simultaneous combination of techniques to gain initial access, including the collection of big  data to tailor their spear phishing campaigns, machine learning to interpret the data, develop  new tools to evade defence mechanisms and combine the physical and the virtual to execute  their attacks. With the increase of smart devices, cloud usage, more online identities and social  platforms, as well as digital IDs issued by governments, attackers will have a variety of new  realms to use and combine to create creative attack vectors.

This increase  in hybrid attacks with new technologies requires cutting- edge capabilities (SO4) and knowledge (SO7.)  Example: Hackers are hired by a corporation to  investigate the new technology being developed by a  competitor. In their quest, they are able to retrieve  metadata, view code, and set up a machine learning  algorithm that continuously collect changes to the code  and then continuously accesses user account to prevent  monitoring systems from recognizing that the attacker is  in the network. In parallel they obfuscate the activity by  spreading fake news about insider trading and industrial  espionage from a third competitor by dropping fake  evidence of physical intrusion.  3.8 SKILL SHORTAGES #8  In 2022, the skill shortage27 contributes to most security breaches, severely impacting  businesses, governments, and citizens. By 2030, the skill shortage problem will not have been  solved. While the growth of unfilled cybersecurity jobs has levelled off, the skill shortage28 will  continue to pose a significant risk to society and governments. One relevant factor that will  impact the threat in 2030 is organizational willingness (and resources) to expand staff and  develop talents. The implementation of cybersecurity features will also suffer due to lack of skills  and overall maturity of cybersecurity features, even if the willingness is there.  As technology integrates more and more into our lives, average citizens may become apathetic  - all their communications and actions are managed somewhere else, over which they have no  26 (Shein, 2022)  27 (Fortinet, 2022)  28 (Hurst, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  19  control. This risk will be compounded by the interaction between new technologies and legacy  technology for which the workforce has not been trained – knowledge of legacy technologies is  not being passed on quickly enough to manage the risk in 2030. On top of the legacy skill  shortage, new technologies like smart devices, artificial intelligence, space-based infrastructure  or quantum computing will pose new cybersecurity challenges. Criminal groups will target  organizations, institutions, and companies that have a large amount of unfilled cybersecurity  jobs to find vulnerabilities and exploit these vulnerabilities for financial gain.  Threat actors will analyse organizational skillsets and deficiencies to gain insight into  weaknesses in defence, potential vulnerabilities, and opportunities to exploit their systems and  networks. Public job advertisements often give detailed information as to which skillsets are  currently lacking within a company or a government agency, giving the attackers insights into  possible entry vectors. In addition, attackers will try to gain open- and closed-source information  to gather organizational and network information to spot legacy systems with known  vulnerabilities. For example, a job posting from a local power plant may share the vendor and  product type for which they need support- this provides threat actors with ample time to  investigate product-specific vulnerabilities. Also, in the development of new technologies, the  employees qualified to implement security do not have enough bandwidth to apply security  before go-to-market due to lack of overall skilled workers.

This includes with regard  to policies (SO2), incident response (SO3), and tangible  capabilities and competencies (SO4).  Example: The skill shortage leads to an increase of  online job advertisements that tell attackers the  technologies that each organization is using and the  approximate number of empty positions. A state-  sponsored actor may use this to their advantage as a  part of a larger campaign to tamper with critical  infrastructure in another country.  3.9 CROSS-BORDER ICT SERVICE PROVIDERS AS A SINGLE POINT OF  FAILURE #9  In 2030, technological interconnectedness will be strengthened. The physical-cyber border will  be further blurred as infrastructure sectors such as transport, healthcare, electric grids and  industry29 are increasingly reliant on ICT service providers to connect to the internet and to  manage all inter-device communications. Even though their responsibility for upholding a  functioning society was significant back in 2022, their importance grows even more by 2030.  ICT service providers and their infrastructure – including satellite technology – are the backbone  of society and therefore may be a single point of failure. Smart cities are an example of how  even more critical operational networks will be in 10 years. Hence, these service providers will  likely be targeted by governments, terrorists and criminal groups. Exploiting vulnerabilities in  29 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  20  their infrastructure, using hybrid attacks to get access to their networks, endpoints, data centres  or other physical components of the ICT infrastructure could cripple cities and whole regions.  Foreign governments may try to use this to destabilize nations, terrorists to fuel fears and  achieve political goals, and criminal groups to hold cities hostage.  ICT infrastructure30 is likely to be weaponized during a future conflict. ICT providers will have to  defend against state-sponsored, persistent and highly developed attacks that draw on insights  from governmental intelligence agencies and offensive cyber capabilities. The resources that  would be dedicated to such an attack are significant – attackers would take time to evade  traditional response functions and will likely deploy hybrid attacks for initial access and newly  developed exploits with command-and-control capabilities. Because the ICT sector connects so  many critical services, it will be targeted by techniques like backdoors, physical manipulation,  and denials of service due to the scale of damages that can be achieved.  Threat #10 - Score 13  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored actors, Hackers- for-hire  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 2  Probable Methods  Fraud, Theft, Corruption, Terrorist  Attack, Network Traffic  Manipulation, Manipulation of  Hardware or Software, Abuse of  Authorizations  Topics for future SPD  How to best implement  oversight for non-EU entities,  How to enforce what is  proposed – importance of EU  market (example GDPR),  Economical value of cyber- attacks and cyber security,  Transparency in critical  infrastructure supply chain  (2nd and 3rd level)  Probable Impacts  Outages, Damage/Loss,  Unavailable Critical Infrastructure Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO5  While cybersecurity policies help to prevent cross-sector  incidents (SO2), operational support will be necessary in  the event of an incident (SO3). Trust in critical  infrastructure providers is essential (SO5).  Example: A state-sponsored actor aims to temporarily  cripple a region during an active conflict by installing  malware that disrupts all critical functions of the ICT  provider. Without operational cities, roadways, and  communication channels, the region is essentially  crippled without the ability for civilians to go about their  daily lives and the responsible parties limited in their  ability to maintain defense monitoring systems and to  collaborate to develop response options and methods  for bringing the necessary systems back online.  3.10 ABUSE OF AI - #10  AI can be manipulated from its inception and throughout its lifecycle through training  manipulation and adversarial attacks31 (among others). Unconscious bias in AI is a well-known  concern in the early 20s, however in 2030 there is a real threat of intentional manipulating AI  algorithms and training data. Likewise, any corrupted training of AI algorithms may train them to  make incorrect decisions with respect to the high-risk sectors (defined by the European  Commission32).  30 (Allianz, 2016)  31 (West, 2017)  32 (Commission, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  21  Threat actors will try to leverage the power of AI applications to shape the decision-making  outcomes and to gather information on potential victims. For example, they may tamper with  training data sets to create dysfunctional and harmful AI applications – this may include crowd  sourced data projects. AI can be used to sift through the mass amounts of data about  individuals to correlate data points about them - the presence of this capability may lead to an  increase in stalkerware. Further, attackers may use AI for offensive or criminal purposes – such  as analysing user behaviour to create highly developed spear phishing or hybrid campaigns.  AI can be used to enhance many nefarious activities such as: creation of disinformation and  fake content, bias exploitation, collecting biometrics and other sensitive data, military robots,  data poisoning, etc.  Threat #10 - Score 12  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored actors, cyber  criminals, hackers-for-hire  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 3, 5  Probable Methods  Spoofing, Denial of Service,  Malicious code, Unauthorized  Access, Targeted Attacks, Misuse  of Information, Man in the Middle  Attack  Topics for future SPD  AI security best practices,  guidelines for secure  software, AI regulation,  certification schemes,  Detection of training data  manipulation  Probable Impacts  Biased decision-making, privacy  violations  Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO5  The inclusion of AI topics in cybersecurity policies (SO2),  rapid operational support (SO3), and trusted certification  schemas (SO5) will help to reduce the risk of AI-related  threats.  Example: A state-sponsored actor wants to sow discord  in a population before an election and manipulates the  learning data of a law enforcement algorithm to target  specific populations, causing widespread protests and  violence. They are also able to deduct information about  the political opponents themselves by using an AI  analysis of the individuals’ whereabouts, health history,  and voting history – the correlation of such personal data  will likely only be feasible with the use of AI tools.  3.11  ADDITIONAL THREATS  The following threats were included on the final prioritized threat list but based on the ranking  system were not in the top 10.  Table 3: 2030 Top threats continued  # Threat Name Threat Description  11  Increased digital currency-enabled  cybercrime  By 2030, digital currency-enabled cybercrime will increase rapidly.  Cryptocurrencies, and the broad market adoption of them, already  have enabled organized crime to expand their reach. Because digital  currencies will be very commonly used as an investment asset and  means of payment in European markets, organized crime may be able  to expand their targets. This means that cybercrime groups offering  professional services (cyber-attacks) will be better funded because of  an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of their efforts.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  22  12  Exploitation of e-health (and  genetic) data  The amount of genetic and health data increases tremendously by  2030 and is in the hands of many stakeholders in the public and private  sectors. Vulnerabilities in e-health devices and databases containing  very sensitive and/or genetic information may be exploited or used by  criminals to target individuals or by governments to control populations,  e.g., using diseases and genetic diversity as a reason for  discriminating against individuals. Genetic data may further be abused  to aid law enforcement activities like predictive policing or to support a  more regimented social credit system.  13  Tampering with deepfake  verification software supply chain  By 2030, deepfake technology will be widely used. It may be used as a  form of harassment, evidence tampering, and provoking social unrest.  Although there will likely be a rapid influx of verification software that  analyses videos and voice to verify the identity of individuals33, the  urgent market demand leads to programmers cutting corners. This  software will be highly targeted by anyone wishing to use deepfakes for  illegal or unethical purposes.  14 Attacks using quantum computing  In 2030 quantum computing resources will be made more widely  available, allowing threat actors to use quantum computing to attack  existing deployments of public key cryptography. Likewise, there is a  risk that threat actors collect sensitive encrypted data now, aiming to  decrypt it once quantum computing is accessible. This is especially  relevant for current digital IDs that use asymmetric cryptography to  authenticate.34  15  Exploitation of unpatched35 and  out-of-date systems within the  overwhelmed cross-sector tech  ecosystem  Everything-as-a-service leads to a multitude of tools and services that  require frequent updates and maintenance by both consumers and  providers. This combined with the skill shortage presents a difficult to  manage surface of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat  actors. Furthermore, the complexity of the supply chain fosters  confusion on where responsibilities for security lie. For governments,  this creates more backdoors for espionage while cyber-criminals can  exploit the unpatched and outdated services for financial gains. This is  especially true when critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private  sector or when national security data is reliant on singular private  entities.  16  AI disrupting/enhancing cyber  attacks  Escalation as a result of AI-based tools. Attackers will use AI-based  technologies to launch attacks. In order to defend against those attacks  and even to launch counter measures, there must also be defensive  AI-based weapons. Behaviour of the AI in these cases is difficult to  test, measure and control – if speed of response is valued.  17  Malware insertion to disrupt food  production supply chain  Due to increased automatization and digitalization of food production,  food supply chains36 can be disrupted by a range of threat actors with  medium-high resources. Denial of service attacks on packaging plants,  for example, can prevent continued food operations; processed food  manufacturing tools may be manipulated to change the compounds in  the food itself. Attacks like these can lead to a food shortage, economic  disruptions, and in the worst case, poisoning.  33 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  34 (Smart, 2021)  35 (Micro, 2019)  36 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  23  18  Technological incompatibility of  blockchain technologies  Until 2030, several regionally based blockchain technologies are  created by different groups of governments to create an international  \"gold standard\". This is driven by a societal lack of trust in blockchain  that has accumulated over the last years.  Each technology group aims  to gain a competitive advantage. This gives rise to a period of  technological incompatibility of blockchain technology which leads to  failures, malfunctions, data loss and the exploitation of vulnerabilities at  the interfaces of the different blockchains. This creates challenges for  ecosystem management and data protection, furthers distrust, and  negatively affects trade and GDP growth.  19 Disruptions in public blockchains  Blockchain has been implemented in nearly all aspects of society in  203037. Unfortunately, security expertise in the area of blockchain did  not advance significantly, creating a slew of vulnerabilities that may be  exploited in the future. Locally unavailable blockchain technology will,  for example, prevent access to voting, legal transactions, and even  security systems. Another possible attack vector is exploited by  partitioning the bitcoin network by hijacking IP address prefixes. This  can cause, for example, duplicated spending and thus economic  damage.  20  Physical impact of  natural/environmental disruptions  on critical digital infrastructure  The increased severity and frequency of environmental disasters  causes several regional outages. Redundant back-up sites that  maintain the availability of critical infrastructure will also be affected.  21  Manipulation of systems  necessary for emergency  response  Manipulation of sensors with connections to emergency services may  overload services like ambulances, police, firefighters, etc. For  example, call centres may be overloaded with inauthentic calls or fire  alarms may be manipulated to injure specific individuals or to obscure  emergency response teams' ability to locate the issue. Similarly, mass  panics that overload emergency systems may also be provoked  through the use of social media.  37 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  24  4. 2030 TRENDS  To identify the threats, the project team initiated an in-depth research project on future trends as  a first step. Based on this research, the team created a long list of trends that was then  narrowed down, discussed and analysed in individual PESTLE-themed (political, economic,  social, technological, environmental, and legal) workshops by a diverse expert group38. As  following step, the threats named in the previous chapter were identified by cybersecurity  experts based on an examination of possible futures as derived from current and possible future  trends (in the form of science fiction prototypes and scenarios).  Below is an overview of the prioritized trends, color-coded based on their scores on impact and  likelihood (on a scale of 1-5). To simplify the image, the trends are rated based on a  combination (impact x likelihood) of the experts’ evaluations and have been assigned a  prioritization of “high, moderate or low”. The further inward the trends are positioned, the more  interconnected they are. For additional information on the connection between trends see figure  5.  Figure 4: PESTLE Trend Radar  Foresight is a multifaceted tool through which targeted collective wisdom can be collected and  through which a lot of insightful secondary data can be extracted. As participants evaluated  potential trends, the conversations also shifted towards relationships between the trends. These  references and relationships are visualized in the following graphic.  38 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  25  Figure 5: Interaction between trends  This image shows the connections that the experts made between the different trends during  the workshops. The trend names within the PESTLE39 dimensions have been translated into  trend IDs to simplify the image. The trend IDs shown in Figure 5 (above) can be found in the  section below.  In some cases, the relationship of one trend to other trends led to clustering, so new trend  labels were formulated to cover all the trends within them. In other cases, the trends were  considered separately and commonalities between the trends were identified. These similarities  are illustrated in this visualization by the gray connecting lines. Particularly salient links between  trends are connected by a red line. As described earlier, participants rated the trends according  to their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence - those that were rated particularly  highly are outlined in red.  4.1 PRIORITIZED TRENDS  This section documents the key trends from each PESTLE dimension. The trends listed below  were the trends that received the highest likelihood and greatest impact ratings during the  workshops. Note that each trend may fall into more than one category, but it is listed based on  the expert working group that ranked it as a priority.  These trends are developments to watch in the next 8 years as they impact cybersecurity  threats.  They were however, not selected based on their ability to impact cybersecurity but  rather on their impact on society as a whole.  39 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  26  P1 The increasing geopolitical influence of ICT providers  Big communication and technology companies have massively expanded their power in recent decades and are increasingly  gaining political power (Taddeo, 2017), which also affects other environments like the economy and society. This increasing  power amplifies the geopolitical power of communication providers and puts their geopolitical relevance in a new light.  Other categories: Economic  P2 Increased political power of non-state actors  Increasing global interconnectedness will continue to foster interactions between non-state actors beyond the state's  capacity to control them, thus challenging traditional governance in multiple ways. The growing role of non-state actors is  changing the political environment, influencing economy, society and more. The influence of social movements such as  climate marches has increased, affecting political outcomes. New non-state actors such as digital communities, institutions  and social media platforms are gaining power and influencing all levels of governance.  Other categories: Economic, Social  P3 The increasing relevance of (cyber) security in elections  With increasing digitization and the use of information and communication technology, there are new influencing factors that  can affect election ecosystems. Today's voting ecosystems encompass more than traditional paper-based processes. With  new technologies, electoral ecosystems (Petrov, 2018) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity gaps as they  offer attackers a larger attack surface. Not only the core electoral systems could be a target, but also election administrators  and entities related to the election campaign itself such as political parties, news organizations, social media platforms, email  platforms and donor groups are potential targets.  Other categories: Technological, Social  P4 The public health issues arising from the mental health problems of victims of cybersecurity  With the increase of our data on the Internet and the increasing need to use online platforms and digital services, a state of  exhaustion in the population could occur due to emerging cyber security gaps. Increasing cybersecurity challenges will lead  to greater vulnerability of the general population, resulting in increasing public health risk from cybersecurity.

Attackers are increasingly demonstrating high skillsets and a robust  understanding of operational technology and industrial control systems engineering and conduct more and more attacks that  gain access and negatively impact operations and human safety.  Other categories: Technological, Legal  P6 Increased technological dependency of governments on private sector technology companies  With the current pandemic and ongoing digital transformation, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on private  sector technology companies, their products and services. As the power of tech companies increases, some tech companies  have more power than some national states. Increasing interdependence between government and companies makes it  more difficult to control and identify separations, leading to increased dependence on the private sector, and in many cases  single entities within the private sector.  Other categories: Legal, Economic  P7 COVID speeds up digitalization in public sector  In times of a pandemic, when chains of infection have to be traced and everyday processes have to be digitized, the digital  transformation of the public sector is accelerating rapidly (ENISA, Raising Awareness of Cyber Security, 2020). The  coronavirus pandemic is forcing local governments to offer services online. In addition, e-government technologies such as  digital registration offices are replacing human interaction between citizens and government officials with technology.  Other categories: Technological, Social  P8 The increasing digital dependencies and cyber vulnerability of populations  The population increasingly uses technology to manage everything from public services and business processes to private  matters and becomes highly dependent on it. Many operations and processes can no longer be managed without technology  today and therefore make technology indispensable for the population. The increasing use of digital services and products  leads to more personal data that is exposed on the Internet. This reliance on technology on one side and the provision of  information on the other side poses a threat and makes the population more vulnerable  Other categories: Legal  P O  L IT  IC A  L  T  R E  N D  S  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  28  Impact:  1-5 Likelihood:  1-5  P9 The growing pressures on a reduced cybersecurity workforce  Mental health can have a critical impact on industry professionals. IT systems are constantly being attacked, so the workload  remains high and is relentless. As cyber-criminals innovate new methods of penetrating systems at a fast rate, the challenges  to keep up are intense. The European labour shortage in information security means that many departments are operating  with half the staff needed which increases stress and pressure exponentially.  Other categories: Social  EC1 The rise of smart cities  European and global cities are gradually becoming smarter with the use of digital solutions to make cities safer, more efficient  and sustainable. Especially countries in the Middle East and Asia have been very proactive in developing smart cities, with  a tendency to build them from the ground up while developed cities around the world are actively incorporating technology  into existing environments and launching smart solutions. The drive of sustainability and efficiency leverages the usage of  technology and data. The aim is to create improvements across infrastructure (ENISA, Guidelines for Securing IOT, 2020),  mobility, energy, healthcare and beyond. Sustainable development of urban areas is a challenge of key importance. It  requires new, efficient, and user-friendly technologies and services, in particular in the areas of energy, transport and ICT.  Other categories: Technological, Legal  EC2 Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies is growing  Distributed ledger technology, more commonly known as blockchain technology, refers to the technological infrastructure  and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network  that's spread across multiple entities or locations.

The pandemic amplified the popularity of the Gig economy since  the current health crisis disrupted many businesses and altered the course of many companies. The current interest in the  gig economy has also been spurred by the application of digital technology and the use of platforms. When talking about the  gig economy, the subject is usually platform economy—and more specifically platform work. App-based transportation—like  Uber, food delivery, or other consumer-facing services—represents particularly visible changes to work and offer flexible  working models. The platformization of this work is drastically reshaping the gig economy—with the potential to create  widespread impacts across the entire economy.

The behaviors, movements, social relationships, interests, weaknesses and most private moments of billions are now  constantly recorded, evaluated and analyzed in real-time. Internet of Behaviors (IoB) is the collection of data on the use of  gadgets to obtain information on user behavior, interests, and preferences. The data can serve as a benchmark for mapping  customer behavior and aims to properly understand and apply data to create and promote products. It will continue to  influence how organizations interact with people. IoB can collect, combine and process data from a variety of sources.

Accompanying this shift is an increasing automation of  equipment used to harvest such energy, such as solar panel arrays and wind generators, by the companies that operate  them. The main driver for increasing automation will be to reduce the costs normally associated with the operation and  maintenance, such as inspection and repair, of these plants. This increasing reliance on IoT devices to monitor, manage  and perform maintenance on assets will expose the EU's energy sector to a variety of cybersecurity challenges.

Due to  the increasing gap of available IT jobs and the number of IT professionals, there is an increasing need to fill important IT  tasks. An option for European companies, which provides flexibility, is to outsource IT tasks to offshore providers. As  companies are moving into the cloud (quicker) and need tailor-made solutions, the need for IT professionals increases  further. Since the shortage affect most European countries, and most European developers prefer jobs within their own  country, companies increasingly recruit talent from outside Europe. The presence of different migrant communities - a so-  called diaspora - adds to the diversity of opportunities on the European market. These outsourced providers can be domestic,  nearshore or offshore. European companies prefer to outsource services to providers within the same country, a practice  also known as domestic outsourcing. When outsourcing abroad, they prefer providers in nearshore locations because of  proximity, language, cultural similarities and minimal time differences. As prices in nearshore countries in for example Central  and Eastern Europe rise, offshoring to developing countries becomes more attractive.

The emerging on new technologies in the course of digitization requires new resources to provide  hardware for e-cars, sensors or other technologies. Currently, EU industry is largely dependent on imports for many raw  materials and in some cases is highly exposed to vulnerabilities along the supply chain.

Web3 harnesses blockchain to “decentralize” management thus reducing the control of  big (tech) corporations and making it more democratic. With Web3, activities and data would be hosted on a computer  network using blockchain instead of corporate servers, based on ubiquitous high-speed access and the development of  web-based business applications at the enterprise level. Internet activities would be represented by crypto wallets and  websites hosted through decentralised applications, digital applications running on a blockchain network. This enables  wireless interaction between machines, vehicles, devices, sensors and many other devices via the internet.

Disinformation and  propaganda disseminated online have poisoned the public sphere. The unbridled collection of personal data has broken  down traditional notions of privacy. And a cohort of countries is moving toward digital authoritarianism by embracing the  Chinese model of extensive censorship and automated surveillance systems.

While countries are at different points in their  COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school  closures due to the pandemic. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning,  whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Even before COVID-19, there was already high growth  and adoption in education technology, with global EdTech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall  market for online education projected to reach $350 Billion by 2025 (Detecon, 2022).

To keep up in today’s rapidly changing environment, organizations need solutions that enable  them to create new business processes, products, and services. The adoption of the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) model  is increasing and has become an indispensable asset for sustaining businesses. As a result, companies become increasingly  dependent on these providers. By hiring offshore software developers, IT suppliers and everything-as-a-service, companies  can eliminate office space and reduce all associated costs.

With more than  1000 new satellites expected to launch each year over the next year, a robust satellite control infrastructure is gaining more  and more importance. GPS is increasingly integrated into sectors' operations such as aviation, railway, maritime operations  and other infrastructure because it is accurate, available, reliable, and provided at no cost to users. The ground-based  infrastructure for a satellite is responsible for a number of support functions, such as commanding the spacecraft, monitoring  its health, tracking the spacecraft to determine its present and future positions, collecting mission data, and distributing these  data to users. A key component of the infrastructure is the ground station, which is an Earth-based point of contact with a  satellite and a distributor of user data.

Recent examples of algorithmic biases based on gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity in AI  technology have demonstrated instances when AI abandon the principles of inclusivity, safety, ethics, privacy,  trustworthiness, and explainability. These findings may lead to the massive risk that future societies not only continue to  project historical human biases, but also risk exacerbating those biases.

The increasing implementation of technological developments have complicated  the ability of law enforcement to gain access to and gather relevant data for criminal investigations. One of the most  prominent examples in this regard remains the widespread use of encryption, which contains many benefits from a security  perspective but is also a development that criminals have gratefully used to their advantage. New challenges for law  enforcement authorities will arise with the gradual onset of 5G in Europe because the technology employs 256-bit encryption  that allows for unprecedented levels of privacy and anonymization in mobile communications networks With the increase in  volume and importance of cross-border investigations in the EU, ensuring the admissibility of evidence gathered in another  Member State at trial is crucial − both for efficient law enforcement and for the protection of fundamental rights. At present,  the rules on the collection, use, and admissibility of evidence are left to the laws of national criminal procedure of the Member  States. These differ extensively as to the collection, use, admissibility, and nullity of evidence and thereby act as an obstacle  to the use of cross-border evidence.

The global  population is increasing and becoming richer, which will significantly increase global food demand in the coming decades.  By 2030, the global middle class is estimated to grow from 2 billion today to 4.9 billion and this will significantly increase  the water required for food production. As people move from low income to middle class, demand increases for meat  products which have higher water requirements than crops. Other factors that accelerate this trend is the increased  frequency of drought due to climate change, increased energy requirements and inadequate water infrastructure.  Freshwater scarcity affects all parts of the environment, society and economy. This leads to crop failures, increased fuel  consumption by companies that rely on hydroelectric power, poor soil quality or increased criminal activities such as war,  robbery and theft.

This exercise should therefore be repeated in a few years to  account for changes to the threats and general societal changes. In many cases the likelihood  of occurrence and relevance of the individual threats may change suddenly, due to sudden  innovations, societal changes or other unforeseeable incidents. Hence, it is recommended to  define and implement a process to maintain a listing of emerging threats and to monitor the  threats presented in this report.  For most organizations looking to identify their own specific threat landscape for the future, we  recommend breaking it down into three workstreams: data collection, collaborative analysis, and  synthesis40. Data collection takes place throughout the year, the latter two workstreams will  need to occur close to one another with a timeline of approximately one month.  4.2 DATA COLLECTION (AKA HORIZON SCANNING)  Throughout the year, a group of individuals briefed on the previous project will collect evidence  of new trends, events, or drivers of change that alter the analysis (emergence of a new trend or  changes to the threat’s likelihood). The data collection should be tackled on a centralization  data platform to collect events and trends. The database should be open access and trend  information can be from other trend reports, scientific papers and journals, vulnerability  warnings from vendors, media reports or internal trend intelligence etc. Where possible, trends  or new information may come from other sources such as hackathons, simulation games, or  consumer protection organizations. The best information is gathered by a large and diverse  community with varying perspectives.  The data collected do not necessarily need to be trends – it may be events with the potential to  create new threats or alter existing ones, like technological disruptions (e.g. operationalization  of deep fakes), political destabilization / stabilization (e.g. expansion of Ukraine conflict to other  European nations), etc.  Data points may include sudden crises – these would not be analyzed as a part of this process.  There is, however, a recommended process for innovative shorter-term planning in ENISA’s  Foresight Challenges report.  4.3 COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS  Once a year, a workshop takes place to discuss collected trends or events that could alter the  threat analysis with experts from PESTLE dimensions and cybersecurity. Because of the  interdisciplinary nature of the context of the trends (PESTLE), it is recommendable to have a  workshop with experts from each PESTLE-dimension and also cybersecurity experts. The  people chosen to participate in this workshop should be involved in the ongoing data collection  – this ensures continuity and commitment.  40 (ENISA, Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  42  4.4 SYNTHESIS  The final stage is taking the findings from the workshops and comparing them with the previous  threat report. The listing should then be updated with qualifying justifications why a new threat  has emerged, changed, or been removed.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  43  A METHODOLOGY  Based on the use case titled “Identification of Future and Emerging Challenges,41” described on  page 32 of ENISA’s 2021 report on Foresight Challenges, the methodology for this exercise  was designed to identify relevant transformations, document possible future states, and to  identify drivers of change and threats for the year 2030. To ensure that the aims of the exercise  were in accordance with ENISA’s specifications and proposed timeframe, the approach  described for the use case had to be modified, reducing the activities in scope and complexity.  Additionally, a structure to manage the large amount of researched information and collected  knowledge on the future had to be developed, to support the methodology. Both proposed  amendments to the framework were aimed at reducing the time of execution to five or six  months, as opposed to one year.

In the exploration phase, the working group reviewed various sources and materials on trends.  Experts from each PESTLE dimensions reviewed, discussed and prioritized those trends, which  then defined the basis of the scenarios used for the threat identification and prioritization42. A  diverse foresight expert group reviewed and explored possible threats inside these scenarios by  using the method “Science Fiction Prototyping”. As last step, cybersecurity experts discussed  and prioritised those threats as final delivery for the report.  This chapter is a description of how the ENISA project team defined key terms within the  project. It will also help to establish a common vocabulary with the reader.  42 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  45  B FORESIGHT  INFORMATION MODEL  Dialogue, conversation quality, and engagement are the means by which ideas, experiences,  knowledge, beliefs, assumptions, and tendencies are shared throughout a foresight project.43  The creation of information and knowledge on the future requires foresight practitioners to unify  two different perspectives, one based on data and what can be proven, and one based on ideas  and perceptions.44 The team conducting this exercise observed an increase in the time required  to reach consensus when the participants lacked common ground or structure in their  interaction.45  To address the inherent issues associated with dialogue in foresight, the team crafted a  predefined information model. Although information models are most commonly associated with  software development practices, the team agreed that the use of a such a model could reduce  the variability of concepts during conversations and provide a shared space46 for the exercise  participants to synchronize their perceptions and ideas on potential futures. The information  model contains seven clearly defined entities used in foresight conversations, as well as the  focused relationships between each entity.  Figure 7: Foresight entity and relationship model  The basic entities of the model are megatrends, trends, events, technologies, actors, context,  and motivation. Drivers of change, the combined entity, arises from the combination of  technology, actor, and context or motivation. The definition of each entity and the elements it  contains are described in the table below.  43 (Chermack, 2011)  44 (Wack, 2014)  45 (Fosnot, 1996). “Scaffolding” is a concept proposed by Lev Vygotsky, which argued that the most effective learning  occurs when the learner and the expert jointly construct meaning (of an experience) through dialogue, thus drawing the  learner out to the potential level of performance.  46 (Schrage, 1999)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  46  Table 4: Foresight entities definitions  Entity Description  Megatrend  A shift in behaviour or attitude that has a global impact and  crosses multiple industries.47  Trend  A general tendency or direction of a development or change  over time.

B.1.1 Drivers of Change  Drivers of change are the interaction between structural features, institutions and agents, which  enables context-specific foundational factors that affect the capacity for reform and  opportunities for change. Therefore, the project team analysed trends and events for  technology, actors and context or motivation, which have a power relationship or an influence  and shaping trends or events.  Figure 8: Landscape of the Drivers of change  B.1.2 Megatrends  A shift in behaviour or attitude that has a global impact and crosses multiple industries.50  Megatrends are defined as large, social, economic, political, environmental or technological  change that is slow to form. Once in place, megatrends influence a wide range of catalysts,  activities, processes and perceptions, both in government and in society, possibly for decades.  They are the underlying forces that drive trends.51  As mentioned above, catalysts play an important role in the landscape of trends. Catalysts are  trends accelerating or deaccelerating megatrends, as defined by the ESPAS.52 The catalysts  impacting the cybersecurity sector were aligned with the trend list and their impact on  acceleration was discussed with the PESTLE workshop participants.  50 (Popova, 2017)  51 (Platform, Megatrend / Trend / Driver / Issue, 2014)  52 (ESPAS, 2022). Chapter 2  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  48  B.2 THREAT ANATOMY MODEL  This section will describe the methodological aspects and entities related to the threat anatomy  model used in later process stages of the framework to describe threats in the year 2030.  Figure 9: Threat anatomy model  The team defined a threat as a potential event or action, with an adverse impact on an asset,  organization or individual initiated by an actor. This definition was derived from ENISA’s,  CISA’s53, and CompTIA’s organizational definitions of threats.  The potential event or action could be the exploitation of a vulnerability. A vulnerability in this  context was defined as any system, structure, asset, or population particularly open to attack or  damage. The second characteristic of the threat definition was adverse impact. The team did  not provide any pre-defined impact categories to avoid limiting the workshop participants’  creativity in identifying the potential impact. Examples of adverse impact were disruption (of  services), financial or physical damage, breach of privacy or decreasing trust of citizens. For the  third part of the definition, the team asked the workshop participants what part of society would  be impacted by the event. Neither of the affected subjects or objects (asset, organization or  individual) were defined narrowly. An asset, therefore, can be understood as anything with  value – whether that is a technical or intangible asset. An organization could be a private  company or a governmental organization. The last element of the threat definition was the  threat actor, for which the team had not defined any categories like state-sponsored actors,  criminal groups, or hackers-for-hire. These categories were added to the threats after the threat  identification workshops took place and were combined with potential motivations of the  specified threat actor.  53 (ENISA, Glossary of Terms., 2018)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  49  C TREND ANALYSIS  C.1 APPROACH & PROCESS  As previously introduced, the team identified four key steps to identify cybersecurity threats in  the year 2030: collaborative exploration & scoping, group workshops to forecast future  developments based on trends54, the identification of threats related to the future developments  and a prioritization of the threats to be explored. These four process steps were documented,  along with the required activities associated to each one into an approach to conduct the  exercise. Stakeholders from ENISA’s Ad Hoc Working Group for Foresight reviewed and  provided input on the planned approach.  Figure 10: Detailed approach for exercise  The approach is iterative in nature, incrementally building up knowledge and information during  each phase. This aggregate approach to constructing information on potential futures allowed  54 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  50  the team conducting the exercise and the participants to unlock new perspectives at each  process step, opening exploration of relevant concepts through focused questioning.  C.1.1 Expert Participant Analysis  Experts who participated in this project (especially in the PESTLE trend workshops) were  individuals in ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight55 and the Ad Hoc Working Group on  Cyber Threat Landscapes. The experts who took part in the Threat Identification Workshop and  the Threat Prioritization Workshop were from EU CSIRTs Network and EU CyCLONe – the  Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network and ENISA stakeholder groups.  The experts interviewed as a part of this project represent a diverse group of individuals. All  stakeholders of ENISA’s, all participants had expertise in foresight, one of the PESTLE 56  framework elements, and/or cybersecurity.  Together they represented 19 EU Member States.  Figure 11: Geographical Distribution of Experts  Participants included individuals from academia, the European Commission, the EU Incident  Response and crisis management community, and national-level experts.  C.1.2 Collaborative Exploration  Once the approach was agreed upon, the first phase of the exercise targeted the identification  of general trends and analysis of interactions and influences of those trends on cybersecurity.  This research involved multiple evaluations of aspects included within the PESTLE framework  (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental), and exploration of trends,  key factors, and other forces that have an evident influence on each of the PESTLE  dimensions.57 The PESTLE dimensions provided a strategic, straightforward, and efficient  structure to conduct the analysis. We structured this research into three steps: collection &  preparation, collaborative exploration, and finalization. In the first step, we collected research  documents, reports, and studies from various sources, such as internal trend studies, open-  source studies, reports, publications of government sources, trend research agencies,  55 (ENISA, Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight On Emerging And Future Cybersecurity Challenges, 2021)  56 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  57 (Chermack, 2011).  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  51  cybersecurity companies, and consultancies. For each trend, a minimum of two reliable sources  was required for it to be added to the list.  The ENISA project team carried out the in-depth review to challenge the relevance and  description of each trend and to identify the trend pervasiveness, possible megatrend  relationships, and associated events. The decomposition into the determining characteristics  ensured a comprehensive basis for the experts’ assessments. This list of approximately 120  trends formed the basis for the foresight workshops. Experts invited to PESTLE workshops  were provided the list for feedback and preparation.  Group Forecast Workshops  The approach used for the second step – collaborative exploration – utilized expert panels in  the form of six workshops, one for each PESTLE dimension. Organizing ENISA’s efforts by  PESTLE dimensions and performing joint exercises leveraged the power of group dialogue and  knowledge. Each dimension involved five participants, who are academics, foresight, and  consulting experts from the fields of the corresponding PESTLE dimension, to ensure an  adequate mix between the wealth of opinions and efficiency.  In the interactive workshops, facilitated with the online collaboration tool Mural, the approach of  the diamond process58 was followed, divided into three steps: trend exploration and analysis,  prioritization, and exploration of prioritized trends.  In the first step, the participants were  debriefed on the objectives of the workshop and the project and were then asked to review the  gathered information on trends. They then provided feedback and discussed, augmented,  explored, and extended the list of trends. As a part of this step, the group explored and  discussed possible future events triggered by the trends and possible drivers of change.  This phase elicited many valuable insights and information on emerging trends. In order to  prioritize the trends, each participant voted for their top three trends, based on their opinion and  experience. Then, as a group, the participants were invited to assess the likelihood of  occurrence and potential impact on corresponding PESTLE field on a prioritization matrix.  58 (Thomas Grisold, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  52  Figure 12: Example of workshop trend prioritization board  In the second task of the workshop, the participants were invited to consider corresponding  events that each prioritized trend may trigger in the future (or has triggered already), possible  underlying drivers of change (actors, technology, and relevant context), and the elements that  may contribute to an increase of the trend’s priority (likelihood, impact).  Following the workshops, we initiated the synthesis of all written results on the collaboration tool  and the discussions. The experts' discussions also revealed clusters and connections beyond  the iteration of all descriptions, events, and underlying forces.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  53  Figure 13: Detailed approach for trend identification & prioritization workshops  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  54  D THREAT IDENTIFICATION  For the identification of future threats, the team drew on the threatcasting methodology. Often  used by military strategists, threatcasting is a (2011) foresight methodology59 that draws from  traditional futures studies and military strategic thinking.  The first phase of threat casting  consists of synthesizing research and identifying trends. This part was concluded with the  explorative research and the following PESTLE expert workshops.  D.1 SCENARIOS  The next phase in threatcasting is futurecasting, which includes the compilation of the research  data into a model of the future environment. The goal of the next step was to simulate possible  futures and for workshop participants to immerse themselves as deeply as possible within that  future. Using the insights and documented information from the PESTLE workshops, the project  team prepared and validated a pared down list of trends from which to build scenarios. The  grouped trends and driving factors were crafted into written scenarios to be evaluated by a  group of cybersecurity professionals.  Scenarios are consistent and coherent stories that illustrate visions and simulate a possible and  plausible future. In times of uncertainty, innovation and change, the use of scenario planning  techniques becomes increasingly important because of their usefulness when facing ambiguity  and complexity. Scenario planning stimulates strategic thinking and helps to overcome the  limitations of thinking60.  They are not meant to be an exact and realistic representation of the  future - they serve to open the field of vision and to uncover blind spots to discover possible  futures. This scenario development method helped avoid any bias or selection based on impact  or priorities. To design the scenarios, the project team numbered the trends that were prioritized  by the experts in the PESTLE workshops and decided to develop scenarios based on 5  randomly selected trends.  Each scenario combined the trends and defined a storyline of a possible future.  D.1.1 Scenario 1 – Blockchain, deepfakes, & cybercrime in a data-rich  environment  In 2030, distributed ledger61 (blockchain) technology has evolved, thus enabling simultaneous  access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner through a network spread over  multiple entities or locations. This technology enables interoperability across different virtual  platforms, allowing digital asset collectability and digital proof of ownership. Blockchain  technology has found widespread use in the financial, logistics, science, and health sectors.  It  significantly impacts the economy by increasing consumer trust and processing efficiency  because of its decentralization.  On the other hand, criminal groups have also benefitted from technological advances, such as  distributed ledger technology (e.g. crypto), the darknet, and privacy-focused platforms. New  technology is used to widen the groups’ negative impact, expand their activities' overall reach,  and use technology for sales and collaboration. This development has a major impact on the  legal sector.  Deep fake technology is also widely established and accessible to everyone; it enables the  creation of synthetic content that appears to be authentic. This technology's mainstream use  and distribution will transform sectors such as education, art, digital reconstruction, and the  59 (ENISA, Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, 2022)  60 (M. Stojanovic, 2015)  61 (ENISA, Blockchain, kein Datum)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  55  entertainment industry. However, its psychological effects will have a major impact on public  safety, election processes, and the spread of disinformation.  While technological options for privacy are available and widely used, the private sector is  highly dependent on using real-time analysis of customer data from various platforms and  sources to create and promote products and understand customer behavior and needs. The  data is constantly recorded, evaluated, analyzed and combined, and processed from various  platforms and sources. Organizations using this method widen their power and have a big  impact on the economy.  In addition to the widespread collection of customer data, organizations collect data from  infrastructure components via technologies like IoT and drones and analyze it with AI. With this  information, organizations perform inspections, predict failures, reduce workforce requirements,  and maintain (critical) infrastructure. This practice has a significant impact on companies in the  wind energy, logistics, insurance, roadway, railway, and telecommunication sectors.  D.1.2 Scenario 2 – Eco-friendly, sustainable, and interconnected smart  cities (non-state actors)  As the global population rose and became more prosperous, and the frequency of droughts  increased due to climate change, the diminishing availability of freshwater in 2030 is posing  challenges to all parts of the environment, society, and economy. Crop failures, poor soil quality,  increased fuel consumption, and dependency on hydroelectric power increased62, which led to  very high costs of living and an increase in poverty. Consequently, the level of criminal activities  including aggressions, robberies, and theft rose dramatically. The increasing energy  requirements and the construction of adequate water infrastructure for the new needs are an  integral part of planning future cities.  As part of the reconstruction of cities, sectors of infrastructure, mobility, energy, ICT, and  healthcare are actively incorporating technology into their existing environment and using data  for decision making and improvement. Smart cities create safer, more efficient, and sustainable  cities that are adapted to the environmental requirements of climate change. However, the  increased use of digital technology into the cities’ infrastructure also increased their  technological dependence.  With the increasing connectivity and possibilities to collaborate, the political power of non-state  actors has continued to grow – broadly impacting both the economy and society.  Digital  communities, institutions, and other actors are beyond the capacity of the state to control,  influencing all levels of governance and changing the political environment. In the  communication sector specifically, telecommunication providers63 have amassed significant  geopolitical, economic, and societal power. Furthermore, as all digitalized processes and  services are dependent on connectivity, both local and transcontinental communication  providers are gaining importance in Europe due to their use of new technology like space  connectivity and drones.  The new factors mentioned above have also affected election ecosystems. Core electoral  systems are being targeted by digital communities, institutions, and actors. However, the scope  of vulnerable components also include election administrators, political parties, news  organizations, social media platforms, email platforms, and donor groups – all of which have  become part of broader campaigns to manipulate democracy and call into question the  trustworthiness of elections.  62 (IPCC, 2022)  63 Please note that telecommunications providers will not be the only groups amassing huge amounts of power – the  greatest power shift will be towards content providers and hyperscalers.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  56  D.1.3 Scenario 3 – More data, less control  The massive collection and use of data is driving innovation and decisions in all sectors.  Important data-driven decisions that impact people’s lives, livelihoods, and the natural  environment are automated in 2030. The delegation of tasks to automated decision-making  systems with little or no human intervention enables new solutions and improves overall  efficiency. On the other side, society, and especially sectors like the medical diagnostics sector,  the industry of autonomous vehicles, and financial institutes (to issue loans and credit cards)  are fighting ethical challenges. Data-based and automated decision-making could lead to  discriminatory and biased outcomes, privacy violations, and the undermining of human self-  determination.  (IoT) devices are the predominant vehicle for decision-making data. In 2030, organizations  using these devices face problems with patch management; it is especially difficult for critical  infrastructure64 providers to update the large number of devices without disruptions or breaches.  With the increasing use of digital products and services, more personal or sensitive data is  available on the Internet. This data includes biometric, genetic, and behavioral information and  is tracked across different online platforms. Unfortunately, data breaches, attacks, and online  bullying have become part of daily life and impact most EU citizens. This results in a severe  public health risk; victims struggle with PTSD, burnout, anxiety, depression, abuse, or even  suicidal behavior. More and more EU consumers are concerned about how their data is being  used online and are calling for increased control over data access and usage rights.  On the other hand, law enforcement has difficulties accessing stored data or using collected  data because of the implementation of end-to-end encryption of communication channels,  compliance with data privacy regulations, lack of technical capabilities. The implementation of  technological developments has complicated the ability of law enforcement to gain access to  and gather relevant data for criminal investigations. The widespread use of encryption, which  contains many benefits from a privacy and security perspective, is also a development criminals  are using to their advantage.  D.1.4 Scenario 4 – Sustainable energy, automated/short-term workforce  In 2030 the use of renewable energy has increased as EU governments and societies seek to  avoid the rising costs and environmental and political impacts of fossil fuel dependency65. Many  organizations automate equipment to harvest such energy, such as solar panel arrays and wind  generators. These organizations rely on IoT devices to monitor, manage, and perform  maintenance on these assets. This is exposing the EU's energy sector to a variety of  cybersecurity challenges.  As more people move to urban areas, the agriculture sector is automated because of  insufficiently available workforce in rural areas. This leads to increasing dependency on  technology and specialized skills and knowledge to manage agricultural output of countries. The  exposure of agricultural infrastructure and operations to a connected environment leads to  challenges in ensuring food security for the population of EU countries.  With the shortage of skilled workers, non-traditional, flexible work structures like freelancing  have become the norm (e.g., workers in the Gig-economy)66. The labor market is characterized  by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. The  platformization of work drastically reshapes the labor market, with an extreme gap developing  between high and low educated people and their income.  64 (Allianz, 2016)  65 (Union, 2022)  66 (Global, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  57  With the need for flexibility and enabling a remote workforce, organizations increasingly require  IT solutions that enable them to create new business processes, products, and services. To  increase efficiency and reduce costs, the adoption of the everything-as-a-service model is  highly popular and has become an indispensable asset for sustaining businesses. As a result,  companies have become increasingly dependent on these software service providers.  D.1.5 Scenario 5 – Legislation, bias, extinctions, & global threats  In 2030, the world’s population counts 8.5 billion people, with urban growth taking place in  regions relatively undisturbed in the last century67. Urban expansion, tropical deforestation, and  land-use change sped up mass extinction and the loss of biodiversity. This has caused the loss  of food security, soil fertility, an increased water scarcity in Europe.  Natural disasters and  pandemics have become commonplace.  The internet, once a medium of freedom and expression has increasingly become regulated  and censored, democracy itself has atrophied under its influence. Disinformation68 and  propaganda disseminated online have poisoned the public sphere and dialogue. The unbridled  collection of personal data has broken down traditional notions of privacy. Moreover, a cohort of  countries are moving toward digital authoritarianism, by embracing extensive censorship and  automated surveillance systems. Europe, targeting to protect its values, has tried to strengthen  its technological sovereignty, by reducing dependencies and including social and environmental  ambitions within its technical legislation. One technology already regulated in 2024 is machine  learning and artificial intelligence, which is massively invested in. However, with the use of AI-  based systems, Europe is being challenged with problems and incidents on data ownership,  sovereignty, data protection, and compliance, especially with algorithmic biases. These biases,  based on gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity in AI technology, led to the continuing historical  human biases and the exacerbation of those biases in societal practices.  Space has also become the main focus of governments and private investment, as space  technologies, data and services advanced in the 20s. But the dependence to this critical space  infrastructure in space and on the ground made Europe more vulnerable to both manmade and  natural threats.  D.2 SCIENCE FICTION PROTOTYPING (SFP)  Science Fiction Prototyping is a “thought-provoking method for arousing discussion in research  and foresight of emerging technology.69”  Science fiction prototypes (SFPs) are stories that  allow the workshop participants to explore a wide variety of futures and a different angle on  these futures. The SFP is based on a future (scenario), derived from five randomly picked  trends and a character (persona) in this scenario, to emphasize this specific point of view70.  From these models of different future environments, the five groups, each containing two to  three cybersecurity experts, were assigned one future model. Based on this model, the group  derived one persona and wrote a science fiction prototype (SFP), focusing on the layered  effects the future environment has on their persona. To characterize this person, the group  imagines a specific person living in that future of the scenario. The group visualizes in a  persona template who the character is, their questions, problems, goals, motivations and a  possible statement. This step was prepared by the participants and the project team before the  workshop71.  The preliminary work of science fiction prototyping created the basis for the Threat Identification  workshop, where the groups moved their focus from the models of the future environment and  67 (Nations, 2022)  68 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  69 (Kymalainen, 2016)  70 (Johnson, 2011)  71 (Institute, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  58  their persona to the sphere of cybersecurity threats. The participants explored and discussed  cybersecurity threats that included the different layers of their science fiction prototype. Based  on the threat definition – a potential event or action with an adverse impact on an asset,  organization or individual, carried out by an actor – the groups formulated and defined different  cybersecurity threats of the future.  These views of the future are effects-based models, meaning that the group is not modelling a  specific threat first; they are exploring the layered effects that this future will have on a single  person, related and an active part in this scenario. This creates a more detailed effects-based  model that ultimately helps the participants to find more threats but also opens the threat  definition in broader depth.  The moderators of the project team guided the discussion with questions and, if necessary,  randomly drew Security Cards that served as input for the threat discussion to explore more  layers of potential threats. Security Cards were created by the University of Washington in 2013  and aim to foster creative thinking on cybersecurity threats. There are four dimensions within  the Security Cards – human impact, adversary’s motivations, adversary’s resources, and  adversary’s methods72. The Security Cards were drawn by the moderator if the discussion  stalled, and the participants were unable to identify new threats. The moderator also  encouraged the group to switch perspectives and look at the future environment from the  adversary’s position to identify more threats.  The output of the Threat Identification workshop was a long list of future cybersecurity threats  and their descriptions.  D.3 THREAT PRIORITIZATION  The final step of the process was the conduction of a Threat Prioritization workshop with ENISA  stakeholders, refining the threat descriptions based on ENISA cybersecurity expert’s feedback  to the threats and compiling the identified future cyberthreats into the report at hand. The Threat  Prioritization workshop’s goal was to rank the threats based on their impact, likelihood, novelty  and, therefore, importance for ENISA. Novelty was included to prioritize threats that are not  often included in public discourse. This was done in a workshop with ENISA cybersecurity  experts, leading to the emerging cybersecurity threats for 2030 list. (See chapter 4.) Impact and  likelihood were rated on a scale of 1 to 5; these were multiplied to create a baseline score. Then  2 points were added if the threat was deemed novel; 2 points were deducted if the threat had  already been published in another ENISA publication.  After receiving this feedback, the project team refined the threat descriptions and added the  actors, methods, and impact category to each top-ten threat.  The threat information may be found in chapter 4 and the scoring for the top 10 threats is in  Annex E.  72 (TAMARA DENNING)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  59  E THREAT SCORING  73 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  74 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  75 (ENISA, Threat Landscape Report, 2022)  76 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  77 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  78 (ENISA, Raising Awareness of Cyber Security, 2020)  # Name Impact Likelihood  Impact x  Likelihood  Novelty  Previously  Published  Total  Score  1  Supply chain compromise of  software dependencies73  5 5 25 +2 -2 25  2  Advanced disinformation  campaigns74  4 5 20  20  3  Rise of digital surveillance  authoritarianism / loss of privacy  4 5 20  -2 18  4  Human error and exploited legacy  systems within cyber-physical  ecosystems75  4 5 20  -2 18  5  Targeted attacks (e.g. ransomware)  enhanced by smart device data76  4 4 16 +2  18  6  Lack of analysis and control of  space-based infrastructure and  objects.  4 4 16 +2  18  7  Rise of advanced hybrid threats  making use of different and  unforeseen modus operandi (e.g.  disinformation)77  4 4 16  -2 14  8 Skill shortage78 4 4 16  -2 14  9  Cross border ICT service  providers as a single point of failure  5 3  -2 13  10 Abuse of AI 4 3 12 +2 -2 12  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  60  5.

INTRODUCTION  2.1 BACKGROUND  In line with the ENISA’s European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s sixth strategic objective,  “Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges2”, the Agency seeks to improve  the EU’s cybersecurity resilience, by increasing awareness of future threats and  countermeasures amongst its member states and stakeholders. Fulfilling this objective likewise  supports the other 6 strategic objectives as it provides input on future threats and challenges.  Figure 1: ENISA Strategic Objectives  To achieve this goal, ENISA has applied its methodological framework grounded in foresight  research and future studies that was developed in 2021.3 The framework, created in  collaboration with an interdisciplinary expert group that included futurists, sociologists, business  leaders, cybersecurity experts, and others, will now be used in practice to identify threats and  challenges likely to emerge by 20304.  Drawing on the insights of previous ENISA projects and reports including “Looking into the  Crystal Ball5” and “Foresight Challenges,” the framework combines foresight methods with  creative thinking approaches and co-creation/innovation methods; it leverages individual skills,  knowledge, and reasoning in a collaborative setting. The overarching mission of this framework  is to produce insight about the future and to enrich the dialogue between experts with various  professions and backgrounds.  We believe that the key to defending the European Union is to prepare for the future; the future  is made by us all and therefore to imagine it we need the input of a diverse range of people.  Beyond identifying emerging futures, the agency will enable member states and other  stakeholders to improve their cybersecurity based on the findings of the foresight exercise.  2.2 PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE  This study aims to identify and collect information on future cybersecurity threats that could  affect the Union’s infrastructure and services, and its ability to keep European society and  citizens digitally secure. It is our intention to arm ENISA stakeholders with new insights with  which to begin combatting future threats. The outcome generated by this practical application of  2 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  3 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021). The framework can be found on page 33 of the report.  4 (ENISA, Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight On Emerging And Future Cybersecurity Challenges, 2021)  5 (ENISA, Looking into the crystal ball., 2018)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  7  the framework is the identification of 21 cybersecurity threats which may emerge or be  exacerbated by the year 2030.  A secondary objective of this Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity threats 2030  exercise is to demonstrate that the foresight framework outlined in the Foresight Challenges  report from 2021 can be applied in a practical context and to identify areas of opportunity in the  framework to improve the applicability of ENISA’s foresight activities.  Finally, the exercise of threat identification and prioritization serves an internal purpose of  supporting each of ENISA’s strategic objectives by providing relevant focus topic for future  planning.  ENISA’s strategy proposes concrete goals for the Agency in the form of seven strategic  objectives that will set the priorities for European Union Agency for Cybersecurity in the coming  years. The strategic objectives6 are as follows:  1. Empowered and engaged communities across the cybersecurity ecosystem  2. Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  3. Effective cooperation amongst operational actors within the Union in case of massive  cyber incidents  4. Cutting-edge competencies and capabilities in cybersecurity across the Union  5. High level of trust in secure digital solutions  6. Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity challenges  7. Efficient and effective cybersecurity information and knowledge management for  Europe  2.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  Our main target demographic for this project are stakeholders from the cybersecurity domain  including national cybersecurity authorities, national and EU decision makers, experts, and  practitioners. We specifically hope to target operational cybersecurity practitioners and response  teams, using the identified threats and scenarios to build resilience and response arrays.  6 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  8  3. EMERGING  CYBERSECURITY THREATS  FOR 2030  The threats identified and ranked within this report represent a range of topics, many of which  are already relevant today. The outcomes of this exercise illustrate that in 8 years many of  today’s threats will remain pressing but will have shifted in character – increased dependencies  and the democratization and development of new technologies add complexity to our  understanding of threats. Our wish for readers of this report is that they are able to recognize  shifts in the threat landscape and already begin preparations to ensure security and resilience in  the face of morphing threats. In cybersecurity there is limited leeway to postpone actions that  aid in the avoidance and mitigation of future risks; one must continuously anticipate  approaching threats. These additional measures, however, need not come at the cost of  necessary wide-reaching cybersecurity controls such as education, awareness, patching, etc.  Figure 2: Top 10 threats  Methodology  Through a series of workshops and interviews between March and August 2022, with relevant  experts in the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental)  fields, ENISA has identified and ranked 21 threats that will increase in prevalence by 2030.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  9  Figure 3: Foresight Exercise Methodology Overview  The methodology used has four phases. The first, “collaborative exploration,” is a phase of  trend research and information gathering that integrates expert knowledge, feedback, and  validation. The second phase, “group forecast workshops,” gathered groups of experts with  experience in one of the PESTLE dimensions to further discuss, explore, assess, and prioritize  the identified trends.  The third phase, “threat identification”, is based on the threat casting7 methodology for  identifying emerging challenges within the next 10 years. To do so, small groups of  cybersecurity experts are provided a scenario that combines prioritized trends. The scenarios  are an integral part of the work in order to immerse in the future trends, however their  description specific as it may be, does not influence the exploration and identification of threats.  The scenarios merely serve as a medium to convey the content related to threats. The group  explores this scenario by building personas and writing a short imaginative science fiction  essay. The experts then assume an adversarial perspective to explore potential threat actors  and vulnerabilities in the described future. This change in perspective enables the group to  establish adversary motivations and define the possible threats.  The threats identified by the expert participants were then given scores on likelihood, impact,  novelty, and whether the threat has been previously published by ENISA. Novelty is considered  in this project in order to prioritize lesser-known threats.  7 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  10  Further details about the methodology used can be found in Annex A.  Threat Descriptions  Each threat is described below with a focus on the top 10 most highly ranked threats. The threat  actors are four main groups described in ENISA’s 2022 Threat Landscape Report - state-  sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists8.  The described methods refer to ENISA’s current threat taxonomy9. It divides threats into the  following high-level categories: physical attack (deliberate), unintentional damage / loss of  information or IT assets, disaster (natural), failures/malfunctions, outages,  eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, nefarious activity/abuse, and legal.  The focus of this  report is primarily on intentional threats; unintentional threats are considered here as  vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat actor.  Each threat is also linked10 to one or more of the scenarios to indicate the origins of the threat.  The threat description also includes a link to ENISA’s strategic objectives (SO). This linkage  supports the connection between identified threats and ENISA’s ongoing and future initiatives.  ENISA’s sixth strategic objective, foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity challenges, is  relevant for each of the threats but is not included in the threat description as all threats are the  result of a foresight exercise.

As the market demands quick product release cycles, component-based programming  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  12  will strongly increase11, leading to the reuse of code and the use of open-source code libraries.  While some of these components will be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, the combination of  software, hardware and component-based code will create unmonitored interactions and  interfaces12. This will lead to novel and unforeseen vulnerabilities, creating more opportunities  for malicious actors to compromise the supply chain from the supplier and customer side.  Financial and political motivations of these threat actors can lead to exploitation of software  vulnerabilities, attacks on the configuration of hardware and software, malware injections in  code libraries, as well as phishing attacks. This would lead to global supply chain issues and  can be used by threat actors for political disruptions, financial gains, or espionage.  Adversaries may manipulate these software dependencies and development tools by adding  backdoors to the code components. The easiest method for attackers is the manipulation of  open-source libraries. If focusing more on commercial applications, the attackers can gain initial  access through several techniques, including drive-by compromises or social engineering  attacks. By placing trojans, droppers or rootkits into the software components of the suppliers,  they can later gain network access to their ultimate target which uses the hardware or software  component in their organization. Physical tampering with hardware in their production facilities  are also a possibility. This would require the attackers to have physical access (or at the very  least physical proximity) to the hardware component production facility. The attackers would  infiltrate the facilities legitimately by having an insider working at the facilities who would be in  an ideal position to tamper with the hardware for the purpose of data or system compromise.  Once compromised (leaving no trace) a state actor will purchase the manipulated hardware or  software, install it across the country, and open themselves up to a very widespread attack.  Another case can be the compromise of a widely used private company with access to sensitive  data, as seen in the SolarWinds incident13.

The sheer scale of  supply chain attacks also demands effective operational  cooperation in the event of an incident (SO3). These threats  are in direct opposition to ENISA’s SO5 – high level of trust in  secure digital solutions. Finally, comprehensive knowledge  management and education on potential supply chain attacks  is necessary to mitigate the threat (SO7).  Example: State-sponsored actors insert a backdoor  in a well-known and popular open-source library on  online code repository. They use this to infiltrate  information from most major European corporations  and use the information to blackmail leaders,  espionage, or otherwise initiate disruptions across the  EU.  11 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  12 (Jubb, 2022)  13 (Newman, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  13  3.2 ADVANCED DISINFORMATION / INFLUENCE OPERATIONS (IO)  CAMPAIGNS - #2  In 2030, non-state actors like criminal groups, hackers-for-hire as well as government actors will  likely have the technological capabilities (e.g., deepfakes) to expand their disinformation efforts  in the EU to manipulate communities. While the application of deepfake technology allows for  illicit financial enrichment of criminal groups or individuals, the primary motivation for  disinformation campaigns through faked identities is (geo)political and will likely be  predominantly performed by state actors and other politically motivated actors.  Data sources are now immeasurable; adversaries can train their AI for deepfake attacks14 with a  wide range of publicly available videos, pictures, and voice recordings of individuals (even those  not in the public sphere). Biometric facial images are particularly vulnerable to morphing attacks  in which the threat actor can, to a high degree of accuracy, impersonate their target. Deepfake  technology can also create unreal faces that the human eye is unable to differentiate from real  faces. Therefore, adversaries can create realistic avatars that go beyond the current social  media15 bots that already have elaborate profiles. The bots of the future that can influence  elections and public trust also share videos of themselves on social media to participate visibly  in the debate. Disinformation campaigns could be further reinforced with AI text or voice  analysis to provide personalized responses to individuals.  Threat #2 - Score 20  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored groups, criminal  organizations, hackitvists  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 2, 5  Probable Methods  Fraud, Unauthorized access,  Session Hijacking, Identity Theft,  Abuse of Personal Data  Topics for future SPD  Advanced awareness  activities, deepfake  identification research,  authentication best practices  Probable Impacts  Distrust, disinformation, financial  damage Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO4  EU policies need to be prepared to address disinformation  (especially when powered by deepfakes and digital IDs)  (SO2). Because these attacks will be difficult to detect, it is  paramount that cross-border mitigations and incident  response be enabled (SO3). These attacks will test the  capabilities of EU Member States – from non-experts to  highly-skilled professionals (SO4).  Example: A state-sponsored actor may impersonate a  political rival by using deepfakes and spoofing the  candidate’s digital identity, significantly impacting  election results.  3.3 RISE OF DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITARIANISM /  LOSS OF PRIVACY - #3  Criminals are increasingly being identified through technologies like location tracking, public  cameras, and facial recognition16. In the future, this may encourage states, and likewise private  actors, to vastly expand the use of these technologies. Through technologies like facial  recognition in the public sphere, increased digital surveillance on internet platforms, or the  adoption of digital identities, European individual freedoms may be curtailed for the sake of  safety and security. Access to this data will enable and encourage law enforcement agencies  and other government entities to track potential suspects. These data stores may also become  a huge target for criminal groups who are able to sell data online for individuals based on just a  photo. The private sector also plays an important role – especially when major facial recognition  technologies or content platforms are dominated by a single market leader. Single providers  14 (Shein, 2022)  15 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  16 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  14  who provide facial recognition technology or content platforms will be targeted for the troves of  consolidated voice and image data available. Furthermore, the actions of private corporations  may not always align with data protection and security requirements.  Governments (including law enforcement) and private enterprises as part of public-private  partnerships can, within their legal boundaries, legitimately collect personal data - including  biometric data. This creates challenges17 for privacy regulators and the public to make sure the  laws that protect their privacy are enforced. Additionally, it requires all entities collecting this  data to have the necessary defence mechanisms in place. Once adversaries gain access to the  network, they can engage in automated collection of data, potentially including a command and  scripting interpreter as well as APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load  (ETL) services in cloud environments. One use case would include an abuse of the collected  data by law enforcement or online vigilante communities to track down potential criminals.

Analysis via guidelines and  foresight exercise  Probable Impacts  Privacy breaches, human rights  abuses Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO5  Mitigating this threat requires strong cybersecurity and  data protection policies (SO2) and a high level of trust in  solutions (e.g. digital IDs) (SO5).  Example:  An authoritarian leader uses their power to  retrieve databases of information about individuals who  have visited their country – from both public and private  entities. They track all those who participated in anti- government protests, put them on a watch list, and  subsequently are able to manipulate those individuals’  access to national services like voting, visits to their  healthcare providers, or access to other online services.  3.4 HUMAN ERROR AND EXPLOITED LEGACY SYSTEMS WITHIN  CYBER-PHYSICAL ECOSYSTEMS - #4  In 2030, IoT permeates large parts of transport, power and water grids, and industrial  infrastructure to increase efficiency and improve intelligent decision-making. Furthermore, we  will see a significant increase in the number of smart devices the average user has associated  to them (as of 2021, the average person had seven smart devices).18 Because of this, it may  become exceedingly difficult to maintain and manage all devices, especially from a security  perspective. Additionally, the manufacturers of the smart devices will likely be unsuccessful on  educating end-users of the need for device maintenance. The fast adoption of IoT and the  ongoing skill shortage will lead to a lack of knowledge, training and understanding of the cyber-  physical ecosystem by 2030, leading to IT and OT security maintenance issues arising from the  misconfiguration, delayed maintenance, and inadequate end-of-life support of discontinued IoT  software. In addition to these issues, threat actors may deploy intelligent attacks using  techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which may dramatically reduce the  detection rate of cyberattacks. One example of the use of GAN would be to target servers  distributing patches in order to disrupt scheduled updates19. Because of the criticality of the  17 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021)  18 (BSI-Magazin, 2021)  19 (Shi, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  15  devices, this can create a systemic risk, leading to outages, damage as well as the interception  of data between the devices.  On the end user side, IoT devices are often managed by mobile devices running on iOS or  Android. The end-users communicate through their mobile applications with the smart devices  that are part of their home, transport or other surrounding. Adversaries can try to get initial  access to the mobile devices by biometric spoofing, brute force attacks, or exploiting  vulnerabilities on the device. Once they have access to the phone and the legitimate  communication channels between the end-user phone and the infrastructure, they can tamper  with the smart devices, laterally move to the network or get access to the account that manages  the smart devices.20 In an industrial ecosystem, adversaries could get initial access through  employees by social engineering attack or through their endpoints, move laterally within the  corporate network and look for internet accessible devices that are connected to the industrial  control systems. Additionally, attacks could succeed through transient cyber assets that are  deployed with an insecure configuration – including those from third party suppliers and  partners.  Threat #4 - Score 18  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored groups, cyber  criminals, hacktivists  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 3, 4  Probable Methods  Tampering, Failure of  Communication links, Denial of  Service, Malicious activity,  Manipulation of Information,  Targeted Attacks, Brute force,  Unauthorized Physical Access  Topics for future SPD  Guidelines for securing the  IOT21, Certification Schemes,  Secure communication  standards, guidelines for  secure storage of data, *  Processes related to security- by-design, Software bill of  materials  / Chain of trust,  Economical value of cyber- attacks and cyber security  Probable Impacts  Malfunction, Failures and Outages,  Physical Damage Relevant strategic objectives: SO3, SO4  Incidents involving legacy equipment typically impact  cross-border critical infrastructure (SO3.) More expertise  and experience in securing a range of products and  retrofitting legacy systems requires additional education  and research into these fields (SO4).  Example: Manuals for all legacy OT equipment are  available online and studied primarily by state-sponsored  groups. Once a vulnerability is found, they target user  devices or other IoT products used at the plant. Cyber  criminals begin a new form of ransomware in which they  bring down important infrastructure and demand  payment – given that the operator likely lacks the  resources to solve the issue themselves.  3.5 TARGETED ATTACKS (E.G. RANSOMWARE) ENHANCED BY SMART  DEVICE DATA - #5  In 2030, the collection of behavioural data will have exponentially increased. The use of smart  devices in our daily lives will significantly increased; data from all aspects of life will be collected,  leading to an accurate and unique behavioural profile of each user. Collected data may include  (among other sources) health data in from wearables and medical equipment, or IoT devices in  Smart Homes that collect information of behaviour at home, movement data, or behaviour  across online platforms. As the smart devices will often be insecure due to the unwieldy  20 (SOCRadar, 2022)  21 (ENISA, Guidelines for Securing IOT, 2020)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  16  amounts of devices and lack of end user awareness, this data is at danger of being exploited22.  Intelligent edge devices are already difficult to protect from manipulation and eavesdropping.  Criminal groups will try to get access to troves of data to tailor social engineering attacks based  on the behaviour profile of the user. The level of sophistication of these social engineering  attacks will challenge end users, law enforcement and governments alike to find new ways to  prevent social engineering and improve authentication.  Attackers may obtain initial access through internet-connected smart devices that are  unpatched, or still running default settings. Criminals and hackers-for-hire23 will gather victim  identity information, credentials, and contact information to gain initial access and then move  laterally within the network to access more sensitive information. The attackers will use  automated data collection and infiltration, correlate and interpret the data to create the  behavioural profile of their victim. Adversaries will use persistence techniques to maintain their  foothold. With the behavioural profile, they will try to get access to financial assets, use the  profile to spoof high-profile individuals within the victim’s network or sell the collected data on  the black market.

Example: Cybercriminals may use the increased  amount of available data from smart devices and  analyze it with AI to create behavioral models of their  victims for spear phishing campaigns or stalking.  3.6 LACK OF ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF SPACE-BASED  INFRASTRUCTURE AND OBJECTS - #6  The early 2010s and 2020s have started a new era of space travel, with private companies  joining governments in the pursuit to explore our universe. By 2030, the space sector will likely  transform even more with more investments of private actors, partnerships between private  companies and governments, and increased geopolitical and commercial competition in space.  The fast growth of this sector will enable many key services. Despite the advances made in  recent years, the sector is still emerging as a focus topic for the security community.  From a security perspective, there is a lack of understanding, analysis and control of space-  based infrastructure. Without a broader EU-wide focus, building up a strong defence of space  infrastructure may be too slow (e.g. R&D projects that take time to be planned and budgeted  for.) This also means that there may be a lack of timely preparation for the identification and  22 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  23 (ENISA, Threat Landscape Report, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  17  exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities24 (zero-days) – if the resources are not appropriately  allocated. Markets incentivise private companies to execute and innovate faster, and to lower  cost at the expense of cybersecurity. Private companies may try to use this to sabotage their  rivals; governments may try to exploit vulnerabilities to create a competitive geopolitical  advantage in space; and criminal groups will use the vulnerabilities to extort companies for  financial gains and to create havoc.  Because of the intersections between private and public infrastructure in space, attackers can  gain initial access to space-based infrastructure by either targeting the private actors,  government agencies or the individuals interacting with the infrastructure. As governments and  societies largely depend on satellites (e.g. GPS), state-sponsored attackers and Hackers-for-  Hire will try to get initial access to hardware through supply-chain attacks and use techniques to  maintain their presence within the space infrastructure – including base stations. 25Base stations  are transceivers that connect satellites to a central terrestrial hub that connects the satellite to a  network. They are a key element that attackers will target with denial-of-service attacks to  disrupt critical military and civilian systems. Attackers will use available techniques to evade  defence and detection mechanisms but remain dormant until they execute their exploit  strategically, e.g. during a conflict as a mean for hybrid-warfare. The introduction of space-  based weapons may shift the geopolitical paradigm.  Threat #6 - Score 18  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored actors,  Cybercrime actors, Hackers-for- hire  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 5  Probable Methods  Unauthorized use of IPR Protected  Resources, Targeted Attacks,  Fraud, Sabotage, Information  Leakage, Session Hijacking,  Malicious Software  Topics for future SPD  Certification schemes,  frequent risk assessment  plans, international  cooperation, threat landscape  for space  Probable Impacts Damage, Outages, Malfunctions Relevant strategic objectives: SO1, SO2, SO3, SO4,  SO5, SO7  This threat will be reduced through a multi-stakeholder  approach that includes policymakers, incident response  teams, R&D teams, certification programs, and knowledge  management.  Example: State-sponsored attackers access space  infrastructure, build up their capabilities and knowledge  of the technology, and secure their presence to execute  attacks. Their aim may be to create infrastructure  malfunctions as a statecraft tool to sabotage other  governments during geopolitical conflicts.  3.7 RISE OF ADVANCED HYBRID THREATS - #7  By 2030, cyberattacks will become more sophisticated and will be matched with physical or  offline attacks. Attack methods are constantly evolving and are often combined – in sequence  and in parallel – to reach their goals. These hybrid operations are more difficult to detect and  defend against due to their complexity and the tendency to treat each attack individually. With a  new modus operandi, detection tools need greater correlation capabilities including connecting  seemingly unrelated events. They therefore pose a growing challenge for governments,  companies, and citizens alike. In the past, hybrid attacks were primarily executed by state  actors as a combination of traditional and cyber warfare. In 2030, hybrid threats have evolved to  24 (Erwin, 2022) (Forum, 2022)  25 (Tim Starks, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  18  apply new technologies and combine different types of exploit mechanisms in order to evade  existing response systems.  For example, attackers will also increasingly use artificial intelligence and deep learning to  combine their capabilities26 to create new, unforeseen modus operandi. Attackers will use a  simultaneous combination of techniques to gain initial access, including the collection of big  data to tailor their spear phishing campaigns, machine learning to interpret the data, develop  new tools to evade defence mechanisms and combine the physical and the virtual to execute  their attacks. With the increase of smart devices, cloud usage, more online identities and social  platforms, as well as digital IDs issued by governments, attackers will have a variety of new  realms to use and combine to create creative attack vectors.  Threat #7 - Score 14  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored actors, hackers- for-hire, cyber criminals  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 2  Probable Methods  Unauthorized Access, Social  Engineering, Abuse of personal  data, Remote Command Execution,  Malicious Activity  Topics for future SPD  AI security best practices,  end-user awareness  campaigns, secure data  processing standards,  common hybrid threat  combinations, guidelines on  developing trustworthy  technology  Probable Impacts  Privacy breaches, outages,  failures/malfunctions  Relevant strategic objectives: SO1, SO3, SO4, SO7  Combatting hybrid threats can be achieved through  activation of a variety of cybersecurity communities (SO1),  including incident response entities (SO3).  This increase  in hybrid attacks with new technologies requires cutting- edge capabilities (SO4) and knowledge (SO7.)  Example: Hackers are hired by a corporation to  investigate the new technology being developed by a  competitor. In their quest, they are able to retrieve  metadata, view code, and set up a machine learning  algorithm that continuously collect changes to the code  and then continuously accesses user account to prevent  monitoring systems from recognizing that the attacker is  in the network. In parallel they obfuscate the activity by  spreading fake news about insider trading and industrial  espionage from a third competitor by dropping fake  evidence of physical intrusion.  3.8 SKILL SHORTAGES #8  In 2022, the skill shortage27 contributes to most security breaches, severely impacting  businesses, governments, and citizens. By 2030, the skill shortage problem will not have been  solved. While the growth of unfilled cybersecurity jobs has levelled off, the skill shortage28 will  continue to pose a significant risk to society and governments. One relevant factor that will  impact the threat in 2030 is organizational willingness (and resources) to expand staff and  develop talents. The implementation of cybersecurity features will also suffer due to lack of skills  and overall maturity of cybersecurity features, even if the willingness is there.  As technology integrates more and more into our lives, average citizens may become apathetic  - all their communications and actions are managed somewhere else, over which they have no  26 (Shein, 2022)  27 (Fortinet, 2022)  28 (Hurst, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  19  control. This risk will be compounded by the interaction between new technologies and legacy  technology for which the workforce has not been trained – knowledge of legacy technologies is  not being passed on quickly enough to manage the risk in 2030. On top of the legacy skill  shortage, new technologies like smart devices, artificial intelligence, space-based infrastructure  or quantum computing will pose new cybersecurity challenges. Criminal groups will target  organizations, institutions, and companies that have a large amount of unfilled cybersecurity  jobs to find vulnerabilities and exploit these vulnerabilities for financial gain.  Threat actors will analyse organizational skillsets and deficiencies to gain insight into  weaknesses in defence, potential vulnerabilities, and opportunities to exploit their systems and  networks. Public job advertisements often give detailed information as to which skillsets are  currently lacking within a company or a government agency, giving the attackers insights into  possible entry vectors. In addition, attackers will try to gain open- and closed-source information  to gather organizational and network information to spot legacy systems with known  vulnerabilities. For example, a job posting from a local power plant may share the vendor and  product type for which they need support- this provides threat actors with ample time to  investigate product-specific vulnerabilities. Also, in the development of new technologies, the  employees qualified to implement security do not have enough bandwidth to apply security  before go-to-market due to lack of overall skilled workers.

This includes with regard  to policies (SO2), incident response (SO3), and tangible  capabilities and competencies (SO4).  Example: The skill shortage leads to an increase of  online job advertisements that tell attackers the  technologies that each organization is using and the  approximate number of empty positions. A state-  sponsored actor may use this to their advantage as a  part of a larger campaign to tamper with critical  infrastructure in another country.  3.9 CROSS-BORDER ICT SERVICE PROVIDERS AS A SINGLE POINT OF  FAILURE #9  In 2030, technological interconnectedness will be strengthened. The physical-cyber border will  be further blurred as infrastructure sectors such as transport, healthcare, electric grids and  industry29 are increasingly reliant on ICT service providers to connect to the internet and to  manage all inter-device communications. Even though their responsibility for upholding a  functioning society was significant back in 2022, their importance grows even more by 2030.  ICT service providers and their infrastructure – including satellite technology – are the backbone  of society and therefore may be a single point of failure. Smart cities are an example of how  even more critical operational networks will be in 10 years. Hence, these service providers will  likely be targeted by governments, terrorists and criminal groups. Exploiting vulnerabilities in  29 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  20  their infrastructure, using hybrid attacks to get access to their networks, endpoints, data centres  or other physical components of the ICT infrastructure could cripple cities and whole regions.  Foreign governments may try to use this to destabilize nations, terrorists to fuel fears and  achieve political goals, and criminal groups to hold cities hostage.  ICT infrastructure30 is likely to be weaponized during a future conflict. ICT providers will have to  defend against state-sponsored, persistent and highly developed attacks that draw on insights  from governmental intelligence agencies and offensive cyber capabilities. The resources that  would be dedicated to such an attack are significant – attackers would take time to evade  traditional response functions and will likely deploy hybrid attacks for initial access and newly  developed exploits with command-and-control capabilities. Because the ICT sector connects so  many critical services, it will be targeted by techniques like backdoors, physical manipulation,  and denials of service due to the scale of damages that can be achieved.

Trust in critical  infrastructure providers is essential (SO5).  Example: A state-sponsored actor aims to temporarily  cripple a region during an active conflict by installing  malware that disrupts all critical functions of the ICT  provider. Without operational cities, roadways, and  communication channels, the region is essentially  crippled without the ability for civilians to go about their  daily lives and the responsible parties limited in their  ability to maintain defense monitoring systems and to  collaborate to develop response options and methods  for bringing the necessary systems back online.  3.10 ABUSE OF AI - #10  AI can be manipulated from its inception and throughout its lifecycle through training  manipulation and adversarial attacks31 (among others). Unconscious bias in AI is a well-known  concern in the early 20s, however in 2030 there is a real threat of intentional manipulating AI  algorithms and training data. Likewise, any corrupted training of AI algorithms may train them to  make incorrect decisions with respect to the high-risk sectors (defined by the European  Commission32).  30 (Allianz, 2016)  31 (West, 2017)  32 (Commission, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  21  Threat actors will try to leverage the power of AI applications to shape the decision-making  outcomes and to gather information on potential victims. For example, they may tamper with  training data sets to create dysfunctional and harmful AI applications – this may include crowd  sourced data projects. AI can be used to sift through the mass amounts of data about  individuals to correlate data points about them - the presence of this capability may lead to an  increase in stalkerware. Further, attackers may use AI for offensive or criminal purposes – such  as analysing user behaviour to create highly developed spear phishing or hybrid campaigns.  AI can be used to enhance many nefarious activities such as: creation of disinformation and  fake content, bias exploitation, collecting biometrics and other sensitive data, military robots,  data poisoning, etc.  Threat #10 - Score 12  Probable Threat  Actors  State-sponsored actors, cyber  criminals, hackers-for-hire  Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 3, 5  Probable Methods  Spoofing, Denial of Service,  Malicious code, Unauthorized  Access, Targeted Attacks, Misuse  of Information, Man in the Middle  Attack  Topics for future SPD  AI security best practices,  guidelines for secure  software, AI regulation,  certification schemes,  Detection of training data  manipulation  Probable Impacts  Biased decision-making, privacy  violations  Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO5  The inclusion of AI topics in cybersecurity policies (SO2),  rapid operational support (SO3), and trusted certification  schemas (SO5) will help to reduce the risk of AI-related  threats.  Example: A state-sponsored actor wants to sow discord  in a population before an election and manipulates the  learning data of a law enforcement algorithm to target  specific populations, causing widespread protests and  violence. They are also able to deduct information about  the political opponents themselves by using an AI  analysis of the individuals’ whereabouts, health history,  and voting history – the correlation of such personal data  will likely only be feasible with the use of AI tools.  3.11  ADDITIONAL THREATS  The following threats were included on the final prioritized threat list but based on the ranking  system were not in the top 10.  Table 3: 2030 Top threats continued  # Threat Name Threat Description  11  Increased digital currency-enabled  cybercrime  By 2030, digital currency-enabled cybercrime will increase rapidly.  Cryptocurrencies, and the broad market adoption of them, already  have enabled organized crime to expand their reach. Because digital  currencies will be very commonly used as an investment asset and  means of payment in European markets, organized crime may be able  to expand their targets. This means that cybercrime groups offering  professional services (cyber-attacks) will be better funded because of  an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of their efforts.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  22  12  Exploitation of e-health (and  genetic) data  The amount of genetic and health data increases tremendously by  2030 and is in the hands of many stakeholders in the public and private  sectors. Vulnerabilities in e-health devices and databases containing  very sensitive and/or genetic information may be exploited or used by  criminals to target individuals or by governments to control populations,  e.g., using diseases and genetic diversity as a reason for  discriminating against individuals. Genetic data may further be abused  to aid law enforcement activities like predictive policing or to support a  more regimented social credit system.  13  Tampering with deepfake  verification software supply chain  By 2030, deepfake technology will be widely used. It may be used as a  form of harassment, evidence tampering, and provoking social unrest.  Although there will likely be a rapid influx of verification software that  analyses videos and voice to verify the identity of individuals33, the  urgent market demand leads to programmers cutting corners. This  software will be highly targeted by anyone wishing to use deepfakes for  illegal or unethical purposes.  14 Attacks using quantum computing  In 2030 quantum computing resources will be made more widely  available, allowing threat actors to use quantum computing to attack  existing deployments of public key cryptography. Likewise, there is a  risk that threat actors collect sensitive encrypted data now, aiming to  decrypt it once quantum computing is accessible. This is especially  relevant for current digital IDs that use asymmetric cryptography to  authenticate.34  15  Exploitation of unpatched35 and  out-of-date systems within the  overwhelmed cross-sector tech  ecosystem  Everything-as-a-service leads to a multitude of tools and services that  require frequent updates and maintenance by both consumers and  providers. This combined with the skill shortage presents a difficult to  manage surface of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat  actors. Furthermore, the complexity of the supply chain fosters  confusion on where responsibilities for security lie. For governments,  this creates more backdoors for espionage while cyber-criminals can  exploit the unpatched and outdated services for financial gains. This is  especially true when critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private  sector or when national security data is reliant on singular private  entities.  16  AI disrupting/enhancing cyber  attacks  Escalation as a result of AI-based tools. Attackers will use AI-based  technologies to launch attacks. In order to defend against those attacks  and even to launch counter measures, there must also be defensive  AI-based weapons. Behaviour of the AI in these cases is difficult to  test, measure and control – if speed of response is valued.  17  Malware insertion to disrupt food  production supply chain  Due to increased automatization and digitalization of food production,  food supply chains36 can be disrupted by a range of threat actors with  medium-high resources. Denial of service attacks on packaging plants,  for example, can prevent continued food operations; processed food  manufacturing tools may be manipulated to change the compounds in  the food itself. Attacks like these can lead to a food shortage, economic  disruptions, and in the worst case, poisoning.  33 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  34 (Smart, 2021)  35 (Micro, 2019)  36 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  23  18  Technological incompatibility of  blockchain technologies  Until 2030, several regionally based blockchain technologies are  created by different groups of governments to create an international  \"gold standard\". This is driven by a societal lack of trust in blockchain  that has accumulated over the last years.  Each technology group aims  to gain a competitive advantage. This gives rise to a period of  technological incompatibility of blockchain technology which leads to  failures, malfunctions, data loss and the exploitation of vulnerabilities at  the interfaces of the different blockchains. This creates challenges for  ecosystem management and data protection, furthers distrust, and  negatively affects trade and GDP growth.  19 Disruptions in public blockchains  Blockchain has been implemented in nearly all aspects of society in  203037. Unfortunately, security expertise in the area of blockchain did  not advance significantly, creating a slew of vulnerabilities that may be  exploited in the future. Locally unavailable blockchain technology will,  for example, prevent access to voting, legal transactions, and even  security systems. Another possible attack vector is exploited by  partitioning the bitcoin network by hijacking IP address prefixes. This  can cause, for example, duplicated spending and thus economic  damage.  20  Physical impact of  natural/environmental disruptions  on critical digital infrastructure  The increased severity and frequency of environmental disasters  causes several regional outages. Redundant back-up sites that  maintain the availability of critical infrastructure will also be affected.  21  Manipulation of systems  necessary for emergency  response  Manipulation of sensors with connections to emergency services may  overload services like ambulances, police, firefighters, etc. For  example, call centres may be overloaded with inauthentic calls or fire  alarms may be manipulated to injure specific individuals or to obscure  emergency response teams' ability to locate the issue. Similarly, mass  panics that overload emergency systems may also be provoked  through the use of social media.  37 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  24  4. 2030 TRENDS  To identify the threats, the project team initiated an in-depth research project on future trends as  a first step. Based on this research, the team created a long list of trends that was then  narrowed down, discussed and analysed in individual PESTLE-themed (political, economic,  social, technological, environmental, and legal) workshops by a diverse expert group38. As  following step, the threats named in the previous chapter were identified by cybersecurity  experts based on an examination of possible futures as derived from current and possible future  trends (in the form of science fiction prototypes and scenarios).  Below is an overview of the prioritized trends, color-coded based on their scores on impact and  likelihood (on a scale of 1-5). To simplify the image, the trends are rated based on a  combination (impact x likelihood) of the experts’ evaluations and have been assigned a  prioritization of “high, moderate or low”. The further inward the trends are positioned, the more  interconnected they are. For additional information on the connection between trends see figure  5.  Figure 4: PESTLE Trend Radar  Foresight is a multifaceted tool through which targeted collective wisdom can be collected and  through which a lot of insightful secondary data can be extracted. As participants evaluated  potential trends, the conversations also shifted towards relationships between the trends. These  references and relationships are visualized in the following graphic.  38 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  25  Figure 5: Interaction between trends  This image shows the connections that the experts made between the different trends during  the workshops. The trend names within the PESTLE39 dimensions have been translated into  trend IDs to simplify the image. The trend IDs shown in Figure 5 (above) can be found in the  section below.  In some cases, the relationship of one trend to other trends led to clustering, so new trend  labels were formulated to cover all the trends within them. In other cases, the trends were  considered separately and commonalities between the trends were identified. These similarities  are illustrated in this visualization by the gray connecting lines. Particularly salient links between  trends are connected by a red line. As described earlier, participants rated the trends according  to their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence - those that were rated particularly  highly are outlined in red.  4.1 PRIORITIZED TRENDS  This section documents the key trends from each PESTLE dimension. The trends listed below  were the trends that received the highest likelihood and greatest impact ratings during the  workshops. Note that each trend may fall into more than one category, but it is listed based on  the expert working group that ranked it as a priority.  These trends are developments to watch in the next 8 years as they impact cybersecurity  threats.  They were however, not selected based on their ability to impact cybersecurity but  rather on their impact on society as a whole.  39 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  26  P1 The increasing geopolitical influence of ICT providers  Big communication and technology companies have massively expanded their power in recent decades and are increasingly  gaining political power (Taddeo, 2017), which also affects other environments like the economy and society. This increasing  power amplifies the geopolitical power of communication providers and puts their geopolitical relevance in a new light.  Other categories: Economic  P2 Increased political power of non-state actors  Increasing global interconnectedness will continue to foster interactions between non-state actors beyond the state's  capacity to control them, thus challenging traditional governance in multiple ways. The growing role of non-state actors is  changing the political environment, influencing economy, society and more. The influence of social movements such as  climate marches has increased, affecting political outcomes. New non-state actors such as digital communities, institutions  and social media platforms are gaining power and influencing all levels of governance.  Other categories: Economic, Social  P3 The increasing relevance of (cyber) security in elections  With increasing digitization and the use of information and communication technology, there are new influencing factors that  can affect election ecosystems. Today's voting ecosystems encompass more than traditional paper-based processes. With  new technologies, electoral ecosystems (Petrov, 2018) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity gaps as they  offer attackers a larger attack surface. Not only the core electoral systems could be a target, but also election administrators  and entities related to the election campaign itself such as political parties, news organizations, social media platforms, email  platforms and donor groups are potential targets.  Other categories: Technological, Social  P4 The public health issues arising from the mental health problems of victims of cybersecurity  With the increase of our data on the Internet and the increasing need to use online platforms and digital services, a state of  exhaustion in the population could occur due to emerging cyber security gaps. Increasing cybersecurity challenges will lead  to greater vulnerability of the general population, resulting in increasing public health risk from cybersecurity.

Attackers are increasingly demonstrating high skillsets and a robust  understanding of operational technology and industrial control systems engineering and conduct more and more attacks that  gain access and negatively impact operations and human safety.  Other categories: Technological, Legal  P6 Increased technological dependency of governments on private sector technology companies  With the current pandemic and ongoing digital transformation, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on private  sector technology companies, their products and services. As the power of tech companies increases, some tech companies  have more power than some national states. Increasing interdependence between government and companies makes it  more difficult to control and identify separations, leading to increased dependence on the private sector, and in many cases  single entities within the private sector.  Other categories: Legal, Economic  P7 COVID speeds up digitalization in public sector  In times of a pandemic, when chains of infection have to be traced and everyday processes have to be digitized, the digital  transformation of the public sector is accelerating rapidly (ENISA, Raising Awareness of Cyber Security, 2020). The  coronavirus pandemic is forcing local governments to offer services online. In addition, e-government technologies such as  digital registration offices are replacing human interaction between citizens and government officials with technology.  Other categories: Technological, Social  P8 The increasing digital dependencies and cyber vulnerability of populations  The population increasingly uses technology to manage everything from public services and business processes to private  matters and becomes highly dependent on it. Many operations and processes can no longer be managed without technology  today and therefore make technology indispensable for the population. The increasing use of digital services and products  leads to more personal data that is exposed on the Internet. This reliance on technology on one side and the provision of  information on the other side poses a threat and makes the population more vulnerable  Other categories: Legal  P O  L IT  IC A  L  T  R E  N D  S  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  28  Impact:  1-5 Likelihood:  1-5  P9 The growing pressures on a reduced cybersecurity workforce  Mental health can have a critical impact on industry professionals. IT systems are constantly being attacked, so the workload  remains high and is relentless. As cyber-criminals innovate new methods of penetrating systems at a fast rate, the challenges  to keep up are intense. The European labour shortage in information security means that many departments are operating  with half the staff needed which increases stress and pressure exponentially.  Other categories: Social  EC1 The rise of smart cities  European and global cities are gradually becoming smarter with the use of digital solutions to make cities safer, more efficient  and sustainable. Especially countries in the Middle East and Asia have been very proactive in developing smart cities, with  a tendency to build them from the ground up while developed cities around the world are actively incorporating technology  into existing environments and launching smart solutions. The drive of sustainability and efficiency leverages the usage of  technology and data. The aim is to create improvements across infrastructure (ENISA, Guidelines for Securing IOT, 2020),  mobility, energy, healthcare and beyond. Sustainable development of urban areas is a challenge of key importance. It  requires new, efficient, and user-friendly technologies and services, in particular in the areas of energy, transport and ICT.  Other categories: Technological, Legal  EC2 Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies is growing  Distributed ledger technology, more commonly known as blockchain technology, refers to the technological infrastructure  and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network  that's spread across multiple entities or locations. Blockchain technologies have an integral role in the development and  growth of new technologies and solutions. They enable interoperability across different virtual platforms, allowing digital  collectability of assets and enable digital proof of ownership.

The pandemic amplified the popularity of the Gig economy since  the current health crisis disrupted many businesses and altered the course of many companies. The current interest in the  gig economy has also been spurred by the application of digital technology and the use of platforms. When talking about the  gig economy, the subject is usually platform economy—and more specifically platform work. App-based transportation—like  Uber, food delivery, or other consumer-facing services—represents particularly visible changes to work and offer flexible  working models. The platformization of this work is drastically reshaping the gig economy—with the potential to create  widespread impacts across the entire economy.  Other categories: Social, Legal  EC4 Collecting and analyzing data to assess user behavior is increasing, especially in the private sector  An increasing amount of companies have started to monitor, track and follow people in virtually every aspect of their lives.  The behaviors, movements, social relationships, interests, weaknesses and most private moments of billions are now  constantly recorded, evaluated and analyzed in real-time. Internet of Behaviors (IoB) is the collection of data on the use of  gadgets to obtain information on user behavior, interests, and preferences. The data can serve as a benchmark for mapping  customer behavior and aims to properly understand and apply data to create and promote products. It will continue to  influence how organizations interact with people. IoB can collect, combine and process data from a variety of sources.  Other categories: Legal, Social, Political  EC5 Increasing reliance on automation and connectivity of sustainable energy production  The use of renewable energy will increase over the next decade as EU governments and societies seek to avoid the rising  costs, environmental and political impacts of fossil fuel dependency. Accompanying this shift is an increasing automation of  equipment used to harvest such energy, such as solar panel arrays and wind generators, by the companies that operate  them. The main driver for increasing automation will be to reduce the costs normally associated with the operation and  maintenance, such as inspection and repair, of these plants. This increasing reliance on IoT devices to monitor, manage  and perform maintenance on assets will expose the EU's energy sector to a variety of cybersecurity challenges.  Other categories: Technological  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  30  Impact:  1-5 Likelihood:  1-5  EC6 Increasing reliance on outsourced IT Services  European IT outsourcing to external service providers has rapidly increased due to the pandemic (Krajewski, 2021). Due to  the increasing gap of available IT jobs and the number of IT professionals, there is an increasing need to fill important IT  tasks. An option for European companies, which provides flexibility, is to outsource IT tasks to offshore providers. As  companies are moving into the cloud (quicker) and need tailor-made solutions, the need for IT professionals increases  further. Since the shortage affect most European countries, and most European developers prefer jobs within their own  country, companies increasingly recruit talent from outside Europe. The presence of different migrant communities - a so-  called diaspora - adds to the diversity of opportunities on the European market. These outsourced providers can be domestic,  nearshore or offshore. European companies prefer to outsource services to providers within the same country, a practice  also known as domestic outsourcing. When outsourcing abroad, they prefer providers in nearshore locations because of  proximity, language, cultural similarities and minimal time differences. As prices in nearshore countries in for example Central  and Eastern Europe rise, offshoring to developing countries becomes more attractive.  Other categories: Social  EC7 Increasing danger of resource bottlenecks of critical raw materials for strategic technologies and sectors in the EU  With the increasing use of crucial technology (batteries, fuel cells, robotics and more), maintaining access to vital resources  such as energy, raw materials, pharmaceuticals and technological components such as micro-chips is vital for the EU’s  economic prosperity. The emerging on new technologies in the course of digitization requires new resources to provide  hardware for e-cars, sensors or other technologies. Currently, EU industry is largely dependent on imports for many raw  materials and in some cases is highly exposed to vulnerabilities along the supply chain.  Other categories: Technological  EC8 The rise of Web3 leverages various emerging technologies incl. blockchain  Web3 is the third iteration of the internet and will be defined by open-source technology, utilizing blockchain technology to  be trustless and permissionless. Web3 harnesses blockchain to “decentralize” management thus reducing the control of  big (tech) corporations and making it more democratic. With Web3, activities and data would be hosted on a computer  network using blockchain instead of corporate servers, based on ubiquitous high-speed access and the development of  web-based business applications at the enterprise level. Internet activities would be represented by crypto wallets and  websites hosted through decentralised applications, digital applications running on a blockchain network. This enables  wireless interaction between machines, vehicles, devices, sensors and many other devices via the internet.

Even in European countries, internet traffic has increased strongly within the past couple of years and has increased  access and traffic in rural areas. Internet traffic has skyrocketed over the past year due to more IoT devices and hence the  increased connectivity between devices such as smartphones, wearable technology, automobiles and more. Remote work,  video streaming, video calls and online shopping are some of the activities that have grown the most and have contributed  to such increase  Other categories: Social, Technological  S1 Advancement of deep fake technology  Deepfake is a combination of the words 'deep learning’ and ‘fake’ and refers to an AI-based technology used to create or  alter images, audio, and video resulting in synthetic content that appears authentic (Shein, 2022). With the world more  connected by digital media and the costs for creating deepfakes slumping dramatically, this emerging technology is gaining  more importance.

The ability to detect electrical activity in the brain, and to control it, will change society in profound  ways. Patterns of electrical activity in the brain can reveal a person’s cognition. New methods to stimulate specific brain  circuits can treat neurological and mental illnesses and control behavior. The ability to interrogate and manipulate electrical  activity in the human brain promises the monitoring of electrical activity in the brain.  Other categories: Technological, Legal  S4 The rise of digital authoritarianism  The internet is growing less free around the world, and democracy itself is atrophied under its influence. Disinformation and  propaganda disseminated online have poisoned the public sphere. The unbridled collection of personal data has broken  down traditional notions of privacy. And a cohort of countries is moving toward digital authoritarianism by embracing the  Chinese model of extensive censorship and automated surveillance systems. For the first time since 2004, the  Transformation Index (BTI) (Stiftung, 2022) counts more autocratically governed states than democracies.

While countries are at different points in their  COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school  closures due to the pandemic. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning,  whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Even before COVID-19, there was already high growth  and adoption in education technology, with global EdTech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall  market for online education projected to reach $350 Billion by 2025 (Detecon, 2022).

To keep up in today’s rapidly changing environment, organizations need solutions that enable  them to create new business processes, products, and services. The adoption of the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) model  is increasing and has become an indispensable asset for sustaining businesses. As a result, companies become increasingly  dependent on these providers. By hiring offshore software developers, IT suppliers and everything-as-a-service, companies  can eliminate office space and reduce all associated costs.

With more than  1000 new satellites expected to launch each year over the next year, a robust satellite control infrastructure is gaining more  and more importance. GPS is increasingly integrated into sectors' operations such as aviation, railway, maritime operations  and other infrastructure because it is accurate, available, reliable, and provided at no cost to users. The ground-based  infrastructure for a satellite is responsible for a number of support functions, such as commanding the spacecraft, monitoring  its health, tracking the spacecraft to determine its present and future positions, collecting mission data, and distributing these  data to users. A key component of the infrastructure is the ground station, which is an Earth-based point of contact with a  satellite and a distributor of user data.

Recent examples of algorithmic biases based on gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity in AI  technology have demonstrated instances when AI abandon the principles of inclusivity, safety, ethics, privacy,  trustworthiness, and explainability. These findings may lead to the massive risk that future societies not only continue to  project historical human biases, but also risk exacerbating those biases.

The increasing implementation of technological developments have complicated  the ability of law enforcement to gain access to and gather relevant data for criminal investigations. One of the most  prominent examples in this regard remains the widespread use of encryption, which contains many benefits from a security  perspective but is also a development that criminals have gratefully used to their advantage. New challenges for law  enforcement authorities will arise with the gradual onset of 5G in Europe because the technology employs 256-bit encryption  that allows for unprecedented levels of privacy and anonymization in mobile communications networks With the increase in  volume and importance of cross-border investigations in the EU, ensuring the admissibility of evidence gathered in another  Member State at trial is crucial − both for efficient law enforcement and for the protection of fundamental rights. At present,  the rules on the collection, use, and admissibility of evidence are left to the laws of national criminal procedure of the Member  States. These differ extensively as to the collection, use, admissibility, and nullity of evidence and thereby act as an obstacle  to the use of cross-border evidence.  Other categories: Technological, Political  L3 The capacity to control data about oneself (individual, company or state) is becoming more desirable and more  technically difficult  With the increasing use of digital products and services, there is more personal or sensitive data on the Internet, which is  being tracked, including biometric, genetic, and behavioural information (ENISA, Guidelines for SMEs on the security of  personal data processing, 2017). More and more EU consumers are concerned about how their data is being used online  and are calling for the ability to not only access and modify their data, but to control the access and usage rights. Since there  is no way to own the rights to personal data and to manage access to this data, this becomes technically more difficult for  the users.

Ensuring compliance to European standards is becoming an ever more complex task.  Europe’s competitiveness, technological sovereignty, ability to reduce dependencies and protection of EU values,  including social and environmental ambitions, will be evermore challenging. To face this challenge the EU will start  regulations/legislation firms and technology more.  Other categories: Political, Technological  L5 Most major technological players continue to reside outside of the EU  Software engineering and digital, data-driven companies form the backbone of the future economy and digital society  (Madiega, 2020). In these markets, US and China are by far the biggest players. Besides SAP, Europe does not have any  enterprises of comparable strength and only a significantly lower number of startups and venture capital being invested  in the region. Moreover, current trends in technology innovation and entrepreneurship intensify this power-imbalance. This  means European data is being processed by companies outside the EU.  Other categories: Economical, Political  L6 Rising drive towards EU strategic autonomy  An increasing number of politicians and analysts argue that the European Union should boost its ‘strategic autonomy’  and/or develop a higher degree of ‘European sovereignty’. These concepts encompass a greater potential for  independence, self-reliance and resilience in a wide range of fields – such as defense, trade, industrial policy, digital  policy, economic and monetary policy, and health policy – following a series of events in recent years that have exposed  Europe’s vulnerability to external dependencies.

Remote Maintenance  describes maintenance, inspection and repair work without personal presence at the object and thus removing the human  element from these processes. Drones are being used to perform inspections on critical infrastructure sectors such as blade  maintenance in the wind energy sector, roadways and railways inspection or in agriculture.  Other categories: Technological  EN2 Diminishing availability of fresh water  About 70% of the world’s freshwater consumption is for agriculture and food demand is rising (Harvey, 2018). The global  population is increasing and becoming richer, which will significantly increase global food demand in the coming decades.  By 2030, the global middle class is estimated to grow from 2 billion today to 4.9 billion and this will significantly increase  the water required for food production. As people move from low income to middle class, demand increases for meat  products which have higher water requirements than crops. Other factors that accelerate this trend is the increased  frequency of drought due to climate change, increased energy requirements and inadequate water infrastructure.  Freshwater scarcity affects all parts of the environment, society and economy. This leads to crop failures, increased fuel  consumption by companies that rely on hydroelectric power, poor soil quality or increased criminal activities such as war,  robbery and theft.  Other categories: Social, Economic, Political  EN3 There is an increasing number of devices that are not (or are unable to be) regularly patched  Updates and patching will grow exponentially with the increase in the number of overall devices (Micro, 2019). With the  increasing application of IoT, more and more devices are being used, making it more difficult to update all devices in a  timely manner. Ability to patch systems being deployed within critical infrastructure without disruptions may also continue  to be a problem going into the future.

Operations will be  done remotely, processes will be automated. A farmer's skills will increasingly be a mix of technological skills and  knowledge of biology. The exposure of agricultural infrastructure and operations to a connected environment will lead  to challenges in ensuring the security of food supplies. Also, the dependency of farmers on niche technologies  increases. New technologies are likely to intensify exploitation and deepen marginalization for most vulnerable.  Other categories: Technological, Economic  EN5 The increasing threat of extreme weather events due to climate change  Statistics in the latest IPCC report show, that there will be an increase in the number of extreme weather events and  that these events will become more extreme, causing more damage than previously observed (IPCC, 2022). Also, the  EU is expected to experience more extreme events and increased exposure and vulnerability to disasters. Climate  change is bringing along more extreme weather events, sea-level rise and changes in the geographical distribution of  some infectious diseases. Continued urbanization and development in hazardous areas have been putting more people  and wealth in harm’s way. Urban settings are vulnerable to even more catastrophic impacts of disasters such as floods,  heatwaves or epidemics.  Other categories: Economic, Social, Technological  EN6 Mass extinction and loss of biodiversity continues  Humans alive today are witnessing the beginning of the first mass extinction in 65 million years. Scientists believe that  at the current rate, the world could be on track to lose that number within a few centuries. Over the next few decades  alone, at least 1 million species are at risk of being wiped out. That's according to an estimate in a landmark report  published in 2019. The results of a collapse in biodiversity is complex and can lead to a loss of food security, soil fertility,  an increase in water shortages and natural disasters or increase the risk of pandemics.

Power grids around the world are becoming more decentralized, resulting in  distributed energy resources (DER) that are transforming energy markets. The DER (SAP, 2022) market has  expanded annually by double digits, with the greatest gains coming from sales of power storage equipment,  photovoltaic systems, and systems that manage energy and the response to demand. And recent policy moves—  including new energy savings policies in the European Union—will likely further fuel demand from businesses in the  DER segment.  Other categories: Economic, Technological  EN8 The increasing energy consumption of digital infrastructure  Digitalization describes the growing application of ICT across the economy, leading to increasing volumes of data,  progress in advanced analytics, and greater connectivity between humans, devices and machines (IEA, 2017). Digital  devices potentially offer improvements in energy efficiency. This long-term trend towards energy efficiency is  counteracted, by the rebound effect. More people streaming videos for a longer period of time require greater amounts  of energy and therefore emit more CO2 as a result. The same applies to audio data, images or the video conferences,  which causes large increases in energy use. The increasing use of the oldest and most well-known cryptocurrency,  Bitcoin, guzzles energy due to its special consensus algorithm and hence adds to an increase in energy use.  Other categories: Technological  EN9 Industrial switch from fossil fuels to hydrogen or electric (demand)  A growing number of companies in Europe and elsewhere are switching to renewable energy for their manufacturing  plants, stores and office facilities. One of the main drivers behind companies' decision to go \"green\" is to reduce the  environmental impact of business operations by cutting down their greenhouse gas emissions.  E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  A L  T R  E N  D S  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  41  MAINTAINING AN EMERGING  THREAT LISTING  The emergence of new threats is complex, fast-paced, and sometimes unpredictable given the  rapid influx of cyber incidents. This exercise should therefore be repeated in a few years to  account for changes to the threats and general societal changes. In many cases the likelihood  of occurrence and relevance of the individual threats may change suddenly, due to sudden  innovations, societal changes or other unforeseeable incidents. Hence, it is recommended to  define and implement a process to maintain a listing of emerging threats and to monitor the  threats presented in this report.  For most organizations looking to identify their own specific threat landscape for the future, we  recommend breaking it down into three workstreams: data collection, collaborative analysis, and  synthesis40. Data collection takes place throughout the year, the latter two workstreams will  need to occur close to one another with a timeline of approximately one month.  4.2 DATA COLLECTION (AKA HORIZON SCANNING)  Throughout the year, a group of individuals briefed on the previous project will collect evidence  of new trends, events, or drivers of change that alter the analysis (emergence of a new trend or  changes to the threat’s likelihood). The data collection should be tackled on a centralization  data platform to collect events and trends. The database should be open access and trend  information can be from other trend reports, scientific papers and journals, vulnerability  warnings from vendors, media reports or internal trend intelligence etc. Where possible, trends  or new information may come from other sources such as hackathons, simulation games, or  consumer protection organizations. The best information is gathered by a large and diverse  community with varying perspectives.  The data collected do not necessarily need to be trends – it may be events with the potential to  create new threats or alter existing ones, like technological disruptions (e.g. operationalization  of deep fakes), political destabilization / stabilization (e.g. expansion of Ukraine conflict to other  European nations), etc.  Data points may include sudden crises – these would not be analyzed as a part of this process.  There is, however, a recommended process for innovative shorter-term planning in ENISA’s  Foresight Challenges report.  4.3 COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS  Once a year, a workshop takes place to discuss collected trends or events that could alter the  threat analysis with experts from PESTLE dimensions and cybersecurity. Because of the  interdisciplinary nature of the context of the trends (PESTLE), it is recommendable to have a  workshop with experts from each PESTLE-dimension and also cybersecurity experts. The  people chosen to participate in this workshop should be involved in the ongoing data collection  – this ensures continuity and commitment.  40 (ENISA, Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  42  4.4 SYNTHESIS  The final stage is taking the findings from the workshops and comparing them with the previous  threat report. The listing should then be updated with qualifying justifications why a new threat  has emerged, changed, or been removed.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  43  A METHODOLOGY  Based on the use case titled “Identification of Future and Emerging Challenges,41” described on  page 32 of ENISA’s 2021 report on Foresight Challenges, the methodology for this exercise  was designed to identify relevant transformations, document possible future states, and to  identify drivers of change and threats for the year 2030. To ensure that the aims of the exercise  were in accordance with ENISA’s specifications and proposed timeframe, the approach  described for the use case had to be modified, reducing the activities in scope and complexity.  Additionally, a structure to manage the large amount of researched information and collected  knowledge on the future had to be developed, to support the methodology. Both proposed  amendments to the framework were aimed at reducing the time of execution to five or six  months, as opposed to one year.  Figure 6: Identification of future and emerging challenges use case, as defined in the  ENISA Foresight Framework  Defining the goal and framework of the foresight project is fundamental to the exploration and  research of trends. Therefore, the project’s time horizon was defined as 2030 and the  stakeholder scope was EU cybersecurity-relevant positions. Based on this scope, the project  41 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021)  Category Description  Objective  Produce an overview of emerging trends and challenges  that will impact security (report)  Time Horizon 3 -5 years  Collaborating  Stakeholders  ENISA Working Group & Broader Public  Target Audience  General public, policymakers, cybersecurity professionals  Impact on Target  Audience  Stay up to date on future and emerging challenges; think  critically about the future  Level of Granularity General trends, directions, and topics.

In the exploration phase, the working group reviewed various sources and materials on trends.  Experts from each PESTLE dimensions reviewed, discussed and prioritized those trends, which  then defined the basis of the scenarios used for the threat identification and prioritization42. A  diverse foresight expert group reviewed and explored possible threats inside these scenarios by  using the method “Science Fiction Prototyping”. As last step, cybersecurity experts discussed  and prioritised those threats as final delivery for the report.  This chapter is a description of how the ENISA project team defined key terms within the  project. It will also help to establish a common vocabulary with the reader.  42 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  45  B FORESIGHT  INFORMATION MODEL  Dialogue, conversation quality, and engagement are the means by which ideas, experiences,  knowledge, beliefs, assumptions, and tendencies are shared throughout a foresight project.43  The creation of information and knowledge on the future requires foresight practitioners to unify  two different perspectives, one based on data and what can be proven, and one based on ideas  and perceptions.44 The team conducting this exercise observed an increase in the time required  to reach consensus when the participants lacked common ground or structure in their  interaction.45  To address the inherent issues associated with dialogue in foresight, the team crafted a  predefined information model. Although information models are most commonly associated with  software development practices, the team agreed that the use of a such a model could reduce  the variability of concepts during conversations and provide a shared space46 for the exercise  participants to synchronize their perceptions and ideas on potential futures. The information  model contains seven clearly defined entities used in foresight conversations, as well as the  focused relationships between each entity.  Figure 7: Foresight entity and relationship model  The basic entities of the model are megatrends, trends, events, technologies, actors, context,  and motivation. Drivers of change, the combined entity, arises from the combination of  technology, actor, and context or motivation. The definition of each entity and the elements it  contains are described in the table below.  43 (Chermack, 2011)  44 (Wack, 2014)  45 (Fosnot, 1996). “Scaffolding” is a concept proposed by Lev Vygotsky, which argued that the most effective learning  occurs when the learner and the expert jointly construct meaning (of an experience) through dialogue, thus drawing the  learner out to the potential level of performance.  46 (Schrage, 1999)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  46  Table 4: Foresight entities definitions  Entity Description  Megatrend  A shift in behaviour or attitude that has a global impact and  crosses multiple industries.47  Trend  A general tendency or direction of a development or change  over time. A trend may be strong or weak, increasing,  decreasing, or stable. There is no guarantee that a trend  observed in the past will continue in the future.48  Event A noteworthy happening involving social or natural actors49  Actor  A party that takes part in an affair or event.

B.1.1 Drivers of Change  Drivers of change are the interaction between structural features, institutions and agents, which  enables context-specific foundational factors that affect the capacity for reform and  opportunities for change. Therefore, the project team analysed trends and events for  technology, actors and context or motivation, which have a power relationship or an influence  and shaping trends or events.  Figure 8: Landscape of the Drivers of change  B.1.2 Megatrends  A shift in behaviour or attitude that has a global impact and crosses multiple industries.50  Megatrends are defined as large, social, economic, political, environmental or technological  change that is slow to form. Once in place, megatrends influence a wide range of catalysts,  activities, processes and perceptions, both in government and in society, possibly for decades.  They are the underlying forces that drive trends.51  As mentioned above, catalysts play an important role in the landscape of trends. Catalysts are  trends accelerating or deaccelerating megatrends, as defined by the ESPAS.52 The catalysts  impacting the cybersecurity sector were aligned with the trend list and their impact on  acceleration was discussed with the PESTLE workshop participants.  50 (Popova, 2017)  51 (Platform, Megatrend / Trend / Driver / Issue, 2014)  52 (ESPAS, 2022). Chapter 2  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  48  B.2 THREAT ANATOMY MODEL  This section will describe the methodological aspects and entities related to the threat anatomy  model used in later process stages of the framework to describe threats in the year 2030.  Figure 9: Threat anatomy model  The team defined a threat as a potential event or action, with an adverse impact on an asset,  organization or individual initiated by an actor. This definition was derived from ENISA’s,  CISA’s53, and CompTIA’s organizational definitions of threats.  The potential event or action could be the exploitation of a vulnerability. A vulnerability in this  context was defined as any system, structure, asset, or population particularly open to attack or  damage. The second characteristic of the threat definition was adverse impact. The team did  not provide any pre-defined impact categories to avoid limiting the workshop participants’  creativity in identifying the potential impact. Examples of adverse impact were disruption (of  services), financial or physical damage, breach of privacy or decreasing trust of citizens. For the  third part of the definition, the team asked the workshop participants what part of society would  be impacted by the event. Neither of the affected subjects or objects (asset, organization or  individual) were defined narrowly. An asset, therefore, can be understood as anything with  value – whether that is a technical or intangible asset. An organization could be a private  company or a governmental organization. The last element of the threat definition was the  threat actor, for which the team had not defined any categories like state-sponsored actors,  criminal groups, or hackers-for-hire. These categories were added to the threats after the threat  identification workshops took place and were combined with potential motivations of the  specified threat actor.  53 (ENISA, Glossary of Terms., 2018)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  49  C TREND ANALYSIS  C.1 APPROACH & PROCESS  As previously introduced, the team identified four key steps to identify cybersecurity threats in  the year 2030: collaborative exploration & scoping, group workshops to forecast future  developments based on trends54, the identification of threats related to the future developments  and a prioritization of the threats to be explored. These four process steps were documented,  along with the required activities associated to each one into an approach to conduct the  exercise. Stakeholders from ENISA’s Ad Hoc Working Group for Foresight reviewed and  provided input on the planned approach.  Figure 10: Detailed approach for exercise  The approach is iterative in nature, incrementally building up knowledge and information during  each phase. This aggregate approach to constructing information on potential futures allowed  54 (West, 2017)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  50  the team conducting the exercise and the participants to unlock new perspectives at each  process step, opening exploration of relevant concepts through focused questioning.  C.1.1 Expert Participant Analysis  Experts who participated in this project (especially in the PESTLE trend workshops) were  individuals in ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight55 and the Ad Hoc Working Group on  Cyber Threat Landscapes. The experts who took part in the Threat Identification Workshop and  the Threat Prioritization Workshop were from EU CSIRTs Network and EU CyCLONe – the  Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network and ENISA stakeholder groups.  The experts interviewed as a part of this project represent a diverse group of individuals. All  stakeholders of ENISA’s, all participants had expertise in foresight, one of the PESTLE 56  framework elements, and/or cybersecurity.  Together they represented 19 EU Member States.  Figure 11: Geographical Distribution of Experts  Participants included individuals from academia, the European Commission, the EU Incident  Response and crisis management community, and national-level experts.  C.1.2 Collaborative Exploration  Once the approach was agreed upon, the first phase of the exercise targeted the identification  of general trends and analysis of interactions and influences of those trends on cybersecurity.  This research involved multiple evaluations of aspects included within the PESTLE framework  (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental), and exploration of trends,  key factors, and other forces that have an evident influence on each of the PESTLE  dimensions.57 The PESTLE dimensions provided a strategic, straightforward, and efficient  structure to conduct the analysis. We structured this research into three steps: collection &  preparation, collaborative exploration, and finalization. In the first step, we collected research  documents, reports, and studies from various sources, such as internal trend studies, open-  source studies, reports, publications of government sources, trend research agencies,  55 (ENISA, Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight On Emerging And Future Cybersecurity Challenges, 2021)  56 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  57 (Chermack, 2011).  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  51  cybersecurity companies, and consultancies. For each trend, a minimum of two reliable sources  was required for it to be added to the list.  The ENISA project team carried out the in-depth review to challenge the relevance and  description of each trend and to identify the trend pervasiveness, possible megatrend  relationships, and associated events. The decomposition into the determining characteristics  ensured a comprehensive basis for the experts’ assessments. This list of approximately 120  trends formed the basis for the foresight workshops. Experts invited to PESTLE workshops  were provided the list for feedback and preparation.  Group Forecast Workshops  The approach used for the second step – collaborative exploration – utilized expert panels in  the form of six workshops, one for each PESTLE dimension. Organizing ENISA’s efforts by  PESTLE dimensions and performing joint exercises leveraged the power of group dialogue and  knowledge. Each dimension involved five participants, who are academics, foresight, and  consulting experts from the fields of the corresponding PESTLE dimension, to ensure an  adequate mix between the wealth of opinions and efficiency.  In the interactive workshops, facilitated with the online collaboration tool Mural, the approach of  the diamond process58 was followed, divided into three steps: trend exploration and analysis,  prioritization, and exploration of prioritized trends.  In the first step, the participants were  debriefed on the objectives of the workshop and the project and were then asked to review the  gathered information on trends. They then provided feedback and discussed, augmented,  explored, and extended the list of trends. As a part of this step, the group explored and  discussed possible future events triggered by the trends and possible drivers of change.  This phase elicited many valuable insights and information on emerging trends. In order to  prioritize the trends, each participant voted for their top three trends, based on their opinion and  experience. Then, as a group, the participants were invited to assess the likelihood of  occurrence and potential impact on corresponding PESTLE field on a prioritization matrix.  58 (Thomas Grisold, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  52  Figure 12: Example of workshop trend prioritization board  In the second task of the workshop, the participants were invited to consider corresponding  events that each prioritized trend may trigger in the future (or has triggered already), possible  underlying drivers of change (actors, technology, and relevant context), and the elements that  may contribute to an increase of the trend’s priority (likelihood, impact).  Following the workshops, we initiated the synthesis of all written results on the collaboration tool  and the discussions. The experts' discussions also revealed clusters and connections beyond  the iteration of all descriptions, events, and underlying forces.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  53  Figure 13: Detailed approach for trend identification & prioritization workshops  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  54  D THREAT IDENTIFICATION  For the identification of future threats, the team drew on the threatcasting methodology. Often  used by military strategists, threatcasting is a (2011) foresight methodology59 that draws from  traditional futures studies and military strategic thinking.  The first phase of threat casting  consists of synthesizing research and identifying trends. This part was concluded with the  explorative research and the following PESTLE expert workshops.  D.1 SCENARIOS  The next phase in threatcasting is futurecasting, which includes the compilation of the research  data into a model of the future environment. The goal of the next step was to simulate possible  futures and for workshop participants to immerse themselves as deeply as possible within that  future. Using the insights and documented information from the PESTLE workshops, the project  team prepared and validated a pared down list of trends from which to build scenarios. The  grouped trends and driving factors were crafted into written scenarios to be evaluated by a  group of cybersecurity professionals.  Scenarios are consistent and coherent stories that illustrate visions and simulate a possible and  plausible future. In times of uncertainty, innovation and change, the use of scenario planning  techniques becomes increasingly important because of their usefulness when facing ambiguity  and complexity. Scenario planning stimulates strategic thinking and helps to overcome the  limitations of thinking60.  They are not meant to be an exact and realistic representation of the  future - they serve to open the field of vision and to uncover blind spots to discover possible  futures. This scenario development method helped avoid any bias or selection based on impact  or priorities. To design the scenarios, the project team numbered the trends that were prioritized  by the experts in the PESTLE workshops and decided to develop scenarios based on 5  randomly selected trends.  Each scenario combined the trends and defined a storyline of a possible future.  D.1.1 Scenario 1 – Blockchain, deepfakes, & cybercrime in a data-rich  environment  In 2030, distributed ledger61 (blockchain) technology has evolved, thus enabling simultaneous  access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner through a network spread over  multiple entities or locations. This technology enables interoperability across different virtual  platforms, allowing digital asset collectability and digital proof of ownership. Blockchain  technology has found widespread use in the financial, logistics, science, and health sectors.  It  significantly impacts the economy by increasing consumer trust and processing efficiency  because of its decentralization.  On the other hand, criminal groups have also benefitted from technological advances, such as  distributed ledger technology (e.g. crypto), the darknet, and privacy-focused platforms. New  technology is used to widen the groups’ negative impact, expand their activities' overall reach,  and use technology for sales and collaboration. This development has a major impact on the  legal sector.  Deep fake technology is also widely established and accessible to everyone; it enables the  creation of synthetic content that appears to be authentic. This technology's mainstream use  and distribution will transform sectors such as education, art, digital reconstruction, and the  59 (ENISA, Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, 2022)  60 (M. Stojanovic, 2015)  61 (ENISA, Blockchain, kein Datum)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  55  entertainment industry. However, its psychological effects will have a major impact on public  safety, election processes, and the spread of disinformation.  While technological options for privacy are available and widely used, the private sector is  highly dependent on using real-time analysis of customer data from various platforms and  sources to create and promote products and understand customer behavior and needs. The  data is constantly recorded, evaluated, analyzed and combined, and processed from various  platforms and sources. Organizations using this method widen their power and have a big  impact on the economy.  In addition to the widespread collection of customer data, organizations collect data from  infrastructure components via technologies like IoT and drones and analyze it with AI. With this  information, organizations perform inspections, predict failures, reduce workforce requirements,  and maintain (critical) infrastructure. This practice has a significant impact on companies in the  wind energy, logistics, insurance, roadway, railway, and telecommunication sectors.  D.1.2 Scenario 2 – Eco-friendly, sustainable, and interconnected smart  cities (non-state actors)  As the global population rose and became more prosperous, and the frequency of droughts  increased due to climate change, the diminishing availability of freshwater in 2030 is posing  challenges to all parts of the environment, society, and economy. Crop failures, poor soil quality,  increased fuel consumption, and dependency on hydroelectric power increased62, which led to  very high costs of living and an increase in poverty. Consequently, the level of criminal activities  including aggressions, robberies, and theft rose dramatically. The increasing energy  requirements and the construction of adequate water infrastructure for the new needs are an  integral part of planning future cities.  As part of the reconstruction of cities, sectors of infrastructure, mobility, energy, ICT, and  healthcare are actively incorporating technology into their existing environment and using data  for decision making and improvement. Smart cities create safer, more efficient, and sustainable  cities that are adapted to the environmental requirements of climate change. However, the  increased use of digital technology into the cities’ infrastructure also increased their  technological dependence.  With the increasing connectivity and possibilities to collaborate, the political power of non-state  actors has continued to grow – broadly impacting both the economy and society.  Digital  communities, institutions, and other actors are beyond the capacity of the state to control,  influencing all levels of governance and changing the political environment. In the  communication sector specifically, telecommunication providers63 have amassed significant  geopolitical, economic, and societal power. Furthermore, as all digitalized processes and  services are dependent on connectivity, both local and transcontinental communication  providers are gaining importance in Europe due to their use of new technology like space  connectivity and drones.  The new factors mentioned above have also affected election ecosystems. Core electoral  systems are being targeted by digital communities, institutions, and actors. However, the scope  of vulnerable components also include election administrators, political parties, news  organizations, social media platforms, email platforms, and donor groups – all of which have  become part of broader campaigns to manipulate democracy and call into question the  trustworthiness of elections.  62 (IPCC, 2022)  63 Please note that telecommunications providers will not be the only groups amassing huge amounts of power – the  greatest power shift will be towards content providers and hyperscalers.  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  56  D.1.3 Scenario 3 – More data, less control  The massive collection and use of data is driving innovation and decisions in all sectors.  Important data-driven decisions that impact people’s lives, livelihoods, and the natural  environment are automated in 2030. The delegation of tasks to automated decision-making  systems with little or no human intervention enables new solutions and improves overall  efficiency. On the other side, society, and especially sectors like the medical diagnostics sector,  the industry of autonomous vehicles, and financial institutes (to issue loans and credit cards)  are fighting ethical challenges. Data-based and automated decision-making could lead to  discriminatory and biased outcomes, privacy violations, and the undermining of human self-  determination.  (IoT) devices are the predominant vehicle for decision-making data. In 2030, organizations  using these devices face problems with patch management; it is especially difficult for critical  infrastructure64 providers to update the large number of devices without disruptions or breaches.  With the increasing use of digital products and services, more personal or sensitive data is  available on the Internet. This data includes biometric, genetic, and behavioral information and  is tracked across different online platforms. Unfortunately, data breaches, attacks, and online  bullying have become part of daily life and impact most EU citizens. This results in a severe  public health risk; victims struggle with PTSD, burnout, anxiety, depression, abuse, or even  suicidal behavior. More and more EU consumers are concerned about how their data is being  used online and are calling for increased control over data access and usage rights.  On the other hand, law enforcement has difficulties accessing stored data or using collected  data because of the implementation of end-to-end encryption of communication channels,  compliance with data privacy regulations, lack of technical capabilities. The implementation of  technological developments has complicated the ability of law enforcement to gain access to  and gather relevant data for criminal investigations. The widespread use of encryption, which  contains many benefits from a privacy and security perspective, is also a development criminals  are using to their advantage.  D.1.4 Scenario 4 – Sustainable energy, automated/short-term workforce  In 2030 the use of renewable energy has increased as EU governments and societies seek to  avoid the rising costs and environmental and political impacts of fossil fuel dependency65. Many  organizations automate equipment to harvest such energy, such as solar panel arrays and wind  generators. These organizations rely on IoT devices to monitor, manage, and perform  maintenance on these assets. This is exposing the EU's energy sector to a variety of  cybersecurity challenges.  As more people move to urban areas, the agriculture sector is automated because of  insufficiently available workforce in rural areas. This leads to increasing dependency on  technology and specialized skills and knowledge to manage agricultural output of countries. The  exposure of agricultural infrastructure and operations to a connected environment leads to  challenges in ensuring food security for the population of EU countries.  With the shortage of skilled workers, non-traditional, flexible work structures like freelancing  have become the norm (e.g., workers in the Gig-economy)66. The labor market is characterized  by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. The  platformization of work drastically reshapes the labor market, with an extreme gap developing  between high and low educated people and their income.  64 (Allianz, 2016)  65 (Union, 2022)  66 (Global, 2022)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  57  With the need for flexibility and enabling a remote workforce, organizations increasingly require  IT solutions that enable them to create new business processes, products, and services. To  increase efficiency and reduce costs, the adoption of the everything-as-a-service model is  highly popular and has become an indispensable asset for sustaining businesses. As a result,  companies have become increasingly dependent on these software service providers.  D.1.5 Scenario 5 – Legislation, bias, extinctions, & global threats  In 2030, the world’s population counts 8.5 billion people, with urban growth taking place in  regions relatively undisturbed in the last century67. Urban expansion, tropical deforestation, and  land-use change sped up mass extinction and the loss of biodiversity. This has caused the loss  of food security, soil fertility, an increased water scarcity in Europe.  Natural disasters and  pandemics have become commonplace.  The internet, once a medium of freedom and expression has increasingly become regulated  and censored, democracy itself has atrophied under its influence. Disinformation68 and  propaganda disseminated online have poisoned the public sphere and dialogue. The unbridled  collection of personal data has broken down traditional notions of privacy. Moreover, a cohort of  countries are moving toward digital authoritarianism, by embracing extensive censorship and  automated surveillance systems. Europe, targeting to protect its values, has tried to strengthen  its technological sovereignty, by reducing dependencies and including social and environmental  ambitions within its technical legislation. One technology already regulated in 2024 is machine  learning and artificial intelligence, which is massively invested in. However, with the use of AI-  based systems, Europe is being challenged with problems and incidents on data ownership,  sovereignty, data protection, and compliance, especially with algorithmic biases. These biases,  based on gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity in AI technology, led to the continuing historical  human biases and the exacerbation of those biases in societal practices.  Space has also become the main focus of governments and private investment, as space  technologies, data and services advanced in the 20s. But the dependence to this critical space  infrastructure in space and on the ground made Europe more vulnerable to both manmade and  natural threats.  D.2 SCIENCE FICTION PROTOTYPING (SFP)  Science Fiction Prototyping is a “thought-provoking method for arousing discussion in research  and foresight of emerging technology.69”  Science fiction prototypes (SFPs) are stories that  allow the workshop participants to explore a wide variety of futures and a different angle on  these futures. The SFP is based on a future (scenario), derived from five randomly picked  trends and a character (persona) in this scenario, to emphasize this specific point of view70.  From these models of different future environments, the five groups, each containing two to  three cybersecurity experts, were assigned one future model. Based on this model, the group  derived one persona and wrote a science fiction prototype (SFP), focusing on the layered  effects the future environment has on their persona. To characterize this person, the group  imagines a specific person living in that future of the scenario. The group visualizes in a  persona template who the character is, their questions, problems, goals, motivations and a  possible statement. This step was prepared by the participants and the project team before the  workshop71.  The preliminary work of science fiction prototyping created the basis for the Threat Identification  workshop, where the groups moved their focus from the models of the future environment and  67 (Nations, 2022)  68 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  69 (Kymalainen, 2016)  70 (Johnson, 2011)  71 (Institute, 2021)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  58  their persona to the sphere of cybersecurity threats. The participants explored and discussed  cybersecurity threats that included the different layers of their science fiction prototype. Based  on the threat definition – a potential event or action with an adverse impact on an asset,  organization or individual, carried out by an actor – the groups formulated and defined different  cybersecurity threats of the future.  These views of the future are effects-based models, meaning that the group is not modelling a  specific threat first; they are exploring the layered effects that this future will have on a single  person, related and an active part in this scenario. This creates a more detailed effects-based  model that ultimately helps the participants to find more threats but also opens the threat  definition in broader depth.  The moderators of the project team guided the discussion with questions and, if necessary,  randomly drew Security Cards that served as input for the threat discussion to explore more  layers of potential threats. Security Cards were created by the University of Washington in 2013  and aim to foster creative thinking on cybersecurity threats. There are four dimensions within  the Security Cards – human impact, adversary’s motivations, adversary’s resources, and  adversary’s methods72. The Security Cards were drawn by the moderator if the discussion  stalled, and the participants were unable to identify new threats. The moderator also  encouraged the group to switch perspectives and look at the future environment from the  adversary’s position to identify more threats.  The output of the Threat Identification workshop was a long list of future cybersecurity threats  and their descriptions.  D.3 THREAT PRIORITIZATION  The final step of the process was the conduction of a Threat Prioritization workshop with ENISA  stakeholders, refining the threat descriptions based on ENISA cybersecurity expert’s feedback  to the threats and compiling the identified future cyberthreats into the report at hand. The Threat  Prioritization workshop’s goal was to rank the threats based on their impact, likelihood, novelty  and, therefore, importance for ENISA. Novelty was included to prioritize threats that are not  often included in public discourse. This was done in a workshop with ENISA cybersecurity  experts, leading to the emerging cybersecurity threats for 2030 list. (See chapter 4.) Impact and  likelihood were rated on a scale of 1 to 5; these were multiplied to create a baseline score. Then  2 points were added if the threat was deemed novel; 2 points were deducted if the threat had  already been published in another ENISA publication.  After receiving this feedback, the project team refined the threat descriptions and added the  actors, methods, and impact category to each top-ten threat.  The threat information may be found in chapter 4 and the scoring for the top 10 threats is in  Annex E.  72 (TAMARA DENNING)  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  59  E THREAT SCORING  73 (ENISA, Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks, 2021)  74 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021)  75 (ENISA, Threat Landscape Report, 2022)  76 (ENISA, Personal Data Breaches, 2020)  77 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020)  78 (ENISA, Raising Awareness of Cyber Security, 2020)  # Name Impact Likelihood  Impact x  Likelihood  Novelty  Previously  Published  Total  Score  1  Supply chain compromise of  software dependencies73  5 5 25 +2 -2 25  2  Advanced disinformation  campaigns74  4 5 20  20  3  Rise of digital surveillance  authoritarianism / loss of privacy  4 5 20  -2 18  4  Human error and exploited legacy  systems within cyber-physical  ecosystems75  4 5 20  -2 18  5  Targeted attacks (e.g. ransomware)  enhanced by smart device data76  4 4 16 +2  18  6  Lack of analysis and control of  space-based infrastructure and  objects.  4 4 16 +2  18  7  Rise of advanced hybrid threats  making use of different and  unforeseen modus operandi (e.g.  disinformation)77  4 4 16  -2 14  8 Skill shortage78 4 4 16  -2 14  9  Cross border ICT service  providers as a single point of failure  5 3  -2 13  10 Abuse of AI 4 3 12 +2 -2 12  IDENTIFYING EMERGING CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR 2030  March 2023  60  5.

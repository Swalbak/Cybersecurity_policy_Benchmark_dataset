This risk  increase when users access sensitive information and services via remote access solutions, including Virtual Private  Networks (VPN). This publication explains the risks posed by the use of stolen credentials and how they can be  mitigated.  Adversaries can impersonate a user without their  knowledge  Stolen credentials can be used by an adversary to circumvent security measures which an organisation has  implemented to protect sensitive information and services. With these legitimate credentials, an adversary can  impersonate a user without their knowledge.  With legitimate credentials, an adversary can use remote access solutions to mask their activities and avoid detection.  Failure to regularly audit logs from remote access solutions increases the risk and extent of a compromise.  While multi-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security, some implementations are more effective  than others. Multi-factor authentication that has not been implemented or configured properly can result in a false  sense of security and leave an organisation vulnerable.  Mitigation strategies  The Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  should be implemented as a minimum on  networks. However, organisations that allow personnel to access their network via remote access solutions should  implement the following additional mitigation strategies:   Disable LanMan password support and cached credentials on workstations and servers to make it harder for an  adversary to crack password hashes.   Implement network segmentation and segregation into security zones to protect sensitive information and critical  services such as key business systems, user authentication and user directory information. Organisations should  assign remote users with a lower level of trustworthiness and limit what they can remotely access on the  organisation’s network. This includes not allowing direct remote access for privileged accounts.
